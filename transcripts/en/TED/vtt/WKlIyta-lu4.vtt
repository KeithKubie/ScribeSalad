00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:16.620
I was born to two amazing professors
who were not religious.

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:19.813
In fact, my father's regular response

00:00:19.837 --> 00:00:23.837
to the question about why we didn't go
to church on Sundays was,

00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:27.098
"When others go to pray, I go to play."

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:29.521
Tennis, in case you're wondering.

00:00:30.034 --> 00:00:34.486
Faith found me and my siblings
when university students came to our house

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.339
to invite us to Sunday school.

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:40.680
I was drawn by their sense
of personal conviction

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:42.725
and their life of service,

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:45.996
and opted for baptism
into the Christian faith

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.078
as my 10th birthday present.

00:00:48.634 --> 00:00:52.222
My faith has shaped my work
as a social entrepreneur,

00:00:52.246 --> 00:00:54.888
attempting to address
Africa's most pressing challenges

00:00:54.912 --> 00:00:57.238
over the last 17 years,

00:00:57.262 --> 00:01:01.126
and my work training youth as leaders

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.532
and promoting ethics across Africa.

00:01:05.094 --> 00:01:06.700
Twenty-nine years later,

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:09.148
as a Sunday school teacher myself,

00:01:09.172 --> 00:01:12.886
my faith was challenged
by a young nine-year-old

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.771
who asked a series of questions.

00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:17.423
He asked,

00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:20.876
"Ms. Ndidi, does God hate Africans?"

00:01:22.345 --> 00:01:24.568
To which I quickly retorted,
"Of course not.

00:01:24.592 --> 00:01:26.774
God loves all his children equally."

00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:31.284
Then he asked, "So why do so many
young African children die?"

00:01:32.685 --> 00:01:35.074
I stumbled and mumbled as I responded.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.803
"There are many reasons
why young African children die.

00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:42.504
Most of them are man-made,
and we cannot blame God."

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:46.134
So he asked, "Why does he let it happen?

00:01:46.158 --> 00:01:47.314
He could stop it."

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:49.009
And I said ...

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:52.021
"Yes he could, yes he could,

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:54.943
but he sent us here as change agents,

00:01:54.967 --> 00:01:57.588
light of the world, salt of the earth,

00:01:57.612 --> 00:01:58.876
and we are failing."

00:02:00.839 --> 00:02:04.404
Africa has had a mixed affair
with organized religion,

00:02:04.428 --> 00:02:07.340
with both positive
and negative consequences.

00:02:08.624 --> 00:02:12.109
The Christian missionaries
educated most of our political elite,

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.220
like Senghor and Nkrumah,

00:02:14.244 --> 00:02:17.647
built many of our first
hospitals and schools.

00:02:18.747 --> 00:02:24.849
Similarly, Islam has introduced
commerce and mathematics

00:02:24.873 --> 00:02:26.269
across the continent.

00:02:27.372 --> 00:02:32.848
Today, we have over a billion Africans
who profess a strong faith.

00:02:34.443 --> 00:02:38.136
What is the net effect
of this on our continent?

00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:43.830
A recent "Economist" article
said that the face of the future

00:02:43.854 --> 00:02:46.836
of the world's most popular
religion is African.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.558
Now, both Islam and Christianity
underscore the importance of social impact

00:02:53.582 --> 00:02:55.526
as critical tenets of our faith.

00:02:56.983 --> 00:03:00.929
Muhammad is noted for stating

00:03:00.953 --> 00:03:05.238
that he is not a believer
who goes to bed on a full stomach

00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:07.453
when his neighbor to his side is hungry.

00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:10.359
And all through the New Testament,

00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:13.311
Jesus Christ talks about loving
your neighbors as yourselves,

00:03:14.654 --> 00:03:17.567
giving to the poor, caring for the sick,

00:03:18.604 --> 00:03:22.209
and James, too, says
that "faith without works is dead."

00:03:23.236 --> 00:03:28.569
So I strongly believe that faith-based
organizations have a critical role to play

00:03:28.593 --> 00:03:30.617
in driving social impact in Africa.

00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:35.551
But for this to occur,
we need three critical changes.

00:03:36.355 --> 00:03:38.932
The first is that we need
to change our mindsets.

00:03:39.983 --> 00:03:43.515
Both as people of faith
and of those who are not religious,

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.265
their perceptions of those of us
who are people of faith.

00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:51.657
Now, for people of faith
and those of us who are religious,

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:54.488
we often say, "If God wills, I'll do this;

00:03:54.512 --> 00:03:56.798
inshallah, I'll do that --

00:03:56.822 --> 00:03:58.980
by God's grace, I'll do this."

00:03:59.988 --> 00:04:04.084
Now there are many things,
I believe, that we can control --

00:04:04.108 --> 00:04:05.360
some we cannot.

00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:08.435
I believe that God is all-powerful,

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.023
but he's not a micromanager.

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:13.058
(Laughter)

00:04:13.082 --> 00:04:16.305
He has sent us here as his change agents,

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:18.210
and we must stop making excuses

00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:19.386
and using him.

00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:22.828
That means that if you're a teacher,

00:04:22.852 --> 00:04:25.176
go to school and give
your students the best.

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:27.564
If you're a public-sector official,

00:04:27.588 --> 00:04:31.120
release the funds meant for that school
or public health-care center

00:04:31.144 --> 00:04:34.203
instead of stealing it
for your personal purposes.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:40.402
By claiming that we have no power
over our past, present and future,

00:04:40.426 --> 00:04:43.895
we give too much authority to the wicked

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.569
who steal funds
and beg God for forgiveness.

00:04:49.376 --> 00:04:51.441
Now for those of you
who are not religious,

00:04:51.465 --> 00:04:53.674
you also have to change
your mindsets about us.

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:57.106
There are many of us who are hardworking,

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.670
ethical and intellectual.

00:04:59.694 --> 00:05:00.945
It might surprise you.

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:03.179
(Laughter)

00:05:03.203 --> 00:05:04.682
Now the second step

00:05:04.706 --> 00:05:08.223
is that we have to utilize
our resources and assets

00:05:08.247 --> 00:05:09.397
for social impact.

00:05:10.052 --> 00:05:11.336
In England,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:17.267
1,900 churches have been
shut down since 1969,

00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:19.918
due to shrinking congregations,

00:05:19.942 --> 00:05:22.188
while in Africa, every single day,

00:05:22.212 --> 00:05:23.890
a church or mosque is being built.

00:05:24.728 --> 00:05:27.808
In some communities,
you might not find a public health center,

00:05:27.832 --> 00:05:30.257
a post office or even a school,

00:05:30.281 --> 00:05:31.972
but you'll find a church or mosque.

00:05:32.842 --> 00:05:36.635
Some of these churches
and mosques are world-class,

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:38.645
with excellent audio-visual systems,

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:40.499
wonderful meeting spaces,

00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:43.797
and they organize events
that rival international concerts.

00:05:44.935 --> 00:05:48.853
The sad reality is that many of them
are empty during the week.

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:51.938
I live in the Lekki area of Lagos,

00:05:53.264 --> 00:05:56.541
and in my community, there are at least
50 really nice churches,

00:05:57.708 --> 00:06:00.246
but there's no adult literacy center,

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:02.159
no homeless shelter

00:06:02.183 --> 00:06:04.854
and very few public schools and hospitals.

00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:10.139
Many of these spaces
could be utilized for social change.

00:06:11.258 --> 00:06:16.211
Imagine if every single church
in Lekki opened its doors

00:06:16.235 --> 00:06:17.989
to the homeless at night,

00:06:18.013 --> 00:06:22.504
gave them a sleeping bag, a warm meal
and a voucher in the morning

00:06:22.528 --> 00:06:24.368
to learn a vocational course,

00:06:24.392 --> 00:06:27.456
offered by the unemployed youth
who attend that church.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.448
That would demonstrate what we preach

00:06:30.472 --> 00:06:33.807
and what we speak about
as people of faith,

00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:37.003
and what led me to Christianity
in the first place.

00:06:38.675 --> 00:06:44.314
Similarly, we have to utilize
our resources for social change.

00:06:45.506 --> 00:06:49.277
The 2016 "why give" survey
conducted in Kenya

00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:55.044
reveals that close to 60 percent of adults
give to faith-based organizations --

00:06:55.068 --> 00:06:57.533
even more than they give
their extended families.

00:06:58.165 --> 00:06:59.614
This is not unique to Kenya.

00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:02.482
It's quite prevalent across Africa.

00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:07.222
Many of our faith-based organizations
have tremendous amounts of wealth

00:07:07.246 --> 00:07:09.963
that can be utilized for social change.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.035
We have to check the sources
of uses of these funds

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:17.943
and curb the excesses
by our faith-based organizations.

00:07:18.607 --> 00:07:22.415
Now, this will require courage
on the part of members,

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:26.894
who will have to put their
imams and priests on straight salaries,

00:07:26.918 --> 00:07:30.376
require audited financial statements
that will be published

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:35.452
and even reject contributions
from unethical sources.

00:07:36.893 --> 00:07:38.043
But it's possible.

00:07:38.669 --> 00:07:42.066
We're already seeing positive examples
in South Africa and Kenya,

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.241
and the organizations,

00:07:43.265 --> 00:07:47.051
such as the Africa Council
for Accreditation and Accountability

00:07:47.075 --> 00:07:49.337
that's checking faith-based organizations

00:07:49.361 --> 00:07:53.241
and ensuring that they comply
with biblical standards of stewardship.

00:07:54.824 --> 00:07:56.570
Now, the third step

00:07:56.594 --> 00:07:59.285
is that we have to partner
with all stakeholders,

00:07:59.309 --> 00:08:03.127
and this is especially relevant
for the non-religious in the audience.

00:08:04.024 --> 00:08:08.738
Recognizing the power and potential
of faith-based organizations,

00:08:09.752 --> 00:08:12.847
leveraging their assets, their scale,

00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:15.095
the public trust
and credibility they have,

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:16.454
their lower operating costs,

00:08:16.478 --> 00:08:17.964
their access to the grassroots

00:08:17.988 --> 00:08:19.276
and their presence abroad.

00:08:19.802 --> 00:08:21.737
Politicians recognize this,

00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:26.055
and campaign seasons are always filled
with stops and picture opportunities

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:27.605
with leading faith leaders.

00:08:28.214 --> 00:08:29.675
Sadly, once elected,

00:08:29.699 --> 00:08:33.187
many of these faith-based
organizations are ignored.

00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:35.616
And in fact, a World Bank survey revealed

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.410
that 30 to 70 percent of assets
owned by medical organizations in Africa

00:08:41.434 --> 00:08:44.038
are actually owned
by faith-based organizations,

00:08:44.062 --> 00:08:48.182
but that there's very little collaboration
between the faith community

00:08:48.206 --> 00:08:50.007
and public health-care systems.

00:08:50.835 --> 00:08:53.879
One positive example is from Ghana,

00:08:53.903 --> 00:08:58.352
where the Ghana Catholic Health Service
partnered with a range of stakeholders

00:08:58.376 --> 00:09:04.259
and was able to realize
a 31 percent reduction in mortality.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:08.653
I believe there's so much potential
that can be realized

00:09:08.677 --> 00:09:11.605
when we walk across the divide of faith

00:09:11.629 --> 00:09:14.436
and, hand in hand, try to solve
many of our problems.

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:18.744
Similarly, faith-based organizations
can support the transfer

00:09:18.768 --> 00:09:20.432
of critical skills and knowledge.

00:09:20.922 --> 00:09:24.175
Many of you in the NGO community
or in the private sectors

00:09:24.199 --> 00:09:28.873
realize how difficult it is
to even attract 150 to 200 people

00:09:28.897 --> 00:09:30.063
to your conferences,

00:09:30.087 --> 00:09:31.978
sometimes even offering stipends,

00:09:32.002 --> 00:09:34.104
reimbursements of transportation costs.

00:09:34.128 --> 00:09:38.613
Meanwhile, faith-based organizations
draw thousands and millions

00:09:38.637 --> 00:09:40.469
every Sunday or Friday ...

00:09:42.077 --> 00:09:45.125
with the promise of a good sermon.

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:50.368
The truth is we cannot address
issues around family planning

00:09:50.392 --> 00:09:52.680
without faith-based
organizations in Africa.

00:09:53.775 --> 00:09:56.435
Issues such as democratic rights
and voter registration,

00:09:56.459 --> 00:09:58.959
ensuring that every member
of a congregation

00:09:58.983 --> 00:10:00.832
has a voter registration card,

00:10:00.856 --> 00:10:03.161
understands their democratic rights

00:10:03.185 --> 00:10:05.179
and can exercise that.

00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:09.220
I really think it's critical
that we consider partnering

00:10:09.244 --> 00:10:12.155
with faith-based organizations
to deliver social impact.

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:16.892
It's also important to note
that African faith-based organizations

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:18.699
have a strong presence globally.

00:10:19.324 --> 00:10:23.444
There are over 2,000 African nuns
and priests in leadership positions

00:10:23.468 --> 00:10:24.875
in Europe,

00:10:24.899 --> 00:10:28.439
with more influence
than some of our diplomatic envoys,

00:10:28.463 --> 00:10:30.733
operating at a fraction of the cost.

00:10:30.757 --> 00:10:34.250
They can serve as influencers
and supporters.

00:10:34.274 --> 00:10:37.543
Similarly, some African churches
have a presence

00:10:37.567 --> 00:10:39.089
in countries across the globe,

00:10:39.113 --> 00:10:43.566
and the Redeemed Christian Church of God
has a presence in 196 countries,

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:46.691
serving as a bridge to the diaspora
and providing support.

00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:51.717
If our public-sector organizations
could partner with these institutions,

00:10:51.741 --> 00:10:55.487
we could unlock the potential
of our diaspora populations.

00:10:56.986 --> 00:11:00.472
I know some of you
are still struggling with this topic,

00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:02.774
but I challenge you to think about it.

00:11:02.798 --> 00:11:04.996
A wise man once said, "Faith is a risk,

00:11:06.099 --> 00:11:09.191
but it's a risk that I cannot
afford not to take."

00:11:09.999 --> 00:11:14.375
I would suggest that partnerships
with faith-based organizations are a risk,

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:18.984
but one that all stakeholders that are
committed to social impact in Africa

00:11:19.008 --> 00:11:20.683
cannot afford not to take.

00:11:21.942 --> 00:11:25.094
I often reflect on my conversation
with that young boy,

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:28.348
and I believe I should have ended it
a little differently.

00:11:28.372 --> 00:11:31.983
First, I should have commended him
for asking tough questions.

00:11:32.537 --> 00:11:35.960
Africa needs more young people
who challenge the status quo,

00:11:35.984 --> 00:11:37.645
even in the faith communities.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:41.607
Secondly, I should have given him
a little more hope.

00:11:42.083 --> 00:11:43.707
Not hope in the afterlife,

00:11:43.731 --> 00:11:46.795
but hope in Africa today,

00:11:46.819 --> 00:11:48.800
because the faithful are powerful.

00:11:49.636 --> 00:11:52.978
Not just because of their beliefs
but because of their assets,

00:11:53.002 --> 00:11:56.803
their resources, their army of volunteers,

00:11:56.827 --> 00:12:01.070
and because working together,
across the divide,

00:12:01.094 --> 00:12:06.142
we can live as positive examples
for what our children --

00:12:06.166 --> 00:12:07.732
my children, your children --

00:12:07.756 --> 00:12:09.448
deserve to see.

00:12:09.472 --> 00:12:13.065
An Africa that demonstrates
that God loves Africans

00:12:13.089 --> 00:12:16.602
and that we are just as capable
as any other world region

00:12:16.626 --> 00:12:18.216
in solving our problems

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.390
in peace ...

00:12:20.314 --> 00:12:21.726
and love.

00:12:23.361 --> 00:12:26.170
I love this quote that says,

00:12:26.194 --> 00:12:31.499
"Hope is the ability to hear
the melody of the future.

00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:35.879
Faith is the willingness and the courage

00:12:35.903 --> 00:12:37.331
to dance to it today."

00:12:38.889 --> 00:12:42.985
I hope that we, as people of faith,

00:12:43.009 --> 00:12:46.715
can truly live up to
the promise of social impact

00:12:46.739 --> 00:12:50.298
that we have been called to do
as change agents in society.

00:12:51.232 --> 00:12:53.326
And I believe that working with you,

00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:54.601
all stakeholders,

00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:57.677
we can truly solve
Africa's most pressing challenges.

00:12:58.483 --> 00:12:59.689
I have that hope ...

00:13:00.986 --> 00:13:02.931
and I have the faith,

00:13:02.955 --> 00:13:04.601
and I've started to dance.

00:13:04.625 --> 00:13:05.866
Won't you join me?

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.041
Thank you.

00:13:07.065 --> 00:13:11.023
(Applause)
