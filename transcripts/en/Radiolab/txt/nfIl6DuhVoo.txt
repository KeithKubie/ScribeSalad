Speaker 1:          00:00          Oh wait, you're listening.

Speaker 2:          00:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:04          okay. We're listening to radio lab radio way too. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:21          awesome. New York public radio. Public radio. W [inaudible] radio.

Speaker 2:          00:33          Sure.

Speaker 1:          00:37          Okay. Okay. So the um, the other day, I bet. Should we say we are? Yes, we should. Okay. Jad Robert Radiolab. Okay. So the other day Soren called us into the studio. They are, oh. And there was a giant human sized Roden sitting in the engineering seat. Very large road. And it was very familiar to us because it was a puppet head that we had toured with. Who is that under that big street and well that's the question. That is the question maybe you guys should guess or something. Oh my goodness. Is it, um, is this Helen? Oh my God. Oh my God. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:27          all right. So the story is the reason that snoring got Ellen to surprise us is that somewhere around now is the 15 year crazy to say it. 15 year anniversary of making radio lab. 15 years. I know we were, have some tape for you guys. Oh, there's more, right? We brought, you said it's just your presence. Yeah, I mean the presence, I mean it seemed like you gotta have someone around who knew you when you know, okay, perfect audience with my presence. So we sort of settled in. We didn't really know what was going on and then horn did something truly evil. She somehow, I don't know how probably the archivist help got her hands on the very first one. This is my nightmare. The very, very, very, I had hoped these tapes and that would never surface, but she found them. They were on bit torrent for a second and I thought they had disappeared and I was like so happy. But then [inaudible] already yet it's okay. Let me rotate. All right, here we go.

Speaker 3:          02:25          2002 very first one. Okay. Don't start talking. Please make the CD crash. Right now. Every radio producer has this idealized image in their head of you. Oh God. Maybe you're sitting on the couch drinking coffee, staring out the window. Maybe you're the person who's driving and you pull over to really concentrate on a story. Whenever the case, that image in the radio producers brain of you, the listener, that's why they make this stuff still only thing. Yeah, they don't get paid much. And you look around these heavy recorders and mikes and they look frankly silly in those headphones. I have to wear it, but it doesn't matter as long as you are there to listen to what they make. W N Y C is about to embark on an experiment. We're calling it the radio lab and love that. We're going to do great documentary radio and stories of different sizes and shapes, colors from different places all over the planet from different times even. And we're going to mix it all together like this.

Speaker 1:          03:34          Whoa. Wait,

Speaker 3:          03:39          the big brew of people and places, but it'll take two hours and 59 minutes to get through.

Speaker 1:          03:45          Oh, two hours, 15 minutes, two hours, three hours. It was a three hour show and was I that was that every week, by the way. Every freaking week. Every week. Eight to 11 every Sunday night. So they were giving you a huge hunk of airtime, a huge hunk of airtime where no one was listening. Javelin rod here I'll be your,

Speaker 3:          04:05          hmm, host is not the right word. Curator guide maybe. How about DJ of documentary?

Speaker 1:          04:11          Oh shut up. That was really terrible. That doesn't work at all. Every moment of that was robbed. Every moment I have to explain like this show is just super different back then. The idea of it back then was to just take all of these documentaries from around the world and smashed them together. But what would end up happening is that like I would line up three or four things and I would have like a 20 minute hole, which I would start to experiment in. And that's those spots were what the show grew out of. Well, so, so that was in 2002 and then I met you the following spring and then a year later, a whole year later. And so there's a year worth of that. And by the time I met you back in New York, you were so sleep deprived. Okay. So we reminisced for a little bit. And then we started talking about the moment when Robert got involved, which is a moment I'll never forget.

Speaker 1:          05:08          So, um, you know, I was trying to fill one of those 20 minute holes. I had done an interview with a memory researcher and it was just one of those signs, interviews that now we're super familiar with where like the scientist is using all this latinate words and I couldn't figure out what she was saying, but it still seemed interesting. I just couldn't understand it. And so a Robert and Ellen and I had breakfast one day at Kitchenette, our foundation restaurant, that's where you go to for breakfast every week. And we were sitting there and I was like, I got this interview. I don't really know what to do. It's about memory and here's what I think she's saying. I think she's saying something about how memories are never the same. You're always constantly remaking them. And then you just like snapped into this thing where like suddenly you were playing this like all these characters and w l and I were like, oh my God, let's just go into the studio and have do that and you want to hear

Speaker 4:          05:58          a little taste of that time. I'm sort of curious what we, this was, this was one. So the one like we later did the memory and forgetting as a podcast, but this is pre, this is before. That is a diff earlier 2003 I think.

Speaker 5:          06:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          06:21          you're listening to radio lab on New York public radio, public radio w and the Jab. I'm Ron. This is radio lab. We're coming up on the Kitty Hawk centennial, the hundredth anniversary of the first human powered flight. It's in a couple of weeks and I was looking at the picture today. No, you weren't the Wright brothers. You know the one Oroville is on the plane. It's just taking off. Wilbur is running alongside there on a beach. The beach is deserted. It looks really, really cold and I'm looking at this photo. Really noticed the most published picture in the history of pictures. What are the collateral? Even though I have anyone who's ever been born as seen it 100,000 times, I couldn't help but be wowed. I mean, look what they did. They got their crazy box into the air a couple hundred feet or whatever it was. Wasn't that great a distance, but look at us now. We can fly over the Atlantic in five hours, a few hundred dollars and that is not what we're going to talk about today because my real question is how is it we can do all that and still not understand some very basic things like common cold. That's the example that's always given. What about memory?

Speaker 4:          07:39          What about memory? Is that what she used? [inaudible] that's a good intro. Every, how's a minute? 30 wow. That's sort of like, well here's the pogo stick. I'm going to jump on it 50 times. But what about tissues? It's such a good idea to wait to get in. We eventually talk about Kitty Hawk or was that just, oh no, but let's, let's go a little bit further forward so we get to hear Robert enter the room 18 Volvo's creativity. This club actually begins with a reading from theater director and actor Simon McBurney. You have to literally remake it every time. Every memory that you remember is different because it is we made in the very present that you remember another words in order to remember, you need the imagination.

Speaker 2:          08:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          08:34          Simon McBurney performing a monologue from is playing pneumonic for the show studio three 60. And with me in the studio to explore these ideas a little further. Is Mr Robert Krulwich from ABC News or Robert Height, you've reported on this, right? Yeah, they have, I'd never actually met Simon McBurney, but uh, that thought that he has at the very end that in order to something

Speaker 6:          08:56          you need an active imagination. I think it's kind of understating it really, I think. And just stating your house. How's that? Well, let's just take the situation we're in right now. Okay. I'm sitting here in front of you. We're about what, three feet apart or something like that. So when you look at me right now, it takes actually the light that's bouncing off my face, a tiny bit of time to reach your retina. But by the way, I arrive upside down and have your brain write me, takes a little bit of time for the sound of me. This sound right now you think ha, but the sound is to travel at 750 miles an hour for me to you. Okay the rest to enter that ear that you have, it has to travel through those hairs that you've got in your ear. It has to turn into electricity.

Speaker 6:          09:40          It has to go to the place in your brain where sounds lie and then the touch of me, if I were to touch you right now and have to travel electrically to your brain, that would take a little time. God had the smell of, suppose I put some licorice in my mouth. I gone the smell of the licorice coming out of my mouth. That too would have to travel all the way to your nose, up your nose, into the place where smells lie, and then your brain has to take all these parts and pull them together into this, this thing that you think is going on right now.

Speaker 4:          10:12          Wait, let me get this straight. You're saying that that this moment, yes, and this one and this one, yes, are hopelessly lost. So when people say that you know you have to live in the moment, to this moment, the moment, the moment already just happened. Or to put it another way, it's a memory. Everything. Everything is a memory. Wow. So let's say we want to ponder this moment. This one you say has already happened before it even had a chance to become this moment. But let's say we want to remember it later. What do we do? It's interesting at this, what's going to happen is you're going to take the touch to the sound, the smell, and everything that's in your brain from that moment, which is all sitting lodged in different places and you're going to reassemble it, pull it back together again. Now, here's the interesting thing.

Speaker 4:          11:02          If 20 minutes from now you are really hungry, then the licorice member, the licorice part of our discussion. Yup. The licorice part will somehow loom a little larger because you want to eat or chew something. How you're feeling in the moment that you're remembering has a lot to do with what you remember. So for that, let's just take a simple a phrase like Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water, right? If you want to recollect that phrase, let's suppose you just had a wonderful thing with Jill. Now when you think of the rhyme, when you reassemble it, Jack, it'll go jack. And he went up the hill to fetch a pail of water. Wait, see the, see the Jill thing is. So I that instead you've just come from an extraordinary hike where you have gloriously climate spectacular hill. So now you hear the thing. And when you re assembled this time yet you think Jack and Jill went up the hill.

Speaker 7:          12:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          12:09          I see the sudden now the hill nus has got all the emphasis. I got it. So you're always remembering differently. Each time up, depending upon how you feel. This reminds me of sunny. We here, let me play you this interview clip

Speaker 8:          12:21          every time you recall something. You're doing so good.

Speaker 4:          12:24          I mean, it's amazing to me that at such an early point, the business of deconstructing puzzles, which I guess is a lot of what we did, uh, took on this very particular quality, like this kind of razzle-dazzle of anything could happen in the next second. I don't know who's gonna say the next thing, but there's something beautifully organic about it when it's done. Yeah. So, uh, today we're selling [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          14:21          Hey, we're back. Uh, so the first episode we ever podcasted, I don't know if it was literally the first, but it was among the first few was an episode about time. I do remember playing it to my wife who I was always scared cause she was in new your times reporter and I thought, oh she'll never liked this kind of thing. And she came out of the kitchen and she said, I really like that. And immediately I called through you call me and you were like, oh you whisper. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's one of the, one of the early modes where like maybe this

Speaker 1:          14:52          will work. Yeah. Again, this is something that fell off our podcast for ed years ago, so probably very few people have heard this. You are listening to radio on New York public radio, public radio,W Y s

Speaker 2:          15:14          [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         15:21          do you know this music? Trust me. You've heard it your entire life.

Speaker 2:          15:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         15:32          the reason you can't recognize it now is because the composer born in 1770 intended for this moment that when you're hearing to last two seconds

Speaker 2:          15:46          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          15:48          caliber. Had he been a whale, Beethoven might've written his ninth symphony this way.

Speaker 5:          15:59          Changes that for us. We're taking an instant, we transpire over minutes and a movement might last six hours. That's in fact what this is. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony digitally stretched from its normal 60 some odd minutes to last an entire day, 24 hours and if you sit for the entire 24 hour duration of the piece as people do from time to time you realize that this music is not simply slower. The Sloane is unlocks something in the original. Maybe it was there all along and we couldn't hear it. Play with the meter. Music is mostly about meter after all and the music has a different story to tell a secret perhaps locked up and signed through routine, changed the routine and make new discoveries. That's what we'll do this hour. We'll look at time so closely. We'll discover new things about it.

Speaker 2:          17:03          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          17:03          this is Radiolab. I'm Jad up and Ron, my guest tonight for the next hour to help me wrestle with time is the science correspondent, Robert Crow, which of ABC News and Nova and Nightline. How are you sir? I'm very well. I like this bathing in Beethoven thing you've got going on. It's cool, right? Yeah. Actually at the end of the program, we will be dropping in on a performance that happened recently in San Francisco where people listen to it over the course of an entire day or day a day. So where first, let's begin with a guy who I think you'll find, well, he thinks very deeply about time. In fact, in a very general kind of way, you could say he's time obsessed. You've heard of the neurologist, Oliver's hacks. Sure. The man who mistook his wife for a hat. Yeah. Right. And a weakness. So I was over at his house. This is me actually over at his house right now.

Speaker 6:          17:50          Keep turning. Um, and he told me this story.

Speaker 12:         17:53          I don't know whether this is relevant. I had an odd experience some years ago. In fact, in 1993 when I got a, um, a message from my publisher, which they had sent out to various of their authors, uh, for their 21st birthday, the jubilee asking if we would like to select a year from the previous 21 years and write about it. Um, when I got this message, I thought, well, why don't I choose 1972, which was the first of the years and it's a year, which is, uh, um, very vivid and important for me, partly because it was the year in which my mother died. Partly it was the a in which I completed awakenings. And these two events, uh, were coupled in some ways. I was actually in the car when I got this message. I picked it up on a car phone and I was driving up to Canada and I had a tape recorder with me.

Speaker 12:         18:49          So I, um, I spoke 1972 aloud and by that time, uh, I thought, well, why stop, why don't I do in 1973 as well? Um, by the time that long in 72 take, did you get to Montreal or we used to [inaudible] 72 probably took about, about, um, half an hour. Well, by the time I got to the Canadian border, um, I was up to 1987. Um, and um, I did in fact make an extra loop so that I could complete things. Um, however it turned out that the, the most recent years in the late eighties and the nineties, I did not apparently have such detailed memories of, and they seem subjectively shorter.

Speaker 6:          19:35          So time, I guess we all know this is a very plastic thing. It's swollen enriched some of the time and it's like flacid and other times. But because Oliver is so inquisitive, such an investigator at heart, all his life, he's looked inside things and beginning when he was a 10, 11, 12, he wanted to get inside time.

Speaker 12:         19:56          I had, I had, um, lots of boyish interests, uh, and um, you know, these pre-adolescent interests, you know, they will took a beating when I became an adolescent, but, uh, but one of them was chemicals and I had a chemistry laboratory. One of them was photography and I had dark room and cameras and one of them was plants. And in particular my mother was very fond of firms and the garden was full of firms. I love the way in which the, um, the curled up fiddleheads or cruisers or firms would unfurl. And it was almost as if time was sort of rolled up inside of them as if time itself unfilled, but when couldn't actually see this, they were pets take a a day or two to do this and I wanted to see it. It made me think of these Christmas things. One, we're blowing book, these are paper trumpets, which would unfold. And so I, uh, set up my camera on a tripod and at least in the daytime I couldn't take pictures at night. I didn't have a flash. Then I took a series of pictures every hour or so of the fun and that showed these rapidly by putting them together in a flip book and this way, then what took a day or two or several hours to happen was compressed into several seconds. So the compression of time photographically fascinated me,

Speaker 1:          21:20          yes to if Oliver sacks can make a baby from unfurl. Robert, how about this radio producer, Tony Schwartz can do the same thing with his baby niece. What exceptance sound, oh, here's sped up for your appreciation is Nancy Schwartz from birthday

Speaker 5:          23:50          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          23:59          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          23:59          you know what that is? What's that? That is if you repair what you've just heard is a parent clock up parent clock. That's kind of cool cause the kid gets older. You can't deny the fact that you must be getting older too when your son has hair on his legs. I thought, Oh man, I'm getting old. But this is true. This is how the whole world works. I think it's a, it's a, everything is a clock I guess. Yeah. By the way, that was Nancy grows up in the audio flip book recorded and arranged by the great radio producer Tony Schwartz. Thanks to him and to Smithsonian folkways recordings and also to you Mr Rodmel Cro, which for joining me today on our program to talk about time. So here's my question. If we've got an example of what you just called a parent clock, you've got other kinds of time, you know like PR, like personal time, getting out of bed, time going to sleep. Most of the existence really

Speaker 6:          24:55          time was measured by, oh it's lunchtime, it's wake up time, right time to milk. The cow time events are task time, tasks, times. How do we get from task and personal time to clock time. Oh, that's interesting. Let's go back to the 18 hundreds and imagine a guy, we'll call him all zoll Tom True Bogan zeal to a hundred lawyers living in Sandusky, Ohio. And suppose the old time wants to know, you know what time it is. Okay, so if Zoltan walked into, say bigsbys tavern and asked, I missed the big speaker, I trouble you put the time, eight right in front of you. You see these pocket, it's built by my nephew, not the smartest boy in the, well it says 33 minutes past the hour. Is that right? Of course it's right. However, if Zoltan instead of going into the tavern, had he gone at the exact same moment into the bank building, how can I help you sir?

Speaker 6:          25:51          And I wondered if you could show me the time to read minutes past the hour. Is he right though? Easy to right or at that very same moment. Suppose instead of going to the tablet of the bank, he'd gone to the hotel. Can I hear you? Can you tell me the time? Yes, of course. My, my time piece has pain, which is actually initially the style actually each 19 past the hour. So at the tavern it's 33 past the hour at the hotel, 19 past the bank, three past. What time is it really in Sandusky? That's the question. The answer is there was no official time in Sandusky. Huh? What do you mean there's no official time and send? There wasn't any non 1850 government and at the time really all there were were clocks. So in Ohio in the 1850s, you'd have as many times as they were clocks in the town. So there was no reason. And you think about it to synchronize it, your clock and my clock were four minutes or 10 minutes different in Sandusky in 1850s. Who cares until

Speaker 11:         26:50          the railroad changed every one once the wheel road clean. If Zoltan wanted to take, uh, how about the uh, three or three to Cleveland. Okay. If you wanted to take the field, who you believe in, how would he know when it was three Oh three. Oh, I see where you're going with this. If you went by the bank's clock, he'd arrived a half hour ahead of time. If you went by the hotel clock, he'd arrived in the nicotine. Oh wait, wait, wait. And if you went by the taverns clock,

Speaker 5:          27:16          oh no. [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         27:20          so for the sake of their business, read the railroads created railroad time and began putting up clocks of their own. It makes sense. And because the railroads were so important, right? I mean the tavern would, you have to get it's beer deliveries from the railroad. And I guess the banks would have to get their cash from the railroad and the hotel would have to get their guests when they're at road. So it gradually, real time

Speaker 6:          27:40          becomes everybody's time.

Speaker 13:         27:42          Huh.

Speaker 6:          27:45          So what happened to local time? Will local time disappeared. Really? Yeah. If local time means that when it's noon in Sandusky, the sun is directly over your head. By 1880 that wasn't true anymore. Oh, the railroad had instructed Sandusky that from now on it's noon would be 20 minutes later. So that could fit into the railroad schedule. So they moved noon over 20 minutes and they were protests about this.

Speaker 5:          28:11          I put it to you ladies and gentleman. Oh, Noonan, shut up. [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          28:23          so in all seriousness, people fought against this. They rebelled against the railroads. Oh, there were time wars in certain towns where part of the town would go to railroad time. But the other part would determinately stick with the what used to be local time and they'd have different times in the town. Wow. It's almost like as a personal freedom issue because time in a way represents your own identity and they didn't want to give up their identity to the railroad. Not at first, but in the end, Sandusky. And then every other town eventually conformed to railroad time. And that is how time became standardized. Time became zoned. Time became clock reference. And you ask somebody, what time is it? They don't say, you know, oh it's bedtime or it's lunchtime. They don't look up at the side. They look at a clock standard and the real,

Speaker 14:         29:08          that break pick of the other time, one off every 60 minutes, tweet every 12 hour tour of both relentless hands, turning off Carload. Lots of time.

Speaker 6:          29:24          There's an interesting connection to explore here. And it has to do with horses. Horses, horses.

Speaker 11:         29:30          Okay. Alright. You mentioned railroad companies. It just so happens that the owner of the biggest railroad company, Leland Stanford, you know Stanford University University, that right. He was

Speaker 1:          29:42          really into speed and he owned a really fast horse and the horse, his name was oxidant oxidant. I know, I remember that story goes. This horse was the subject of a gentleman's bet. Well, there was no gentleman's bet. It's a myth. Danford so far as we know was not a betting man. That's Rebecca Solnit. She would know. She wrote a book about this called river of shadows and the focus of her book is the solver of the bed. Oh, look at her. It was, it was an argument. There's no evidence that there was money on it. In any case, this argument amongst Stanford and his railroad buddies sent it around. The following question. When a horse gallops, do all four of its feet leave the ground at once when you think? I don't know. I'm just not a question. I would frankly every, I was getting one but well at the time it was a big question cause they had no way of knowing cause the horses moved faster than eyeballs can see.

Speaker 1:          30:25          So Leland Stanford one and to prove that of course at all four feet off the ground at one time and he was recommended to try my bridge as the photographer to capture this. Along comes Edward Muybridge, the photographer, if he could take a picture of the horse at exactly the right instant could see whether all four feet were off the ground in solve the bed. Here's the problem. Cameras in those days were very slow. Fast exposure would be maybe a second or several seconds. My vision was going to push photography to suddenly be able to capture motion in a 500th of a second. Otherwise you just got blur.

Speaker 11:         31:06          Imagine that first step out of the world of a blur when Brechin stretched a wire across the race track and attached it to the shutter mechanism on his camera. Oxidant the horse gallops by trips. The wire [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          31:22          which freezes the horse. Nick gala steals him right out of the flow of time. Except my bridge doesn't just take one photo. He takes 24 c it place 24 cameras in a line, one after the other with 24 trip wires stretching across the racetrack and the horse strip. Every one.

Speaker 15:         31:42          Yeah,

Speaker 11:         31:47          24 frozen and blurry running horses. So what did, what did they see?

Speaker 1:          31:52          Well, the pictures formed a series of a horse running and some of those photos showed oxidant yes, with all four feet off the ground. So the camera here unlocks a secret. It let's just see something you could never see before because this camera essentially it stops time. Exactly. Meanwhile it says Rebecca Bridge became fascinated with learning more secrets of time,

Speaker 16:         32:13          secrets, lacking signs, basic human movements. A leap, a splash, a walk of parallel, wet. Wow. Mundane. But they're so enchanted when you really pay attention to them. Yeah. Bridge had photograph rushing water. He was obsessed with water and his landscape pictures. So he, obsessive. Lee has people pour water, splash water, pour water over themselves, poor pictures of water, pour water into glasses, splash water out of basins, bathe in water.

Speaker 1:          32:40          And you can see all these droplets frozen in midair. There's one particular photo, Robert, where you see a sheet of water suspended in the air, hovering over the splasher. Kind of like a ghost. Hmm. Oh Wow. Anyhow, take all those frozen moments and align them one after the other and play them back. And you've got flow again, albeit artificial flow, which we call movies.

Speaker 16:         33:10          [inaudible] movies are good. Yeah. Yeah. But

Speaker 1:          33:14          the next time you're feeling stressed out, you saved yourself. I'm stressed. I need to go to a movie to relax. Well, you should know that the technology that made the movies is exactly the thing which spin up the pace of modern life, which stressed you out, which led you to go to the movies. What does that mean? What did, what do you mean by that? Well, one of the first ways movies were used was to film factory workers doing repetitive tasks and then find out how to make those tasks more efficient. So if I were pushing the lever, maybe too slowly is this right? They would find the guy who did it the right way, film him, slow the film down, and then use that to teach everyone else. And then when World War II came, this was not just now in the cause of efficiency, this was a life or death matter. Cause this is how you beat Nazis.

Speaker 14:         33:57          All the scientific devices of chronology. I'm a, the manufacturing time in all hands means victory. And all hands must be as we learned with our hands, hadn't [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          34:13          or there's a whole nother way to think about this. Time can be a weapon in battle or it can be the most sensuous and subtle and natural thing in the world. And I learned about this from a book by Jay Griffiths called a sideways look at time. Let me just take a stop here at the clocks. Even though you don't like clocks because there's so many cool clocks in your book. First of all, there's a spice clock.

Speaker 17:         34:44          Yes, we're used to clocks, which you can see when it's really dark and it's seen. And you can see that you've just woken up at two 35 and you really didn't want to wake up at two 35 but of course for a long time, you know, in the night you don't have a way of seeing what the time is. And so somebody invented a spice cock so you could taste your way through the nights. So there would be maybe kind of, you know, cinnamon for about one o'clock in Turmeric for two o'clock. You're sitting there in bed and you stiff the time. Oh, you could taste it

Speaker 1:          35:19          right. How about the clock of birds? This is the [inaudible] supporters. This

Speaker 17:         35:23          is lovely. The clearly people apart when you're getting, they have what they call a clock of birds. Um, and that certain birds like the um, New Guinea fryer bird and the hooded butch, but when they sing in the mornings, the children are taught to understand that that's a signal to get up and leave

Speaker 18:         35:39          the house. When those birds sing, that late afternoon calls, that's a signal to the children to go back home. Just a forest in the central highlands in Papua New Guinea. I've been, that is a very, very difficult place to be in once it's dog. And that the children would need to know at what time to start heading for home. [inaudible] now, how about it's 1751

Speaker 17:         36:15          Carl Linnaeus famous catalog. Categorize her of everything. Yes. Our clock. What do you make it? A flower clock so that you could, you could see by the blooming of different flowers. Um, what time? It was some kind of something that blooms in the morning and then folds up like a morning. Glory would be there in the morning and then in the evening and evening primrose would come out. Yeah. These are all plants that opened for an hour or two and then close. So if you're walking by and you see a blush of let's say pink, then you know, oh, it must be in the morning. Or if you say blush of Privilege, Oh, it must be lunchtime or whatever it is. Yes, exactly. Exactly. That's by the way, very, very good gardening to be able to do that. Yes, isn't it? Isn't it? And connected to that. There's also the Andaman forests and the Andaman islands in the Indian nation. Um, that people have a sense calendar, which I find the most beautiful idea because some, what it was is a way of kind of describing the months by the sense of certain fruits and flowers.

Speaker 18:         37:16          Okay. Time at time is everywhere in nature. What I put, one of the things I wanted to do with the hope book was to say, you know, we think of time thing to do with clocks. In fact, for most of the world, for most of history time has been absolutely embedded in nature in some beautiful ways.

Speaker 1:          37:39          Thanks Robert. [inaudible] Robert Krulwich tonight we'll be back in a moment. You're listening to radio on New York public radio, public radioW

Speaker 17:         37:49          and why

Speaker 18:         38:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          38:00          so that was a chunk of the first thing we ever podcast. It was a show about time and it's in honor of our 50th birthday. And because there's, it's funny, Robert, like there's, we just looked at the [inaudible] at our RSS feed recently, which access is, um, it's a, I don't know what it stands for, but it's the thing that like feeds iTunes. So when you go on iTunes and you see all the episodes, you sort of see what, what's there and there's some limit that's that iTunes places on the number of items that you can have in the feed. Oh. And there I think it's a hundred or 150

Speaker 4:          38:36          or something. And we realized like 150 early episodes have fallen off the feed. Oh really? Yeah. We were a backlist like at random house that would be like Hemingway and Fitzgerald had fallen onto the floor. Exactly. So like these huge number of old episodes have fallen off. And I started looking at that list and on that list are some episodes that are weirdly relevant now at a whole bunch that are just completely not relevant. And, uh, I was like, I, you know, I think I want to pull some of those back into the flow and, uh, because it'll give us a chance to like sorta just reframe them and rethink about them and update them. And sometimes the science gets old and needs to be updated, but sometimes design gets refreshed by something that's happening in the real world. Yeah. Something, it gets on a certain urgency.

Speaker 4:          39:22          Yeah. So I, so what the plan would be is maybe, you know, in the coming months we would go way back for us, which is like 14, 13, 15, 12 years back and resurrect things and throw them out and see who wants to take a smack at them now and whether there's things have changed. Yeah. And whether they, whether they're more interesting or, or utterly wrong. Now we're all wrong in a fascinating way. Yeah. That kind of thing. Yeah. That's the advantage of getting old as you can. That's true. Yeah. That's true. You can play with your memories. Exactly. You can not be a rabbit. There you go. All right, well that was, that was something, and thanks for listening.
