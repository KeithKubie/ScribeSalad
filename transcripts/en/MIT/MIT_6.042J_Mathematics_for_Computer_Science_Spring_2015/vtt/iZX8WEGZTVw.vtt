00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.000
PROFESSOR: So some of
the standard questions

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.250
that we've examined
already about random graphs

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.320
are the probability of getting
from one place to another,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.339
or the expected time to get
from one place to another.

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.880
But a different kind
of question that

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.570
comes up in a fundamental
way is the probability

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.440
of being someplace.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.650
So let's examine that.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.950
Here is the graph with states
blue, orange, and green

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.550
that we've seen before.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.810
And suppose that I
start at state B.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.030
And I ask, what's the
probability of being at each

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.090
of these states after one step?

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.540
So to start with, I'm
interested in p B, p O,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.430
and p G-- which is the
probability of being at state

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.460
B, the probability
of being at state O,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.070
and the probability
of being at state

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.850
G. The sum of the
probabilities is going to be 1.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.220
And initially when I tell
you that I'm at state B,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.340
it means the probability
of being at B is 1,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.240
and the other two is 0.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.380
And I'm interested in the
way that these probabilities

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.160
update after one step.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.270
If p prime B is the
probability of being in state B

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.814
after one step, and p
prime O is the probability

00:01:10.814 --> 00:01:13.230
of being in the orange state
one step later-- and likewise

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.720
for green-- what are
these probabilities?

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.580
Well it's easy to see just
reading off this graph

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.500
that the only place you're
at is B. So the only way

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.110
to get probability
of being somewhere

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.660
is by following
an edge out of B.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.610
So the probability of being at
one step at the orange vertex

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.570
is 1/4.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.030
And it's likewise 1/4 for
being at the green state.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.930
And it's 1/2 for staying
at the blue state.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.850
So what we can say is that
the updated probabilities

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.450
of being at these
different states

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.931
is 1/2, 1/4, and 1/4,
as we've just reasoned.

00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:49.430
OK.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.150
Let's keep going.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.450
Given that the probability
that I'm at the states blue,

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.980
orange, and green are given by
this vector of probabilities,

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.480
what's the distribution
after two steps?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.380
So let p double-prime B be the
probability of being at state B

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.930
after two steps,
starting from B. Well,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.780
the way we can
figure that out is

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.390
by using conditional
probabilities.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.090
Let's look at the
example of calculating

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.740
the probability of being
in the orange state two

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.690
steps after you've
started at the blue state.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.600
So here was the probabilities
of being at the different states

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.770
after one step.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.970
How do I get to
the orange state?

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.390
Well I can get to the orange
state from the blue state.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.370
And so the probability of
being in the orange state

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.680
after two steps
is the probability

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.020
of being at the blue state after
one step times the probability

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.600
that I take this edge
to the orange state.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.500
That is, it's the probability
of going from B to O-- given

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.740
that I'm at B-- times
the probability of being

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.230
in B after one step.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.280
This then is the probability
of being in O after two steps.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.560
And likewise, another
component of the probability

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.980
of being at O is that if
you're at O, and what's

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.220
the probability of
going from O to O?

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.660
And that is this 1/3
times the probability

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.740
of being at O at
all, which is 1/4.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.660
And the final case, using again
the law of total probability,

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.500
breaking it up into cases,
the third way that I

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.990
can get to the orange
state on step two

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:38.590
is by being at the green
state on step one following

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.556
the green to O edge-- of
which there isn't any,

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:44.930
so that's going
to be probability

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.140
0-- times the probability of
being at the green state, which

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.770
is 1/4, but it won't matter.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.160
So let's just fill
in these amounts

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.670
looking at the first term.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.580
The probability of going
from B to O when you're at B

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.530
is simply the
probability of this edge.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.000
It's 1/4.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.375
And likewise, the
probability of going from O

00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:10.890
to O given that you're
at O is the probability

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.720
of this edge-- namely 1/3.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.920
So we can fill that term in.

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.000
And finally the probability
of going from G to O

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.769
is 0, given that you're
at G, because there

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.950
isn't any vertex there.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.170
And then you fill in
those probabilities

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.650
and do the arithmetic.

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.380
You come out with
5/24 probability

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.770
of being in the orange
state after two steps.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.820
Well the same calculation,
you can figure out

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.240
what's the probability of
being at the blue state

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.030
or the green step
after two steps.

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:42.110
And there's the answer.

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.420
There's a 50/50 chance of
being at the blue state

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.170
after two steps, 5/24 as
we saw at the orange state,

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.540
and the rest of it is
7/24 is the probability

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.900
of being at the green state.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:56.400
OK.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.630
So what's going on in general?

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.900
And we can explain how to do
these calculations by using

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.760
a little bit of linear algebra.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.990
So let's define the
edge probability

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.970
matrix of a random
walk graph is just

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.340
the adjacency
matrix of the graph,

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.050
except that instead of using
0's and 1's to indicate

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.080
whether an edge is not
present or present,

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.600
I'll use in the I, J
position of the matrix--

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.190
the probability of the edge
that goes from I to J--

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.510
if there is an edge-- and
0 if there isn't any edge.

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.640
Let's look at an example.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.790
So here is the way we'd
fill it in abstractly

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.330
for our three-state graph.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.290
It'll be a 3 by 3 matrix
with the probabilities

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:44.700
of the successive edges in
the corresponding position.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.832
So this is the
position in the B,

00:05:47.832 --> 00:05:52.580
B coordinate is the probability
of the edge from B to B. The O,

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.880
B coordinate, if you
think of the columns

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.550
as labeled blue, orange,
green; and the rows as labeled

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:01.790
blue, orange, green.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.195
And this is the orange,
blue coordinate.

00:06:04.195 --> 00:06:08.580
And it's the probability
of the edge from 0 to B.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.080
Let's fill in the first
row, which was-- this

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.390
is just read directly
off the graph.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.210
It was the edges out of
B that went from B to B,

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.720
from B to O, and
from B to green-- G.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.220
And it had those weights.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.190
And if I fill in
the rest of it, I

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.350
get the edge
probability matrix for

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.890
our simple three-state graph.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:31.660
And there it is.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.070
So this last one shows the fact
that there is a certain edge

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:38.380
from green to blue.

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.530
The only place you can
go from green is to blue,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.490
and you can't go to either
orange or green in one step.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.110
OK.

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:49.000
So why are we bringing
up the matrix?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.900
Well if you looked at the
way we updated the state

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.660
to go from the
one-step distribution

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.910
to the two-step distribution,
it was really a matrix multiply.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.170
And in general, to
do an update, you're

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:04.330
just going to do a vector
matrix multiplication.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.410
If you have the probabilities of
being in the successive states

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.780
B, O, and G, and you do a vector
matrix multiplication using

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.080
the probability
matrix of the graph,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.110
you get the updated
vector of distributions.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:24.480
And that's easy to check
just from the definitions,

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.030
and from the definition
of vector times matrix,

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.100
which I assume
you're familiar with.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:34.320
So now we can ask what's the
distribution after t steps,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.290
starting from some particular
given distribution-- say,

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.000
starting at state B, or starting
at any possible distribution

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.090
of probabilities to
the different states.

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:47.517
And the way that we can
figure that out-- so I'm

00:07:47.517 --> 00:07:49.350
interested in other
words is the probability

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.340
of being in O after t
steps G after t steps in B

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.770
after t steps, say,
starting from state B.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.935
And what happens also as
t approaches infinity?

00:07:59.935 --> 00:08:01.920
And these are sort of
two basic questions

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.310
that we're going to be asking.

00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.240
So first of all,
how do you calculate

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.507
starting at a given
distribution p

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:10.970
B, p O, p G where you're
going to be after t steps?

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:14.570
Well, you're just
continually updating, which

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:19.330
means multiplying by M t times.

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.700
So the distribution
after t steps

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.540
is gotten by taking the
initial distribution times

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:26.200
the t-th power of M.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.490
Now this is actually already
useful computationally,

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:31.770
because it means that since
you can compute a matrix

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.470
power by successive
squarings, you actually

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:39.710
only need about log of
t matrix multiplications

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:41.720
in order to be
able to figure out

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.000
what's the distribution
of probabilities

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.200
after t steps of the graph.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.662
Then the crucial concept
that we want to examine--

00:08:55.662 --> 00:08:57.870
and we'll make a lot of use
of in the next video when

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.810
we talk about a page
rank-- is the idea

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.680
of a stationary distribution.

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.000
So a stationary
distribution means

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.790
that once you're in the
stationary distribution,

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:10.720
it's stable.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.220
You're going to stay
in that distribution.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.620
You're not going to be
in any particular state,

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:20.170
but you'll have a vector
of probabilities of being

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:21.170
in the different states.

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:24.300
And one step later, that
vector's not going to change.

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.310
So what it means is that
the next-step distribution

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:30.630
is the same as the
current distribution.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.054
What's the stationary
distribution here?

00:09:33.054 --> 00:09:34.970
Well, the way we're going
to have to calculate

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:36.630
that is here's how you update.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.200
This is the result of the
vector matrix multiplication.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.890
But let's just spell
it out in terms

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.560
of the conditional
probabilities.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.030
After one step, if the
original distribution

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:52.150
is p B, p O, p G, then
the new probability

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:53.660
of being in state
B, the only way

00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.125
you can get there is by
following the edge from B

00:09:58.125 --> 00:09:59.710
to B with probability 1/2.

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:02.790
And that's times the
probability of being at B.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:06.030
And the other way
you can get to B

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:09.000
is by being at the green state.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.620
And then one step later
you're certain to be at B. So

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.730
that adds a contribution
of 1 times p G.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:17.784
And likewise for p-- the
updated probability of being

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:19.450
at the orange state
and the green state.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:24.510
And what we want is that
these updated probabilities

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:26.860
are the same as the ones
that I'm starting with.

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.700
That's the definition
of stability.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.670
You update the
vector p B, p O, p G,

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.740
and you get the same vector.

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.520
That's what makes it stable.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.300
And of course, a
side constraint.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.960
Since you can always solve a
system of equations like this

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.810
by letting all the p's be
0, which is degenerate,

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:44.720
we add the constraint
that the sum

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:48.880
of the probabilities of being
in the states has to be 1.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:53.900
Well if we solve that simple
3 by 3 system of equations,

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.840
then it turns out that the
stable distribution is there's

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.420
an 8/15 chance of
being in state B,

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.210
a 3/15 chance of
being in state orange,

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.070
and a 4/15 chance of
being in state green.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.760
And you should
check that yourself

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.940
by asking what's the probability
of being in p B after one step

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.399
given these probabilities?

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:17.190
And I'm not going to
talk you through that.

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:21.020
But just to verify and
imprint the idea of stability,

00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:23.350
that's one that's worth
stopping the video for a moment

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.650
to check and do a little
arithmetic with a pencil

00:11:26.650 --> 00:11:28.370
and paper.

00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.210
OK.

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.950
So in general, what
we're going to do

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:34.340
is we're trying to find
the stationary distribution

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:38.430
vector-- call it
s bar, for vector.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:44.200
And we get this by solving
the vector matrix equation--

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:49.050
that the distribution vector
times the edge probability

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:53.100
matrix is equal to that
same distribution vector.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:55.870
We want to solve this
system of equations.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.510
If there are n
states, then this is

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.760
an n by n system of equations,
with an additional constraint

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.850
that we want the norm of
the stable vector to be 1,

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:11.050
because that's to avoid
the degenerate 0 solution.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:14.520
Well there are some problems
with stationary distributions

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:15.720
that we want to think about.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.881
First of all, what happens in
this example where you have

00:12:19.881 --> 00:12:21.755
just two states, and
the probability of being

00:12:21.755 --> 00:12:23.930
in the first state at 1
and the second state is 0?

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:28.370
Well if you update that
state, what happens

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.750
is you just go to the second
state with probability 1.

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.150
And you can keep doing that.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:36.100
And there may be a
stable distribution here,

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.940
but this particular pattern
doesn't converge to it.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.790
As you go through time,
at every other step

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:47.370
you're at state 1, and every
other step you're at state 0.

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:52.800
But you never get to
a stable distribution

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:57.240
where step after step you
are at equal probability

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.870
of being at these two places.

00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:01.067
I'm assuming here that
this is a certain edge,

00:13:01.067 --> 00:13:02.150
and that's a certain edge.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.830
It has to be.

00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:04.440
There's only one edge out.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.940
So a stable distribution
would be 1/2, 1/2.

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:10.130
But this thing doesn't
converge to it.

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:10.890
OK.

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:13.090
Here's a slightly more
complicated example,

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.250
where again assume that all
the edges are equally likely.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:21.520
There's exactly two edges
out of each of these vertices

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.860
so that each edge
has weight 1/2.

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.810
And the problem
with this graph is

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.220
that when you ask what's
the stable distribution

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.570
and, well, if you look
at it, if you assume

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.260
that the probability of
being in the middle is 0,

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.460
and the two places that you
get stuck at have probability p

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:42.230
and 1 minus p,
then that's stable,

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:46.150
because once you're at this
state with probability p

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:50.050
you're following the one certain
edge that goes back around

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.260
to this vertex.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.720
And therefore
there's probability

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.450
of p of being there
one step later,

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.000
and likewise probability
q of one step later.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.480
So the split between p and
q is a stable distribution

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.770
for this thing, with
probability 0 and 0 there.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:07.490
And of course p and q can be any
real numbers between 0 and 1.

00:14:07.490 --> 00:14:09.720
So there's actually
an uncountable number

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.870
of stable distributions
for this graph.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.310
Problem here is it's
not strongly connected.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:20.540
And that turns out to be
a sufficient condition

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:27.760
that it's got a single
stable distribution whenever

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.350
it's strongly connected.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:31.180
So in general we can
ask the question,

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.660
is there always a
stationary distribution

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.820
for any random graph? well,
if the graph is finite, yes,

00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:42.230
there's guaranteed to be
a stationary distribution.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:43.530
But is it unique?

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.840
Well sometimes, sometimes not.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.660
If the graph is strongly
connected, it will be unique.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:51.960
But we've seen examples
in the previous slide

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:53.070
where it's not unique.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:55.670
In fact, it could
be uncountably many.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:59.550
And another crucial question
is, does a random walk

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:04.260
approach the stable distribution
no matter how you start?

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.130
And that first
example was one where

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.960
you went between the first
state and the second state

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.990
and oscillated.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.690
And it never converged on
the stable distribution

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.160
of 1/2 and 1/2.

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:17.000
In general, it's nice when
you can say that no matter

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.310
how you start, after a
while things stabilize,

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.580
and you wind up at the
unique stable distribution.

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:30.040
So sometimes it'll be the case
that every initial distribution

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.040
will eventually converge
on the stable one

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.420
or the stationary one.

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:35.810
Sometimes not.

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:37.470
And then another
crucial question

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:40.920
will be, how quickly does
this convergence happen?

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.780
If we start off at some
arbitrary probability

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.520
distribution, or some
particular state,

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.470
how long does it take
before by and large

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.130
the probabilities that were
in the different states

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:55.060
has become pretty stationary?

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.620
And the rate at which
that happens again

00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.080
varies depending on the graph.
