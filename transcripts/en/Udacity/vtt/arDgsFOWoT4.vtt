00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:05.800
Here is a simple example of a representation. It is a decomposition of a single

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.660
component, which is called here, the component. The component involves a,

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.350
two ports: one for dealing with easy requests, and one for dealing with hard

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.428
requests. And then, there's the representation, which describes the details.

00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:25.110
In a sub-system, called details that has two components.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.760
One fast but dumb component and second a slow but

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.100
smart component. The binding section then pastes these two levels together.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.040
Easy requests are mapped to the fast but dumb component port P and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.340
hardRequests to the slowButSmartComponent also called Port P. Hence we

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.210
now have the same system described at two different levels of abstraction,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.960
the lower one allowing us to go into the more details than the upper one.
