00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.860
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.510
- So it's my
pleasure to introduce

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.370
the first panel of
this afternoon, which

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.800
is on big data.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.530
I alluded to it this
morning, but there

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.820
is an explosion of data at
every level of the organism

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.900
to behavioral data, like
our cell phone usage, that

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.570
can be used if you're
clever analytically,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.170
and that has its own
challenges, to really understand

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
patterns of disease and
potentially prevent them.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.220
So to lead this panel our
moderator is Caroline Buckee.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.950
She is an assistant
professor of epidemiology

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.800
at the Harvard Chan School of
Public Health, where she's also

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.820
the associate director of the
Center for Communicable Disease

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.260
Dynamics.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.590
Dr. Buckee's work at Harvard
uses mathematical models

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.020
to bridge the biological
scales underlying malaria

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.610
epidemiology.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.410
She works with
experimental researchers

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.070
to understand the molecular
mechanisms within the host that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.840
underlie disease and infection.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.780
And uses both genomic
and mobile phone data

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.210
to link these individual
level processes

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.560
to understand population
level patterns of transit.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.893
Please join me in
welcoming Dr. Buckee.

00:01:12.893 --> 00:01:16.204
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.490
- Thank you.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.280
The world is changing
very fast, as we all know.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.980
We've all seen those
exponential graphs

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.900
showing population growth.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.260
But population density is
also rising very quickly.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.890
And as of 2014, more than half
the world's population was

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.860
living in an urban
environment and projections

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.510
suggest that over
the next 30 years

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.990
we will add 2.5 billion people
to our urban environments,

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.080
and 90% of those will
be in Asia and Africa.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.940
So there's nothing a
pathogen likes more

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.480
than a densely populated slum.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.490
And I think that
really highlights

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.010
some of the threads that
were brought up earlier today

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.410
about the importance
of embedding all

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.290
of our research in
the local populations

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.890
and national control programs in
low and middle income settings.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.830
And in particular,
for capacity training.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.000
So this session is on big data.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.650
Many of us don't
really like the term

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.500
big data, although it's catchy.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.080
So I would like to reframe
this as a discussion

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.710
about qualitatively new
types of data stream

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.920
that are often at scale, at
the level of the population.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.700
And so yes, this requires
new computational challenges.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.220
But I think by labeling
things big data we

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.240
can miss the fact that all
of these new data streams

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.010
are embedded within
traditional small data that

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:43.270
are absolutely essential.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.570
So epidemiological information
on the ground, the importance

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.640
of community health
care workers,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.250
like was highlighted earlier
when we discussed Ebola,

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.090
really can't be overstated.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.420
So we do have many
new opportunities.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.170
So I'm just going to give you
some numbers to kind of frame

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.140
how fast the pace of
technology is changing.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.230
So it took on the order
of months or even years

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.817
to sequence a
single human genome.

00:03:06.817 --> 00:03:08.650
In the year 2000 it
would have cost hundreds

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.280
of millions of dollars.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.520
Now, it costs on
the order of $1,000.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.470
And we saw this morning
from Christian's talk

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.930
that we can sequence
viral genomes which

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.430
are much, much smaller than
that for $50, even less,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.630
over a very short time period.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.010
We also talked about CRISPR
and the promise of gene drive

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.640
technologies for controlling
and containing diseases.

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.700
So we have this opportunity to
really fundamentally rethink

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.940
how we do diagnostics,
surveillance, and track

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.760
epidemics for containment.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.471
Mobile phones, which we all
have now, except for some people

00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:44.470
don't have smart phones.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.010
But generally speaking,
everyone has a phone.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.810
So the World Bank estimates that
in 2000, 12 out of 100 people

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.640
had mobile phone subscriptions.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.290
Now it's 101 out of 100
people have mobile phone

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.600
subscriptions.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.250
Clearly the distribution
is not even,

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.530
and some people have
multiple subscriptions.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.530
But increasingly, cell
phones are everywhere.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.140
And so not only
does it produce what

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.110
we call digital exhaust data,
behavioral data about where

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.570
everyone is, where they're
going, what they're doing,

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.620
it also creates a tool to
engage directly with people

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.269
and to educate them.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.970
Now of course, what comes
with that is also challenges.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.930
So we have this explosion of
disinformation, the importance

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.510
of rumors in containing
epidemics and trying

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.170
to reach people.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.930
And so I think it also brings
up this question about where

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.040
we aim our solutions.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.000
So designing the perfect app
isn't going to work, clearly.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.330
We need to have cultural
specific context when

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.970
we think about engaging
populations around epidemic

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.800
containment and surveillance.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.300
So I think the
challenges that we're

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.240
going to discuss today that
come along with the promises

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.350
that big data provide are to
do with the lack of analytics,

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.190
the lack of validation, the
need to integrate these new data

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.530
sources with
traditional epidemiology

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.480
and national control programs.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.220
And then it also
brings up some issues

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.830
that are age old problems for
public health practitioners

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.650
like, how do we balance
individual rights, rights

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.680
to privacy, with public health?

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.920
And I would be interested to
hear your thoughts about that

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.730
too.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.950
So our speakers, again,
you have their bios.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.010
Our speakers are going to
range from global health

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:28.840
security and threats on a global
scale that are represented

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.490
by emerging diseases.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.610
And then we're going to hear
about the national control

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.620
programs and how we can
move them forward using

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.930
new analytics and
new technologies.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.610
And then lastly, Ami is going
to discuss with us the promise

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.320
of genomics for
helping us understand

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.510
human health as an ecosystem.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.610
An integrated
system that reflects

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.400
the dynamics of immune systems
and our microbial communities,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.890
and what that means for
developing new drugs

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.570
and approaches to containment.

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:58.080
So I will, without
further ado, I

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.630
will introduce our first
speaker Jim Wilson.

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.077
Please join me in welcoming him.

00:06:02.077 --> 00:06:05.416
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:08.278 --> 00:06:10.507
- OK.

00:06:10.507 --> 00:06:12.090
So we're going to
talk about something

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:18.360
that is, I would say, a
little bit off the beaten path

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.680
of typical public health.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.740
And this is the world where
public health intersects

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.730
with national security.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.520
And I think this is
an important topic

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.555
to discuss because,
just for context here,

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:32.055
this is the first time I've
ever spoken about this publicly.

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.260
I've been doing this
work for 25 years.

00:06:44.065 --> 00:06:47.590
What do I mean when I say
health security intelligence?

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.240
Why do we need
this intelligence?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.570
I think your speakers from the
first panel amply displayed why

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.420
we need effective intelligence.

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:58.176
How is information used to
inform our intelligence?

00:06:58.176 --> 00:06:59.800
What do I mean when
I say intelligence?

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.814
I'm not interested in people's
personal records, at all.

00:07:02.814 --> 00:07:04.480
I'm not interested
in named individuals.

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.990
I'm interested in trends big
trends, scary trends, trends

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.780
that are sometimes
very hard to detect.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.829
How do we use the intelligence?

00:07:12.829 --> 00:07:15.370
And what are the challenges with
health security intelligence

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:16.161
in today's society?

00:07:16.161 --> 00:07:18.850
I will give you a hint, they're
the exact same challenges

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.760
that Kevin outlined earlier,
as well as our first panel.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.070
This whole aspect of
information sharing,

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.840
who gets to control
that information,

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.270
all the games people play.

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:31.110
You will find me to be a cynic.

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.350
You will find me to be
very frustrated and angry

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.750
with my own career
and my failure

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:40.500
to convince our
government and the world

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.130
to do the right damn thing.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.020
All right, here we go.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.740
Traditional public
health, and I'm

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:52.960
going to upset a
couple folks here,

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.410
as a discipline does tend
to be forensically oriented.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.740
There is an important
reason for that.

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.400
You cannot have our CDC or
our public health officials

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.430
expressing things that are
speculative to the public.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.940
You must have confidence.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:09.500
Right?

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.550
We all in agreement?

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.680
You don't want to have
questions about your CDC.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.860
You want to take their
word as almost the word

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.910
from some divinity, right?

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:23.030
To achieve that level of
confidence takes time,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.370
takes a lot of time.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.630
Unfortunately for us, we
continually run out of time.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.210
We don't have time
to screw around.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.559
We need to make decisions now.

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.289
If I told you the real
stories behind the scenes

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.270
about how we managed
to Ebola, how we

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.982
managed Zika, how we managed
a lot of these issues--

00:08:43.982 --> 00:08:45.440
and there are books
out there like,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.220
And the Band Played
On about HIV.

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:52.000
You will find that we've been
playing games for decades,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.810
and it's very unfortunate.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.290
But some of those games are
important games to play.

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.031
You need peer review, right?

00:08:59.031 --> 00:08:59.530
You do.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.400
You need to be sure of what
you're dealing with here.

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.720
So there's a minimal
tolerance of false alarms.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:12.430
In our world however,
we embrace false alarms.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.270
We want to be on that bleeding
edge of alert notification.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.109
I am intolerant of people
playing games with information

00:09:19.109 --> 00:09:20.650
when we're dealing
with an event that

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:23.530
could cause massive
socioeconomic disruption

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.870
or scare the living
heck out of the public.

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:28.630
I want resolution of uncertainty
as fast as we can get it.

00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:31.790
And I'm willing to
take false positives.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.500
Now that's a very different
perspective, it really is.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.900
And a totally
different work culture.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.610
In my world, I was dealing
with the time sensitive issues.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.890
The very bleeding edge of a flip
point where a community is just

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.080
humming along in their
activities of daily living

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.815
and all of a sudden,
somebody flinches.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.474
So the birth of health security
intelligence really began--

00:09:56.474 --> 00:09:57.890
and there have
been various groups

00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:00.740
that have looked at this from
intelligence perspectives

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.906
since going back as far as
the Spanish flu of 1918.

00:10:04.906 --> 00:10:06.530
But they've done it
for various reasons

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.230
and with different
purposes in mind.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:12.950
I actually started my
career trying to forecast

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:14.900
Ebola using satellite imagery.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.460
But my sample size
was really small

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:18.543
and I was having a hard
time publishing the paper.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.000
Because you want a robust
sample size, right?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.194
You want to meet certain
criteria for publication.

00:10:26.194 --> 00:10:27.610
We just couldn't
get it out there.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:30.120
But I needed to get it out
there because I needed people

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.722
to test the hypothesis.

00:10:31.722 --> 00:10:33.230
Right?

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:36.980
So this is in the late
1990s, before we had bioRxiv

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.200
and some of these
other systems to enable

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.830
us to share that information.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.360
But when I walked around
our country trying

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.750
to find the one agency that
actually has a watch cell that

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:51.120
actually does,
indeed, do nothing

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:53.340
but watch the entire
planet for bad things.

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:55.940
I couldn't find it.

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.122
And I say, I went everywhere.

00:10:58.122 --> 00:11:00.080
I even went to the
department of transportation

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.370
in desperateness.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:05.430
Why don't we have a National
Weather Service equivalent

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.960
for infectious disease?

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:13.950
I am angry after 25 years
we still don't have it.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:16.830
So I tried to convince people.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.780
What would it take for us
to have one for the world?

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.530
West Nile virus was the
beginning of that discourse.

00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:27.290
And I'm here to tell you that
West Nile unfortunately, sadly

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:30.150
did not kill enough people.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.940
You have to kill people.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.200
You have to kill Americans.

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.520
You've got to do
it fast, and you've

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.910
got to do it in a nice
cluster, and you've

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:37.250
got to get a good sample size.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.625
And you've got to
kill the young,

00:11:38.625 --> 00:11:40.815
and you've got to kill
working age adults.

00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:42.440
Think about it, what's
it going to take

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.420
to get political willpower
to back something like that?

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.600
What ultimately got us
started was actually SARS.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.960
Where our team actually looked
at some of these signatures

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.480
that were actually reported
in publicly available

00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:00.350
Chinese media, and realized
that we actually missed plenty

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.920
of heads up warning for months.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.920
Months.

00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:07.050
OK, I'm sorry the Chinese
actually didn't really

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.130
hide a lot.

00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:11.490
There was a lot of information.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:13.812
Now, why did we miss it?

00:12:13.812 --> 00:12:16.270
Well, there's some pretty ugly
questions to be asked there,

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.270
yes?

00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:20.990
4 1/2 months is what I'm talking
about in terms of the time

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.250
delta.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.160
We've had alleged
bioweapon events, including

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:28.190
one that I recently published
on the largest anthrax

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.170
epidemic documented
in modern history

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:35.600
during that counterinsurgency
in Rhodesia in the late 1970s.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.540
Interesting events that
shouldn't have gone unnoticed,

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:40.904
that shouldn't have
gone unreported.

00:12:40.904 --> 00:12:42.320
Why aren't there
many publications

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.220
about these events?

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.280
Lab accidents, we've
had lab accidents, yes.

00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:51.040
Many of which have
not been reported.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.060
I think Kevins provided
us with ample hints

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:56.440
of there is research going
on around this world.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.260
Are we aware of who's
doing what, where?

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.170
Genetic manipulation
of H5N1 virus

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:03.860
to get it to transmit
more efficiently

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.372
is my popular favorite.

00:13:07.372 --> 00:13:09.080
Do we know if they've
had a lab accident?

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.480
What happens if they
do have a lab accident?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.420
Do we have vaccine ready
on standby in case they do?

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:16.977
Will it be able to be
deployed fast enough?

00:13:16.977 --> 00:13:18.560
Unfortunately, these
are the questions

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.530
that we're stuck
with in my world.

00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:26.860
HIV/AIDS, took us a long
time to figure that one out.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:29.370
Venezuelan equine
encephalitis, that's

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.470
an agent that is
mosquito transmitted very

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:34.140
similar to some of the other
agents we've discussed today,

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:36.630
causes pediatric encephalitis.

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:41.007
We had a huge epizootic
in Venezuela for which

00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:42.090
we didn't receive warning.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.714
And there was a
convergence of the peak

00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:46.430
of the epidemic with the peak
of direct nonstop air traffic

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:47.720
to Dade County, Florida.

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.810
West Nile, well, that's
been robustly discussed

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.140
by Tracy McNamara who's the
Bronx Zoo veterinarian who

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.180
helped raise the alarm on that.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.890
And all of the
challenges she faced

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:03.855
trying to get people to pay
attention to what's going on.

00:14:03.855 --> 00:14:05.480
And if you really
talk to Tracy, you'll

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.150
find out that later, she had a
really hard time getting a job.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:11.869
She is a national
hero in my opinion,

00:14:11.869 --> 00:14:13.160
she should have gotten a medal.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:17.140
SARS, we already talked about.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.430
MERS, when was the first time
MERS was really detected?

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.156
Wasn't in the kingdom
of Saudi Arabia.

00:14:24.156 --> 00:14:26.840
It was in Jordan.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.050
It too, was blatantly
apparent to any analyst who

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:34.440
was monitoring in the native
vernacular, or Arabic media,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.400
where they talked about an
unusual, atypical, fatal

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.040
illness killing ICU
health care workers.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:42.120
Cholera, Haiti.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.320
I was asked not to
reveal my suspicion

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.240
that the UN Mirabi base was the
source of the cholera disaster.

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.740
My response to that
was, if we believe

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.880
the UN to be the epitome of
the world, then act like it.

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.830
It's called corporate
responsibility.

00:15:02.830 --> 00:15:07.710
It was an accident,
do not deny it.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:08.824
Ebola.

00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:10.990
How long was it on the
ground before we were finally

00:15:10.990 --> 00:15:12.370
able to mount a response?

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:14.124
chikungunya, zika.

00:15:14.124 --> 00:15:16.165
This is a pattern it's
been going on for decades.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.310
So, targeting.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:24.120
So in our world we really are
focused on a subset of disease,

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:27.750
the things that move very
quickly are locally unfamiliar.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.317
This speaks to diagnostics,
availability of infrastructure

00:15:30.317 --> 00:15:30.900
on the ground.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.910
It has to be clinically
significant, right?

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.260
Can't be a mild disease.

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:35.220
Ideally, it kills.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.120
Ideally, it maims.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.730
Ideally, it marks the
individual so that any layperson

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.530
can see what's going on.

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.030
You have to affect
a certain segment

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:43.950
of the population, as
I've hinted at before:

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:45.930
children, working age adults.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.480
If it affects the elderly,
unfortunately that gets buried.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.110
People don't talk about
illnesses in the elderly,

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:54.540
worldwide, like they do
with working age adults.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.247
Problems with access
to diagnostics

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.080
and countermeasures.

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.930
So if we don't have a vaccine,
that's concerning to us.

00:15:59.930 --> 00:16:01.680
If you don't have an
effective antibiotic.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.429
Efficient transmission
is a big one, right?

00:16:04.429 --> 00:16:05.970
And that has to do
with the dynamics.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.300
Do we have herd immunity
on the ground or not?

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.840
The data focus.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.960
We use global media.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.460
Now, I'm going to tell you
flat out, no company on Earth

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.790
has a full grasp of the
entire global output of media.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.060
If you think ProMed
does it, guess again.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.730
If you think Google
does it, guess again.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.150
OK, Rupert Murdoch has played
actually quite a strong role

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:32.897
in actually restricting our
access to media over time,

00:16:32.897 --> 00:16:34.480
so you have to pay
for everything now.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.067
So now the costs have increased.

00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:38.900
We had to monitor, just
to give you an idea,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:43.430
we had 50 full-time analysts
who spoke 50 languages

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:44.690
as their primary language.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.790
That's what it took to get at
the barest tip of this iceberg.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.430
We had 5,000 live
events on the radar

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.410
a day that we had
to keep an eye on.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:58.610
5,000 that were threated.

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:01.245
And you've got to pick which
one of those 5,000 events

00:17:01.245 --> 00:17:03.203
that you're actually
going to pick up the phone

00:17:03.203 --> 00:17:07.790
and put your career on the
line and call somebody about.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.619
Tough work.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:11.325
And human networks.

00:17:11.325 --> 00:17:12.700
And really what
you're looking at

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.420
is you're tipping and
queuing, tipping and queuing.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:20.159
And it's a constant dialogue,
it's a constant conversation.

00:17:20.159 --> 00:17:22.450
And you're having these
conversations with researchers,

00:17:22.450 --> 00:17:25.990
with physicians, with
journalists, with anyone

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.840
who is close to the
action to try to say, hey,

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:31.450
is this something
or is this nothing?

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.940
At a time when we have
no epidemiological data.

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.060
At a time when we might not
have any diagnostic information

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.670
at all other than
people are dying.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:44.170
Or there's a report that people
panic evacuated a village.

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:46.540
The bias, of course,
when you're dealing

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.000
with data of any kind in
the electronic environment

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
is, of course, where
is there infrastructure

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.050
to support that data?

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:57.190
So we knew very well that it
tends to follow this city light

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.960
map, which should make sense.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.930
It's where you have
electricity, right?

00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:05.180
So in this analysis and
dissemination piece,

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:09.320
we have used forecasting
tools for decades.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.450
So if anybody tells you that
we cannot forecast infectious

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:15.380
disease, I'm here to tell you
that's just a blatant lie.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:16.250
It ain't true.

00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.790
We do.

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.160
We have been for a long time.

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.330
How do we use it?

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:24.590
We use it to set the hypothesis
when we're tracking something

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:26.390
in the real time space.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:28.670
We say, OK, I expect
to see that we're

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.580
about to enter cholera season.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:34.337
I'm also forecasting the
entire social response

00:18:34.337 --> 00:18:35.420
pattern in that community.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.650
I know what they're going to do.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.066
What countermeasures
they're going

00:18:38.066 --> 00:18:40.470
to deploy, how they talk
about it in the media,

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:42.860
whether or not there's social
anxiety, whether or not

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.900
the hospital gets overwhelmed.

00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:48.322
We have all that information
and we know what to expect.

00:18:48.322 --> 00:18:50.030
So therefore, if you
know what to expect,

00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:52.580
you can recognize deviations.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:55.580
And you can recognize
when, uh-oh, that train

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:57.620
seems to be coming
off the rails here.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.360
What's going on?

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:01.670
Signal processing, I've
kind of hinted to that.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:04.520
That's the recognition of an
anomalous signature pattern,

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.820
or an anomalous pattern that's
appearing in the system.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.660
There's a myriad of
different ways to do that.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.210
We have pattern libraries.

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:13.521
So there's an Ebola signature.

00:19:13.521 --> 00:19:15.020
One of our speakers
from the morning

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.930
was talking about the
Nigerian experience.

00:19:17.930 --> 00:19:20.840
That signature
looked like a country

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.990
that is well adapted to
handling those kinds of issues.

00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:26.120
Whereas the signature of
a country that has never

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.460
encountered Ebola before
with no infrastructure it,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.640
to us, looks like a heart
attack, wild fluctuations

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.530
of indicators.

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:36.260
Sensitization, desensitization
of human networks.

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.200
We will actually ramp up entire
global networks of people

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:42.260
to watch for something, and
then tamp them down again.

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.660
Now, the tamping down is
a really important piece

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.580
that people really
don't appreciate.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:51.440
I spend, actually, 98% of my
time home calming people down.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.300
Indication warning
methodology is really

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.940
what we're talking about
here, which is a Cold War

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.740
intelligence
analytic methodology

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.200
and it's available
for you to review

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.260
in the public literature.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.630
Now, here's an example.

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.200
So we manage the Japan
Medical Intelligence Center.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.710
These are actual
forecasts for legionella,

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:12.290
carbapenum-resistant
gram negatives, which

00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:14.960
is a gram negative
bacteria that is

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.225
resistant to one of our end of
line categories of antibiotics.

00:20:18.225 --> 00:20:21.770
I'm, also, side note, very much
into anti-microbial resistance

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:23.240
tracking.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.860
And EHEC, which is a
disease we often see--

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:28.565
or, not often,
thank god not often,

00:20:28.565 --> 00:20:32.390
a disease we occasionally
see in pediatrics.

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.740
So the point here is, I
have a different demand

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.550
for forecasting.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.370
I just want to know if we're
about to hit the season or not

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.820
across dozens of diseases,
down to the prefecture level,

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:45.560
down to the community level.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:49.220
And we have this information
across multiple countries.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.820
It does exist.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.870
Here's for Nevada.

00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:56.090
And on the left
side here, this is

00:20:56.090 --> 00:21:00.560
an example of an unusual
fall outbreak of H3N2.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.120
That's a seasonal
influenza and we

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.650
were able to recognize it
very quickly because we had

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.920
the baselines for influenza.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.830
So a lot of this
information is very

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:09.770
reminiscent of what already
happens in epidemiology.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.630
We know what the
seasons are, right?

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.090
We do build
statistical baselines.

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:16.889
The question is, so what?

00:21:16.889 --> 00:21:18.680
How do you interface
with this information?

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.000
How do you communicate
with people?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.710
And how do you blend it with
your awareness of what's

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:22.880
happening in the community?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.460
And in this case on the
left, what happened was

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.590
physicians were recommending
the influenza vaccine

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.160
to older adults in December
because of waning immunity.

00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:33.140
The vaccine protective
period does not

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.520
last as long in older adults.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.420
And so rightfully so
our community said,

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.364
well, just wait until
December to get that vaccine.

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:41.030
Well, we had four
fatalities due to type

00:21:41.030 --> 00:21:44.310
A influenza by
mid-October that year.

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:46.702
And it was actually
a warning failure.

00:21:46.702 --> 00:21:49.160
And I got in a world of trouble
with my local public health

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.960
people for pointing that out.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.830
RSV, you see that peak
there, that red line

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.846
goes above our forecast band.

00:21:56.846 --> 00:21:58.970
That's a point where I
actually picked up the phone

00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:00.594
and called our
pediatric intensive care

00:22:00.594 --> 00:22:04.430
unit to make sure that our
soul PICU in the county

00:22:04.430 --> 00:22:06.766
wasn't getting overwhelmed.

00:22:06.766 --> 00:22:08.390
Are they calling up
backup ventilators,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.181
this kind of thing.

00:22:09.181 --> 00:22:12.170
So it's very important to kind
of put your data in context

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.670
with your infrastructure.

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.490
What's happening?

00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:16.200
Are we able to respond?

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.170
Attribution.

00:22:18.170 --> 00:22:19.730
So this is the
actual email that I

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:22.010
sent to 1,000 people
on the ground in Haiti

00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:24.500
about our suspicions
about the Mirabi base.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:27.350
I don't expect you to
be able to read it.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:30.080
But the point here is
that this was basically

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:34.910
the culmination of this kind of
messy world of data gathering

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.140
and human conversation.

00:22:37.140 --> 00:22:40.160
This was the tip where
we knew that we weren't

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.314
dealing with endemic
Haitian cholera

00:22:43.314 --> 00:22:44.480
as some people were arguing.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.210
That we were actually dealing
with an imported virgin soil

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:51.620
epidemic of Nepalese cholera,
whole different animal.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.990
And had national security
implications from the Haitian

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:55.850
government point of view.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:56.990
Signal recognition.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.600
So how did we provide
the tip off on swine flu?

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.980
Well, that was
open source media.

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:09.760
Unfortunately for us, we
ran into some crossed wires

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.460
with CDC who didn't
want to tell the press

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.490
and acknowledge that we had
given them this information.

00:23:15.490 --> 00:23:18.860
We lost a $10 million
company over this.

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.050
And I sent another
50 analysts home.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:24.370
Challenges.

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.800
Well, as I've hinted,
this is a direct challenge

00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:28.577
to established bureaucracies.

00:23:28.577 --> 00:23:30.160
There are many
disagreements regarding

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.930
what is considered
an alert priority.

00:23:31.930 --> 00:23:35.830
I've spent my career playing
Cassandra, the Greek tragedy

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.780
of being cursed with
the ability of forecast

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.029
and no one will listen to you.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.000
Failure by bureaucracies
to use the intelligence.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.100
I've seen this over, and
over, and over again.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.350
I'm tired of seeing it.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.600
Lack of understanding what
to do with the information.

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:53.580
Well, OK, that's an
important challenge, right?

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.770
That perhaps I can help with.

00:23:55.770 --> 00:23:56.735
Information control.

00:23:56.735 --> 00:23:58.860
If you think that people
don't control information,

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.450
you're not living in reality.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.710
Everyone does it.

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:03.720
And they do it in
my own locality.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.300
OK, I see hospitals hiding
information all the time,

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.400
about drug resistance
for instance.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:10.440
And of course,
denial and deception.

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.140
The funny thing is, if you ask
anyone in the national security

00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.600
committee they will put
that last bullet first.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.290
Saying, well, the state actor
is suppressing information.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:21.300
The hardest time I've
had getting information

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:22.950
has nothing to do
with that, it has

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.215
to do with my own local folks.

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:29.350
It's the pogo cartoon, right?

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:30.510
Who's the real enemy here?

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.060
Challenges.

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:33.890
Academic and
operations disconnect.

00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.670
So it's very hard
to have somebody

00:24:36.670 --> 00:24:39.760
like me sit in on a
collaborative research group

00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.470
to give them guidance
and say, look, this

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.210
is what's really important.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.850
If you go down this road,
honestly, great paper.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.650
You get your PhD thesis but we
won't be able to put it to use,

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.330
and there are all kinds
of reasons for that.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.490
There's an operations/policy
disconnect.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:55.990
I hate this.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:58.540
This is the thing that
actually is driving me squarely

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.670
into insanity.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.250
We keep seeing policy
drafted out of Washington

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.160
and it's quite clear that the
people who drafted the policy

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:10.010
have never done
this work before.

00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.240
Transparent accountability.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.700
I've just hinted at multiple
intelligence failures.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:17.920
When was the last time we had
an open congressional session

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.040
where we sort of reviewed
who knew what, when,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.070
and why didn't you
share that information?

00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.990
Time for that to
change, I think.

00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:29.840
Substantial inability to provide
balanced risk assessment.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:35.570
So this hints at our culture's
tendency to hype things.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:37.130
I do think that we hype things.

00:25:39.730 --> 00:25:43.390
I know I've got 30 seconds, so
let's rip through this fast.

00:25:43.390 --> 00:25:44.244
Live example.

00:25:44.244 --> 00:25:45.910
There has been a
proclamation that we're

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:48.640
going to be hit with a
severe influenza season.

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.860
Some of you may have seen this.

00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:52.120
And it came out of Australia.

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.040
Australian media talking
about the worst flu

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:57.490
outbreak on record in 2017.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:03.450
Worst on record in 2017.

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:08.630
In general, we get our season
what the southern hemisphere

00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:10.290
in the season
immediately preceding us.

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:12.930
So this is Tony
Fauchi saying this.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.390
Now, if he understood,
perhaps, what

00:26:15.390 --> 00:26:17.260
this looks like from
our perspective,

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.220
I wouldn't have gone that
far out with that comment.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:23.630
I would have maybe
hesitated to have said that,

00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:26.180
because it's not actually
very much a guarantee at all

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:27.555
that we're going
to see what they

00:26:27.555 --> 00:26:29.490
see in the southern hemisphere.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.300
But it hit CNN.

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.260
Flu jab warning.

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.540
NHS, National Health Service
of the United Kingdom,

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.636
warns of major outbreak.

00:26:36.636 --> 00:26:38.510
Getting vaccinated could
be life threatening.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:39.635
This is the United Kingdom.

00:26:39.635 --> 00:26:42.140
So there's a spread of a meme.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.930
British flu deaths may rise in
the worst epidemic in 50 years

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.240
after Australian
strain outbreak.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.400
And now, the media
is creative, they're

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.020
going to swap that
virus out and say

00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:54.170
it's due to H2N2 which was
a pandemic strain not seen

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:57.430
since 1957.

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:58.244
Creative.

00:26:58.244 --> 00:26:59.410
I've got to hand it to them.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.510
Again, current
influenza season being

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.820
worst on record and
evidence that the elderly

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.400
are particularly--
so Sanofi Pasteur

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:13.796
chiming in now to take
profitability options here.

00:27:13.796 --> 00:27:15.670
And now the Canadians
are picking up on this.

00:27:15.670 --> 00:27:17.230
Now Canada is all
lit up thinking

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:18.570
they are about to get
hit with a pandemic.

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:20.495
This is all happening
right now, by the way.

00:27:20.495 --> 00:27:21.950
- In the interest of time--

00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:24.610
- Yeah, it's going
to be two slides.

00:27:24.610 --> 00:27:26.814
So, admissions to
sentinel hospitals.

00:27:26.814 --> 00:27:28.480
This is the actual
report from Australia

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.210
that started this
entire train of events.

00:27:31.210 --> 00:27:33.480
Note the underlined comment.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.230
And not necessarily
reflecting an increase

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.642
in severity infection.

00:27:36.642 --> 00:27:38.350
So what has happened
here is that they're

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:41.800
diagnosing more cases, it is
not necessarily more severe.

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.920
But that don't let
that stop the media.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.780
And then finally,
we see somebody

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.360
rational after months
of this spreading

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.460
across multiple
countries this meme.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.290
Finally somebody
in Canada decides

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:57.690
to say, now, wait a minute,
maybe we're overblowing this.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:00.800
And then last but not
least, what's happening now?

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.550
We have perfectly
routine influenza

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:05.430
being documented by CDC.

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:08.490
Now, this may change, of course.

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.710
The influenza virus that's
in circulation right

00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:15.020
now is covered by our
current vaccine, so much ado

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.420
about, perhaps nothing.

00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.760
So I'll close with that.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.890
With the point that it would
be nice to have a little bit

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:24.270
of balance in the discourse.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:27.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.430
- Thank you.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:33.130
Thank you, Jim.

00:28:33.130 --> 00:28:38.080
So we can debate the how
good forecasts are all day,

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.390
but we can do that later maybe.

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.520
Next speaker is Jess Metcalf.

00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:44.470
She is an assistant
professor at Princeton.

00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:46.570
You can read her
bio in your book.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.700
And she's going
to talk about how

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.240
we can move national control
programs forward using modeling

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:55.980
and new technologies.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.990
- Hi.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:28:58.499
So it's a great
pleasure to be here.

00:28:58.499 --> 00:29:00.290
I'm going to talk about
how we can actually

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.110
connect some of
these new, exciting

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.200
and to use the term
big data streams,

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:09.690
to public health questions.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.870
And I'm going to focus my
discussion around measles.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:15.630
So measles is a directly
transmitted, completely

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:16.860
immunizing infection.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:19.110
So that means for someone
to give someone else measles

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.700
they have to be in proximity.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:24.570
And once you've had measles,
you'll never have it again.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:26.490
So it has a very
simple life cycle.

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:28.320
Individuals tend to
be born susceptible.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.395
They then become
infected, and then recover

00:29:30.395 --> 00:29:31.520
and are protected for life.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:40.915
We have a safe, inexpensive, and
completely immunizing vaccine.

00:29:40.915 --> 00:29:42.880
And since the case
fatality rate for measles

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.200
can be extremely high, as high
as 20% in low resource settings

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.920
and in catastrophes, and because
the consequences of measles

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:53.140
can be so bad,
measles vaccination

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.630
has been referred to as a
best buy in public health.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.050
Following successful eradication
of smallpox and polio,

00:30:03.050 --> 00:30:05.120
the Pan American
Health Organization

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.860
decided to target measles
elimination in 1994.

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:12.980
A combination of
routine vaccination

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.880
with large campaigns designed
to both interrupt transmission

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.670
and maintain high
population immunity

00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:21.860
meant that this was
achieved within a decade.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.260
It was a very
remarkable success.

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.550
In the rest of the
world, the situation

00:30:28.550 --> 00:30:31.020
was not so successful.

00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.080
So the x-axis on all
these graphs is time

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.270
and the y-axis is
numbers of cases.

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:37.520
And you can see that
red line is Paho.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.210
Afro is the African WHO region.

00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:43.260
And WPR is the West
Pacific region.

00:30:43.260 --> 00:30:44.870
They're falling
much more slowly.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:47.270
Although there were substantial
gains at the beginning,

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:50.160
progress has been interrupted.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.910
And we know why, partly.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.960
There is considerable inequity
in vaccination coverage

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.780
across the globe.

00:30:56.780 --> 00:31:00.410
The yellow countries on
this plot in around 2011

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:01.660
had coverage of less than 80%.

00:31:04.170 --> 00:31:05.880
Of course, these
national statistics

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.820
also conceal a lot of
important heterogeneity.

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:12.210
And even in countries that
seem to be doing really well,

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.340
there have been large,
unexpected outbreaks.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.130
So this is an example
of one in Malawi

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:18.900
that had a well-performing
system and very

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:22.230
few cases for about a
decade, and then experienced

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:26.450
this large late age
outbreak in 2010.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:27.510
And it made sense.

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:28.590
We know why that happens.

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.290
Vaccination coverage was
good, but not perfect.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.669
So every year, a certain
number of children

00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:35.460
were not being immunized
and they were also

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:37.800
escaping infection because
we had successfully

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.840
reduced transmission.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.270
And that meant that
when the infection came,

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:44.520
there was this large outbreak.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.340
We used to think that measles
was so transmissible-- it

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:49.170
is so transmissible--
that there was

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:52.540
no point trying to intervene
once the epidemic could taken

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:53.527
off.

00:31:53.527 --> 00:31:55.110
We know through
carefully modeling now

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:56.850
that that's not the case.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:02.457
Outbreak reactive vaccination
is now indicated by WHO.

00:32:02.457 --> 00:32:04.290
And of course, it's
even better if you could

00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.150
have anticipated this outbreak.

00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:09.312
If two months, or three months
before the measles outbreak

00:32:09.312 --> 00:32:10.770
had kicked off in
Malawi you'd been

00:32:10.770 --> 00:32:12.990
able to reach the
population and vaccinate it,

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.680
you could have averted many,
many cases, potentially.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.800
And thus, deaths and
thus the morbidity.

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.270
But what would we
need to do that?

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:22.589
We need two pieces to
do that successfully.

00:32:22.589 --> 00:32:24.380
And the first is that
we need to understand

00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.360
the landscape of immunity.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:31.490
We need to know who's protected
from infection and who isn't.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.160
In this particular example,
the person in red is infected

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.560
and I've set this up with R0.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:38.939
So a number of new
infections of around two.

00:32:38.939 --> 00:32:40.730
So it infects two other
people, but there's

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.500
a third person who's immune.

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.320
And as it progresses and
as the pathogen progresses,

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.400
more of the population
is protected.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:49.469
If we vaccinate
effectively, everybody

00:32:49.469 --> 00:32:51.260
should have that little
blue shield on them

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.520
and the pathogen should
not be able to spread.

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.440
To understand the
landscape for immunity,

00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.610
we therefore need to understand
both the scale of heterogeneity

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:03.190
in local demographics, because
the source of new susceptible

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:06.700
individuals is births, but
also, the history of vaccination

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.472
and infection.

00:33:09.472 --> 00:33:10.930
There's another
piece that we need,

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:13.180
and that is that we need to
understand human mobility.

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.890
So we need to understand if you
have successfully eliminated

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.470
measles in a particular
location but you're not

00:33:20.470 --> 00:33:23.350
vaccinating everybody so
susceptibles can build up.

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:25.600
You might still get
away with it for a bit

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.210
because the only way measles
is going to arrive in your city

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:31.102
or your district is if someone
with measles turns up there.

00:33:31.102 --> 00:33:32.560
So we need to
understand how people

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.480
are moving around the
landscape in order

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.890
to grapple with understanding
the landscape of immunity

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:42.950
and mobility to predict
when outbreaks would occur.

00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:45.730
So what we wanted to do, and
Caroline was part of this work,

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.790
was see if we could figure
out retrospectively using

00:33:48.790 --> 00:33:51.610
all the tools we had available
could we have got ahead

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:54.470
of an example
historical outbreak.

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:56.260
And the example
outbreak we used was

00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:01.040
one that happened in
2010-12 in Pakistan.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:05.020
So again, x-axis
years, y-axis cases.

00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.570
So we mustered all the
data we had available.

00:34:07.570 --> 00:34:10.030
And first of all, to calibrate
the landscape of immunity

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:13.270
we pulled together the
vaccination coverage surveys

00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:16.880
that had been done in
Pakistan over previous years.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.480
And it's quite a luxury having
vaccination coverage surveys

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:21.820
because this doesn't exist
for many of the settings

00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:24.880
where measles is a concern.

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:27.260
We put this together with
births and we put this together

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.710
with our best guess of what the
history of infection had been.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.389
And this is actually
a reasonable thing

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:35.219
to do because in the
era pre-vaccination

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:38.090
it's reasonable to assume
that everybody got measles.

00:34:38.090 --> 00:34:40.340
There's this great quotation,
measles is like love,

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.690
everybody gets it.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:45.364
And it was definitely
true back in the day.

00:34:45.364 --> 00:34:47.030
So we built a picture
of what we thought

00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:48.830
the landscape of immunity was.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:52.760
And then to put this
together with human mobility,

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.350
we leveraged a source of data
that Caroline really pioneered,

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:59.090
which is using mobile
phone call data

00:34:59.090 --> 00:35:01.700
records to capture
how people are

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.770
moving across the landscape.

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.020
And the way this works
is that every time you

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.270
make a call, the
tower that you're

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.850
closest to routes that call.

00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:12.770
So if we know where
the towers are and we

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.260
have a record of the
calls, we can figure out

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.710
these large scale
fluxes of population.

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.770
And this data comes with
no other information.

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.710
We just know where people are
and where they've moved to.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:25.970
We don't know their age.

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:27.860
We don't know the
vaccination status.

00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:32.110
What we have is
fluxes of mobility.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.900
So to evaluate our
ability to predict,

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.350
we're also going to need
information on measles itself.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:40.060
And so we had two
sources of data here.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:43.050
One was province
scale case reports.

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.840
So over the time scale
from September 2012

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:51.700
on the left going forward to
September 2013 on the right,

00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.960
there were records
of numbers of cases

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:57.520
in each of the provinces of
Pakistan shown by the colors.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.200
So we compiled that data.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.310
It's not perfect, right?

00:36:01.310 --> 00:36:02.934
If you're interested
in human mobility,

00:36:02.934 --> 00:36:05.120
Pakistan is rather large
and provinces is rather

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:08.120
a large scale to be
thinking about this problem.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.004
So we also pulled in
another source of data.

00:36:10.004 --> 00:36:12.170
And this was a different
source of information which

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.010
was district levels alert data.

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:19.460
So when local health officials
of a particular district

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.662
thought a measles
outbreak was kicking off,

00:36:22.662 --> 00:36:24.620
that data was sent up to
the Ministry of Health

00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.030
and was available to us.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:27.620
It's not actually instance data.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.600
We don't know the total number
of cases that were there.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.516
They might just have
flagged up that something

00:36:31.516 --> 00:36:33.190
was about to happen.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:37.340
OK, so how am I going to see
if I can predict this data?

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:39.370
Well, what I'm going
to do is build a model

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:40.660
of what Pakistan looks like.

00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:42.820
And this is a very crude
cartoon, obviously,

00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:44.780
for feasibility.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:47.650
If every one of the points
is a different district, what

00:36:47.650 --> 00:36:49.870
the mobile phone data
gives me is a sense

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:51.640
of the fluxes of
individuals between all

00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:52.841
these different points.

00:36:52.841 --> 00:36:54.340
So there might be
strong connections

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:56.215
between some districts
and weaker connections

00:36:56.215 --> 00:36:57.780
between others.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.520
For every one of these districts
I also have a sense of what

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:04.100
proportion of the population
is immune to measles and what

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:04.600
isn't.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:08.140
And that's going to matter
for the pathogen spread.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:11.530
So I have my sense of how
the world works based on all

00:37:11.530 --> 00:37:13.570
the big data that I have.

00:37:13.570 --> 00:37:16.117
And then what I'm going to
do is initiate an outbreak

00:37:16.117 --> 00:37:18.700
in the setting where I know that
the outbreak kicked off based

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:21.454
on the district alert data.

00:37:21.454 --> 00:37:22.870
And I'm going to
run a simulation.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.720
And this works essentially by
saying, the outbreak begins.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.370
It might have moved,
you know, if this

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:29.710
was the district that
was most connected it

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.960
might have moved here next.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:34.060
The outbreak continues in
the two first districts.

00:37:34.060 --> 00:37:37.570
It might move to a
third, and so on.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:41.249
So over time, I'm going to
have a full simulation of what

00:37:41.249 --> 00:37:42.790
the outbreak looked
like in every one

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.950
of the districts of Pakistan.

00:37:44.950 --> 00:37:47.170
And importantly, every
time I rerun this you

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.000
might get a slightly
different picture

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.670
because I'm assuming that
chance is going to play a role.

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:54.940
That some routes are going
to be fairly similarly

00:37:54.940 --> 00:37:57.010
important at different
times, and so we're

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.410
flipping a coin to figure
out which one predominates.

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:02.915
So every simulation might end up
looking a little bit different.

00:38:02.915 --> 00:38:04.540
But overall, they
look a bit like this.

00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.550
So this is simulated
trajectories

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:10.060
across all districts in Pakistan
based on the mobile phone

00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.760
data and the landscape
of immunity data.

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:15.500
The x-axis is time in by
weeks over the time course

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:17.130
we were focused on.

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:20.922
And the y-axis is the
number of cases we obtained.

00:38:20.922 --> 00:38:22.630
So we need a way to
evaluate whether this

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.880
is any good or not, obviously.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.290
And so for that, we go back
to our original district alert

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.790
data.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:31.930
The province level data is just
too coarse to do much with.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:35.180
And we chose to focus
on the question of,

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.020
could we anticipate,
could we predict

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:40.540
how many districts would
occur after a certain point

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.370
in the future?

00:38:42.370 --> 00:38:44.680
Because in that case,
we could rush out there.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.180
We could start
preparing campaigns,

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.650
we could maybe get
ahead of the wave

00:38:48.650 --> 00:38:53.410
and that would be a considerable
public health benefit.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:57.220
So on this plot, what we have is
time and by weeks on the x-axis

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.600
into the future.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.850
And on the y-axis is the
proportion of districts

00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:04.030
that we accurately predict to
have happened after the time

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:06.460
point on the x-axis.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.730
So at the start of the outbreak,
100% of districts happening

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:11.790
in the future, we do quite well.

00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.360
That's not too impressive.

00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.600
And then the
proportion predicted

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.336
to happen in the
future falls off.

00:39:19.336 --> 00:39:23.660
And by about 10 by week,
so about five months,

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.960
we're doing as well
as a coin flip.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.670
So we're doing 50%.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:30.400
And after that, our
predictions get even worse.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.020
Because we have a
model, and the model

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.490
is less good than just saying,
stuff might happen by chance.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.560
So, is it helpful?

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.590
It's been estimated
during measles outbreaks

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.980
in Malawi that it takes about
two to three months to get

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.481
a campaign up and running.

00:39:45.481 --> 00:39:46.980
So we're buying a
little bit of time

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:49.620
there, potentially
on that scale.

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.430
But we're not doing great.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:55.950
It's important to think about
why we aren't doing great.

00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:59.580
And in this context, it's
important to remember

00:39:59.580 --> 00:40:03.660
that every one of
our data sources

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:05.400
has uncertainties in it.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.220
So the vaccination data might
have reporting biases in it.

00:40:08.220 --> 00:40:10.590
We might only be
finding the children

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.170
to report on coverage
who had been vaccinated

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:15.640
because the ones who aren't
vaccinated, by definition,

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.120
are probably hard to find.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:20.010
We might have a large
population, therefore,

00:40:20.010 --> 00:40:21.199
of missed children.

00:40:21.199 --> 00:40:22.740
So our vaccination
coverage estimates

00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.240
will be really optimistic.

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:27.490
Mobility data, mobile phone
data is really amazing

00:40:27.490 --> 00:40:28.990
and gives you this
incredible window

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:31.429
into how people are moving
around the landscape.

00:40:31.429 --> 00:40:33.220
We don't know if it's
relevant to children.

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.511
We don't know if it's relevant
to transmission from one

00:40:35.511 --> 00:40:37.540
individual to the next.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.690
There's a quite specific biology
underlying measles transmission

00:40:40.690 --> 00:40:43.570
and these big fluxes
might not capture it.

00:40:43.570 --> 00:40:44.710
And then the case data.

00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:47.830
It's true everywhere in the
world, even and outbreak

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:49.840
in Holland in 2007
it was estimated

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.470
that 10% of measles
cases were reported.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.270
Nobody reported measles cases.

00:40:55.270 --> 00:40:57.876
So that data is
also fairly erratic.

00:40:57.876 --> 00:40:59.500
And I think this
comes back to a thread

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.900
that Caroline alluded
to in the beginning.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.020
To make any progress
around really leveraging

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.250
these unique and powerful
novel sources of information

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:13.570
requires really strengthening
existing sources of information

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:17.090
and really basic epidemiology,
case reports, vaccination

00:41:17.090 --> 00:41:17.590
coverage.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:20.215
No one ever seems to write down
what fraction of the population

00:41:20.215 --> 00:41:21.220
they vaccinated.

00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:22.750
Possibly because they have
more important things to do,

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.791
like vaccinate children,
but it would be helpful.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.490
So one of the things
we've been thinking about

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.490
as we move forwards
in this space

00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:36.604
is I told you I need two pieces
to really try and predict

00:41:36.604 --> 00:41:38.520
where and when an outbreak
is going to happen.

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.200
And even for measles,
which is perhaps

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:43.530
one of the world's simplest and
best understood of pathogens,

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.162
it's really hard.

00:41:46.162 --> 00:41:48.370
And we ended up thinking
about, is there another way?

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:49.786
Is there another
approach we could

00:41:49.786 --> 00:41:53.170
take to refining
our understanding

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:56.021
of the landscape of immunity?

00:41:56.021 --> 00:41:57.520
And really, we
started from the fact

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.770
that this is the central
process in epidemiology.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.100
I told you, individuals
start off susceptible,

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.170
that's the S. They become
infected if they encounter

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:06.450
an infected person.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:08.780
That's the I. And
then they recover.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.680
And just about every
piece of modeling

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.960
around infectious
diseases has some variant

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:16.920
of this basic schematic in it.

00:42:16.920 --> 00:42:19.320
Yet all we ever see when
we're trying to build

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:23.330
these forecasts is cases.

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:26.014
The susceptibles and the
recovereds are invisible to us.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.050
And we can infer who's
susceptible and who isn't.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:32.580
That's what I did here.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:35.490
I pulled together information on
births and vaccinations to try

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:37.990
and figure out who could
have got the infection,

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:40.280
who was protected,
and who wasn't.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.270
And in measles--
this is an example

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.060
of pre-vaccination measles
in England and Wales.

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.440
It's very straightforward.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.480
The number of
susceptibles in two weeks

00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:50.580
time is the number
of susceptibles now

00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:53.100
plus new births minus
whoever got infected.

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.600
So you just iterate it forwards
and you have your trajectory

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.932
of susceptibles.

00:42:57.932 --> 00:43:00.390
Almost everywhere in the world
would be a lot like Pakistan

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:03.930
where the case data was shaky,
the vaccination coverage data

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:04.929
was shaky.

00:43:04.929 --> 00:43:06.720
In fact, everywhere
now has measles vaccine

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.280
so you have to account for it.

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:12.130
But it turns out that there is
potentially another approach

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.470
to getting at that.

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.470
And that is that
serology can directly

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.051
measure susceptibility.

00:43:19.051 --> 00:43:21.300
So this is where if I were
to go out into the audience

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.080
and take your blood, which
would be very strange,

00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:30.010
I could evaluate whether you had
been vaccinated against measles

00:43:30.010 --> 00:43:31.030
or not.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:33.370
And I'm guessing that
everybody in this audience

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:36.880
has an antibody titer that
is protective to measles.

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.656
In my case, it's actually
because I was infected.

00:43:40.656 --> 00:43:42.280
But we can discuss
that with my mother.

00:43:45.312 --> 00:43:47.770
And you can do much more nuanced
really interesting things.

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:50.590
So for example, I could
evaluate whether you'd

00:43:50.590 --> 00:43:53.530
been exposed to
particular flu strains,

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:56.922
like Hong Kong 68 or Bangkok 71.

00:43:56.922 --> 00:43:59.380
Which tells me whether you were
in a part of the world that

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:02.980
was connected to the
rest of the globe

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:05.230
during these global pandemics.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:09.610
So it's an incredible window
onto the past of populations.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:12.430
And it's an incredible window
into predicting the future,

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:15.160
and the likely
burden of infections.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.280
It allows us to project.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:20.110
It gives us a direct measure
of this landscape of immunity.

00:44:20.110 --> 00:44:22.750
And so with colleagues,
one of the things

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:25.720
we're very excited
about moving forwards

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.330
in considering big
data and the world

00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:31.240
of contagion and
epidemics is developing

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.920
a global immunological
observatory.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.750
And our logic here is that
if you think about weather

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:40.540
forecasting, we have
buoys distributed

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:43.960
all over the seas of the
world to measure sea surface

00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:47.944
temperature to strengthen our
prediction of global climate.

00:44:47.944 --> 00:44:49.360
And yet we have
nothing equivalent

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:51.520
for infectious diseases.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.630
But all of our blood is
this unbelievable sensor

00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:57.760
of all the things
we've been exposed to,

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:00.310
all the things we've
been infected by.

00:45:00.310 --> 00:45:02.170
And the technology is
ramping up to a stage

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:04.420
where you need smaller
and smaller samples

00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:06.160
and you can get more
and more resolution

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.630
across even more pathogens.

00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:12.850
It would give you the
prospects of anticipating

00:45:12.850 --> 00:45:14.620
hidden epidemics or
at least understanding

00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.860
when they were occurring long
before perhaps cases blipped up

00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:18.460
on the radio.

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.500
You might be thinking,
well, that's not,

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.960
I mean, how are we
going to store that?

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.190
What are the ethics of it?

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:29.231
And it's absolutely true.

00:45:29.231 --> 00:45:31.670
There's a huge amount of
both ethical and logistical

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:33.930
considerations that
have to come through.

00:45:33.930 --> 00:45:36.290
But I think the prospects
are such that there are so

00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:38.600
many ways in which you could
use convenience samples,

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.077
if you think about blood banks.

00:45:40.077 --> 00:45:41.660
We could be using
blood banks to think

00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:44.810
about what the world's kind of
epidemiological and contagion

00:45:44.810 --> 00:45:46.520
risks are.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:50.090
There are all sorts
of carefully designed

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:51.680
nationally
representative surveys

00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.720
that could add a
biological sample to it.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.220
And there's even
the prospect of not

00:45:55.220 --> 00:45:58.290
needing to use blood because
it's really hard to get blood,

00:45:58.290 --> 00:46:01.250
but using saliva for
some of these techniques

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:04.032
with many of the new
technological innovations,

00:46:04.032 --> 00:46:05.990
many of which are actually
happening at Harvard

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:08.060
that would allow us to do this.

00:46:08.060 --> 00:46:10.010
So that's all I have.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:15.200
And I did all of this with
Caroline, Andy Tatem, and other

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.240
[INAUDIBLE].

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.300
Thank you very much.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.660
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.490
- Thank you, Jess.

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:33.080
So our final speaker for today's
panel is going to move from--

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:37.310
we've been to global threats,
and national vaccination

00:46:37.310 --> 00:46:38.720
programs, and serology.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:42.290
Ami Bhatt from Stanford
is going to talk

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:47.270
now about a more personal scale,
thinking about the microbiome

00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:49.820
and how our
bacterial communities

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.630
and viral communities interact
to create susceptibility

00:46:53.630 --> 00:46:54.140
to disease.

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:56.900
And what it can teach us about
the development of new drugs

00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:59.240
and approaches to
make people healthy.

00:47:04.370 --> 00:47:06.200
- All right, so
thank you very much.

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:08.220
What a pleasure to be
a part of this event

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:10.470
and to be a part of this panel.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.070
So I'm going to speak
for the microbes today.

00:47:13.070 --> 00:47:15.080
And I'm going to think
about epidemics with you

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:17.540
all through the lens
of the microbiome.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:19.940
And whether we like it or
not, a huge wave of data

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.520
are coming at us and we're
just at the beginning

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:26.510
of trying to build tools to
understand these microbes,

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:31.250
to enumerate these microbes, and
to figure out how they change

00:47:31.250 --> 00:47:34.370
over time and space.

00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:36.950
So I'm going to start out
by helping you get to know

00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:39.660
your trillions of neighbors.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.120
I'll try to convince you
that context matters.

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.100
And I'll try to give you a sense
of the perils of a simplified

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.340
microbiome.

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:49.020
I'll scare you a little bit.

00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.520
Our microbiome are under siege.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.390
And I'll remind you that
while we talk about pathogens

00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:58.550
and microorganisms as though
they're stagnant organisms,

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.990
they're alive and
they're changing.

00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:04.570
I'll end by giving you
a very simple example

00:48:04.570 --> 00:48:09.130
of microbial evolution
on a clinical time scale.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:13.000
So number one, getting to know
your trillions of neighbors.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.990
We are one, but we are many.

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:18.990
There are about 10 to 100
trillion microbes within each

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:21.200
and every one of us.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.500
They make up about 3%
of our human body mass.

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:29.560
We have 1 to 10 times as many
microbes as we do human cells.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.460
There are 10 to 100 times
many microbial genes

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:35.500
as there are human genes.

00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.840
And of course, as you all
know, the largest number

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.960
of microbes that we have
are in our GI tract.

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:43.970
Over the course
of today's seminar

00:48:43.970 --> 00:48:47.060
we've heard a lot about
how microbes can be bad.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.770
And I'm not here to disagree.

00:48:49.770 --> 00:48:54.300
But sometimes they can
be good, or neutral.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.150
We know that we
exist or co-exist

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.920
with these trillions
of microorganisms

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:04.040
and that they are inexplicably
intertwined with ourselves.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.140
And so while many of us
will look at this picture

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.510
and see the host or the
faces, when I look at this,

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:10.880
I see the microbes.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.850
And what I understand is
that if the microbes change,

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:16.006
well, perhaps we will as well.

00:49:16.006 --> 00:49:18.380
And so part of what motivates
me as a physician scientist

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.140
is trying to understand
this interface so that we

00:49:21.140 --> 00:49:24.110
can manipulate host health
through manipulation

00:49:24.110 --> 00:49:26.230
of the microbiota.

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:29.590
So I alluded to the fact that
microorganisms can be good.

00:49:29.590 --> 00:49:32.350
And to make this point, I'll
actually pull an example

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:34.424
from the animal kingdom.

00:49:34.424 --> 00:49:36.840
I like elephants, which is
part of why I have this picture

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:37.650
here.

00:49:37.650 --> 00:49:40.050
But it turns out that this
is also an excellent example

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:42.450
of why microorganisms are good.

00:49:42.450 --> 00:49:45.210
So elephants are one
of many organisms

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.370
that actually eat poop.

00:49:47.370 --> 00:49:49.500
They don't eat poop
throughout their lifetime,

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.490
they only do it when
they're children.

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:56.070
And if babies do not eat stool
from adults from the herd,

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.240
they actually have
a runting problem,

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.180
which means that they
don't grow properly.

00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:04.080
The microorganisms that they
acquire through adult feces

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:06.270
actually help them
to extract energy

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:08.110
from their food optimally.

00:50:08.110 --> 00:50:09.600
So this is an
excellent example I

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:14.670
think from the natural world
about microbial good guys.

00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:19.140
When we think about microbiome
sciences and the little tidbits

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:21.810
that I gave you earlier, a
lot of how we've enumerated

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.900
understood the microbiome
has relied upon techniques

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.210
for enumeration.

00:50:26.210 --> 00:50:28.020
And while light
microscopy was probably

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:29.760
the first method
that was successfully

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.800
applied to enumerate
microorganisms

00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:35.190
that were visible, there
are other methods as well.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:37.060
And a vast majority
of these methods

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:40.490
now rely upon DNA
or RNA sequencing.

00:50:40.490 --> 00:50:42.150
And so Professor
Happi earlier today

00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:46.290
talked about beautiful work
using DNA and RNA sequencing

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:49.590
to enumerate microorganisms,
in that case viruses,

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:51.840
and to understand not
only whether or not

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.120
they exist within a human,
but how they change over time.

00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.730
And so the fundamental
basis of most

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:58.770
of the experiments
that I'll describe

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.070
is taking a sample,
usually a mixed sample,

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:05.580
sequencing it, generating these
lists of A's, and T's, and G's,

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:08.160
and C's, and then
trying to infer

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:12.790
from that information what
microorganisms are present.

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:16.360
Put more simplistically,
my job is to collect stool,

00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:20.110
to extract nucleic acids, and
to ask simple questions like,

00:51:20.110 --> 00:51:20.920
who's there?

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.880
What are they doing?

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.440
And what do they make?

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:25.030
In order to do so,
obviously we're

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:28.070
generating gigabytes and
now terabytes of data.

00:51:28.070 --> 00:51:30.550
And so we require high
throughput computational

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:32.170
pipelines to actually
achieve this.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.660
So next, we're going
to talk about context.

00:51:37.660 --> 00:51:40.210
And I'm going to try to convince
you that context matters,

00:51:40.210 --> 00:51:42.340
and that having a
simplified microbiome

00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:44.050
comes with its problems.

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:47.180
So for that, I was really happy
to see that I had this orange.

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:48.640
I got this orange for my lunch.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.800
I'll eat it at the break.

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.000
You know, this is an orange.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.240
This is probably not
very scary to any of you.

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:58.750
I presume you do not
find it threatening.

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:03.970
You probably also do not
find this orange threatening.

00:52:03.970 --> 00:52:08.090
I think almost all of
you have seen this movie.

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:09.250
This is from The Godfather.

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:12.100
For those of you who haven't
seen The Godfather, you should.

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.260
These are an excellent
series of movies.

00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.390
But on a more serious
note, in The Godfather

00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:19.750
you may notice that every time
there is an orange in a scene,

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:22.510
it actually portends bad things.

00:52:22.510 --> 00:52:25.760
And usually the person
engaged with the orange dies.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.170
Sorry, spoiler alert.

00:52:29.170 --> 00:52:33.910
So, you know, these
oranges, not so bad.

00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:37.250
Those oranges, quite worrisome.

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:40.990
And so an orange, is not an
orange, is not an orange.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:44.980
Likewise, microbes
are not always

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:47.960
pathogenic in all circumstances.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:50.320
And so the context
in which you view

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.200
those microbes and the context
in which they exist actually

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.900
strongly affects their function.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:00.410
So we'll turn now to the perils
of the simplified microbiome

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:05.040
and think about
context in that way.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.830
So here are two microbiomes.

00:53:06.830 --> 00:53:09.570
The one on the left is
a complex microbiome.

00:53:09.570 --> 00:53:11.810
This is what, for example
your stool microbial

00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:13.160
might look like.

00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.500
The one on the right is,
obviously, very simplified.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:20.330
All you see is these Good
and Plenty looking rods.

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:23.810
It turns out this exists
in clinical medicine.

00:53:23.810 --> 00:53:26.510
So an example of how this
exists in clinical medicine

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:28.700
is in the setting of C. diff.

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:31.130
Many of you have heard of C.
diff, clostridium difficile.

00:53:31.130 --> 00:53:34.250
Now actually, it's called
pepto clostridium difficile.

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:36.890
Is an organism that
is an opportunist.

00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:42.110
And typically, it exists,
colonizes many healthy people.

00:53:42.110 --> 00:53:44.886
We have a few hundred people
in here, about 5% of us

00:53:44.886 --> 00:53:46.010
are colonized with C. diff.

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:48.230
It doesn't cause any problems.

00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:50.990
However, in the setting of
a simplified microbiomes

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:55.600
when you don't have a healthy
context, it causes disease.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:58.100
So this is an example
of an opportunist

00:53:58.100 --> 00:54:01.350
that is pathogenic only
in a given context.

00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:03.800
And so while we can look at
pathogens, and infectious,

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.566
disease, and epidemics
and contagions

00:54:06.566 --> 00:54:07.940
through the lens
of the pathogen,

00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:10.040
we can also think about
it from the standpoint

00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:14.270
of those who are susceptible,
as just pointed out.

00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:16.790
Now, many of you know of the
most successful treatments

00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:20.000
for C. diff is actually
not antibiotics,

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.950
but fecal microbiota
transplantation.

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:25.970
This happens to be my
favorite picture of FMT which

00:54:25.970 --> 00:54:29.090
shows you connecting two
people's colons, which

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:30.080
we obviously do not do.

00:54:33.490 --> 00:54:35.710
Over on the right
this is like probably

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:37.780
not right after lunch
picture, but this

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:40.560
is an example of a crapsule.

00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.230
This is--

00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:44.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:46.780
This is just from across
the river over at MGH,

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.700
A colleague of
mine, Libby Hohmann,

00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:50.380
generates these capsules.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.120
And actually, if you take
15 of those pills one day,

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.940
15 pills the next
day you can actually

00:54:54.940 --> 00:54:58.199
have a very high rate of
cure of your C. difficile.

00:54:58.199 --> 00:54:59.740
In part, because
what you're doing is

00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:03.520
you're giving a healthy
microbiome context back

00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:06.100
to an individual who has
a simplified microbiome.

00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:08.990
How cool is that?

00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:13.072
Now, of course, our
microbes are under siege.

00:55:13.072 --> 00:55:14.030
I'm worried about them.

00:55:14.030 --> 00:55:15.950
I know you guys did
a good job of going

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:19.400
and having lunch and taking
care of your microbes.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.510
But many have argued
that industrialization

00:55:23.510 --> 00:55:27.530
increases exposure to agents
that change our microbiome.

00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:29.900
So when you reflect upon
your daily life, what

00:55:29.900 --> 00:55:31.649
are the things that
we're doing that might

00:55:31.649 --> 00:55:32.930
simplify our microbiome?

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:36.770
Well, if we look at humans
throughout evolutionary time,

00:55:36.770 --> 00:55:39.020
early on in the
hunter gatherer days

00:55:39.020 --> 00:55:42.270
the main thing that affected
our microbiome was our diet.

00:55:42.270 --> 00:55:45.050
Our diet, and occasional
exposure to pathogens that

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.270
caused terrible
diarrhea and essentially

00:55:47.270 --> 00:55:49.550
kind of a clean out.

00:55:49.550 --> 00:55:53.090
As we went to a more
agricultural sort of setting,

00:55:53.090 --> 00:55:55.490
diet again was a major effector.

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:57.380
As we became more and
more industrialized,

00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:59.930
heavy metals and
arsenic introduced

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:02.070
were introduced into
our environment.

00:56:02.070 --> 00:56:04.850
And finally, in the modern day
adding onto those heavy metals

00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:07.190
and arsenic, we also
had broad scale exposure

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:10.100
to antiseptics and antibiotics.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:12.099
So by a show of
hands, how many of you

00:56:12.099 --> 00:56:14.390
think you might have been
exposed to antibiotics today?

00:56:18.890 --> 00:56:22.600
I'm going to argue
that it's everyone.

00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.260
So this compound over on
the left is triclosan.

00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.200
Triclosan is a
common antiseptic.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.470
It actually was originally
developed in the 1960s

00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:34.210
as a surgical anesthetic.

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:35.680
It's a very simple molecule.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.430
And for those of you
who aren't chemists,

00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:39.370
anytime you see a simple
molecule you can look

00:56:39.370 --> 00:56:41.270
smart at a cocktail
party by saying,

00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:43.480
I bet somebody synthesized that.

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.620
Because when nature
synthesizes molecules

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:47.560
they're awfully complex.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.810
So this is a synthesized
antimicrobial.

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.460
It's very broad spectrum.

00:56:51.460 --> 00:56:54.400
And it's in thousands
of consumer products.

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.760
Now, you may know
that the FDA banned

00:56:56.760 --> 00:57:00.820
triclosan and several
related compounds in 2016.

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:02.630
That ban just went into effect.

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:05.410
So you won't see
anti-microbial hand soaps

00:57:05.410 --> 00:57:07.570
on your shelves for example.

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:10.120
Now, while it was banned
in certain household wash

00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.999
products, it's still
present in lots of things.

00:57:12.999 --> 00:57:15.040
And I would guess that
even the chairs that we're

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.410
sitting on today have
antimicrobials that

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:20.650
are impregnated into the cloth.

00:57:20.650 --> 00:57:23.200
So Jessica Roboto, a talented
graduate student in my lab,

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:24.340
decided to study this.

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.260
And we collaborated
with an epidemiologist

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:28.450
named Julie
Parsonnet at Stanford

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.970
to evaluate the
impacts of triclosan

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:34.180
on a cohort of mothers
and their babies.

00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:36.880
To make a long story short,
this is a complicated graph.

00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:39.580
But suffice it to say
that each dot represents

00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:41.050
a bacterial taxon.

00:57:41.050 --> 00:57:44.980
So a community of similar
types of microbes.

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:47.660
If you have dots to the
right of the center line,

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:49.960
these are microbes that
are enriched in households

00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.550
exposed to triclosan.

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:53.560
If you see a dot
on the left, those

00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:56.200
are microbes that are
enriched in households

00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.480
exposed to the control agents.

00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.520
And what you can see
is in these adults

00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.590
they happen to be mothers.

00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:05.560
Over the course of time
we see an enrichment

00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.730
of these blue dots on the
right side of the graph.

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:10.600
Which means these are organisms
that are enriched in households

00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.840
exposed to triclosan.

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.150
Interestingly, in this
experiment what was done

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:18.450
was between two and six
months these households were

00:58:18.450 --> 00:58:21.690
randomized to be
exposed to toothpaste

00:58:21.690 --> 00:58:24.250
that contain triclosan.

00:58:24.250 --> 00:58:26.710
Now, triclosan is not
banned from toothpaste.

00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:29.050
So while you won't see it
in antibacterial hand soap,

00:58:29.050 --> 00:58:31.090
you can walk down the
street to CVS and buy

00:58:31.090 --> 00:58:32.650
this particular toothpaste.

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:36.680
And you can see that this is
actually having a broad effect.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.820
Triclosan is actually
the second most abundant

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.610
human-made chemical in
waste water treatment plants

00:58:42.610 --> 00:58:44.930
and it abounds in
our groundwater.

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:48.350
So whether we like it or not,
we're exposed to this compound.

00:58:48.350 --> 00:58:51.460
At least these data suggest
that these compounds

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:53.683
are changing our microbiomes.

00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:59.064
You can look up this
in Jessica's paper

00:58:59.064 --> 00:59:00.730
that just came out
if you're interested.

00:59:00.730 --> 00:59:02.938
And I'm certainly happy to
answer any other questions

00:59:02.938 --> 00:59:05.590
you may have on it.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:09.160
But remember, not only are
our microbiomes under siege

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.620
and our microbiomes
are changing,

00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:14.860
but our microbes themselves
are alive and changing.

00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:17.320
They adapt beautifully
to stressors.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:20.110
You saw evidence of how
they adapt over time

00:59:20.110 --> 00:59:23.762
and acquire mutations in
the setting of outbreaks.

00:59:23.762 --> 00:59:25.220
Fundamentally, for
those of you who

00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.610
are not molecular biologists,
or geneticists in the audience I

00:59:28.610 --> 00:59:31.220
though I would just break it
down into two main categories

00:59:31.220 --> 00:59:34.050
of ways microbes evolve.

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:36.100
they acquire small mutations.

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.820
And so in this case, the
highlighted red letters

00:59:38.820 --> 00:59:41.610
are changing to another letter.

00:59:41.610 --> 00:59:45.270
Or they can acquire
genes or gene fragments.

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:49.660
And we usually call this
horizontal gene transfer.

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:52.690
And so there are two main
ways bacteria can evolve.

00:59:52.690 --> 00:59:55.540
It turns out that we're pretty
good at measuring the way

00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:57.970
that organisms
evolve on the left.

00:59:57.970 --> 00:59:59.650
So we can measure
those mutations.

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:03.040
Those are pretty easy
using current technologies.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.660
But measuring the thing on
the right has been difficult.

01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:08.400
And part of the
reason it's difficult

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:11.370
is because when you have a
horizontal transferred segment,

01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:13.770
what it means is that what
you're seeing in this toy

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:15.450
example actually occurs.

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:18.000
Which is you have a repeated
segment, in this case labeled

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.170
R, that exists both between
A and D in this case,

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:25.600
as well as between
B and C. Now, this

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:28.240
happens in nature, a
horizontal gene transfer.

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:32.530
An example of where it happens
is in this organism, E. coli.

01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:34.400
So I'll just ask you
to raise your hands,

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:38.390
how many when I say like E. coli
feel really good about E. coli?

01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:40.006
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:40.006 --> 01:00:41.850
It's like a few.

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:45.150
How many of you feel
like kind of bad?

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:47.100
Like we're at a pathogen
conference, so yeah,

01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:48.390
many of you feel bad.

01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:50.460
And how many of you feel
like it's complicated?

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.180
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:52.792
Yeah.

01:00:52.792 --> 01:00:54.250
Like, I feel like
it's complicated.

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.700
You know on one hand, it's
like the most commonly used

01:00:56.700 --> 01:00:58.590
bacterial model organism.

01:00:58.590 --> 01:01:00.270
Every biology lab
in this country

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:02.790
and probably in the
world uses this.

01:01:02.790 --> 01:01:05.850
On the other hand it can cause
enterohemorrhagic E. coli,

01:01:05.850 --> 01:01:07.650
which we heard
about earlier today.

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:09.632
Terrible diseases, kill people.

01:01:09.632 --> 01:01:12.090
And it turns out that part of
the reason we feel conflicted

01:01:12.090 --> 01:01:15.630
is because E. coli can acquire
genes through horizontal gene

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:20.340
transfer that make it very, very
virulent and very dangerous.

01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:26.390
So once again, E. coli is
not E. coli, is not E. coli.

01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:28.390
So microbes can
certainly evolve.

01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.990
We know that.

01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:31.870
We know microbes can acquire
genes through horizontal gene

01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:33.010
transfer.

01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:35.620
We've talked about how it's a
little difficult to measure.

01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:37.630
But one of the things
that we realize

01:01:37.630 --> 01:01:39.910
is that not only can
microbes evolve over

01:01:39.910 --> 01:01:43.300
time scales of ten of
years, or hundreds of years,

01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:44.480
or millennia.

01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.600
But they can actually
evolve in real time.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:50.120
And in order to evaluate
that, our laboratory

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.720
studies patients undergoing
bone marrow transplantation.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.200
Bone marrow transplantation is
a potentially curative therapy

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.270
for patients with
refractory malignancies.

01:02:00.270 --> 01:02:03.050
So cancers like
leukemia and lymphoma.

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:04.550
It's a really
intensive treatment

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:06.617
and it has a very high
complication rate.

01:02:06.617 --> 01:02:08.450
But to take you through
the general process.

01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:09.740
We have a patient.

01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:12.440
We give them a lot of
high dose chemotherapy.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:15.060
Often we'll also give
them radiation therapy.

01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:18.900
This renders them much reduced
in their cancer burden,

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:21.470
but it also means that all of
their rapidly dividing cells,

01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:23.219
including the red blood
cells, white blood

01:02:23.219 --> 01:02:26.840
cells, and platelets basically
poop out for a period of time.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.300
In order to rescue
them we give them

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.920
hematopoietic stem
cells that are

01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:32.630
obtained from a healthy donor.

01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:34.799
And classically, we obtain
these from the pelvis.

01:02:34.799 --> 01:02:36.590
And so that's why it's
called a bone marrow

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:40.480
transplant because we took
the marrow out of the bone.

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.445
We give these stem
cells to the recipient

01:02:42.445 --> 01:02:45.070
and then we sit around and wait
while a whole new immune system

01:02:45.070 --> 01:02:47.494
develops, which is
kind of amazing.

01:02:47.494 --> 01:02:49.660
But as you can imagine,
over the course of this time

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:51.750
these patients are
very immunosuppressed.

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:56.280
They were exposed to a lot
of potential antibiotics, et

01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.950
cetera, to try to both prevent
them from getting infections

01:02:59.950 --> 01:03:01.450
and to empirically
treat them when

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:04.120
they get things like fevers.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.040
Because they're exposed to
so many of these compounds

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.360
their microbiomes are
for sure under siege.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.660
And this is an example of a
hospital patient at Stanford

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.280
who underwent bone
marrow transplant

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:17.800
or hematopoietic
cell transplantation.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:20.170
These are time points
after transplantation,

01:03:20.170 --> 01:03:24.090
so A is before the BMT, and
then B, C, and D are after.

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:26.620
And what you can see
is there microorganisms

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.280
basically go away.

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.550
This is a stacked bar
histogram relative abundance

01:03:30.550 --> 01:03:32.030
on the y-axis.

01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:35.430
And you can see that that blue
organism seems to take over.

01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:39.470
That blue organism happens
to be bacteroides caccae.

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:41.210
And so two talented
graduate students

01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:43.310
in my lab, Alex
Beshara and Eli Moss,

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:46.050
asked this question:
how does this occur?

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:48.650
Why does that organism win?

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:52.570
It must be particularly fit.

01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:55.980
Furthermore they said, well,
maybe gene transfer or gene

01:03:55.980 --> 01:03:59.580
movement makes this organism
particularly evolutionarily

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:00.480
fit.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.460
And they knew that
measuring this gene transfer

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.130
was difficult. Part of
the reason it's difficult

01:04:06.130 --> 01:04:07.810
is because if we
simplify that toy

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:10.840
diagram into another
representation what you can see

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:13.900
here is that we can't figure
out whether the right path is

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:19.760
ARC, or ARD, BRD, or BRD.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.790
What they decided to do was to
use a technology that actually

01:04:22.790 --> 01:04:26.240
was commercially available
but no computational approach

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.020
existed to apply this
technology in microbiomes.

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.120
And what this
technology roughly does

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:37.130
is allows you to trace a
trail through the right path.

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:39.130
In so doing, they found
some intriguing results,

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:41.990
which I'll share with you.

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:43.490
I'm going to show
you the genome,

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:47.690
or a piece of the genome
of this organism in blue.

01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:49.530
This is what a regular
assembly looks like.

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:51.177
This is 1/6 of the genome.

01:04:51.177 --> 01:04:53.510
And what you can see, for
those different time points A,

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:56.190
B, C, and D is you
have a lot of holes.

01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:58.550
So it's not contiguous.

01:04:58.550 --> 01:05:00.830
When they applied
their new method

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:02.750
they ended up with
these blue bars, so

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:06.120
a much more contiguous genome.

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:09.190
What this allowed them
to do was the following.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:11.860
They were able to
identify this huge segment

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:16.600
of 60 kilobase pairs of
DNA that actually popped

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:18.730
into the genome
between time point

01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:23.230
C and time point D. This
is horizontal gene transfer

01:05:23.230 --> 01:05:24.360
in a clinical time scale.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:27.880
This happened over the course
of days and weeks, not months.

01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:29.830
So suddenly, we can
measure genes being

01:05:29.830 --> 01:05:33.200
transferred between organisms.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.930
Finally, they were
able to identify

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:38.300
insertion sequences,
or small sequences that

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.770
can jump around a genome.

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:42.570
So jumping genes as we
heard about earlier.

01:05:42.570 --> 01:05:47.230
This particular jumping gene was
absent in time points A and B

01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:54.420
and present in time points C and
D. And these are the results.

01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:57.720
You can see I've got time
points B, C, and D here.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:06:03.450
The gene ends up in that center,
which is listed as the IS.

01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:05.640
And you can see what
happens to the right.

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:09.000
To the right of that
gene what you see is

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.510
the genes just
upstream are turned on.

01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:15.230
And so whereas in
time point B you

01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:17.370
don't see a lot of
expression of that gene.

01:06:17.370 --> 01:06:18.930
Those genes are off.

01:06:18.930 --> 01:06:22.380
In time point C and D once that
insertion sequence pops in,

01:06:22.380 --> 01:06:25.260
suddenly you've flipped a switch
and this antibiotic resistance

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:27.910
gene turns on.

01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:30.480
So no genes were
acquired or lost.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.740
This jumping gene
just moved around

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:36.450
and acts as a
random light switch.

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:38.670
So I'll just end
by reminding you,

01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:40.890
we have trillions of
neighbors and our microbes

01:06:40.890 --> 01:06:43.290
are often good.

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:46.320
Context matters and there
are perils associated

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:48.270
with simplified microbiomes.

01:06:48.270 --> 01:06:52.510
They may increase our disease
susceptibility our microbes are

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:56.830
under siege: antiseptics,
antibiotics, industrialization,

01:06:56.830 --> 01:07:01.760
and many have argued
simplified diets, low in fiber.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.440
Our microbes are
alive and changing

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:05.930
and they are steadily evolving
through mutations and gene

01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:07.690
transfer.

01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:10.840
Finally, microbial evolution
can happen on a clinical time

01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.540
scale.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.540
I showed you evidence of
a shape shifting genome

01:07:13.540 --> 01:07:15.460
and antibiotic resistance.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:18.280
So with that, I'll thank
my lab, thank all of you,

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.520
and I'm happy to join the
panel for some questions.

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.020
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.460
- OK, thank you to our speakers.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:35.460
I think this means that we
have six minutes of questioning

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:38.910
between us and then we'll
open it up to the floor.

01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:41.520
So those were fantastic
and I think they really

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.040
spanned a huge spectrum.

01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:48.930
I guess since we just ended
there, Ami I will ask you.

01:07:48.930 --> 01:07:51.450
So there's this
huge amount of data

01:07:51.450 --> 01:07:54.360
that we can now get
about our microbiome.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:56.760
It's sometimes hard to make
sense of which bits of it

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:59.070
are epidemiologically
meaningful.

01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:02.160
Can you imagine a
scenario where we've

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:06.090
got Jess's serological
bank and we

01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:08.700
could have a similar
microbiome bank where

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.260
we think about vulnerability?

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.390
Because ultimately what
we're trying to do is

01:08:12.390 --> 01:08:16.210
think about who's susceptible
to disease of various kinds.

01:08:16.210 --> 01:08:20.250
And I wonder if you can comment
on that and on the current work

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:22.290
being done in low
income settings

01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:25.379
on this type of microbiome
simplification work.

01:08:25.379 --> 01:08:25.920
- Absolutely.

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.020
So, excellent questions.

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:30.510
I think fundamentally
our microbiomes

01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:34.770
are great reflections of how
we experience our environment.

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:36.310
I'll take your last
question first,

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:38.340
which is this
question of studies

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:40.050
in low and middle
income countries,

01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:42.810
and countries that are
currently undergoing

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:44.580
rapid industrialization.

01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:46.229
There have been
very limited studies

01:08:46.229 --> 01:08:48.210
on the microbiome of
individuals outside

01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:50.100
of high income countries,
and indeed, outside

01:08:50.100 --> 01:08:51.979
of the US and Western Europe.

01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:53.729
And so this is an
area of much need.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:56.250
We don't have adequate
reference databases

01:08:56.250 --> 01:08:59.340
that tell us what the microbiome
of the vast majority of people

01:08:59.340 --> 01:09:00.761
in the world look like.

01:09:00.761 --> 01:09:02.760
The studies that have
been done have pretty much

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:05.520
been done in small
tribes, often that

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:08.100
are living in subsistence
farming communities,

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.040
or in hunter
gatherer communities.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.210
There it's been
demonstrated that at least

01:09:12.210 --> 01:09:15.770
at the simplistic taxonomic
level, meaning who's there,

01:09:15.770 --> 01:09:19.260
the microbiomes are quite a
bit more complex than our own.

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:21.779
Suggesting that Western
diet, you know the Happy Meal

01:09:21.779 --> 01:09:24.660
lifestyle, may be
compromising the complexity

01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:26.580
of our microbiomes.

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:29.250
To your point about, will
we ever get to the point

01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:31.200
where we can measure
microbiomes and actually

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.990
be able to predict
disease susceptibility?

01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:36.000
I think we can
absolutely get there.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.930
I think we need to do two things
to achieve that, in addition

01:09:39.930 --> 01:09:42.930
to collecting data from
countries outside of those

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:44.819
where our data are
overrepresented.

01:09:44.819 --> 01:09:47.850
One is collecting very high
quality clinical phenotype

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:48.479
data.

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:50.670
So whenever we collect
someone's stool sample,

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:54.330
it's absolutely critical
that we collect information

01:09:54.330 --> 01:09:57.900
about, for example,
serology, disease history,

01:09:57.900 --> 01:10:00.480
migration, lifestyle.

01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.550
Secondarily, I think
we need to be committed

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:04.260
to measuring what matters.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:08.400
And in our field we've been
very reliant upon measuring

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:13.140
taxonomy, meaning who's there,
which genus, which species.

01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:15.450
As I showed you, these
genomes can evolve.

01:10:15.450 --> 01:10:16.890
And so maybe we
need to think more

01:10:16.890 --> 01:10:21.240
about measuring elements of
the microbiota that actually

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.030
lead to functions, and
measuring what matters.

01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:27.360
Maybe we need to measure
what these microbes make

01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.290
or how they're
changing over time.

01:10:29.290 --> 01:10:29.790
- Right.

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:30.290
Thank you.

01:10:30.290 --> 01:10:33.750
Or think about antimicrobial
resistance plasmids and things

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.130
like this.

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:37.802
So Jess, I'll move to you.

01:10:37.802 --> 01:10:40.260
And also, you guys are welcome
to ask each other questions.

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.240
But I was thinking about
your serology bank.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:45.240
We think about surveillance
for emerging epidemics

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.130
and zoonosis, and
there are many who

01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:49.920
advocate that we should be
going out and sampling macaques

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.560
and the wildlife populations.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.530
Is there a way to use serology
data to try and understand

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:57.330
vulnerability to
emerging pathogens

01:10:57.330 --> 01:10:59.370
that we have not yet seen?

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:01.290
Do you think that's reasonable?

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:03.150
Or you think it's
limited to things

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:06.540
that we already understand?

01:11:06.540 --> 01:11:09.490
- I think that it's
challenging to look

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:11.890
for what you don't know.

01:11:11.890 --> 01:11:16.070
But I do think that
once an emergence is

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:18.185
suspected that's where
the power of serology

01:11:18.185 --> 01:11:19.060
might come into play.

01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.680
Because quite often
many of the pathogens--

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.560
we heard a lot about
this this morning.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:27.660
Many pathogens can have
asymptomatic infections

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.770
and so you might have
no idea of the scope,

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:32.200
particularly given uncertainty
in reporting systems.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:36.810
But if you happen to have a
blood bank in northern Brazil

01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:40.060
or other locations where
you suspected circulation,

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.070
you would have a
way to ground truth

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:44.410
that the way to understand
what might be going on.

01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:45.880
- Yeah, and for Ebola too.

01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:46.910
- And for Ebola too.

01:11:46.910 --> 01:11:50.260
I think there's a lot of
interesting questions about how

01:11:50.260 --> 01:11:54.760
whether our evolutionary ecology
theory could actually take us

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.830
towards thinking a little
bit more about what

01:11:56.830 --> 01:12:00.190
would emerge where, but I think
that's at a very early stage

01:12:00.190 --> 01:12:02.260
in the science still.

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:03.220
- Thank you.

01:12:03.220 --> 01:12:08.010
And then I'll ask a question
of Jim that's maybe different.

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:09.790
But I think a lot
of the data sources

01:12:09.790 --> 01:12:13.360
that you talked about are
often in the private sphere,

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.850
and corporations
don't own the data

01:12:15.850 --> 01:12:20.860
and are differentially regulated
or have different incentives.

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:22.930
What do you think the
role of corporations

01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:27.760
is as we move towards
preparing for a pandemic?

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:31.310
- Well, that's a
loaded question.

01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:33.100
I did disclose
here, and again this

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.140
is the first time I've
ever said this publicly,

01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.981
but we lost a $10
million company doing

01:12:36.981 --> 01:12:38.230
the right thing for the world.

01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:43.110
What incentive does
anyone have when

01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:45.060
you have-- and this has
been mentioned before,

01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:45.810
by other speakers.

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:48.330
What incentive do we have to
share information when you

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:50.040
face that kind of a penalty?

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:52.090
You blow your market.

01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:54.370
If I make the information
available for free,

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:57.100
and part of what killed the
company is that we actually

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.490
released the output
of two operations

01:12:59.490 --> 01:13:02.770
centers online on Twitter.

01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:05.860
After we notified CDC I
told the operative, I said,

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:07.927
listen I'm going to
give you 24 hours

01:13:07.927 --> 01:13:09.760
to get this out there
to the American public

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:12.550
before we go live with
everything we've got.

01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:13.830
And we did.

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:16.000
What it did it was
it blew out market

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:17.980
because you devalue the product

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:21.970
OK, so there was also questions
asked earlier this morning

01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:23.020
about vaccine.

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:25.490
What's the status
of the vaccine?

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:28.206
Well, if you've noticed, we
keep getting surprised over,

01:13:28.206 --> 01:13:29.830
and over, and over,
and over, and over,

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:33.190
and over again by these crises
that are very time sensitive.

01:13:33.190 --> 01:13:36.280
And then we see somebody go
before Congress and asking

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.639
for a billion dollars
to develop a vaccine.

01:13:38.639 --> 01:13:40.180
Well, then all the
information that's

01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:42.880
associated with that endeavor
starts getting clamped down

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:44.830
and becoming proprietary.

01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:47.487
And we had huge trouble
getting information

01:13:47.487 --> 01:13:49.570
on what was happening with
the Ebola on the ground

01:13:49.570 --> 01:13:52.060
as well as Zika because
of some of the overlays

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:54.760
that were involved
with that process.

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.790
And I would ask the audience
the honest to goodness question,

01:13:57.790 --> 01:14:01.770
do we have a vaccine available
on the market for Ebola?

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.017
Where did that funding go?

01:14:04.017 --> 01:14:05.600
Why don't we have a
vaccine for Ebola?

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.100
Why don't we have
one for West Nile?

01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:09.080
Why don't we have one for SARS?

01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.582
Why don't we have one for MERS?

01:14:10.582 --> 01:14:11.540
Why don't we have one--

01:14:11.540 --> 01:14:14.020
I mean so if you
think about this--

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.960
and Sanofi backed out of the
Zika vaccine production, right?

01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:22.430
So where are we going
with all of this.

01:14:22.430 --> 01:14:25.700
Allow me to be the curmudgeon
here and maybe the cynic,

01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:29.000
but we have real
problems with how

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.237
do we share information
and do the right thing.

01:14:31.237 --> 01:14:33.320
And that's why I'm very
animated about this issue,

01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:37.190
is that I've seen it play out
over, and over, and over again.

01:14:37.190 --> 01:14:39.370
So to me that is the
big research question.

01:14:39.370 --> 01:14:40.850
- OK, Yeah, I agree.

01:14:40.850 --> 01:14:42.620
There is there's an
organization called

01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:46.270
CEPI that was founded
after the Ebola outbreak

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:50.090
and it's an effort to
finance clinical trials

01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:54.170
to get some of these potentially
emerging pandemic infections

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:55.960
to develop vaccines for them.

01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.824
And so that if
something happens,

01:14:57.824 --> 01:14:59.990
there's an accelerated
pipeline to get vaccines out.

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:03.051
It's a hard problem to know
which pathogens you choose

01:15:03.051 --> 01:15:04.050
and all of those things.

01:15:04.050 --> 01:15:07.220
But it's certainly something
we're going to need to tackle.

01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.660
OK, so I'm going to open it.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:11.480
Up if you come and line
up behind the microphone

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:15.230
please state your name and
then ask your question.

01:15:15.230 --> 01:15:20.210
And we have about 10
minutes for questions.

01:15:20.210 --> 01:15:22.010
- Paul [INAUDIBLE] from Tuffs.

01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:26.360
Jim, I'd like to ask you
about that whole half, maybe

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:29.281
more of the environment
that wasn't talked about

01:15:29.281 --> 01:15:30.030
and that zoonosis.

01:15:32.840 --> 01:15:38.360
We aren't coupling with
the veterinary community,

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:42.890
with the zoos, or with all of
the animal side of the kingdom

01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:47.600
here, subhuman,
blah, blah, blah.

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:50.780
It seems to me that part
of what you're doing really

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.910
needs to be including
that part as well.

01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:57.230
You know, for example, the
Journal of Emerging Diseases

01:15:57.230 --> 01:16:01.070
from the CDC has been doing
that for the last 10 or 20 years

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:04.076
and in terms of making
those connections.

01:16:04.076 --> 01:16:07.700
Any comments on that?

01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:10.870
- Do you want me to respond now?

01:16:10.870 --> 01:16:14.312
- Let's have a few questions
and then we'll answer them.

01:16:14.312 --> 01:16:16.020
- This is sort of a
complicated question.

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:17.490
My name is Alyssa
Goodman and I'm

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:19.490
a professor in the astronomy
department and also

01:16:19.490 --> 01:16:22.440
the other science director
here at Radcliffe.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.700
And my question actually
sort of concerns astronomy.

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:27.360
So in astronomy we're known
for sharing our economically

01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.875
valueless data--

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.090
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:31.524
--very well, actually.

01:16:31.524 --> 01:16:32.940
And so I was asked
a few years ago

01:16:32.940 --> 01:16:36.450
to give a talk at something
called Sage Bionetworks which

01:16:36.450 --> 01:16:38.954
is where a number of the
pharmaceutical companies,

01:16:38.954 --> 01:16:40.620
thanks to the efforts
of Stephen Friend,

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:43.830
have volunteered to give
away the data that were not

01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:45.840
useful in drug trials.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.750
And it turns out that
this is really helpful.

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:52.470
And so I'm just curious whether
in the world of epidemiology

01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:53.850
there's some equivalent of that?

01:16:53.850 --> 01:16:56.880
Where some fraction of the
data could be made public

01:16:56.880 --> 01:16:59.674
rather than all or nothing?

01:16:59.674 --> 01:17:01.018
- Thank you.

01:17:01.018 --> 01:17:04.140
- I'd like thank the panel
for your wonderful talks.

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:09.120
Specifically, I'd like
to ask about what I think

01:17:09.120 --> 01:17:10.340
is an elephant in the room.

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.270
I loved Professor Bhatt's--

01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:14.580
Dr. Bhatt's picture
of the elephants.

01:17:14.580 --> 01:17:18.150
And that elephant is results
from the intersection

01:17:18.150 --> 01:17:21.420
of genetic engineering and
perhaps particularly CRISPR.

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:24.660
Our CRISPR speaker talked
about super villains.

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:28.050
And so my elephant
is the intersection

01:17:28.050 --> 01:17:31.140
of genetic engineering,
particularly maybe

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:34.650
CRISPR powered genetic
engineering and bioterrorism,

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.830
and how that relates
to your interests

01:17:37.830 --> 01:17:40.665
in monitoring and
responding to health crises.

01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.440
- I'm Ann Patterson.

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.130
I work in an organic vegetable
farm, which shows my bias.

01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:53.480
Can you give me any
guidance on how to improve

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.769
our microbiome by what we eat?

01:17:55.769 --> 01:17:57.560
I know you said it was
in the ground water,

01:17:57.560 --> 01:18:00.670
but there must be something
we can do about it.

01:18:00.670 --> 01:18:02.630
- OK, thank you.

01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:06.610
So we'll start with the
question for Jim about zoonosis

01:18:06.610 --> 01:18:09.040
and the importance
of monitoring,

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:11.705
being involved with agriculture
and zoos and this kind

01:18:11.705 --> 01:18:13.840
of thing.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.960
- So Tracy McNamara from
West Nile virus days

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.430
in the Bronx Zoo, she
was the one way back

01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:22.520
when who introduced me to
the concept of one health.

01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.390
So we definitely do.

01:18:23.390 --> 01:18:28.100
I was remiss in mentioning that,
so thanks for calling that out.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.070
When we led the
tracking of H5N1 when

01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:32.600
it was spreading
throughout Asia,

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.250
one of the leading
indicators that we

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:38.720
knew that H5N1 was probably
spreading up into Russia

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:41.720
was the bird die off reports.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:45.350
We're absolutely on that
page and on board with that.

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:48.020
And honestly, huge
parts of the network

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:50.510
that I monitor on the human
side are veterinarians

01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:52.140
and our veterinary researchers.

01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:53.464
So we're very close to that.

01:18:53.464 --> 01:18:54.880
So thank you for
calling that out.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:19:02.430
- So, the next question was
about giving away seemingly

01:19:02.430 --> 01:19:06.390
non-useful data and whether
we could do a better job.

01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:08.860
I mean, I think we definitely
can do a better job.

01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:10.950
And there needs to
be better incentives.

01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:14.250
And their responsibility
by researchers like we

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:16.530
saw earlier today to
take it upon themselves

01:19:16.530 --> 01:19:18.330
to do a better job with this.

01:19:18.330 --> 01:19:21.570
It's very hard as an academic
because your incentives

01:19:21.570 --> 01:19:24.390
are squarely in publishing.

01:19:24.390 --> 01:19:26.130
And even if it's
not for you, you

01:19:26.130 --> 01:19:27.900
want your PhD
students and post-docs

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:30.066
to get their publications out.

01:19:30.066 --> 01:19:31.440
Jess do you have
opinions about--

01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:33.950
I know you have opinions
about this, so I will ask you.

01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:36.170
- So I have one lovely example.

01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:39.000
There's a chap called
Hugo Lopez-Gatell who

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.627
was a PhD student
at Johns Hopkins

01:19:41.627 --> 01:19:43.710
and went to the director
of epidemiology in Mexico

01:19:43.710 --> 01:19:46.680
and asked for their childhood
infection and other data.

01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:49.240
And the director of
epidemiology told him no.

01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:52.140
And later, Hugo Lopez-Gatell
became the director

01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:53.300
of epidemiology in Mexico.

01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:54.270
[LAUGHTER]

01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:56.590
And all that data is
freely available online.

01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:58.620
And one of my brilliant
ex graduate students,

01:19:58.620 --> 01:20:01.131
Ayesha Mahmud, who's in
the audience here I think,

01:20:01.131 --> 01:20:02.880
used all that data for
one of her chapters

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.713
of her dissertation.

01:20:03.713 --> 01:20:05.310
I think is increasingly moving.

01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:06.820
The Pan-American
Health Organization

01:20:06.820 --> 01:20:08.194
are real leaders
in this respect.

01:20:08.194 --> 01:20:11.345
So many of those countries
share so much of the data.

01:20:11.345 --> 01:20:12.720
And many countries
are relatively

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:15.700
relaxed about sharing their
death records, causes of death.

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:17.970
And so there's incredibly
rich data there

01:20:17.970 --> 01:20:19.640
which has yet to be mined.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.060
I'm the optimist.

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:24.240
I think that the world
is moving towards this.

01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:27.300
And the generation of scientists
that's being trained now

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:29.010
is thinking deeply
about these questions

01:20:29.010 --> 01:20:30.520
and tackling these questions.

01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.520
- And I think digital
platforms for data sharing

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:34.560
are going to be key, especially
for the kind of field

01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:36.120
epidemiology that we've
been talking about.

01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.536
Once things are
digitized we don't

01:20:37.536 --> 01:20:40.110
have to go and find
somebody's hand-drawn map

01:20:40.110 --> 01:20:43.200
and things can be collated,
and aggregated, and shared

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:44.040
more easily.

01:20:44.040 --> 01:20:45.679
Do you have comments on this?

01:20:45.679 --> 01:20:47.970
- I think it's critically
important that those data are

01:20:47.970 --> 01:20:50.010
shared, but I also
think we need to support

01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:52.990
the centralized resources
that host the data sharing.

01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:58.260
So from our perspective, we
have open sharing mechanisms

01:20:58.260 --> 01:21:00.510
and approaches for
genomic data, but our data

01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:04.655
are increasingly growing in
size and are only accelerating.

01:21:04.655 --> 01:21:06.780
Right now in the United
States the National Library

01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:09.720
of Medicine is charged with
storing all of these data,

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.940
but are quite chronically
underfunded for that purpose.

01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:15.810
And so I think as we think about
generating these data, which

01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:18.550
we most certainly
must and should share,

01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:21.300
we need to think about how
we create infrastructures

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:22.493
that allow that.

01:21:22.493 --> 01:21:24.860
- Great.

01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:28.130
On the question of genetic
engineering and bioterrorism,

01:21:28.130 --> 01:21:30.410
I will pass this
to Jim in a second.

01:21:30.410 --> 01:21:32.420
I would just say
that like our ability

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.000
to prepare for
pandemics globally

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.370
and our ability to
detect things that

01:21:37.370 --> 01:21:39.500
are going to become
a big problem,

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:41.960
I think the answer
often is health system

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.410
strengthening, good access to
health care in low and middle

01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:46.130
income settings.

01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:48.110
And it comes back to
that over and over again.

01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:49.700
We can't detect
anything if we don't

01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:52.640
have good data from the field.

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:56.480
But I'm not an expert in
the bioterrorism field

01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.540
so I'll ask Jim if he'd
like to comment on that one.

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:02.360
- So the way that we detect
unusual events is we're just

01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:05.420
looking for unusual
disease, or unusual events

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.560
that are recorded.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:10.580
Unusual social disruption
where we don't expect it.

01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:14.750
And then we ask the questions,
then it becomes very forensic.

01:22:14.750 --> 01:22:17.120
The hard part here is
putting things in context.

01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:18.750
And we have a habit
in this country,

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:22.340
and this goes back
for decades now,

01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:23.936
of worrying about biotechnology.

01:22:23.936 --> 01:22:26.060
So for those of you who
are old enough in the, room

01:22:26.060 --> 01:22:28.040
you remember the
concern about DNA

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:32.090
recombinant technology in the
'70s, and The Andromeda Strain

01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:34.190
movie and how it got
everybody spun up

01:22:34.190 --> 01:22:35.600
about having
physical containment

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:38.370
level for facilities be created
here in the United States.

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:41.780
So this is a longstanding
thing, and then we

01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:43.890
have Hollywood
driving the memes.

01:22:43.890 --> 01:22:45.930
So we love to scare
ourselves, we do.

01:22:45.930 --> 01:22:47.250
It's our society.

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:51.140
And so if you watch these
events though for 25 years

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:53.450
and you become a
curmudgeon like me,

01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:59.240
you realize that we tend to blow
things out of proportion a lot.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.490
So earlier we had a
map posted on Zika

01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:03.560
that highlighted
literally half the United

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.720
States at risk for Zika.

01:23:05.720 --> 01:23:07.250
And we had to
spend a lot of time

01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:09.990
around behind the scenes
calming people down and saying,

01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:14.040
listen, the probability of a
sustained epidemic of Zika is--

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:16.280
OK, let's be cool about this.

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.170
All right, let's be careful
and put things in context.

01:23:19.170 --> 01:23:21.380
So I think we do have,
when it comes to CRISPR,

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:23.810
I think we need to slow down.

01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:26.000
Let's listen to the researchers.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.040
Let's listen and give
them an opportunity

01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:30.100
to engage in the discourse.

01:23:30.100 --> 01:23:32.840
And let's not go a little
overboard as we classically do.

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.780
My last point would be we
can't even handle game playing

01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:38.930
level one, why are we
trying to jack it up to game

01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:41.240
playing level number 50?

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.460
So we're having a very
hard time managing

01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:46.880
the things that are presented
to us by mother nature.

01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.580
Why do we have to go off
into science fiction land?

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:54.210
So I really, I'm sorry for
taking the pragmatic point

01:23:54.210 --> 01:23:56.490
of view, but that's
really after 25 years

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.920
that's what it's left me.

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:01.410
- Yeah, and I think
preparing for a pandemic

01:24:01.410 --> 01:24:04.050
means preparing for
local epidemics first.

01:24:04.050 --> 01:24:07.010
So pandemics start local and
we have to think about it

01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:08.670
in that context.

01:24:08.670 --> 01:24:11.650
So the last question and
then if we have time,

01:24:11.650 --> 01:24:15.210
we'll take a few more, was
about microbiome and diet.

01:24:15.210 --> 01:24:17.230
That was for Ami.

01:24:17.230 --> 01:24:19.397
- So I think obviously we're
interested in improving

01:24:19.397 --> 01:24:21.188
our microbiome, and
I'm glad at least there

01:24:21.188 --> 01:24:23.820
are some people in the audience
who resonated with that.

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.240
There's limited prospective
data on this topic.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:31.830
Certainly many espouse eating
diverse fiber rich diet

01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:36.790
as a method for potentially
returning to an increased

01:24:36.790 --> 01:24:38.520
diversity of the microbiome.

01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:40.140
I certainly think,
as a physician,

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:42.630
minimizing exposure to
unnecessary antibiotics

01:24:42.630 --> 01:24:43.620
is critical.

01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:46.500
And I've seen certainly a
shift from five years ago

01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:49.550
when you have sniffles, you go
in, you ask for your Z-Pack.

01:24:49.550 --> 01:24:51.880
To people coming in
and really saying,

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:54.000
well, I don't think I
need a Z-Pack, which

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.860
I think is part of the answer.

01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:57.840
Obviously we have
antibiotic use that's

01:24:57.840 --> 01:25:01.230
broad scale in, for example,
the livestock industry.

01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:05.390
And you heard a little bit about
other household antimicrobials.

01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:07.830
You know, curtailing
use of these

01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:11.280
is much more of a global
issue than a local issue.

01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:15.240
Bu I think it begins with
consumers asking what

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:18.660
the potential for harm
is with novel agents that

01:25:18.660 --> 01:25:21.120
are introduced into
the commercial sector.

01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.940
And so I think being smart
consumers can certainly

01:25:23.940 --> 01:25:24.824
contribute.

01:25:24.824 --> 01:25:26.490
But I think those are
some of the things

01:25:26.490 --> 01:25:29.025
that we can do as we
consider our microbiome.

01:25:29.025 --> 01:25:30.900
And I think the first
step toward improvement

01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:33.500
is obviously awareness.

01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:34.130
- OK.

01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:37.400
I've been told we have one more
time for one more question.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.920
- Cynthia [INAUDIBLE]
from Brandeis University.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:42.890
And I was wondering--

01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:46.190
I think maybe this question is
mostly for Jim-- but are you

01:25:46.190 --> 01:25:48.860
doing any work with
tuberculosis because it's

01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:51.410
the leading infectious
killer in the world,

01:25:51.410 --> 01:25:54.680
and between 30% and
40% of all deaths

01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.110
due to antimicrobial
resistant bugs

01:25:57.110 --> 01:25:59.220
are due to drug resistant TB.

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:02.210
And do we not track it
anymore because we just

01:26:02.210 --> 01:26:04.760
know that it's endemic and it's
going to kill a ton of people

01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.990
and given up on them?

01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:09.740
Or what's the scenario from
your perspective of pretty much

01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:13.810
any of your work, but I
think maybe especially Jim.

01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:16.500
- Well, so our bias
here is we look

01:26:16.500 --> 01:26:21.600
at abrupt shifts in
indicators that that show us

01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.600
that a community is suddenly
experiencing something

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.330
that's acutely happening.

01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:30.110
And in the tuberculosis
world, like with HIV, malaria,

01:26:30.110 --> 01:26:32.280
and so these other
endemic diseases

01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.770
in endemic areas
of the world, we

01:26:34.770 --> 01:26:37.140
see very calm
disruption patterns.

01:26:37.140 --> 01:26:38.730
So these are
communities that are

01:26:38.730 --> 01:26:40.290
used to dealing
with these issues,

01:26:40.290 --> 01:26:42.630
they're de-sensitized
even though there's

01:26:42.630 --> 01:26:44.220
a lot of mortality.

01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:47.090
What we do see are cases where--

01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:49.030
and we know it's just
the tip of the iceberg.

01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:51.529
I mean, we have data problems
just like everybody else does.

01:26:51.529 --> 01:26:55.530
But where an XDR TB will show
up in a clinic in South Africa

01:26:55.530 --> 01:26:57.239
and people will realize
that, oh my gosh,

01:26:57.239 --> 01:26:59.363
we're dealing with a patient
that can't be treated.

01:26:59.363 --> 01:27:01.080
And then people
evacuate the facility,

01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.510
potentially spreading
that into the community.

01:27:03.510 --> 01:27:06.330
And so we've detected
that periodically.

01:27:06.330 --> 01:27:09.030
We know there's a lot
that we don't detect.

01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:10.420
And yeah, it's a huge issue.

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:13.890
I mean, we've all discussed
the issues of access

01:27:13.890 --> 01:27:16.800
to data, which kind of
drives everything and drives

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:17.880
our awareness.

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.590
But the classic mantra
in public health

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:21.465
is, if you don't report
it, it doesn't exist.

01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:27.120
- And I would just
add that there

01:27:27.120 --> 01:27:34.440
are significant pushes to
end TB, and malaria, and HIV.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:37.170
And you know we've been talking
about an explosive epidemic

01:27:37.170 --> 01:27:40.560
event, but actually there
are these very long time

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:42.900
endemic infections that
cause a huge amount

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:44.610
morbidity and
mortality and continue

01:27:44.610 --> 01:27:47.910
to place enormous economic
burden on low and middle income

01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:48.930
settings.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:52.110
Those movements with genomics
and all of the methods

01:27:52.110 --> 01:27:53.490
that we've been
talking about are

01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:56.490
hard for these infections
that have long, chronic latent

01:27:56.490 --> 01:27:57.630
periods.

01:27:57.630 --> 01:28:00.990
But there's certainly
a whole range

01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:03.300
of people who are trying
to push for ultimately

01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:05.610
eradication of those things.

01:28:05.610 --> 01:28:07.980
We've only managed to
eradicate two pathogens.

01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:11.580
We're struggling to do
so for the third, polio.

01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:14.680
But that is definitely
on the agenda,

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.219
I think, for most people.

01:28:16.219 --> 01:28:17.760
It's a really tough
challenge though.

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:20.700
I don't know if Jess, you
want to talk about TB.

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:23.120
- I was just going to mention
that genomics as well.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.380
Although it's very
hard to detect TB

01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:27.210
through case detection
just because it

01:28:27.210 --> 01:28:29.661
is this chronic pathogen.
We can trace back

01:28:29.661 --> 01:28:32.160
by looking at the genomics and
trying to understand patterns

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:32.760
of spread.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.040
And that, again, speaks
to health care capacity

01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:36.630
and where you need
reinforcements.

01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:39.030
So it is a hidden
epidemic but it's one

01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:42.102
that we are using the lens
of things like, I mean,

01:28:42.102 --> 01:28:43.560
to use the big data
buzz word again

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.351
is being used to approach
these challenges.

01:28:45.351 --> 01:28:46.750
[MUSIC PLAYING]

01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:49.174
- OK, we're getting
flashing red lights.

01:28:49.174 --> 01:28:51.090
I'd like to thank all
the speakers once again.

01:28:51.090 --> 01:28:54.440
[APPLAUSE]
