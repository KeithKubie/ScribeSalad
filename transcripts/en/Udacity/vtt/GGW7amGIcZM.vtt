00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.000
So one of the other important things to notice about this

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500
pairing that we see after lining the chromosomes up, is that

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.410
we have two copies, because we get one from Mom and

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.330
one from Dad. So if we look in each pair here, one

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.310
of the copies of this pair of chromosomes came from Mom

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.620
and one came from Dad. And the same is true for the

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.780
next pair, and the next pair, and the next pair, right

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.190
on down the line. Obviously at this point it's important for us

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.430
to have some kind of naming system so

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.000
we know which chromosome is which. We actually number

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.010
the chromosomes in order from biggest to smallest. So

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.320
that the biggest chromosome pair, they're both called chromosome

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.560
one. And then chromosome two, chromosome three, four,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.330
five, and six, and right on down the line.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.290
So in this case, if I say" Hey, let's

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.290
look somewhere at chromosome 13," I know immediately that

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.070
I'm interested in that pair right there. Or, if

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.920
I'm interested in chromosome, let's say eight. I know

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.760
to look right there. But there's actually something missing

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.260
right here. And I don't know if you noticed it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.030
yet, but look really closely, something is not right

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.500
about our line up. So what's wrong with this picture

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.670
here, take a look and see if you can

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.480
figure out what it is, and then type whatever answer

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.130
you think it is into the text box.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.780
I'll give you one hint There's something missing. So

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.280
see if you can figure out what it is and write it in this text box here.
