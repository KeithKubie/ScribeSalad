MENG TAN: My dear
friend Daniel Goleman

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.970
is one of the world's most
recognized experts on topics

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.510
relating to emotion
intelligence.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.450
He is also an amazing author.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.110
He has written more than ten
books, and his book "Emotional

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:22.760
Intelligence," that
one book alone,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.950
sold more than 5 million copies.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.475
He has received
many awards, and he

00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:32.189
has been nominated twice
for the Pulitzer prize.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.280
On a personal level, Dan is
also the person most responsible

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.790
for me becoming an author.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.080
So back in 2007, Dan
and I, with a bunch

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.310
of distinguished friends,
co-created something

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.100
called "Search Inside
Yourself," which is

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.190
became a very popular
curriculum in Google and beyond.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.080
And I remember in
2009, Dan and I

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.720
were taking a walk right there.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.490
I remember the exact
place and exact time.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:00.865
We were taking a
walk where I was

00:01:00.865 --> 00:01:03.210
trying to convince him to
write a book on "Search

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.810
Inside Yourself."

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.430
And what he told me was,
he said, I'd love to do it.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.170
I just don't have the time.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.420
And then he looked at me,
he pointed his finger at me,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.770
and said, Meng, why
don't you write the book?

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.330
I was like, me?

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.100
I'm an engineer, not a doctor.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.970
Dammit, Jim.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.840
Eventually, because of Dan's
support and his confidence

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.270
in me, I did end
up writing a book.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.640
So thank you so much, Danny.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.340
I'm really excited
about Dan's new book,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.560
"Focus-- the Hidden
Driver of Excellence."

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.770
Skillfulness over
attention is the foundation

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.080
of all higher cognitive
and emotional abilities.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.780
Attention creates the conditions
for personal excellence.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.150
Attention is so important that
in "Search Inside Yourself,"

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.970
it is the first thing we train.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.810
The first thing we
train is attention.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.080
Yet I think the
subject of attention

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.350
itself is not getting enough
attention, ironically.

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.490
And I cannot think of anybody
better to write a book

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.940
on an important topic as Dan.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.550
So my dear friends--
my dear friend, Danny,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.540
I'm delighted that
you wrote this book.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.010
And I'm delighted
that you didn't

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.550
ask me to write the book.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.820
My friends, please
welcome my friend,

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.307
and Google's
friend, Dan Goleman.

00:02:31.307 --> 00:02:32.390
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Thank you.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.286
That's sweet.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.290
I'm always happy
to come to Google.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.660
2007, that reminded
me of something.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.070
In 2007, there was a short
squib in "Time" magazine.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.450
And it said, there's a new
word in the English language.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.800
The word is "pizzled."

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.700
It's a combination of
"puzzled" and "pissed off."

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.010
And it describes how you feel
when the person you're with

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.020
takes out their BlackBerry and
starts talking to someone else.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.420
Think about that.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:10.810
Both things have died.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.120
That word and BlackBerry too.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.620
Things change quickly.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.870
That says something.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.140
I remember when I went around
to publishers and said,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.010
I'd like to write a
book about attention.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.900
One of them said, that's great.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.290
Keep it short.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.930
Because I think attention is
a capacity-- a vital capacity,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.460
as Meng was hinting-- that's
really under siege today.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.770
I'm most worried about
our kids, actually,

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.700
but I think we all
are kind of victims.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.820
Here's something
rather provocative.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.510
Herbert Simon,
Nobel Prize winner,

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.200
said, "What
information consumes is

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.110
the attention of its recipients.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.920
Hence, a wealth of
information creates a poverty

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.880
of attention"-- to the
extent that you understand

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.910
that there are two
kinds of attention.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.970
There's the attention that
we voluntarily direct,

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.227
and there's the attention
that seduces us.

00:04:12.227 --> 00:04:14.310
There are actually different
systems in the brain.

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.980
One is a top down system
from the prefrontal area.

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.820
This is when we decide to
concentrate on our work.

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.710
We're applying that
kind of attention.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.860
But then there are
the little seduction--

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.280
the endless seductions.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.800
And there are more and
more and more of them.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.220
I get-- I'm writing away on my
book and I get a little pop-up,

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.500
you've got an email.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.020
That's a seduction.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.770
That's an intrusion
in sustained focus.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.830
And because of the
excellence of our technology

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.680
and the cleverness of people
who design technology--

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.260
some of whom are
right in this room,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.090
I just realized--
our attention needs

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.510
to be paid more attention to if
we're going to maintain or even

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.450
increase our capacity for it.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.804
This also-- the fact that
attention is threatened,

00:05:09.804 --> 00:05:12.470
along with the fact that there--
in the last two or three years,

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.590
there's been an explosion
of neuroscience findings

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:17.570
about the attentional
circuitry, which

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.120
has vast implications for us.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.710
This has really, since
I'm a science journalist,

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.940
enticed me to write the book
that Meng refused to write,

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.560
perhaps luckily, now
that I think about it.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.280
And as I got into
it, I realized I

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.469
had to rethink
emotional intelligence.

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.760
You didn't mention that
"Harvard Business Review" art--

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.360
yeah, the next issue of
"Harvard Business Review," which

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.070
will be out next week,
has a cover article by me

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.040
on the leader's focus,
the kind of focus,

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.020
intentional capacities, that
anyone who's a leader needs.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.550
And we're actually all leaders.

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.430
I think of leaders as anyone
with a sphere of influence--

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.400
not people on the
chart, necessarily.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.120
But to the extent
that we all need

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.600
to get more control
over our attention,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.720
and it makes us good
at the things that

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.950
matter in performance
these days,

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.380
it's led me to revise
emotional intelligence,

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.430
or my thinking about it.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.410
And I'll share that with you.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:23.970
There's an effect called--
in statistics, many of you

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.060
are probably familiar with
it-- the floor effect.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:27.840
It occurs at a
place like Google.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.070
It occurs at an
Ivy League college.

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.040
It occurs anywhere, for
example, that there's

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.530
a premium put for
admission on IQ.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:37.680
And it's an
interesting phenomenon,

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.610
because it's rather paradoxical.

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:44.320
What it means is that IQ,
which is a fantastic predictor

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.579
of the level of cognitive
complexity that you can manage,

00:06:47.579 --> 00:06:49.620
and that you can understand--
and therefore sorts

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.940
people into job roles
and so on-- abilities.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.300
Once you get selected
for IQ, then excellence

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:04.130
becomes defined largely
by things other than IQ.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.780
And it's because of
the floor effect.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:10.690
And are you all familiar
with the floor effect?

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.920
OK.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:20.880
So a little statistic-- so
if you were to plot, say--

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.370
how's this going to be?-- IQ
and emotional intelligence

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.250
into a scatter plot, you get
a fairly random distribution,

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:32.740
because those are largely
independent aspects of ability,

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.060
and they partake of different
parts of the brain, largely.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.850
So you have this pool of people.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:46.300
And if this is the IQ axis, and
you select the 99th percentile,

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.870
and this is the emotional
intelligence access,

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.800
there's much less range
of variation for IQ

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.620
than there is for
emotional intelligence.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.150
And the way this manifests in
the organizational world more

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:01.030
generally is that if you
look at what's called

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:03.410
a competence model--
does anyone know

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:04.550
what a competence model is?

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:06.720
Another term I should explain.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:08.690
So when I was a
graduate student,

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.550
my professor at Harvard, David
McClellan, wrote an article.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:12.870
It was very controversial.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:14.790
He said, if you want
to hire the best

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.120
person for a job, any
job in any organization,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.340
don't look at their IQ.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.910
Don't look at their GPA.

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:22.970
Don't look at their
personality profile.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:25.650
Look at people in your
own organization who

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:27.880
hold the role you're hiring for.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.890
Identify the top 10% by
whatever metric makes

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.130
sense for that job,
compare them systematically

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.610
to people who are only
average in that role,

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.960
and determine the
competencies or ability

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.570
set that you find in
the stars that you

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.450
don't find in the average.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.710
That's now called
competence modeling.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.210
And it's done by world
class organizations,

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:52.450
pretty much worldwide.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.430
And what's interesting about
competence model-- at least

00:08:55.430 --> 00:09:00.090
what interests me-- is if you
aggregate many different models

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.590
and they're all independently
derived-- they're proprietary,

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:05.510
actually, because a company
or organization wants

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:08.315
to know for competitive
reasons, what

00:09:08.315 --> 00:09:09.890
should we look for in our hires?

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:11.670
What should we promote for?

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.910
What should we
develop in people?

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:15.560
And they want to
hold that closely.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:19.320
But I aggregated
100 or 200 models

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.840
after I wrote "Emotional
Intelligence," the follow-up

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.780
book.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:27.540
And I only looked
at two dimensions

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.160
in the competence models.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.270
One was, if you look at the
distinguishing competencies--

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.110
not the entry
level competencies,

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:39.170
but distinguishing, the
ones that mark the stars--

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:42.240
and you separate them in terms
of purely cognitive abilities,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.340
like IQ or technical skills, and
on the other side of the ledger

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.980
you have emotional
intelligence--

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.410
which is how we manage
ourselves and how

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.220
we manage our
relationships-- it turns out

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:57.800
that for leadership,
about 80% to 90%

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.356
of the competencies
independently identified

00:10:00.356 --> 00:10:01.980
are on the emotional
intelligence side.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.570
Well, that makes sense,
because leadership is not

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.810
about being the smartest
person in the room.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:10.480
It's about helping other
people be as smart as they can,

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.020
which is a people skill.

00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:17.660
And so emotional intelligence
has four parts-- self

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.270
awareness, self management,
empathy, and social skill.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:24.860
And when I looked at that
through the lens of attention,

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:30.280
I realized that the first
and third components, self

00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:34.330
awareness and empathy, are
varieties of attention.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.330
And social skill,
actually, is a combination

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.190
of how we manage
ourselves and what

00:10:40.190 --> 00:10:42.390
we read in the other person.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.960
So managing ourselves
turns out to be

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.900
based on how aware
we are of ourselves.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.630
So I revised the model.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:55.780
I'll walk you through some
of that in looking at-- well,

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.439
I'm going to share with you
this article that is coming out

00:10:58.439 --> 00:11:00.230
next week in the "Harvard
Business Review,"

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:02.680
so you don't have to
buy it because you got

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.280
the "Reader's Digest"
version already.

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:11.000
So the first ability, or set
of abilities-- inner focus,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.810
I call it, which is being aware
of what's going on inside you.

00:11:15.810 --> 00:11:19.520
And that's exactly what
you're teaching, Meng,

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.080
in "Search Inside Yourself."

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.940
You're teaching self-awareness.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.010
And by the way, I see every
variety of meditation,

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:29.200
including mindfulness, as
a retraining of attention.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.050
If you strip away
the belief system

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.640
of any meditation from any
tradition in the world,

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.680
you find an
attentional mechanism

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.462
is being strengthened.

00:11:38.462 --> 00:11:39.670
Would you do agree with that?

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:40.170
Yeah?

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:41.620
Yeah, exactly.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:47.410
So for self-awareness,
self-awareness

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:52.220
is really important in many
rather surprising areas

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.640
of life, I think.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.510
I have a friend-- I
grew up in the Central

00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:01.060
Valley of California, in the
horrible midwest of California.

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:01.840
Don't stop there.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:04.690
Just keep going to
Lake Tahoe, really.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.120
And there was a
guy who lived down

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.590
the road in the next town who
I got to know pretty well.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.870
He was a really bad student.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.990
He almost flunked
out of high school.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.030
He managed to go to a
community college, found

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.220
his way to a film course.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.760
He loved film.

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.530
So he got into a film school.

00:12:25.530 --> 00:12:27.600
He did pretty well--
did a student film that

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.520
caught the attention
of a director, got

00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:31.460
hired by the director.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:32.920
The director liked
his work so much

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.130
that he let him direct a film.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:37.610
He did so well with
that that they let him--

00:12:37.610 --> 00:12:41.410
a studio actually backed him
to direct a script that he had

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.180
written before, when
he was much younger.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:48.850
That one did so
well that a studio

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.580
wanted to back him
to do another script.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:56.930
But he hated the fact that
the studio had final cut.

00:12:56.930 --> 00:13:00.400
That meant-- he considered
himself a creative artist,

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.920
and he hated what they
did in the final edit.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.144
So he said, no way am I
going to take that money.

00:13:05.144 --> 00:13:07.310
I'm going to use the money
that I got from the film,

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:08.480
finance it myself.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:11.530
Everyone he knew in Hollywood
said, you are crazy.

00:13:11.530 --> 00:13:13.540
You do not risk your
own money on a film.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:17.450
He did it anyway,
ran out of money.

00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:22.900
Only the 11th bank he went to
gave him the money to finish.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:24.930
You have seen that film.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.230
"Star Wars."

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:33.310
George Lucas is someone
who considers himself,

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.410
and considers himself,
first an artist.

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.190
The factory he stumbled
into Lucas Film

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:43.720
was an accident of his
living by his values.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.120
And one of the strengths
of good self-awareness

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.770
is that it helps us
answer the question,

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:52.970
is what I'm about
to do in keeping

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:57.060
with my sense of purpose,
value, and meaning or not?

00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.730
And the way it does
it is by tuning us

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:02.980
into subtle signals that
come from the bottom-up part

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:06.470
of the brain-- which is
involuntary, automatic, and out

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:09.870
of awareness for the most
part-- which also holds much

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.100
more information
than the top-down.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.530
And parts of that brain
as we go through life

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.710
extract decision
rules-- when I did

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.010
that, that worked pretty well.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.020
When I said that, that bombed.

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.020
And when we face
a decision point,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:27.930
it summates that information
for us and presents its advice.

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:29.020
Problem.

00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:31.880
It has no direct
circuitry to the part

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:34.260
of the brain thinks in words.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:39.130
It has extensive circuitry to
the gastrointestinal tract.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.260
You get a gut feeling-- feels
right or doesn't feel right.

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:45.870
Then we put it in words,
after we get the gut feeling.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:49.600
So George, I assume,
had a very strong gut

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.870
feeling-- I just
can't do it that way.

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:55.160
This is an ethical
rudder for us.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:01.910
Howard Gardner, a friend
of mine at Harvard,

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.700
studies what's
called "good work."

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.820
Good work combines
our best skills--

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:12.390
what we're excellent at--
with what we love doing,

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:15.470
what engages us,
and what we believe

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:19.280
in-- our sense of ethics,
values, purpose, and meaning.

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:23.930
In good work, when you align
excellence, engagement,

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:28.990
and ethics, you have something
to do that you love doing,

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:30.290
that it's a pleasure to do.

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:33.920
In fact, it gets you
in an attentional state

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.100
which is the state
where-- it's called

00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.140
the state of maximal
cognitive efficiency,

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.650
or maximum neural harmony.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:46.727
Simple schematic.

00:15:46.727 --> 00:15:47.560
This is performance.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.590
And this is stress
hormones in the brain.

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:04.560
And the relationship between
stress and performance

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.270
is very well known
in psychology.

00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:07.560
It's curvilinear.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.070
It's an inverted "u."

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.930
If you have good work, you're
very likely to be up here.

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:17.580
This is the state some of
you may know literature on.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.430
It's called flow.

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.820
The flow state was determined
to-- was actually identified

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.770
by researchers at the University
of Chicago who asked people

00:16:26.770 --> 00:16:31.400
in many, many areas of
competence and of work

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.395
to describe a time you outdid
yourself-- you were absolutely

00:16:35.395 --> 00:16:37.730
at your best.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.510
And they asked chess
champions and they

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.470
asked basketball player and
they asked neurosurgeons.

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:44.870
It didn't matter who they asked.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:48.330
They're all describing the
same phenomenological state.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:52.660
There was a neurosurgeon
who described

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:55.365
a very difficult, challenging
piece of surgery he had to do.

00:16:55.365 --> 00:16:57.740
He didn't know if he could
pull it off before he started,

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.350
but he did it brilliantly.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:01.880
At the end of the
surgery, he looked around

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.740
and there was a little
rubble in the corner.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:04.960
He said to the
nurse, what happened?

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.810
She said, well, while
you were operating,

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:10.000
the ceiling caved in over
there, but you didn't notice.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.339
You were so concentrated.

00:17:12.339 --> 00:17:16.430
It's 200% concentration
in a flow state.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.319
And one of the
pathways to flow is

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:22.650
through developing and
enhancing concentration.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:24.520
Other elements of
concentration--

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:28.020
it calls on your best skills.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.000
You're challenged at the
top of your skill set.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.446
Another, you're
totally adaptable.

00:17:32.446 --> 00:17:33.320
You're very flexible.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:34.694
Whatever happens,
you can change.

00:17:34.694 --> 00:17:38.640
You're not set in some
rigid behavior pattern.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:42.280
Another element of flow that's
very important-- it feels good.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.420
The things we
choose to do in life

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:47.780
generally are things that
get us in some kind of flow

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:50.010
or micro-flow.

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:55.870
Flow is also where people
work at their best.

00:17:55.870 --> 00:18:02.150
Now, the state down here
is basically boredom.

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:08.070
Because you're under--
you have a skill

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:11.120
set-- you may be a
fantastic programmer,

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:15.290
but you're driving a
taxi or whatever it is.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.325
So you're under-challenged.

00:18:17.325 --> 00:18:19.390
You're disinterested
at what you're doing.

00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.390
Actually, I doubt that
it's true here at Google,

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.130
but in the working
world at large,

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.480
disengagement-- which is what
this is called by HR people--

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.560
is an enormous problem.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.690
People will just do
enough to keep their job.

00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:31.980
They're not interested.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:33.250
They're not engaged.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.750
It's not good work.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.090
However, what they
do here is daydream.

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.920
And daydreaming is
another attentional state

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.150
that has value.

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.650
Every kind of attention
has a purpose and a place.

00:18:44.650 --> 00:18:47.260
It's when they're out of
place they're a problem.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.610
Daydreaming, it
turns out, is what

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:52.320
the brain chooses to
do 50% of the time.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.350
There was a study--
psychologists at Harvard

00:18:56.350 --> 00:19:01.150
gave people an iPhone
app that called them

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:05.470
at random times of the day
and asked them two things,

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:10.010
what are you doing now, and
what are you thinking about?

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:12.720
In other words, is your
mind somewhere else?

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.010
Are you daydreaming?

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.100
That's the 50% data.

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:21.065
The most daydreaming was when
people are commuting, sitting

00:19:21.065 --> 00:19:23.023
at a computer terminal--
I'm sure it's not true

00:19:23.023 --> 00:19:25.970
of the people in this
room, but other people.

00:19:25.970 --> 00:19:29.330
And work, generally.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:31.280
The most focused?

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:32.850
When people are making love.

00:19:32.850 --> 00:19:36.480
Who would answer an app
at a time like that?

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:39.150
This is just totally
puzzling to me.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:43.080
It happens.

00:19:46.254 --> 00:19:48.170
So these are two different
attentional states.

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:55.720
The third is when
people are stressed out.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:57.870
There's actually an
article about this.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.420
By the way, this
axis-- the metric

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:02.670
for this is the levels
of stress hormones,

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.890
particularly adrenaline
and cortisol, in the brain.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.040
So if you're way
up here, it means

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.920
you're having what's
called an amygdala hijack.

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:14.160
The amygdala is the part
of the emotional brain

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.930
which is the radar for threat.

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:19.020
Our amygdalas right now
are answering the question

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:23.130
amygdalas have asked
all through evolution.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.770
And it is, am I safe?

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:26.020
Is there a danger?

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:27.950
That's what the
amygdala cares about.

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.700
The brain, you have to remember,
was designed for survival.

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:35.030
The neocortex, the part of the
brain that we use all the time,

00:20:35.030 --> 00:20:37.610
that was like a later--
it's still a beta.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:42.540
That was added way later
in evolutionary history.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:46.190
And in fact, the brain
is designed still

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:49.520
to give precedence to
the survival mechanisms.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.240
So if the amygdala
thinks there's a threat,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.580
it can hijack the rest of
the brain, particularly

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.340
the prefrontal area, the part
of the brain we take pride

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:00.500
in-- the part of the brain
that manages attention.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.650
And the amygdala has
a privileged position

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:04.680
in the brain.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.110
One neuron-long connection
from the ear, from the eye,

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:09.370
from the senses.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:12.520
So if gets an instant
picture of what's going on.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.540
There's a problem.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:15.500
I don't know if many
people in this room

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.610
are old enough to remember
when television had static.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:19.709
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:21:19.709 --> 00:21:21.750
DANIEL GOLEMAN: You remember
the non-digital era.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:22.540
Some people do.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.560
OK.

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:26.240
So that's what the
amygdala's looking at.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.110
It has a staticky picture,
because most of the signal

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:32.070
actually does go up to
the top of the brain.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:36.290
But the amygdala has a
hair-trigger mechanism.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:41.550
It has a kind of "rather be
safe than sorry" point of view.

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.120
So it calls emergencies when
actually there's not really

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.400
an emergency.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.700
And just to
complicate it, we now

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:55.260
live not in the biological
reality, where there are saber

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:57.290
toothed tiger type
threats, but we

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.090
live in a complex
social reality.

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.200
So the amygdala
is misinterpreting

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:05.600
social signals-- or
interpreting them.

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.770
That guy's not
treating me right.

00:22:07.770 --> 00:22:08.950
That's unfair.

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.610
The amygdala is
very childlike too.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:13.920
So the amygdala
might have a reaction

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.440
like, this guy's not
treating me fair.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.220
I'd like to slug him.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.540
That's the way the
amygdala thinks.

00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:22.670
So the good news
is that that signal

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.280
goes from the midbrain up
to the prefrontal area.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.680
And the prefrontal area
brings together information

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.910
from all parts of the brain.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.605
So it might add something like,
oh, but this is your boss.

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.020
So you don't hit him.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.044
You smile and change the
subject or something.

00:22:41.044 --> 00:22:42.585
That's called
emotional intelligence.

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:49.840
So people who are in this
state-- which, were there

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.540
was an article in "Science"
about that state called

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:55.540
"The Neurobiology of Frazzle."

00:22:55.540 --> 00:23:01.160
People who are frazzled have
an attentional hijack going on,

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:03.130
because one thing
the amygdala does

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:06.500
is redirect attention to
whatever's upsetting us.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.030
If you're having a
problem in a relationship,

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:12.790
you're going to be thinking
about that problem at times

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.080
that you might want to be
thinking about something

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.060
else-- like 2 AM, when
you want to be sleeping.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:19.380
That's the amygdala.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.930
It forces our attention
away from where

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:26.570
it might be if we were here to
what it is that's upsetting us.

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:28.610
It also reshuffles memory.

00:23:28.610 --> 00:23:30.340
Memory is in a hierarchy.

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:33.170
So when you're having a
fight with your partner,

00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:37.190
you can't really remember so
well why am I with this person.

00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:40.300
That's how the amygdala works.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:45.500
So this is an attentional state
which is very inefficient,

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.250
particularly when
people ruminate.

00:23:47.250 --> 00:23:49.860
There's a difference
between constructive worry

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:51.080
and rumination.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:55.120
Rumination is thought loops you
can't stop thinking about that

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.960
are upsetting, and you go over
the same thing over and over.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.170
Constructive worry is
when you think about it--

00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.920
the amygdala wants you
to think about it--

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:04.670
and you come up with
something you can do.

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:06.980
And then you stop the thought.

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.990
You can go back to having
more voluntary control

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.620
over attention.

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:15.920
So those are three very
important kinds of attention.

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.120
I want to call your attention
to one aspect of this

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.180
that I think is really crucial,
particularly for kids today.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.110
And that is the voluntary
ability to get here.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:30.980
It's called "cognitive control."

00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:35.230
When you do mindfulness, you're
amping up cognitive control.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:36.920
Just mainly for
your information,

00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.510
yesterday I was in Chicago.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.710
And I gave a talk,
and Roger Weissberg

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:44.800
was there from the Collaborative
for Social Emotional Learning.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:49.390
And he said he really sees this
as a next step, the integration

00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.970
of, basically,
attentional training

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:54.530
with emotional intelligence.

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:57.590
So cognitive control
is talked about,

00:24:57.590 --> 00:25:00.050
depending on people's
point of view,

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:01.540
in a lot of interesting ways.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:06.650
Sometimes it's called the
delay of gratification,

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:11.300
the allocation of attention,
working memory, the resistance

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.660
to distractions, impulse
inhibition, goal focus,

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.260
and learning readiness.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.400
The level of cognitive
control in a young child

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:24.650
determines how well he
or she can pay attention

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.500
to what the teacher is saying,
to the textbook, to the lesson.

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.910
It's absolutely essential
for comprehension.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:34.540
And there's a bell
curve for this.

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.730
One of the first tests of
cognitive control-- actually,

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.480
the most famous--
was done very near

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.300
here, at Stanford,
in the Bing Preschool

00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.350
there, which is on campus.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:49.240
And they brought four-year-olds
in, sat them down

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:54.360
at a little table, put a big,
juicy marshmallow on the table,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.660
and experimenter says, you
can have this marshmallow

00:25:57.660 --> 00:25:59.080
now if you want,
but if you don't

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:01.060
need it till I run an
errand and come back,

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.970
you can have two then.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.010
And then she leaves the room.

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:09.630
This is a predicament that tries
the soul of any four-year-old,

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.580
I promise you.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:12.410
I've seen videos.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.790
Some go and lick it
and then jump back,

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.300
like it's a dangerous thing.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:18.070
Some just sing and
dance-- you know,

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:19.850
sing to themselves to
distract themselves.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.210
About a third can't stand it.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:24.430
They just gobble it
down on the spot.

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.150
Another third wait the endless
10 minutes or whatever and they

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.232
get the two.

00:26:29.232 --> 00:26:33.060
The payoff finding
comes 14 years later,

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.530
when they're tracked down and
the two groups are compared,

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:38.570
the ones who grabbed
and the ones who waited.

00:26:38.570 --> 00:26:41.200
And it turns out the
ones who waited still

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.630
can delay gratification
in pursuit of their goals,

00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:46.120
which is what that's a test of.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.960
But more interestingly, they
have a 210 point advantage

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.360
out of 1600 points on the SAT.

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.129
Now the SAT is an
achievement test,

00:26:55.129 --> 00:26:56.670
it's a test of what
you have learned.

00:26:56.670 --> 00:26:58.560
It's not an IQ test.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.850
And when I told
this to the people

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:04.630
at Princeton that make the
SAT, they were stunned.

00:27:04.630 --> 00:27:09.200
Because they said, that's
bigger than the difference

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.400
that we see between kids
who come from a family where

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.280
parents have only an elementary
school education and those

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.650
where one parent at least
has a graduate degree.

00:27:20.650 --> 00:27:25.220
But these are all children of
people at Stanford University.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:29.800
So what's emerging is
that cognitive control

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:35.290
is an independent asset-- the
ability to pay attention well.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:39.010
This was really
nailed by a study done

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:43.020
in New Zealand, where they took
every child born in a city-- I

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.390
think 1,037 children--
over one year,

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:47.790
between ages four and eight.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:50.850
They tested them rigorously
for cognitive control.

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:54.020
And then they tracked them
down when they were 32.

00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.610
You can only do
this in New Zealand.

00:27:56.610 --> 00:28:00.550
Do not try this in Silicon
Valley, I assure you.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:06.170
And what they found was that
a child's cognitive control

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:12.620
between four and eight predicted
that child's financial success

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:17.650
and health in their
mid 30s better than IQ

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:22.650
or the socioeconomic status
of the family they grew up in.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.410
Think about that.

00:28:24.410 --> 00:28:26.830
It's very, very compelling.

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.710
And it's made me feel-- that
and many other findings--

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.700
that we should be
paying more attention

00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:34.140
to this aspect of
attention for children.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.180
It should be part of education.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:39.300
Because in the study
in New Zealand,

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.590
they found that children
who between foreign eight

00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:45.670
managed to boost their cognitive
control had the same benefits.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.570
And one of the
conclusions was that, yes,

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:49.190
we should teach this to kids.

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:52.580
And in fact, if we
taught it to all kids,

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.980
it would help the
productivity of the economy.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:00.820
People would be much more
effective in their work.

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.950
So there are a number
of ways to do it.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:06.135
One of them I find
really interesting.

00:29:06.135 --> 00:29:09.940
I visited Sesame Workshop.

00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.110
Sesame Workshop is where they
put together "Sesame Street."

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:18.300
The day I visited,
they're having a meeting

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:20.350
where all the
writers were meeting

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.700
with two cognitive scientists.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.680
Because it turns out that
every segment of Sesame Street

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.590
is the translation of a finding
in developmental science

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:33.770
wrapped in entertainment.

00:29:33.770 --> 00:29:37.590
So they told me about one
that's aimed specifically

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:40.090
at cognitive control
in preschoolers.

00:29:40.090 --> 00:29:44.070
It's called "the cookie
connoisseur club."

00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:45.910
I don't know if you've
ever seen Sesame--

00:29:45.910 --> 00:29:48.190
how many people have
seen "Sesame Street?"

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.500
So you may remember Alan.

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:51.320
He has the store
on Sesame Street.

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.220
Alan wanted to establish
the cookie connoisseur

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.670
club, just like a wine club.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.730
You take a cookie.

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:01.560
You examine it to see if
there are any defects.

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.160
Then you sniff it.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.100
And then you take a nibble.

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:09.830
Cookie Monster, of course--
this was meant for him.

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:11.320
He wanted to be in
the cookie club.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.850
But he could not
manage to nibble.

00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:15.630
He only could gobble.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:20.510
So Alan used several
reframes for him.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.220
And the one that worked was
like the marshmallow test.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.410
"Cookie, if you can
just nibble now,

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:28.110
you'll get a lot of good
cookies to eat later."

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.390
And that was the one
that did it for him.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:34.010
That is a lesson in
cognitive control

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:38.130
that's aimed at toddlers,
because the way toddlers learn

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.750
is through modeling.

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:44.260
When little kids watch other
kids or grownups operate,

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.290
their brain is
taking that all in.

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.540
So if they see someone
manifest cognitive control,

00:30:50.540 --> 00:30:53.160
that helps them a little bit.

00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:53.850
Older kids.

00:30:53.850 --> 00:30:59.030
I was in PS 112 in Spanish
Harlem in New York City.

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:03.210
And I watched the kids
who are from a really

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:04.940
impoverished neighborhood.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.470
Is East Palo Alto still poor?

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:08.970
Sort of?

00:31:08.970 --> 00:31:10.160
Not like it used to be?

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:10.660
OK.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.050
So-- anyway, in New
York, it's a-- the kids

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:19.400
there live in a huge housing
project next to the school.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.550
The teacher in this
classroom said, you know,

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.620
the other week, a child
came in really upset.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:25.661
And I said, what's wrong?

00:31:25.661 --> 00:31:27.890
And she said, I saw
someone who was shot.

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:29.640
And she said to the
class, how many of you

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.910
know someone who's been shot?

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:32.690
Every hand went up.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:36.370
That kind of childhood-- very
traumatic, very difficult.

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:39.770
And typically you
would find that kids

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:42.000
who come from such
a chaotic background

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.340
manifest that in classroom.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:46.940
But this classroom was
absolutely calm and focused.

00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.940
And I realized why
when I saw them

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.660
do what they call
"breathing buddies."

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:54.330
Breathing buddies
happens every day.

00:31:54.330 --> 00:31:56.152
Each child goes to
their cubby and gets

00:31:56.152 --> 00:31:58.320
their favorite little
stuffed animal,

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.600
finds a place to lie
down on the floor,

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.980
puts the animal on
their belly, and watches

00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.150
it rise and watches it fall.

00:32:05.150 --> 00:32:07.630
And they count one, two, three
on the inhalation and one,

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.220
two, three on the exhalation.

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:12.210
Basically, it's
training in attention.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.350
When you train the circuitry
for sustained attention,

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.010
you get a "two
for," because it's

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.600
the same circuitry--
it's intertwined

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.660
with the circuitry
the brain uses

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:25.130
to manage distributing
emotions and impulse.

00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:30.070
So that's why you get the
calm along with the focused.

00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:33.050
There's another way to do this.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:34.720
Meng might know about it.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.140
It's from SEL.

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.790
It was developed by a friend
of mine named Roger Weissberg.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.050
It's called "the stoplight."

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:43.880
SEL is Social
Emotional Learning.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.520
Many schools now
across the country

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:47.890
have a curriculum in
emotional intelligence.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.630
Basically in managing
emotions, being

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.390
aware of them, in
empathy, in getting along

00:32:52.390 --> 00:32:53.610
and collaborating.

00:32:53.610 --> 00:32:57.600
The stoplight is on
the wall of every room.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.780
It's a traffic light that
says, when you're upset,

00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.850
remember the stoplight.

00:33:00.850 --> 00:33:02.480
Red light, stop.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:03.670
Calm down.

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:05.387
Think before you act.

00:33:05.387 --> 00:33:07.595
Yellow light, think of a
range of things you could do

00:33:07.595 --> 00:33:10.940
and what the
consequence would be.

00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:13.650
Green light, pick the
best one and try it out.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:17.750
And that's another way to
teach cognitive control.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:21.650
Yet another way, I
had my grandchildren

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:24.700
play the beta version
of a video game that's

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.500
being developed for the iPad
at-- a group at Wisconsin.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.950
Every time you breathe out,
you tap the screen once.

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:35.250
And on the fifth breath
out, you tap it twice.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:37.794
And if you keep
doing that, it gets

00:33:37.794 --> 00:33:40.210
more difficult-- in other
words, the challenge gets better

00:33:40.210 --> 00:33:42.080
and you learn more and more.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:45.280
And secondly, you
get a visual reward--

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.570
like if it's a desert
scene, flowers will bloom.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.350
They loved it.

00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.700
But that is also
explicitly designed

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.810
to teach-- to enhance
cognitive control.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:56.590
And then, of
course, the best way

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:00.620
is what Meng has
developed for us.

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.260
What's that?

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.593
MENG TAN: We developed together.

00:34:02.593 --> 00:34:04.235
DANIEL GOLEMAN: We
developed together.

00:34:04.235 --> 00:34:05.740
I'll give you the credit.

00:34:05.740 --> 00:34:06.450
OK.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:09.075
So that's inner focus.

00:34:09.075 --> 00:34:11.980
Inner focus is
both self-awareness

00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:14.560
and managing our inner
world, particularly

00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.560
our distressing emotions.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.210
The second kind of
focus is other focus--

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.639
knowing what's going on
with people around us.

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.489
There are three
kinds of empathy.

00:34:26.489 --> 00:34:31.357
The first is-- what
time is it now?

00:34:31.357 --> 00:34:32.790
MENG TAN: It's 3:40.

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:34.726
DANIEL GOLEMAN: When
am I supposed to stop?

00:34:34.726 --> 00:34:35.351
MENG TAN: 4:00.

00:34:35.351 --> 00:34:37.500
DANIEL GOLEMAN: You
mean I have 20 minutes?

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.290
Is that right?

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.750
Well, forget other empathy.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:45.190
OK.

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:46.790
So there are three
kinds; cognitive,

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:48.460
understanding how
a person thinks;

00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:51.940
emotional, understanding and
feeling what the person feels,

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:55.560
and feeling with;
and empathic concern.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.590
Empathic concern is
not, I understand

00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:02.610
what's going on in you, but
if you're in pain, if you're

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:05.090
suffering, if you have a need
that I can help you with,

00:35:05.090 --> 00:35:07.400
I'm inclined to
help you with it.

00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.590
It's the basis of compassion.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.310
And compassion,
by the way, starts

00:35:11.310 --> 00:35:14.960
with noticing what's going
on with the other person.

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:18.440
There's a spectrum that runs
from noticing the person

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:21.660
to tuning in to registering
what's happening

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:24.800
within them, empathizing,
and then, if you can help,

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:27.501
doing so.

00:35:27.501 --> 00:35:29.750
And I have a lot more to
say, but it's all in my book.

00:35:33.850 --> 00:35:37.130
Because what I wanted to get
to is the third kind of focus,

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:41.170
because I think it's
very salient here.

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:43.570
And there's a real
problem in the world

00:35:43.570 --> 00:35:47.630
that I think Google, or
the talents in this room

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:52.340
and in this valley,
could really help with.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.150
Outer focus is a
systems awareness.

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:59.000
And I think we all need
to be aware of systems.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.670
It could be
organizational systems.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.020
In an organization,
who do you need

00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:05.130
to influence to
get a decision made

00:36:05.130 --> 00:36:08.620
that you are trying
to put through?

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.290
That's a kind of
systems awareness.

00:36:10.290 --> 00:36:12.270
There are family systems too.

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:15.000
Family dynamics are systemic.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.850
And then there are
the broader systems.

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:20.140
And it's the broader
systems I want talk about,

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:23.880
because it's really a mess.

00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.310
And I don't know if
you know the terms

00:36:27.310 --> 00:36:29.720
"wicked problem" and "mess."

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:33.030
They're actually
technical terms.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:38.180
A wicked problem
is not understood

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.550
until after the
formulation of a solution.

00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.340
It has no stopping rule.

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:44.760
You don't know when you're done.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.310
Solutions to wicked problems
are not right or wrong.

00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:51.570
Every wicked problem is
essentially novel and unique.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:53.450
Every solution to
a wicked problem

00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:55.060
is a one-shot operation.

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.780
There's no chance
for a learning curve.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.030
Now, to compound
a wicked problem,

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:06.234
you have to look at what's
technically called a mess.

00:37:06.234 --> 00:37:09.080
A mess is a wicked
problem that interacts

00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.040
with other wicked problems.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.400
Another characteristic,
there's no authority

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.170
in charge of
solving the problem.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:19.160
The people trying
to solve the problem

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:22.000
are also creating the problem.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.980
And time is running out.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.190
Welcome to the
Anthropocene dilemma.

00:37:29.190 --> 00:37:35.870
The Anthropocene Age started
with the Industrial Revolution

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:40.200
and has been increasing
in ferocity ever since.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:45.050
Geologists use this term
for the current epoch where

00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:51.920
we exist now to describe
the fact that one species is

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:55.370
altering the global
systems that support

00:37:55.370 --> 00:37:58.290
life in the wrong direction.

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:00.580
That's the Anthropocene dilemma.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:04.070
The real dilemma is that there
are three systems operating

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.700
that don't mesh.

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:11.220
One system is--
one domain, rather,

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.780
is human systems-- systems
of energy, transportation,

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:19.290
construction, industry, and
commerce on the one hand--

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:23.660
are systematically degrading
the eight global systems that

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:25.040
support life on the planet.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.839
The poster boy, of
course, is carbon.

00:38:27.839 --> 00:38:29.880
But that's just one of
many, many different kinds

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.830
of problems.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:35.260
The real problem is that
the human brain is not

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:38.360
designed to notice the problem.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:43.130
The human brain does not
have any perceptual apparatus

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:45.350
that lets us directly
perceive this,

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:48.970
because it's too
macro or too micro.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:53.110
I mean, we're-- the human brain
is designed to register, honey,

00:38:53.110 --> 00:38:58.500
we have to talk--
that's threat--

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.750
but not what's actually
happening to the planet.

00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:03.280
The amygdala doesn't care.

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:04.610
It shrugs.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:08.290
So this is a big, big problem.

00:39:08.290 --> 00:39:13.060
And, you know, it puts
us all in the predicament

00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:16.570
of collectively doing
evil, just by living.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:20.910
Because everything we
use has a footprint.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.300
And a footprint is
another way of saying

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.580
it has some level
of destructiveness

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:30.200
for natural systems.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.170
So there's actually
a metric for this.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:34.970
It's called life
cycle assessment.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:36.840
Some of you may
have heard of it.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:41.600
It looks at, for
example, these glasses.

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:42.860
And it says, well, glass.

00:39:42.860 --> 00:39:44.990
In making-- glass
is not a product.

00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:47.190
It's a process.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:51.000
You could start the history of
glass when you get some sand.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.750
And you're going to
mix it with chemicals.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.990
And you're going
to transport it.

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.448
You're going to
bring it to a place

00:39:55.448 --> 00:39:57.730
where you cook it at
a high temperature

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:00.920
for many, many
hours, all of that.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:05.990
At every step along the way, you
can break down what's going on.

00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:08.550
And life cycle assessment does
it in a very fine-tuned way.

00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:11.645
It says there are almost
2000 discrete steps

00:40:11.645 --> 00:40:14.760
in glass, from beginning to end.

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.090
And at each step,
you can analyze

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:22.730
an array of emissions and
impacts on the environment,

00:40:22.730 --> 00:40:26.200
on the health of the people
who are connected with it,

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.595
and on the social well
being of the people that

00:40:30.595 --> 00:40:31.820
are connected with it.

00:40:31.820 --> 00:40:34.740
And the metric--
there's a science.

00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.430
It's called industrial ecology.

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:40.080
It's a combination of
physics, chemistry, biology,

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:42.140
environmental science,
industrial design,

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.890
and industrial engineering.

00:40:43.890 --> 00:40:46.380
They are the ones
who have this metric.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.410
So now there is a way
to analyze precisely

00:40:51.410 --> 00:40:53.510
the damage we do just by living.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:56.700
So I have-- this, by the way, is
the depressing, guilt-provoking

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.530
part of my talk.

00:40:58.530 --> 00:40:59.680
Sorry.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.300
I have a friend who teaches life
cycle assessment at the Harvard

00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.690
School of Public Health.

00:41:04.690 --> 00:41:07.720
He has his students
analyze their footprint.

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.380
And they say to him after, and
it's a very depressing thing

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.800
to do, the world would
have been better off

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:15.910
if I hadn't been born.

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:16.680
Isn't that right?

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.150
And he says, that's
the wrong conclusion.

00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:22.690
He says, instead of just
looking at the footprint,

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.220
we should look at our handprint.

00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:28.540
The handprint takes the
footprinted baseline

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:32.020
and then calculates the
metric for everything

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.960
good we do, everything
that reduces our footprint.

00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:39.190
He says, instead of just moping
around about the footprint,

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:42.240
think about how you can keep
building your handprint.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.090
People can do it.

00:41:43.090 --> 00:41:44.070
Families can do it.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.260
Schools can do it.

00:41:45.260 --> 00:41:47.340
Companies can do it.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.840
There's an aggregate
handprint as well as

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.390
an aggregate footprint.

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:56.170
If we're really responsible
to the generations who

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:59.090
will bear the cost of
how we're living now,

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.550
we would take this
pretty seriously.

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:03.360
And I'm hoping somebody will.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:08.470
My job is to tell you
about it and to tell you

00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:10.300
what I think some
fixes might be.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.940
But really, I don't
have the answer.

00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:15.750
There's a group at Berkeley
and in San Francisco that

00:42:15.750 --> 00:42:17.410
built something
called Good Guide.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:18.910
It's a website.

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:25.370
G-O-O-D-G-U-I-D-E. goodguide.com
evaluates consumer products

00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:30.090
in terms of their
footprint using LCA,

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.870
and compares products against
each other so you can make

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:34.190
a better choice.

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:36.920
There's one called "Skin
Deep" just for personal care

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.700
products.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.210
Personal care products might
have 50 different ingredients

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:42.770
you never heard of.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:46.120
They look in medical
databases to see, well,

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.970
is this a carcinogen?

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:49.770
Is it an endocrine disruptor?

00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:55.540
And it ranks lipsticks, eye
gloss, according to toxicity.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:58.810
Toxicity is one of the
dimensions in this.

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:00.840
And that gives people choice.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.150
I feel it's great
that these exist,

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:05.395
but you have to look them up.

00:43:05.395 --> 00:43:10.020
I would like to see the
cognitive cost of finding out

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:14.740
the impact of what we do
and buy reduced to zero.

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.620
The cognitive cost
is the effort you

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.990
have to make to
find out the data.

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:21.840
So the cognitive
cost is high now,

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:24.700
even though the metric
exists, because people

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:27.140
have to look it up somehow.

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:31.800
It should be-- ideally, it would
be there and evident the moment

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.550
that we are about to
engage in the activity

00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:38.370
or about to buy the product, or
B2B if we're going to purchase

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.960
for an organization from
another organization.

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.850
So one solution is
transparency-- at least,

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:45.580
a partial solution.

00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.770
The second is handprints.

00:43:47.770 --> 00:43:53.020
The third-- I think
we're in this predicament

00:43:53.020 --> 00:43:56.520
because most of the platforms
that are used-- chemically,

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.400
industrial, and so
on-- were invented

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:04.720
before we knew about LCA, before
we thought about consequences,

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:06.740
before it was really a factor.

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.260
The chemicals we
used are largely

00:44:09.260 --> 00:44:11.890
based on petrochemicals.

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:14.270
Well, petrochemicals,
excuse me, suck.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.190
The reason is that oil
and water don't mix.

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.040
They never die.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:22.380
Plastics, bad idea.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.600
Styrofoam, bad idea.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.460
Better idea?

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.510
Two students at
Rensselaer Polytech

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:30.850
invented a styrofoam,
which also never dies,

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:35.760
that is made out of rice
husks and mushroom roots.

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.860
And it works just as well.

00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.495
In fact, General Motors is
using in the dashboard of cars.

00:44:40.495 --> 00:44:42.870
Who knew there was styrofoam
in the dashboard of you car?

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.030
But still, better they use
this than the other kind,

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:48.130
because it decomposes.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:50.490
And we really need to
start thinking along

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:52.170
the terms of bio mimicry.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:54.740
How does nature do
it so elegantly?

00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.080
We do it so crudely.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.780
We could be much better at it.

00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.450
There are wonderful
models everywhere.

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:04.330
So that's another thought I
had about what we could do,

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:06.420
reinvent everything.

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.680
Another thing I'd like to
see is systems education

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.510
for kids in school, so
that this way of thinking

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.360
came naturally to
kids because it's

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.040
embedded in the
curriculum, K through 12.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.940
And LCA is part of your math.

00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.720
You could be--
this whole science

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.900
could be part of all
kinds of courses.

00:45:26.900 --> 00:45:29.840
And the other
solution, I don't know.

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.889
What do you think?

00:45:30.889 --> 00:45:32.430
I'm just leaving
you with a question.

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:39.170
Because, just to wrap it up,
I went to a conference at MIT

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:40.220
on global systems.

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:41.490
And I struck by two things.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:44.660
One was John Sterman, who's
the head of the systems dynamic

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:50.950
unit at MIT, said, our biggest
problem is system blindness.

00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:53.330
And the other was what
the Dalai Lama said.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:56.590
He said, whenever
we face a decision,

00:45:56.590 --> 00:45:59.280
we should ask
ourselves, who benefits?

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:02.670
Is it just me, or a group?

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.940
Just my group, or everyone?

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:10.940
Is it just for now,
or for the future?

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:11.440
Thank you.

00:46:17.654 --> 00:46:20.470
MENG TAN: OK, we have about
ten minutes for questions.

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:21.960
Jordan, do you have the mic?

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:22.850
OK.

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:24.130
So Jordan has access to Dory.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:27.082
He can ask the first
couple questions.

00:46:27.082 --> 00:46:28.790
And then the rest, if
you have questions,

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:30.200
you can queue up behind Jordan.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.950
JORDAN: Hello.

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:38.740
What's the relationship
between focus and creativity?

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.400
Often, if I pour all my
focus into a problem,

00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:43.000
I fail to see better
solutions that

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.605
are obvious when
stepping back a bit.

00:46:45.605 --> 00:46:47.480
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Yeah,
you named the solution.

00:46:47.480 --> 00:46:50.110
Actually, it's the good
side of this state.

00:46:50.110 --> 00:46:51.580
It's daydreaming.

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.130
Because the classical stages
in solving a creative problem

00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.590
are begin with focusing,
with effort, and gathering

00:47:00.590 --> 00:47:02.690
all the information, trying
out all the solutions

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.750
you can think of.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:06.072
And if you're still
baffled, you let it go.

00:47:06.072 --> 00:47:06.780
And you daydream.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.800
You go for a walk.

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.610
You take a shower.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:12.740
The annals of
science and math are

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.550
full of instants where--
for example, a mathematician

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:20.120
grappled with an equation for
years, could not solve it,

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.860
and the answer came to him
as he was getting on a bus.

00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:29.980
Because in that day-dreamy state
where your mind is wandering,

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.980
you have more access
to the bottom-up part

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:36.750
of the mind, which, remember,
registers everything you know.

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:39.120
And that can put together
two discrete elements that

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.080
have never been
combined, but that

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.530
operates in a useful way,
which is a creative product.

00:47:44.530 --> 00:47:46.740
Then, of course, you have
to focus again to execute.

00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.810
That's another-- I mean,
then you need venture capital

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:52.720
and oh my god, it's
like a headache.

00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.639
Did you have another
question, Jordan?

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:56.180
JORDAN: Yeah.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:58.304
Can you give us the
top three points

00:47:58.304 --> 00:47:59.720
from the "Harvard
Business Review"

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.000
article on leadership
and focus, please?

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.510
DANIEL GOLEMAN: That's
what my whole talk was.

00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:11.390
It was that leaders need
the three kinds of focus--

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.940
inner focus to manage
yourself and lead yourself,

00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:18.530
other focus to read
other people effectively

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:21.020
and to be able to communicate
in a way which is persuasive,

00:48:21.020 --> 00:48:24.840
and that motivates and that
has the right impact-- I mean,

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:26.340
you could say the
art of leadership

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:30.720
is helping people get
and stay in this state.

00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:33.040
And the third is the
systems awareness,

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:35.660
because you need that
for strategic thinking,

00:48:35.660 --> 00:48:36.200
for example.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:37.825
You need to understand
what's happening

00:48:37.825 --> 00:48:38.880
with the technologies.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.740
You need to understand what's
happening with the economy.

00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.990
You need to understand
the larger systems

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:46.870
that your organization
operates in.

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:52.390
And so, for example, with
the economic problem,

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:55.110
a lot of companies
promoted people

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:56.910
who were very good at
getting the numbers

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:59.075
but really trampled on people.

00:48:59.075 --> 00:49:02.830
And now they're realizing
that that lack of empathy

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.920
is costing organizations.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:07.920
So what I'm arguing is
that leaders need all three

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.650
in balance.

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:10.620
Will that do?

00:49:10.620 --> 00:49:13.230
JORDAN: One more.

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:17.100
People with ADD are told that
they are most effective when

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:20.090
they follow their impulses,
instead of forcing themselves

00:49:20.090 --> 00:49:22.970
to control their attention
in a top-down manner.

00:49:22.970 --> 00:49:25.760
How does this fit
into your model?

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.390
DANIEL GOLEMAN: So ADD is a
big problem during the school

00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:31.880
years, when there's
a premium on being

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:34.760
able to focus on what the
teacher's saying and so on.

00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:38.220
ADD also means
that people's minds

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.150
wander more, which is why it's
a problem during the school

00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.890
years.

00:49:41.890 --> 00:49:44.270
But it turns out that
people with ADD tend on,

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:47.690
average, to be more
creative than other people.

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:52.354
They are more naturally
entrepreneurs, for example.

00:49:52.354 --> 00:49:54.020
JORDAN: Does anyone
else have questions?

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:56.050
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Someone's
behind you here.

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:58.930
AUDIENCE: So my question
is about cognitive control.

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:01.020
And you mentioned
a lot of studies

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:03.570
where certain children
or certain people

00:50:03.570 --> 00:50:05.880
had better cognitive
control than others.

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:08.449
And my question is, what
factors affect that?

00:50:08.449 --> 00:50:10.490
Do you think it's something
people are born with?

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:14.160
And is it affected by things
like their socioeconomic

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.830
situation, by culture,
by the education

00:50:17.830 --> 00:50:19.050
they've already received?

00:50:19.050 --> 00:50:20.180
DANIEL GOLEMAN: All of it.

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:24.320
In other words,
it's both something

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:29.370
that people have some level
of naturally-- it's innate.

00:50:29.370 --> 00:50:30.230
It's genetic.

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:33.180
But you know, the brain
is plastic through life.

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.250
And the centers for
cognitive control

00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:38.720
are part of the brain that's the
last to develop anatomically--

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.380
doesn't mature
fully till mid 20s.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:44.190
And during that period of
plasticity, roughly childhood

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:47.940
and adolescence, what you
learn, and systematic training,

00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:49.500
has enormous effect.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:53.230
So the basic repetition
for cognitive control

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:55.734
is you focus on one
thing, your mind wanders,

00:50:55.734 --> 00:50:57.650
you notice it wandered,
and you bring it back.

00:50:57.650 --> 00:50:59.220
Does that sound familiar?

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:04.430
And every time you do that,
the neurons for that circuitry

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:06.440
strengthen in
their connectivity.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:09.900
It's exactly analogous to being
in a gym and lifting weights.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:11.410
And every time you
do a repetition,

00:51:11.410 --> 00:51:13.510
that muscle gets
a little stronger.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:16.690
So the more we can
help children and teens

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:18.330
do that-- which
reminds me, I actually

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:23.680
have some instructional CDs
for kids and teens on this,

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:27.430
from morethansound.net,
if anybody's interested.

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:29.200
Because I think
it's very important

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.230
that parents do this for
kids and that schools do it

00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:35.190
for kids.

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:39.000
The more you do it, the better
you get at cognitive control.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.770
Then you asked about chaotic
childhood and all of that.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:44.120
And that is a negative factor.

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.703
That's why I was so impressed
by the school in Spanish Harlem.

00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.200
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:55.000
I'm one of the fortunate
Googlers that has teens.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.370
And I would like to know a
little bit about the amygdala

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:04.970
hijack and the response that
different teens may have.

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:06.870
I have one team
when I think they're

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:10.580
hijacked that goes angry, and I
have another that goes tearful.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:12.970
Is that a relationship
to the amygdala hijack

00:52:12.970 --> 00:52:13.880
or something else?

00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:15.640
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Angry and
tearful, I don't know.

00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.098
There's a wonderful
book coming out

00:52:17.098 --> 00:52:19.630
by Dan Siegel called
"Brainstorms."

00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:22.030
It'll be out December 26.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:24.060
And it's about the
adolescent brain.

00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:27.320
It's actually written for
teenagers and their parents

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.980
to read together.

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.780
But one of the
things he talks about

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:34.650
is the phenomenon that
during adolescence, there's

00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:37.390
a wider discrepancy than
at any other point in life

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.440
between two neural systems.

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:43.210
One is the system for
instant gratification, which

00:52:43.210 --> 00:52:46.860
surges ahead, and the other
is for delaying gratification,

00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.900
which lags a little behind.

00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:52.940
And so individual
teens may differ

00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.450
in the gap between
that circuitry,

00:52:54.450 --> 00:52:57.410
but I've heard a
definition of maturity

00:52:57.410 --> 00:53:00.415
as widening the gap
between impulse and action.

00:53:06.529 --> 00:53:08.320
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much, Mr. Goleman,

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:12.130
for this incredible lecture.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:13.710
I'm wondering with
this structure

00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:16.880
that you have here and
traditional medicine

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:18.860
and what they look
at in the mind.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.590
And as far as I can
tell, being an epileptic,

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:24.920
this really doesn't
apply much to us.

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:28.360
We have cognitive problems that
cannot be corrected and have

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:31.330
been heavily-- heavy
medication has been used.

00:53:31.330 --> 00:53:35.960
I'm on medications that
are very dangerous.

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.850
And I'm working with
a couple neuros,

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:43.090
a Jim Fallon-- I don't know
if you know Jim, he's a guy--

00:53:43.090 --> 00:53:45.510
and I'm told that
I don't have much

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:48.170
of a chance of doing
a lot of this stuff.

00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:51.190
And for me to focus actually
takes a lot of work.

00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:53.920
And I was wondering if you have
any suggestions for epilepsy?

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.560
DANIEL GOLEMAN: I'm not a
neurologist, not a specialist.

00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:01.500
I have friends who are
in the same situation.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:04.290
But I think that-- one of
the things I didn't mention

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:07.680
is that there's a decline in
cognitive control with aging.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:11.580
And they've developed
a set of training tools

00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:16.660
which are web-based to
reverse or slow that process,

00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:19.650
and you might try those,
because the medications are

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:21.670
like a shotgun in the brain.

00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:24.210
They hit many different systems.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:27.540
And the brain still
remains plastic.

00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:30.300
So you can go to the
mental gym and see--

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.331
that just might help
you keep that focus.

00:54:32.331 --> 00:54:33.580
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:36.260
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Good luck

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.380
MENG TAN: With that, for
those of you interested

00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:40.280
in [INAUDIBLE], the
CEO, [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:41.370
is sitting right here.

00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:42.910
Feel free to talk to him.

00:54:42.910 --> 00:54:46.130
The book is "Focus, The
Hidden Driver of Excellence,"

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:47.590
for those in the
room, you can buy

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:48.950
it fom the back of the room.

00:54:48.950 --> 00:54:50.940
Danny will do a book
signing after this.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:54.230
For those not in the room, it's
available where books are sold.

00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:56.910
So with this, "Focus,"
Danny Goleman.

00:54:56.910 --> 00:54:58.260
Thank you, my friends.

00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:00.510
DANIEL GOLEMAN: Thanks, Meng.
