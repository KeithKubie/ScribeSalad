you'll hear a lot about Android devices

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:07.390
you'll hear a lot about Android devices
 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.910
you'll hear a lot about Android devices
but that's just a small part of what

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920
but that's just a small part of what

Android really is when you think about a
 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.040
Android really is when you think about a
device like Android and Android device

that there are ton of devices out there

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:20.290
that there are ton of devices out there
 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.229
that there are ton of devices out there
on the shelf or whatever and you know

00:00:22.229 --> 00:00:22.239
on the shelf or whatever and you know
 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:23.940
on the shelf or whatever and you know
maybe someday each one of those would be

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950
maybe someday each one of those would be
 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.650

running Android you know they all look

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660
running Android you know they all look
 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.330
running Android you know they all look
different they all it would cost

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340
different they all it would cost

different
 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.740
different
they could be a bunch of different

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750
they could be a bunch of different
 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:29.999
they could be a bunch of different
things they'd all be made by different

people but you know one of our goals

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800
people but you know one of our goals
 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.620
people but you know one of our goals
would be to just get Android all over

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630
would be to just get Android all over
 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.840
would be to just get Android all over
the place and we've done that in a bunch

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850
the place and we've done that in a bunch
 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.270
the place and we've done that in a bunch
of different ways mostly by making it so

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280
of different ways mostly by making it so
 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.529
of different ways mostly by making it so
that it's really easy for the industry

00:00:40.529 --> 00:00:40.539
that it's really easy for the industry
 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.630
that it's really easy for the industry
to adopt we've made it free you don't

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640
to adopt we've made it free you don't
 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.209
to adopt we've made it free you don't
have to license it we've done a lot of

00:00:45.209 --> 00:00:45.219
have to license it we've done a lot of
 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:47.459
have to license it we've done a lot of
work making sure that this platform is

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:47.469
work making sure that this platform is
 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:49.770
work making sure that this platform is
viable to the industry manufacturers and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780
viable to the industry manufacturers and
 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.299
viable to the industry manufacturers and
carriers are more likely to adopt the

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309
carriers are more likely to adopt the
 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.250
carriers are more likely to adopt the
whole platform and we make it easy for

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260
whole platform and we make it easy for
 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.470
whole platform and we make it easy for
developers to extend the platform to

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480
developers to extend the platform to
 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.419
developers to extend the platform to
make sure that it stays you know on the

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429
make sure that it stays you know on the
 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:00:58.880
make sure that it stays you know on the
cutting edge of the industry in

something like this there's always this

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469
something like this there's always this
 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.470
something like this there's always this
tension between a product and a platform

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480
tension between a product and a platform
 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.590
tension between a product and a platform
a platform is what enables you to make

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600
a platform is what enables you to make
 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.270
a platform is what enables you to make
all of those things as we built the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280
all of those things as we built the
 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.590
all of those things as we built the
Android platform we've spent a lot of

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600
Android platform we've spent a lot of
 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.940
Android platform we've spent a lot of
time thinking about how it's going to be

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950
time thinking about how it's going to be
 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.100
time thinking about how it's going to be
used in the future there are several

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110
used in the future there are several
 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.160
used in the future there are several
layers in the Android system it's a it's

Linux kernel the system libraries Dahl

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000
Linux kernel the system libraries Dahl
 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.609
Linux kernel the system libraries Dahl
vaq the application framework and then

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619
vaq the application framework and then
 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.020
vaq the application framework and then
all of the applications on top of that

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030
all of the applications on top of that
 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.969
all of the applications on top of that
the Linux kernel has been around for

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979
the Linux kernel has been around for
 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.490
the Linux kernel has been around for
many many years it's tried and true it's

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500
many many years it's tried and true it's
 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.639
many many years it's tried and true it's
used in millions of computers and

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649
used in millions of computers and
 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:34.609
used in millions of computers and
devices but it hasn't really been

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
devices but it hasn't really been
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.429

IP lightweight IPC mechanism and we did

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649
IP lightweight IPC mechanism and we did
 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.580
IP lightweight IPC mechanism and we did
work on just on the scheduler to really
