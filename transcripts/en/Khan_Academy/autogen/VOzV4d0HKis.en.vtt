00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.850
 Let's talk about 

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:03.580
 exocytosis, 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.490
 the process in which the cell 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.690
 releases large molecules, 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.650
 which can be used in other parts of the body. 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.420
 From other cells or as a part 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.720
 of the extracellular matrix. 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.090
 To understand how this process is going, 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.090
 we need to reverse endocytosis 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.490
 and produce 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.090
 proteins 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:21.690
 in the endoplasmic network, 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.120
 this will be a classic example of exocytosis. 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.220
 These proteins will be released in 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.220
 own secretory vesicles (vesicles), 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.390
 which will then merge with the Goldie apparatus. 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 There they will be processed further. 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.990
 Processed in the Goldie apparatus, 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:35.020
 right here. 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.490
 They will then separate from 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.150
 the Golgi apparatus in new secretory bubbles, 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.950
 who will go 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.950
 to the cell membrane, 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.250
 plasma membrane. 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.790
 The membranes of these bubbles 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.120
 will merge with the cellular 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.990
 membrane 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.650
 and thus will separate 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.580
 your content. 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.720
 This is classical exocytosis. 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.750
 There are other cases, 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.120
 in which 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.790
 the bubble may partially merge, separate its contents 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.050
 and to go back, 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.820
 this method of exocytosis is called 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.890
 kiss-and-run. 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.020
 But with the classic method the bubble is 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.790
 merges with the membrane. 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.090
 Lets look 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.050
 this cell membrane, 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.120
 with which the membrane of the bubble has merged. 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.520
 The cell membrane may look like this. 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.750
 If the bubble - 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.390
 I will make the membrane of the vesicle orange. 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.590
 If the bubble membrane is orange, 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.390
 now it merges with the cell membrane 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.420
 and has released its contents. 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.290
 She has separated the protein, 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.220
 which will be used 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.090
 somewhere else in the body. 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.920
 I want to make it clear, 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.590
 this membrane - 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.350
 I talk about it often in 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.190
 many other videos - 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.790
 Although I have painted the membrane as a single line 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.790
 here, 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.190
 it consists of a double phospholipid layer. 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.430
 If we look at it closely, 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.990
 it will look like this. 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.420
 It is a phospholipid double layer. 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.120
 These are some of the phospholipids, 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.620
 which were part of the original 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.090
 cell membrane, 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.750
 but in the box 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.020
 there are also phospholipids from 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.890
 the secretory bubble, 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.250
 in which was the protein. 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.120
 That was part of the secretory bubble, which 

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.320
 stored the protein. 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.020
 I want to pay close attention 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.290
 of these lines, 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.110
 which I paint, 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.820
 they are double layers of phospholipids. 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.090
 All these lines, 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.920
 these membranes you see, 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.320
 they are all double layers of phospholipids. 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.220
 I pay attention to this to make sure, 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.750
 that you imagine things right. 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.450
 This is exocytosis. 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.490
 It is interesting that 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.690
 when you learn about it for the first time, 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.120
 you see her depicted on charts here, 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.750
 and you say to yourself, 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.320
 "Okay, obviously these bubbles 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.090
 with these membranes 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.750
 just sail at random 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.590
 and eventually reach the cell membrane, 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.820
 with which they merge 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.950
 and release their content. " 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.790
 But actually the process is not so chaotic. 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.850
 Indeed, vesicles are on rails, 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.090
 stand on rails. 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.650
 Remember the cytoskeleton, 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.650
 which is not drawn often enough, 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:51.690
 perhaps because it makes the drawings 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.590
 very confused. 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.590
 But when we think of a cage, 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.390
 it has all these structures. 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.220
 Structures such as 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.190
 microtubules, microfibers, 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.520
 intermedia filaments. 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.250
 All of them 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.220
 not just give the structure of the cell, 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.020
 but can be used for transport. 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:07.450
 And the vesicles 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.550
 can "ride" 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.750
 of these structures. 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.960
 We can have 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.550
 motor proteins that use ATP, 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:19.740
 to transport the bubble 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.890
 and its contents. 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.520
 This mode of transport is like 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.020
 factory, 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.450
 which pushes the bubbles to the membrane, 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.150
 to separate their content. 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.720
 The process is remarkable. 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.890
 I always say the cells 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.150
 are universes on their own. 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.890
 They're not just some spots, 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.890
 have all these structures, 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.090
 all these proteins, 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.250
 which are incredibly small, but 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.620
 perform very complex processes. 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.420
 What I showed you is 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.350
 classical exocytosis. 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.680
 You will meet her when the proteins or lipids 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.020
 are produced in the cage 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.690
 and must be separated. 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.980
 Exocytosis is also used 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.710
 in the neurons. 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:58.790
 When chemical signals are 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.720
 transmit from one neuron to another, 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.890
 we have neurotransmitter exocytosis, 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.290
 which trigger the next neuron. 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.920
 These are many, very important processes. 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.410
 Our bodies would not function properly 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.890
 or would not function at all 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.240
 if we had no exocytosis.
