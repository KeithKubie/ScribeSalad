00:00:00.007 --> 00:00:03.480
This sharing is not just
with health providers.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.749
Patient engagement is the key strategy
for preventing and managing diseases.

00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:13.415
Patients in 2010 survey by
the California Health Foundation

00:00:13.415 --> 00:00:17.497
reported that access to their
data improved their care.

00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:21.961
Those using a specific tool,
a personal health record,

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:25.500
reported they knew more
about their health.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.040
They asked their physician a question
they would not otherwise have asked.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.970
They felt more connected
to their physician.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.131
And they actually did something
to improve their health.

00:00:36.131 --> 00:00:41.126
However, the survey also showed
that patient adoption is still low

00:00:41.126 --> 00:00:43.938
with only 1 in 14 having used a PHR.

00:00:43.938 --> 00:00:49.450
And adopters are predominantly young,
highly educated, higher income patients.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.703
A big part of the reason seems to be
patient concerns about privacy and

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:55.693
security of their health data.

00:00:55.693 --> 00:00:58.792
68% of the respondents
said they are very or

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:04.069
somewhat concerned about misuse
of their digital health data.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.940
Keep in mind that PHRs
are cloud-based web tools.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.740
So, it's likely that any well
publicized problems with data misuse on

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.300
the Internet translates into increased
patient concerns about health data

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.880
being stored there.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.320
At least partially as a result,
a 2012 survey showed that

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.990
only 26% of patients want
their medical records to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.800
be digital, with 85% expressing
privacy and security concerns.
