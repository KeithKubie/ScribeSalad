MAN (VOICEOVER): Most of
the cities in Palestine,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.533
they store water on their roofs
to have water in their houses,

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:10.200
because the regular
water is not running.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.300
And this is what we
call "Black Forest."

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.133
Because if you look to
the Palestinian roofs,

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:19.567
it's full with the
black storage tanks.
