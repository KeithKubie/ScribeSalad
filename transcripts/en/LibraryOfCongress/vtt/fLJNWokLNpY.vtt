I'm the Chief of Humanities

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.360
and Social Sciences
Division here at the Library.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.460
On behalf of our division
and the Library

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.050
of Congress I welcome everyone

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.410
to this afternoon's talk
by Dr. Jessica Millward.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.210
The lecture today is part of
our ongoing series of programs

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.450
in the humanities and
social sciences.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.050
Today's program interprets
and promotes an awareness

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.320
of the Library's unique
African American collections.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.870
Other recent examples

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.110
of such programs include a full day
June Teenth book festival symposium

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.900
entitled, "Celebrating African
American Literature, Literacy,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.500 position:56%
and Independent Artists," which
featured Dr. Haki Madhabuti, founder

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.250
and publisher of the
"Third World Press"

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.970
and several other outstanding
literary activists,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.180
the panel discussing "Remembering
Edward Williams Brooks,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.830
1919 to 2015."

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.320
It also included a lecture and book
signing, "Living with Lynching:

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.920
African American Lynching Plays,
Performance, and Citizenship,

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:01.470
1890 to 1930," by Dr. Koritha
Mitchell of Ohio State University.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.640
And a lecture and book signing
for the "Segregated Scholars:

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.250
Black Social Scientists and the
Creation of Black Labor Studies,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.220
1890 to 1950," by Dr. Francille
Rusan Wilson at the University

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.130 position:56%

current president of the Association

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.830
of Black Women Historians.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.380
A number of staff members have been
involved in planning our programs

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.050
and I'd like to just take a moment
to thank them for today's event.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.350
Dr. Sibyl Moses for suggested Dr.
Millward as a speaker, Leroy Bell

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.800
and Darrin Jones of HSS for
their assistance, Wallace Perry,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.770
Office of Business Enterprises,
and Nichelle Wingfield,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.710
Office of Special Programs
and Public Programs.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:57.170
And now, to introduce Dr.
Millward, Dr. Sibyl Moses,

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.510
Reference Specialist for African
American History and Culture.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.710
[ Applause ]

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.910
&gt;&gt; Sibyl E. Moses: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.800
And thank you for your
support and your interest.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.640
It is my pleasure to
introduce Dr. Jessica Millward,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.670
Associate Professor of History
at the University of California,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.980
Irvine, and author of "Finding
Charities Folks: Enslaved

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.360
and Free Black Women in Maryland."

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.960
Can we imagine what life would
have been like for enslaved women

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.420
of African descent in the
nineteenth century of Maryland?

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.400
Will we ever be able to calculate
the number of enslaved black women

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.120
who have been lost to history.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.370
These are the concerns that our
historian scholar has addressed.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.440
Today Dr. Jessica Millward
will share her research

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.280
and her inspiring story
of uncovering, capturing,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.330
and preserving the life and
experiences of Charity Folks,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.870
an enslaved woman from
Annapolis, Maryland,

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.970
and the multiple generations
of folk,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.190
or descendants, of Charity Folks.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.390
Using personal accounts, oral
history, photographs, artifacts,

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.350
and several Library of Congress
collections, as well as collections

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.930
in other repositories,
Dr. Millward shows us

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.770
in her own words how
enslaved women moved across

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.200
and beyond the boundaries
between slavery and freedom,

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.100
and ultimately changed
those boundaries.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.540
And the three words that she
features in her epilogue are faith,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.390
hope, and love as the means
by which they overcame.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.090 position:56%
And for those of us who are familiar

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.300
with even African American
history today we know

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.280
that that is what is sustaining
us: Faith, hope, and love.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.690
Dr. Millward is the recipient of
several awards and fellowships,

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.150
including the Association of Black
Women Historians' Leticia Woods

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.380
Brown Best Article in Black
Women's History prize.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.490
Following this presentation,
Dr. Millward has agreed

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.490
to answer a few questions,
and then please note

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.840
that we are recording this
presentation for the Library

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.410
of Congress' website

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.520
and any questions asked
constitute your permission

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.880
to be recorded, thank you.

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.480
So we are honored to host Dr.
Millward at the Library of Congress

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.300
so please join me in
welcoming her to the podium.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.950
&gt;&gt; Jessica Millward: Okay.

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:02.250
Normally I would ask
if you can hear me

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.590 position:56%
but I guess I'll ask can you see me?

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:04.890
I'm a bit -- .

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:06.190
[ Laughter ]

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:09.000
I want to thank you all
so much for coming out.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.130
This is in some ways it's
a homecoming and a reunion

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.640
because I lived in D.C. for
three years while I was doing

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:16.220
dissertation research.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.580
So I might be having a
little feelings this morning.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.950
This is a bad time for it to
hit me but I'll work through it.

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.770
So thank you to all of those who
made me feel very welcomed today,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.180
especially to the Humanities
and Social Sciences Division.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.900
Thank you to Chief Sanchez.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.150
And I especially want to
thank Dr. Sibyl Moses.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.420
Dr. Moses has been my liaison
and she's my host today.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.080 position:56%
She moved literally heaven and earth

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.010
so that this talk could take
place during Black History Month.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.640 position:56%
This included and was not limited to
processing every item that is needed

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.800
for a talk in a Federal space,
meaning everything had to go

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.040
through three levels
of clearance, or more,

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.820
and they had to go
through very quickly.

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.670
So I do want to give a
heartfelt thank you to her.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.920
A special acknowledgement to the
archivists and reference librarians

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.430
in the main reading room,
the manuscript room,

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.350
the newspaper room,
photographs and prints.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.130 position:56%
I spent a great deal of time in each

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.920
of these rooms researching
these projects.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.920
And also I want to thank all
of you who came today and some

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.830
of you literally were
sitting at the table with me

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:18.920
when I started this project.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.870
And so it's nice to see so many of
you and especially to those of you

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.080
that brought your students so you
can help educate a new generation.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.390
So today's talk, "Finding
Charity Folks: Public Memory

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:36.440
and the Construction of an Enslaved
Biography,"is a play obviously

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.010
on the title of my
recently released book.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.040 position:56%
Charity Folks is a formerly enslaved
woman who lived in Annapolis,

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.570
Maryland, during the time
of the American Revolution.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:47.930
The book uses the fragmented
archive of Charity Folks' life

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:51.060
to give a window into the
ways that slavery, freedom,

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.760 position:56%
and liberation were intertwined in
the lives of African American women.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.790 position:56%
In particular, as Dr. Moses said,
it explores how enslaved women moved

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:02.570
across and beyond the
boundaries of slavery and freedom,

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:05.090
and ultimately changed
those boundaries.

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.630
In the decades following the
American Revolution enslaved women

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.500
such as Charity Folks
acquired freedom by buying it,

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.720 position:56%
by being granted it, by
petitioning it, and then, of course,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.740
by negotiating for it privately.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.690
By accessing manumission, or
that is the act to be free,

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.620
freedom by a legal deed,
enslaved women, as I said,

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:27.150
shifting the boundaries of
freedom in terms of the law,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.030
their communities, their
family, their work,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:30.660
and even their own bodies.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.720
Maryland may have been
typical in the 1880's.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.370
It was typical because it had
a large free black population.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.520
And this tended to happen
in places like Virginia,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.480
in places like South Carolina
where there was an urban center,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.880
number one, and number two, where
slavery was no longer profitable.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.040
Maryland in particular
shifted from tobacco production

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.800
to wheat production and that
doesn't necessarily mean

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.120
that one needed a labor
force for the entire year.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.190
So planters were able to relieve
themselves of enslaved property

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:03.630
by either hiring them
out or freeing them.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.380
But freedom came with
some kind of stipulation

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.940
which I'll discuss in a moment.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.010
So when I looked at
this larger project,

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.330
this genesis actually
happened to be in questions

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.980
of motherhood, resistance,
and slavery.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.240
And so I opened the book
with this very first line:

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.490
"Motherhood during slavery was
the farthest thing from freedom.

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:25.050
For enslaved African American
women freedom, like enslavement,

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.850
was actually tied to the womb."

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.910
And slave women, particularly
in Maryland,

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:31.550
realized that if they
could give birth

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:33.580
to an enslaved child they also,

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.070
because of how the
law was structured,

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.650
could give birth to a free child.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.200
Meaning because the way
the laws were structured

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.030
and because slave holders
were freeing their slaves

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:47.320
in greater numbers, if the
status of a child was written

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.500
down in a document before
the mother gave birth,

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.940
in theory if the owner said they
were going to free that child,

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.420
the child could be born free.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.190
Well, we know that this
didn't always happen.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:00.510
But, for the most part,
Maryland is unique

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.060
because there's this notion
that, as the law was changing,

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:07.950
particularly in 1808, enslaved
women actually had this thought

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.610
that perhaps they could
give birth to free children.

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:15.160
So the gendering of freedom
influenced notions of liberty,

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.840
equality in race in what
becomes this new nation.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.740
And this gendering of freedom
also held long term implication

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.430
for African American women's
interactions in the state which,

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:25.460
hopefully, we can get to.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:27.060
While a singular definition
of freedom

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:30.610
or its manifestations is not really
possible because the conditions

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.430
and experiences of
enslavement were not uniform,

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.580
this study focuses
chiefly on two aspects

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:38.170
of how enslaved people
define freedom.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.380
So in the book I talk about
the historical groundings

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.670
of enslaved women trying to
lobby for their own freedom,

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.320
either negotiating
with their owners,

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.920
or filing petitions,
and what have you.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.380
I don't want to say
the greater story,

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.250
but the story you're here
today to hear is how, in fact,

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:58.450
families influence
the writing of history

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.680
and history influences the
writing of families, okay.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:09.310
So with that said, in this talk
Charity Folks appears as a ghost

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.730
who haunts public memory.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.910
She appears as an embodied subject.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:14.460
She appears as a founding mother.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:17.180
And she appears as a
forgotten ancestor.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.730
So my final thank you this
morning is to Charity Folks

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.050
who has waited a long time
to have her story reclaimed.

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.260
Charity Folks is a ghost of
slavery who refuses to be silenced.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.860
She finds herself in the company of
Margaret Garner's beloved daughter,

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.550
the young girl known only as
Celia a slave, Sarah Baartman,

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:42.090
Sally Hemings, Sojourner Truth,
Queen Nanny of the Maroons,

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:46.170
and countless unnamed women who
haunt historical memory precisely

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.770
because they carry the weight
of the diasporas traumatic past.

00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:52.400
Collectively and individually
their lives testify

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.240
to the multifaceted legacies
of enslavement and attempts

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.630
by captives to dismantle it.

00:11:57.630 --> 00:12:01.140
And they do so without suppressing
the slave system's most violent

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.580
and horrific truths.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.420
The recovered pasts of black women
underscore the competing interests

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:08.150
involved in remembering,
constructing,

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.100
and commemorating their lives.

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:13.630
So Charity Folks isn't as well
known as these other women

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:17.520
but she is no less important.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.630
She was enslaved in
Annapolis, Maryland,

00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:22.330
and she gained her
freedom as an adult.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.670
We know from an 1811 freedom
certificate she was, quote,

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.290
bright mulato and about
52 years old,

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:36.320 position:56%
suggesting she was born around 1759.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.550
She, sorry, one local historian
suggests that she was born

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:44.390
at Belair Plantation, which is
actually ten minutes outside

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.030
of Annapolis.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.860
Oops. Okay, we're going to wait.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.160
Just wait.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.390
It happens all the time.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.810
And what can be deduced from her
life is that she probably worked

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.340
in the home, in the domestic
space, and she lived with --

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:03.580
at least initially at
Belair Plantation --

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.810
she lived with her
mother and her brother.

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.270
Charity Folks gave
birth to five children,

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.140
all of whom gained their freedom.

00:13:10.140 --> 00:13:12.460
And her family line produced
generations of race men

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:15.660
and race women committed to
uplifting African Americans.

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:16.960
Among her descendants are some

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.940
of the most accomplished
African American families

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.170
of the nineteenth and
twentieth century.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:25.160 position:56%
During the nineteenth century
members of her family were prominent

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.630
in the free black class in
Annapolis and Baltimore.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.750
They served as pillars of the
Methodist and Episcopal church.

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:33.560
They even fought in the
Civil War, rather one was

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:35.390 position:56%
on a Navy ship during the Civil War.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.300
During the twentieth
century her descendants,

00:13:37.300 --> 00:13:40.180
who were named the Bishops, became
pioneers in the fields of medicine,

00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.640
religion, and participated
in the ongoing struggle

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:46.550
for Black equality in America.

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:48.260 position:56%
So I first encountered Charity Folks

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.210
in the year 2000 while I
was conducting research,

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.300
dissertation research, which
was supposed to be on freedom

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.990
and slavery in Anne Arundel
and Baltimore Counties.

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.060
She introduced herself through
manumission documents executed

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.550
by her owners in 1797 and 1807.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.790
And these deeds revealed
that Charity had arranged

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:08.670
to secure not only her
freedom, but for her children

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.140
and her grandchildren as well.

00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.000 position:56%
That's more than 50 years before the
Emancipation Proclamation I found an

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.820
enslaved woman who was the
architect of her own liberation.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:22.870
Charity's name and fragments of
her story quickly became the focus

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:25.930
of a dissertation chapter,
a book, and an article.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.940
Charity Folks worked
her way literally

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.130
into every single conference paper
and article I tried to write.

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:36.120
And if I did not include her name,
the article wouldn't be published,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.420
the paper didn't go well.

00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:41.350
So she literally worked her way
into every project I was doing.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:43.870
And, I don't know, has
Dr. Brown arrived yet?

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.540
I don't think Dr. Brown is here.

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:50.430
So people would often ask
in sustained disbelief,

00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:52.920
"Charity Folks, is
she still around?"

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.690
Indeed Charity was present
and she was unshakeable.

00:14:56.690 --> 00:15:00.340
And one of my colleagues, I see
my colleague, Damien Thomas here,

00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:02.920
one of our colleagues at Illinois
said, "Wouldn't it be great

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:05.990
if you found more information
on Charity Folks?

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.020
Wouldn't it be great if you told
the book from her perspective?"

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.640
And I said, "Yeah.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.290
That's not going to happen."

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:15.830
At that point I had two
documents, two documents.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:19.140
I will say for the record that
Professor David Roettger was right,

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:22.530
it was really great to tell
this book from her perspective.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:25.680
But that forced me to do
a lot of things in order

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.210
to take two documents
and make a book.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:32.930
So that my search for Charity Folks
has spanned more than a decade.

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:36.850
Like I said, she found her
way into every conversation.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:40.010
I've catalogued more than 1500
manumission documents to see

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:45.350
if her history was typical
or if it was exceptional.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.990
I conducted work on three
continents, the United States,

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:52.070
Great Britain, and in Ghana.

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:54.490
And one of the most
important things that happened

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:59.000 position:56%
in this finding Charity Folks is I
actually realized I possessed a bulk

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.680
of the information about her
life and I had for some time.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.450
But that was only revealed when
I listened to the silences.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.160
And sometimes we know, if we're
doing the kind of work that some

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.240
of us do, looking for people
who weren't meant to be

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.570
in historical documents, doing
this kind of research revolves

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:17.830
around not just looking at
how history is documented,

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:21.180
but how it is remembered and, in
most cases, how it is imagined.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:27.810
I did a considerable amount of
work to step outside of the archive

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:29.860
to chase after this ghost
that was chasing me.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:32.110
And the first thing I did
is I called the Historic

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:33.660
Annapolis Foundation.

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:35.260
And there a gentleman by the name

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.610
of Glen Campbell answered the
phone and said, "Oh, Charity.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.940
I don't know anything about her
but I know she's important."

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.950
So that sent me on this trail.

00:16:46.950 --> 00:16:50.400
I met Janice Hayes Williams
who is a local genealogist

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.020
and local historian.

00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.540
She assured me the story
of Charity Folks didn't end

00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.650
with the two documents that I had.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:17:01.780
I was encouraged to speak to
the descendants of the people

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:05.460
who owned Charity Folks,
who was the Rideout family.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.680
And the Rideout family is very
prominent in the state of Maryland.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:12.250
And they actually have a history
and a connection to Kunta Kinte,

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:16.110
the ancestor that is talked
about in Alex Haley's book.

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:20.260
And we can discuss how legitimate
or non-legitimate that is.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.580
The point of the matter is the
Rideout family is very used

00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:26.030
to people calling them
and saying, "I'm sorry.

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:29.340 position:56%
May I talk to you about the enslaved
people your family used to own?"

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.430
So it wasn't as awkward as
it initially was going to be.

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:36.620
And I also contacted descendants
of Charity Folks which I will talk

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:41.370
about in the latter
part of this talk.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:46.190
So, without a picture to guide
-- me well, let me back up.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.810
When we think about
the history of slavery

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.090
in Maryland we really only
think about three people.

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:53.780
We think about Kunta
Kinte, who I just named.

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.080
We think about Frederick Douglass.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.380
And we think about Harriet Tubman.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.210
And this is one of the reasons
that Charity Folks has remained

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:02.700
such an obscure historical figure.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.550
We know that Annapolis hardly ever
receives attention by historians.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.800
People are much more
interested in Baltimore.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.140
And we know that when
people are telling stories

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.480
and recreating movies, we know
the story of Harriet Tubman,

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:18.650
or Kunta Kinte, or Frederick
Douglass is much more exciting.

00:18:18.650 --> 00:18:20.600
So there are a couple
of places in Maryland

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.150
where there are actually
monuments and exhibits dedicated

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.600
to these three individuals.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.270 position:56%
We have in the upper corner the
house that Frederick Douglass worked

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:31.640
in and lived in when he was
enslaved in Philips Point.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:35.360
There's another bust
commemorating his head.

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:38.160
We have Harriet Tubman down here.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.290
And then we have the Alex
Haley memorial that sits

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:43.020
on the dock of Annapolis.

00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:49.660
What is interesting about this is
even though there are all these

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:52.100
plaques and that we can --
plaques and monuments --

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:54.910
and we can take a tour
for $18.00 and walk

00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:57.810
around Frederick Douglass'
Baltimore,

00:18:57.810 --> 00:19:00.780
what is interesting is
just as Baltimore belonged

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.980 position:56%
to Frederick Douglass, Annapolis
certainly belonged to Charity Folks.

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:07.890 position:56%
Charity Folks is more representative
of the enslaved experience

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:10.050
in Maryland than Kunta
Kinte, Frederick Douglass,

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:14.090
or Harriet Tubman, and this is
why: She did not flee bondage

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:15.990
like Frederick Douglass
or Harriet Tubman.

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:18.840
She did not die enslaved
like Kunta Kinte.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.110 position:56%
Nor did she end her life in poverty.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:25.230 position:56%
Okay. Folks and her family were like
the 45,000 other enslaved people

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:26.920 position:56%
in Maryland who gained their freedom

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.280
in the decades following
the American Revolution.

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.980
So in Maryland the small geographic
region boasted a remarkably fluid

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.910
slave and free Black population.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:39.480
Folks lived the majority of
her life in the Chesapeake

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:41.890
and during her lifetime she
inhabited all three zones

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.190
of freedom.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:50.980
Okay. So, as I said, I had
to go on an expedition.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.760
I had to go on an expedition.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.510
I literally would, we don't,
sorry, I know we're being recorded

00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:59.190
so I guess I won't walk around.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:03.000
So without a picture --
we don't have a picture

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.300
of what Charity Folks looks like --

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.750
without a picture I was
literally forced to go to the site

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:11.750
where she lived and literally
consider myself an archeologist

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:15.530
and look for places where I thought
her imprint might be visible.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:20.140
So this is a map sitting just
offsite of Church Circle.

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.440
You can see Doctor Street.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.760
You can see South Street.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.120 position:56%
Charity Folks, from her grown adult
years, during her grown adult years,

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.710
inhabited these, what, three
blocks that adjoined one another.

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:32.010
That was it.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:33.310
That was it.

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.490
She was enslaved at the bottom,
at the bottom of this, well,

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.100
is the bottom of what I'm saying
right here, Doctor Street.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.020
She moved to the corner of
South Street when she was freed.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.780
So her entire life was
contained in this area.

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:51.540
However, it's much more
interesting than you would expect.

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.360
Charity Folks' imprint
is all over Annapolis.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:57.720
Nearly every place she worked
in, that she inhabited,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:02.310 position:56%
is part of historic Annapolis or
part of the National Historic Trust.

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.390
Properties once owned by Charity
Folks and her son-in-law are sites

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.230
for archeological digs and continue

00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:11.090
to yield crucial details
about Black Annapolis.

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.850
Now during the late nineteenth
century Folks' property

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:18.000
at 84 Franklin Street was sold

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.710
to the Mount Moriah
Methodist Episcopal Church

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:23.590
as the site of their new building.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:28.970 position:56%
The church has since came into the
hands of the National Historic Trust

00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.350
and it's been converted to
the Banneker-Douglass Museum

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:34.140
which is Maryland's
official repository

00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:36.490
for African American heritage.

00:21:36.490 --> 00:21:38.610
And this is where I'll
do a shameless plug

00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:41.740
and say we two representatives
from the Banneker-Douglass Museum.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.800
We are actually working
on an exhibit

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.310
around this story for next year.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.230
So, welcome them.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.290
And I also learned
that going through this

00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:55.920 position:56%
that not only was Charity Folks'
imprint visible but she was integral

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.180
to the history of Annapolis.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:02.430
Which means I also had to accept
that there were public narratives

00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:07.510
about her life that may or may
not agree with the documents.

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:09.790
That's put me out of
favor with some people.

00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:14.180
I think we have come
to a conclusion.

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:18.710
But it was very awkward to have
to write a history as an historian

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:20.950
and be challenged by
people who had passed

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.390
down a history for generations.

00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:29.740
So Charity does not enter
the historical record

00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:31.330
until she's an adult.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.410
As I said before, one local
historian thinks that she was born

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:40.160
at Belair Plantation which is now
part of the city of Bowie museums.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.650
We don't have any documentation
for this.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.540
But it's alluded to in family lore.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.010
It's alluded to in several places.

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:53.670
Okay. The slave quarters
of Belair have not survived

00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:56.000
but the public display
at the mansion suggests

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.560
that the enslaved people
made their home

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.120 position:56%
in the cellar of this grand mansion.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:06.630
They lived among rats,
and mice, and horses.

00:23:06.630 --> 00:23:09.390
They lived as chattel.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.100
Charity may have spent the first
ten to twelve years of her life,

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:15.250
like I said, in the cellar with
her brother, James, and her mother.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:16.550
Or she might have lived
in Annapolis.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.120
We're really unclear.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.670
We do know that she
entered the house

00:23:19.670 --> 00:23:24.840
of John Rideout between
1765 and 1767.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.120
But it's unclear how
she ended up there, too.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.630
Some say that she was
part of a dowry.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:33.630
When Samuel Ogle, who owned Belair
mansion, who was the governor

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:38.190
of Maryland, his daughter
actually married John Rideout.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.320
So this brings us to
the Rideout house.

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.930
Some of these pictures are actually
from the Library of Congress.

00:23:42.930 --> 00:23:47.560
The John Rideout house stands on
Gloucester Street in Annapolis

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.010
and it is a historical
monument and testament

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:55.470
to eighteenth century architecture.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:56.880
So this is frontispiece
of the house.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.250
You can see the little
historical landmark marking.

00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:02.150
A picture from the
Library of Congress.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.450
I've been in the house.

00:24:03.450 --> 00:24:05.410
The house almost looks like
this picture that was taken

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:07.770
in the 40's -- 40's or 50's.

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:16.580 position:56%
This is an outside view of the house
and then the house from the back.

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.370
So Charity folks probably
came to the Rideout house

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.250
when she was about 13 years of age.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.390
And we don't know what kind

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:26.760
of advice her mother
would have given her.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.240
We don't know if she had a chance
to say goodbye to her mother.

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.080
But she comes to the
Rideout house right

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.740
when she's on the cusp of puberty.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.630
In a house with a mistress she knew
because she was raised at Belair

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.060
with Mary Rideout we're told.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.650
And she was also placed
in a house with a master,

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.600 position:56%
John Rideout, that she did not know.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.590
So we're not really sure what her
experiences would have been like.

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.070
Was she free from sexual violation?

00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:53.570
Did she come in close
contact with people?

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.470
Was she punished often?

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.770
We don't know this.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:59.880
But living outside the
normative definition

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:03.330
of womanhood probably forced
enslaved women like Charity

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.660
to nurture her spirit
in a particular way

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:08.650
to combat the psychological

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.960
and physical abuse that
encircled her life.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:17.140
We know that while she was a slave
Charity gave birth to five children

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.090
and maintained a broad relationship

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:20.910
with another slave
named Thomas Folks.

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.800
Meaning he lived a few doors down.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.260
He was owned by John Davidson,
a shopkeeper and tavern owner.

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:32.500
And from what we know he fathered
three of her five children.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.650
Where Charity was determined

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:40.530
to influence her own
liberation it's clear

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:45.190
to actually manumit her took
place over quite a few decades.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:49.030
In total it took almost
40 years from the time

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:52.180
that Charity's first daughter was
freed by John Rideout to the time

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:53.960
that her grandchildren
were finally freed.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:26:00.000
It took 40 years for this entire
family to live as free people.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.560
For Charity Folks in
particular she died in --

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.280
I mean John Rideout died in 1797.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.830
And within two months
his wife signed a deed

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.650
to grant Charity Folks' freedom.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.780
And she, at this point two

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:17.440 position:56%
of Charity's daughters were already
freed and they lived with her mother

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.770
or her free Black husband.

00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.250
Thomas Folks has been freed.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:23.970
And Charity Folks still had
children remaining in bondage.

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:26.990
So I'm going to short shift so we
can get to questions and answers

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:30.940
and basically say that by 1807
all of her children were freed.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:33.440
And by 1810 we can tell
that she's living in a house

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.970
with Thomas Folks and her children.

00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.520
Despite Charity Folks' desire to
keep members of her family close,

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.370
their experiences in
slavery continued

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.240
to drive a wedge between them.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.010
And ultimately the fact that
some were freed and others stayed

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.850
in bondage actually produced
resentment among her children.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.670
Her son, for example, felt
that she had a greater fondness

00:27:06.670 --> 00:27:09.070
for little daughter,
named Little Charity,

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:12.310
than she did for the other
children in the family.

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:17.320
And this often frustrated her
husband who by now was free

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.870
and he remarked that Little
Charity's influence would actually

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.200
carry his wife to hell.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:27.830
For their part, James Jackson,
her son, and her other daughter,

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:31.650
Mary Folks, certainly believed
that they were unfairly separated

00:27:31.650 --> 00:27:33.390
from their mother when
they were young.

00:27:33.390 --> 00:27:36.210
And they felt that because Charity
was probably the one that stayed

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.660
with her the longest that she
had the better relationship.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.770
And so this produces
a longstanding rivalry

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.660
between Mary Folks
and Little Charity.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:51.900
The rivalry was so intense that
they actually sued one another.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:55.090
Mary Folks and her husband
sued Charity Folks Bishop

00:27:55.090 --> 00:28:00.050
and her husband, William Bishop,
because the Bishops erected a fence

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:05.340
that would not allow them to cross
the alley and go to their own home.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:09.890
So when it came down to it, the two
sisters were competing literally

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:15.100
over a space that was
18 inches long.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.400
Who owned it?

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.700
Who was it bequeathed to?

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.000
What have you.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.350
So this rivalry was intense.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:24.710 position:56%
And this tension exacerbated in the
family even more when William Bishop

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:26.790
and his wife, Charity
Bishop, Little Charity,

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:30.610
moved into the house
with Charity Folks.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.360
In fact Little Charity asked
her brother, James Jackson,

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.620
to remove the pigs that
he kept in the front yard.

00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.690
And this ensues such a violent
argument that James drew a knife

00:28:40.690 --> 00:28:45.090
on his mother and called
her ill names.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:49.920
Charity Folks never forgave her son
and she was removed from her will.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.930
And that was a significant penalty

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:56.920
because she really
amassed a lot of property.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.500
In addition to the lingering
memories of slavery in her home,

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.680
the imprint of slavery was still
apparent all over Annapolis.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.240
A perfect example is if
we go to Annapolis now,

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.710
you can go to Reynold's Tavern.

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:10.870
You can go there for high tea.

00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.170
I'm the scholar of slavery.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:13.470
I should have known this.

00:29:13.470 --> 00:29:16.210
I went to Reynold's
Tavern for high tea.

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.650
Thomas Folks had worked
there when he became free.

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:22.580
And then the local historian said,
"We don't go to Reynold's Tavern."

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.300
We don't? "We don't
go to Reynold's Tavern

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:30.760
because during the slave trade they
sold people in the parlor room."

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.150 position:56%
And archeological evidence from Mark
Leone at the University of Maryland,

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.360
College Park, reveals
they actually held people

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.190
in the basement waiting to be sold.

00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:44.530
So this imprint of slavery even
exists today but at the time

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.660
that Charity was a free
person this building was right

00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:49.300
across the street from her home.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.420
So slavery is still
everywhere, right.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:08.030 position:56%
In an form of eerie foreshadowing
Charity Folks anticipated being lost

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.330
from history.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:11.390
In her final years she
felt she was displaced

00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:13.560
and feared being turned
out of doors.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.360
She obsessively searched
for something that was lost

00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.550
and half the time she did not
know what she was looking for.

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:22.970
Family members and neighbors
described her as deranged.

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:25.960
And given her age and her failing
health, and probably the experience

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.210
that she endured, it's
probably not surprising

00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:32.940
that Folks probably had something
that likened to dementia.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:39.780
Now part of her ruthlessness
and restlessness

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:42.050
in her later years stemmed
from a sense that her position

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:46.960 position:56%
in the family was being overtaken,
that her son-in-law, William Bishop,

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.710
was displacing her as the
mistress of the house.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:52.570
Bishop ultimately assumed
control of her residence

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:54.660
and eventually the
deed to the property.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.030
Substantiating Folks' worse fear

00:30:57.030 --> 00:30:59.450
that she was losing
power among her kin.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:02.420
A family friend described a
fight between William Bishop

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.520
and Charity Folks and
the family remarked that,

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.230
"There was just no place for her."

00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:09.900
And she set off to the graveyard.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.620
This was the last public
account documenting the life

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:14.760
of Charity Folks.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.090
Charity Folks we know
suffered a paralyzing stroke

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.250
in 1834 when she was 75.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:23.670
She regained the ability to
walk and some ability to speak,

00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:25.980
but she died within that year.

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:28.550
Charity Folks did leave a will
at a time when white men failed

00:31:28.550 --> 00:31:31.570
to even use this legal mechanism.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.990
Her will and its related codicils
underscore the importance she

00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:37.080
attached to property and kin alike.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:40.630
She left property to each of
her three surviving daughters.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:46.630
And Folks in some ways resembled
African Americans during

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:50.300
Reconstruction, which is
discussed by Dylan Penningroth,

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:54.970
in that her family - sorry --

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:58.450
in like many nineteenth
century African Americans,

00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.750
Charity Folks attached value

00:31:59.750 --> 00:32:02.830
to reclaiming her family members
even though they had been lost

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:04.130
to slavery.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:07.780
And in essence her kin was
as valuable as property.

00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:10.480
She also had a clear understanding
of what it took to succeed

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.090
in a free society and worked
hard to become a woman

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:15.080
of property and social standing.

00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.460
Though she was not formally
educated, Charity learned protocol,

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:22.170
legal protocol, from life
experiences and her exposure

00:32:22.170 --> 00:32:24.540
to business transactions.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:35.570
A family genealogical chart bears
the notation that Charity Folks,

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:38.670
the wife of Thomas, personal
maid to the wife of the governor,

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:42.270
is buried in St. Anne's
Cemetery in Annapolis.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:45.950
Tucked away between the
Severn River and Route 50,

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:50.090
St. Anne connects historic
Annapolis with the modern world

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:51.720 position:56%
and it contains graves spanning back

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.870
to the 200 years of
the city's history.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:58.740
And there's a Bishop family plot
where twelve members of the Bishop

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:00.840
and Folks family are buried.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:05.480
Next to a headstone for Thomas
Folks, which is the one closest

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.470
to me, there's an empty space.

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:13.720 position:56%
And there's a footstone at the end
of this that you'll see in a moment.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:18.730 position:56%
So it's Thomas Folks, there's an
empty space, and there's Mary Folks.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:22.470
And the footstone allegedly
belongs to Charity Folks.

00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:30.980 position:56%
So 200 years after she was forgotten
to history, I place flowers,

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:36.440
giving her some kind of monument
to mark her death and her life.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.990
Yet, without a headstone to
commemorate her existence,

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.550
Charity's life appears
as a ghost story.

00:33:43.550 --> 00:33:45.210
She like the wondering
spirits who died

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.970
on board slave ships
during the Middle Passage

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:50.460
and did not have proper burial.

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:52.570
Charity Folks has been
denied the important process

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.910
of being remembered and
honored by the living.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:56.210
She is forgotten.

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.650
And because she is
forgotten she is restless.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.230 position:56%
Yet, as Charity Folks
demonstrates, the absence of a body,

00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:04.770
or even the absence of a physical
headstone, does not always equate

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:06.230
to the absence of memory.

00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:08.120
And we are winding up
because I know some

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.910 position:56%
of you are here on your lunch break.

00:34:09.910 --> 00:34:13.100
Even without a headstone, Charity
Folks continues to draw attention

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.420
to her life in interesting ways.

00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:17.830
So, case in point, when I
was finishing this book --

00:34:17.830 --> 00:34:19.130
you have to finish your book,

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.180
you have to turn it in,
you have to get tenure.

00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.610
The clock is not on the
side of the historian.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:26.510
And I sent the book to the press
but I was still very unsettled.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:27.810
I was uncertain.

00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:33.070 position:56%
So I went on an elaborate mission to
track down some of her descendants.

00:34:33.070 --> 00:34:35.770
I looked on Facebook.

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:40.300
But unfortunately the one person
I found had a Facebook account

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.600
but doesn't use it.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.060
So I actually had to go the old
fashioned way and look at books,

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:46.960
go through another historian who
linked me to one of her relatives

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.510
that worked in the government,

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:51.660
who then said that she would give
me this secret information what she

00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:53.760 position:56%
went through, the person themselves.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:57.770 position:56%
So this is how I came to meet a
woman by the name of Liberty Rashad.

00:34:57.770 --> 00:35:01.500
And Liberty Rashad is the five
times removed granddaughter

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:02.860
of Charity Folks.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:08.970
The first time we spoke was in
December 2012 and the phone rang,

00:35:08.970 --> 00:35:11.050
I answered it, "Hello, Jessica.

00:35:11.050 --> 00:35:13.160
This is Liberty Rashad."

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:17.720
And she was very dramatic
and just wonderful.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.520
And she was great.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.340
And I said, "Is Liberty
your real name?"

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.230
"Yeah. That is my given name."

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:26.400
I said, "Well, little ironic.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.830
Do you know that you're descended
from a line of freedom fighters?"

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.170
And so the irony was not
lost on either one of us.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.430
But as we spoke about her
ancestor, Charity Folks,

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:40.450
we quickly realized we were
speaking about two different women.

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:44.040
So for the family historians
you'll love this.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:49.740
I was talking about Charity
Folks, Senior, the mother.

00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:54.430
She was talking about Charity
Folks Bishop, the daughter.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:57.080
There were two Charity Folks.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.830 position:56%
And I knew this but Liberty did not.

00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:02.440
And so that was the
connection I was looking for.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.650
My academic hunch had been correct.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.460
Charity Folks had been
lost to history

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.360
and she was lost to
her family as well.

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:13.640
And in one phone call we
restored not just one generation,

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:17.400 position:56%
but two generations because I told
Liberty not just about Charity Folks

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.530
but about her mother, Rachel Burr.

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:22.830
And for a historian, this in
some ways is that aha moment.

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.130
This is when you get goose bumps.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:25.430
I mean I have goose bumps.

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:26.730
I don't know if you do.

00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:28.090
But this is that moment
that a historian dreams of.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:30.450
We don't talk to people
that are living and walking

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:32.300
around in the present moment.

00:36:32.300 --> 00:36:34.940
So this was a beautiful moment
but of course this means

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.360
that Liberty has to come
to Annapolis to meet me.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.640
She had never been to Annapolis.

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:41.940
She lived in New York.

00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.240
She knew Annapolis was important

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.920
for her family history
but she'd never been.

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:54.660
So on Easter morning, a day of
rebirth, in 2013, I met Liberty,

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.370
her son, his two children who
live in D.C., and their niece

00:36:58.370 --> 00:37:00.090
who was visiting from Chicago.

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.750
And we walked all around
Annapolis and I showed them things.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:06.750
I showed them the dock with the
Alex Haley memorial and we talked

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:10.130
about how many Africans
probably came through that port

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:12.470
or lost their lives beforehand.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.510
We walked around downtown
Annapolis and I showed the grounds

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:18.960
where Charity's house
may have stood.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.260
We saw Reynold's Tavern.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.230 position:56%
We saw the Banneker-Douglass Museum.

00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:25.850
And as we're walking past the
front of the Rideout house,

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:30.470
and we're looking at it, and we're
exchanging remarks about whether

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:34.640
or not it was a tribute to
eighteenth century architecture

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:37.520
or what it must have been
like to be enslaved in there,

00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.220
someone comes from
the side of the house.

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.520
So Liberty looks at me.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:42.820
I looked at her.

00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:44.130
She sends me over to the
gentleman and it turns

00:37:44.130 --> 00:37:46.500
out he was the owner of the house.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.150
I introduced him to --
I introduced myself.

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:52.230
And Liberty started
to introduce herself.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:54.170
I cut to the chase
and said, "Listen,

00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:55.790
this is the descendant
of Charity Folks."

00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.830
"Ah! Charity Folks?"

00:37:57.830 --> 00:38:00.940
So he invited us in.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:03.010
He invited us in through
the front door.

00:38:03.010 --> 00:38:04.310
[ Laughter ]

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:09.740
And we spent a lot of time
just walking in her footsteps,

00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:12.700
looking at this garden that she
probably got herbs and roots

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:16.330
from to do some root work, looking
at the time she probably, you know,

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:19.610 position:56%
secreted herself to go to the bushes

00:38:19.610 --> 00:38:21.540
to have a safe harbor
and perhaps pray.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.390
And it was this incredible
experience.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:26.060
I had tried to get into
this house so many times

00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.400
but it's not open to the public.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.680
I just didn't have
the right combination.

00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.510
I had to walk there with her
descendants and it opened right up.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:38.330
[ Laughter ]

00:38:38.330 --> 00:38:41.510
We're almost, I mean, I haven't
even gotten to the good stuff yet.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:45.950
So here's a picture
of Liberty and myself.

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.760
You can see why some
people might have said

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:52.270
when I went traipsing around, "Are
you a descendant of the Bishops?"

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:55.010
"No." I have no resemblance
whatsoever.

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:57.850
This even happened in New
York when I went to a church

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.180
that the Bishops had
been ministers at.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.400
No family resemblance
to my knowledge,

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:07.790
no family relationship rather.

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:13.990
So Liberty and I spent two
additional days retracing her

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:15.290
family's past.

00:39:15.290 --> 00:39:16.870
And the trip was profound.

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:20.720
It was blessed by the ancestors
and it exceeded our expectations.

00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:22.970
Her presence was everywhere.

00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:25.060
We felt here when we entered
the John Rideout house.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:27.250
We felt her at the
Banneker-Douglass Museum.

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:30.090
We actually felt her as we
stood at the side of this Bank

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.440
of America building that
sits right on Church Circle

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.030
because that's actually where
her house used to stand.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:39.720
So perhaps it's ironic given that
she accumulated so much money.

00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.360
And we felt her as we entered
St. Mary's Catholic Church.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.920
We snapped photos and
toasted her memory.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:49.740 position:56%
And we ended our visit at the Bishop
family plot in St. Anne's Cemetery

00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.790
where of course Liberty placed
flowers honoring her ancestors

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:54.450
and she called out their names.

00:39:54.450 --> 00:39:57.770
As Folks' example suggests
the enslaved are persistent

00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:59.400
in their desire to be remembered.

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.060
They beckon to be seen more
than names and prices jotted

00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:05.000
down on plantation account books.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.390 position:56%
They invite us in through artifacts,
oral histories, and photos.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:11.300
They challenge us to engage
in the untelling in narratives

00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.880
that neglect their pain, their
suffering, and even their triumphs.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.480
Their ongoing presence forces
us to deal with the flesh

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.810
and blood diaspora involved
in the trafficking of bodies.

00:40:21.810 --> 00:40:23.460
They call for attention, they call

00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:26.420
for atonement, they
call for apologies.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:30.870
So how we choose to engage the
past as archivists, as scholars.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:33.630
How we choose to engage the
past then is not simply a matter

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:35.020
of discourse.

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:39.080
If the story of Charity Folks

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.100
and other enslaved women is any
indication, what we do matters.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.410
The story of enslaved women

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.950
and Black women more generally
are crucial to our understanding

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.340
of the long fight for freedom.

00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:56.360
One of the ways I like to end this
talk is I actually like to speak

00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:01.120
about actually what it was like to
reconstruct Charity Folks' life.

00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.200
And part of reconstructing
Charity Folks' life,

00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:05.370
it was to understand her pain.

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:09.440
And this was the historic pain
brought out of social conditions --

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.150
it was a historic pain born out of
social conditions, legal policies,

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:17.180
and particular constructions that
were anti-Black, anti-woman, and,

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:20.000 position:56%
for the most part, anti-Black woman.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.660
Only by experiencing this
pain can one truly write about

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:23.960
and understand the redemptive

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:27.030
and revolutionary nature
of Black women's joy.

00:41:27.030 --> 00:41:28.980
As generations of Black
women can attest,

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:33.360
we know that rejoicing
is the key to surviving.

00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:41.020
So, in closing, -- I'm a lefty,
that's what's going on over here.

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.310
That's what's been the
problem all day long.

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:48.140
So I like to believe that
Charity Folks is finding peace.

00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:51.030
She rests in the center of the
family plot surviving the ebb

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:55.530
and flow of time, encircled
by all her folk.

00:41:55.530 --> 00:41:59.690
The tombstones of her husband,
her daughter, her son-in-law,

00:41:59.690 --> 00:42:02.060
and even some grandchildren
bear witness

00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.420
to the family's enslaved past.

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:07.810
There are other descendants that
bear witness to the experiences

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.350
of the family in freedom.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:14.840 position:56%
So in this paper Charity Folks has
inhabited many forms, be it a ghost,

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.890
an artifact of public memory, an
enslaved woman, a free Black woman,

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:22.290
a founding mother, and
a forgotten ancestor.

00:42:22.290 --> 00:42:25.980 position:56%
In each form Charity Folks
testifies to the incomparable spirit

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:30.120
of survival and adaptation
among African Americans.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.860
Charity Folks seems to call
out the past and say to us,

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:35.160
"Despite it all we are still here."

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:36.960
Thank you.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:44.320
[ Applause ]

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.710
Okay. I know some of you have
to leave and go back to work.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:50.380
We have time for a few questions
and then we'll move outside

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.450
to a formal book signing.

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.290
Yes, Mr. Jones.

00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.820
&gt;&gt; Have you thought about
going back to the cemetery

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:00.540
and [inaudible] take a probe
and stick it through that area

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.760 position:56%
where you think she might be buried?

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.590
&gt;&gt; Jessica Millward:
See that's a great idea.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:09.030
Yes. I don't have that
kind of power.

00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:11.390
But the Library of Congress
knows a lot of people.

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:16.540
[Laughs]. I mean this would take,
you know, asking the family.

00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:19.530
It would take some negotiations.

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:21.150
Yes. The answer is yes.

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.510
And I'm not close to
that experience.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:30.160
I hope that at some point it
will actually lead us there.

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.930
Yes, in the back.

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:36.400
&gt;&gt; Could you speak a little bit
about how her life and the choices

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.730 position:56%
that she was able to make so much of
might have been affected by the fact

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:44.250
that she lived in a city,
and then of course how

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:46.190
that might have [inaudible].

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:50.050
&gt;&gt; Jessica Millward: So Annapolis
at this time we can call it a city.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:52.210
Annapolis by city standards
never grew

00:43:52.210 --> 00:43:54.310
to be more than just a large town.

00:43:54.310 --> 00:43:58.710
But urban centers like Annapolis,
Baltimore, and Charleston,

00:43:58.710 --> 00:44:04.650
for example, people are
in some ways it's believed

00:44:04.650 --> 00:44:07.470
that they have more
access to freedom.

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:10.020
In that they're not on the
plantation under and overseer.

00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.720
They've been hired out
to work for someone else.

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.020
You know, Frederick Douglass talks

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.990
about being almost a
free man in the city.

00:44:16.990 --> 00:44:21.260
I think in Charity Folks'
situation it has been said

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.040
that she probably had a
degree of more freedom

00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:26.300
because the family also
had a house in Whitehall

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:29.120
which is just past Annapolis.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.320
And it's believed she traveled
back and forth to see her children.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.340
But I also want to underscore that
even though she had more freedom

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.870
and even though enslaved people had
more freedom in cities, you know,

00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:45.550
they might be able to sell their
wares and use some of that money

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:48.460
to buy their freedom,
they were still enslaved.

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.150
So their circumstances
are conscribed

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:54.240
in a particular manner, right.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.540
Yes, sir. In the back.

00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:56.840
&gt;&gt; Would you like to tell us

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.340
about your research on
the other continents?

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.640
London, and Africa, Ghana?

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:02.820
&gt;&gt; Jessica Millward:
Oh, I don't know.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.120 position:56%
You all might not be ready for this.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:07.260
So London was London.

00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.560
London was London.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:09.860
And, ma'am, I see you in the back.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:11.160
I'll answer your question
in a minute.

00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:12.460
London was London.

00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:15.180
But there's a particular
experience when you go to Africa

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.480
and when you go to Ghana.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.170
I went to Ghana in particular.

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:21.230
And because now we're all friends
I will say that I gave this paper

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:25.510
at the University of Ghana Legon.

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:29.710 position:56%
And the instructor, who's an artist,
had this great idea to put me

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:34.880
with this backdrop of Cape Coast
slave dungeon in the background.

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.180
I said, "Yeah.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.500 position:56%
I don't know if that's a good idea."

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:40.110
But he was insistent on this
because he knew the majority

00:45:40.110 --> 00:45:43.820
of enslaved people
passed through Cape Coast.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:46.040 position:56%
Okay. So there's a part in this talk

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.320
where I start saying the
names of the families, right.

00:45:48.320 --> 00:45:50.230
I call out there names.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:53.210
And that was probably one of the
most beautiful memories I have

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.510
of doing this kind of work.

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:58.850
And it wasn't doing archival work
but it was literally bringing part

00:45:58.850 --> 00:46:01.490
of someone back home
to the continent.

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:03.710
And if you do African American
history, that's also one

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:05.260
of those best moments
you can hope for.

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:06.660
You can't touch it.

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:07.960
You can't see it.

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:09.260
But you can feel it.

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:14.430
Yes, in the back.

00:46:14.430 --> 00:46:15.930
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:17.990
&gt;&gt; Jessica Millward: Thank you.

00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:24.410
So I think that's a
good place to end.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.600
I know they're monitoring the time.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.400
So I'm going to turn the
microphone back to Dr. Moses.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:35.510
&gt;&gt; Sibyl E. Moses: Please join me
again in thanking Dr. Millward.

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:44.670
[ Applause ]

00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:49.500
Dr. Millward, you really don't know
how much we have appreciated your

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.470
visit, and your presentation,
your research, and your spirit.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:56.760
Your talk was so appropriate
because the Humanities

00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:58.660
and Social Sciences Division,

00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.940
in addition to African
American history,

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:03.940
also covers women's
history, and local history

00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:09.350 position:56%
and genealogy, and American history.

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:11.730
[Laughs]. And so for all
of you, we welcome you

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:14.750
to come in to use our resources.

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:18.490
We have a Ask a Librarian
service where you can send

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:21.540
in your questions via the internet.

00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:25.420
We have a genealogy
section where we welcome you

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.760
and we can assist you
with your research.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.690
And we want you to come back again.

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:33.490
So if you do not have a reader
registration card, go and get one

00:47:33.490 --> 00:47:37.190
because the reason we have so many
people here is our chiefs sent

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.340
out something to Patron Services.

00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.710
Which is when you sign
up for your card

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:45.620 position:56%
to use the Library you automatically
get on this list and so you hear

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:48.630
about everything that's happening
at the Library of Congress.

00:47:48.630 --> 00:47:50.350
We thank you again.

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:55.920 position:56%
We have for the past couple of
years featured lectures and programs

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.470
that where we have starred
members of the Association

00:47:59.470 --> 00:48:02.400
of Black Women Historians
of which I am a member.

00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.680
And it's fabulous research.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:06.900
It's cutting edge research.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.570
And it goes into areas that
we have not visited before.

00:48:10.570 --> 00:48:15.030
So we encourage all of you here
to recover someone from the past

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:17.880
so that they will not be
lost in history, okay.

00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:20.440
Our book signing will occur outside

00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.390
in the lobby and she'll
be available.

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:28.980
[Inaudible].

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:32.850
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:35.230
