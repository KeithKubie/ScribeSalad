00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.100
Let f be a differentiable
function for all x.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.090
If f of negative 2
is equal to 3 and f

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.030
prime of x is less than or
equal to 7 for all x, then

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.760
what is the largest
possible value of f of 10?

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.904
And so I encourage you to
think about this on your own,

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:20.320
pause the video,
try to figure out

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.830
the largest possible
value for f of 10.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.800
And then we'll work
through it together.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.490
So I'm assuming you've
given a go at it.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.510
So let's visualize this.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.530
So let me draw some axes here.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.420
So let's say that's my x-axis.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.040
That's my x-axis
right over there.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.960
And this right over
here is my y-axis.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.390
That's my y-axis [INAUDIBLE]
I'll graph y equals f of x.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.600
And they tell us f of
negative 2 is equal to 3.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.850
And the two axes aren't
going to be drawn to scale.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.050
So let's say this is negative 2.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.440
And this right over here is
the point negative 2 comma 3.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.840
And they tell us that f prime of
x is a less than or equal to 7,

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.630
that the instantaneous slope is
always less than or equal to 7.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.500
So really, the way to get the
largest possible value of f--

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.220
we don't have to necessarily
invoke the mean value theorem,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.790
although the mean value theorem
will help us know for sure--

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.260
is to say well, look, the
largest possible value of f

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.480
of 10 is essentially if
we max this thing out.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.040
If we assume that the
instantaneous rate of change

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.750
just stays at the
ceiling right at 7.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.820
So if we assumed
that our function,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.500
the fastest growing
function here

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.810
would be a line that has a
slope exactly equal to 7.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.660
So the slope of 7 would
look-- and obviously, I'm

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.667
not drawing this to scale.

00:01:51.667 --> 00:01:53.500
Visually, this looks
more like a slope of 1,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.249
but we'll just assume
this is a slope of 7

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.090
because it's not
at the same-- the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.810
x and y are not
at the same scale.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.070
So slope is equal to 7.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.700
And so if our slope
is equal to 7,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.229
where do we get to
when x is equal to 10?

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.670
When x is equal to 10, which
is right over here, well

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.770
what's our change in x?

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.962
So what's our change in x?

00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:18.420
Let's just think
about it this way.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.190
Our change in y over change
in x is going to be what?

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.380
Well our change in y is going
to be f of 10 minus f of 2.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.800
f of 2 is 3, so minus
3, over our change in x.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.562
Our change in x is
10 minus negative 2.

00:02:39.562 --> 00:02:43.860
10 minus negative 2 is
going to be equal to 7.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.100
This is the way to max out what
our value of f of 10 might be.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.100
If at any point the slope
were anything less than that,

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.034
because remember, the
instantaneous rate of change

00:02:57.034 --> 00:02:58.200
can never be more than that.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.690
So if we start off even
a little bit lower,

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.770
than the best we can
do is get to that.

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.870
Remember, we can't do
something like that.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.850
That would get us too steep.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.690
So it has to be like that.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.470
And then we would get
to a lower f of 10.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.350
Every time you have a
slightly lower rate of change,

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.750
then it kind of limits
what happens to you.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.840
So remember, our slope
can never be more than 7.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.214
So this part should be parallel.

00:03:30.214 --> 00:03:32.380
So this should be parallel
to that right over there.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.379
This should be parallel.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.450
But we can never have a
higher slope than that.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.090
So the way to max it out is
to actually have a slope of 7.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.820
And so what is f
of 10 going to be?

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.270
So let's see, 10 minus
negative 2, that is 12.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.360
Multiply both sides
by 12, you get 84.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.890
So f of 10 minus 3 is
going to be equal to 84.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.320
Or f of 10 is going
to be equal to 87.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.570
So if you have a slope of 7,
the whole way, you travel 12.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.560
That means you're going
to increase by 84.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.200
If you started at 3,
you increase by 84,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.457
you're going to get to 87.
