00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.430
When you're trying to take ownership of a mistake made by a fellow team member,

2
00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.820
what do you do if the team leader asked for a step by step,

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.830
step by step breakdown of events,
I'd said it was our mistake and not too,

4
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.380
and not made excuses,

5
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.390
but a step by step breakdown would expose the fact that he alone was responsible

6
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:24.340
for the air.
It's interesting.
So he basically gets interesting.

7
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.360
It is,
wait,
wait.
So he's basically saying,
okay,
it's our mistake,
right?

8
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.420
I don't want to individualize this guy or assault,
you know,

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.480
make him stand out or whatever.
Um,

10
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.980
it's our mistake and we're going to fix it kind of thing.
And he's like,
no,

11
00:00:35.981 --> 00:00:40.660
I want to step by step,
step,
step,
step by steps.
Gonna reveal,
reveal the Solo.

12
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:44.940
Actually bill's fault.
And now what I do,
I

13
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.890
<v 1>tried so hard to take ownership but here's the part,
it was actually built.</v>

14
00:00:48.891 --> 00:00:53.640
It was all jacked up.
Actually not mine.
Not My fault is what we're saying.

15
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.060
It's,
it's the truth,
right?
You get that right.
Yeah.

16
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:02.760
Cause cause check it out.
Who's responsible leaders.

17
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.380
When you're taking ownership of something,

18
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.710
when you're taking extreme ownership of something,
whose fault is it?
Your mind?

19
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.210
Yeah,
sure.
Is that include when someone else on your team makes a mistake?
Yes,

20
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.800
but how can that be God's man?
It's here.
It's your team.

21
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.120
So let me ask you these questions.
Here's what I'd be thinking.
Um,

22
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.310
the teammate was in error.

23
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.930
Why or why did the teammate make a mistake?

24
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.570
Why didn't the teammate have backup?

25
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.790
Why didn't the rest of the members of the team,

26
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.870
why didn't I actually go through with him and make sure that he knew how to do

27
00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:39.540
that procedure properly?
He's part of my team.

28
00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.970
We're responsible for this taking place.

29
00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:45.360
I knew he was a little bit shaky and I didn't do anything to fix it.

30
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.650
That's why it's our fault.
It's not our fault because we say,
oh,
it's our fault,

31
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.980
but it's really,
Bill.
That's not,
that's not what we're talking about.

32
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.750
The point is,
the point is to actually own it.
So if my coworker fails,

33
00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.120
I'm literally saying to myself,

34
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.860
what mistake did I make that my coworker dropped the ball?

35
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.300
What mistake did I make?
My coworker dropped the ball.

36
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.440
What mistake did I make?
Did I not show it to them?

37
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.480
Did I not ask him if he knew how to do it?

38
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:17.060
Did I not ask me if he needed some help?

39
00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.470
Did I not confirm that he knew the procedures correctly?

40
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.060
All those things are my fault.

41
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.010
Did I not do a good job of identifying that bill was a little bit slow on the

42
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:30.090
uptake and therefore he needed a little extra preparation for this

43
00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.950
and now,
now think about this.
What can I do once I make those mistakes?
Okay,

44
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:35.710
we're going to do to fix them.

45
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.570
Now think about this from a leadership perspective.
You go down and you say,
Hey,

46
00:02:39.571 --> 00:02:43.320
you guys,
you guys messed up this thing.
Why did it happen?

47
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.610
And now think about the team where everyone goes,
well,
you know it's our fault.

48
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.420
Mostly Bill,
right?

49
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.060
And I'll tell you when I,
when,
when,

50
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:59.220
when I look at a platoon and bill made a mistake,

51
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.100
I don't look at bill.
A good leader doesn't just look at bill.

52
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:05.020
A good leadership looks at everyone on the team,

53
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:06.370
especially certainly the leadership,

54
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:07.810
but I think this guy's talking about from a peer,

55
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:12.430
but it doesn't matter from a peer perspective,
if there's a mistake that happens,

56
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.470
we are truly responsible.

57
00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.290
And then from a leadership perspective,
when I go down to the team and I say,

58
00:03:20.291 --> 00:03:22.870
hey guys,
what happened?
And they said,
well it was our fault,

59
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.260
but this is what bill did.
I go,
okay,
so you just dropping dime on bill.

60
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:27.730
I'm not going to say that,
but I'm like,
I'm thinking to myself,

61
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:32.530
okay so it's all bill's fault.
Cool.
I'll tell you what.
Whereas if you say,

62
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.830
hey listen,
bosses,
what happened?
Here's the procedures that we went.

63
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.010
I don't think we did a good job of briefing bill.
Cause here's what bill did.
He,

64
00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.990
he did step three instead of step for my fault.
We went through twice.

65
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:46.240
But why should have gone through it a couple more times and confirm he knew what

66
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:48.430
was going on.
It's not gonna happen again.
We got this.

67
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.700
Which guy are you wanting to work for?
Which guide you,
which,

68
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.960
which team do you want?

69
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.140
You want the team where people are taking ownership of the problem,

70
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:59.590
not blaming bill.
Ah,

71
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.300
ownership is not just saying we own it.

72
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.860
Ownership isn't actually owning it.
And that's what makes it so powerful.

73
00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.740
What makes it so powerful is if you actually own it,

74
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.190
then you actually look at bill beforehand and you go look in our team.

75
00:04:15.191 --> 00:04:18.030
Do we have any weaknesses?
Yeah,
we do.
We got bill build.

76
00:04:18.031 --> 00:04:20.200
Doesn't bill can't get this part of the procedure done right?

77
00:04:20.201 --> 00:04:23.260
Here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna put bill into this other position.

78
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:25.900
That's an easier part of the procedure or to make sure he knows how to do that.

79
00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:26.351
Meanwhile,

80
00:04:26.351 --> 00:04:29.840
we're taking Mike and Mike is going to go down here and he nails this procedure

81
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.340
and he's going to spend,
by the way,
an extra 15 minutes a day during lunch,

82
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.680
he's going to get bills trained up.
So bill can eventually do,

83
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:37.300
that's the good thing you'd do on a team.

84
00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.170
<v 0>Yeah.
Yeah.
You made it pretty clear who's,
um,</v>

85
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.180
which is kind of,

86
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.380
cause it's not that easy to understand or it wasn't for me anyway.

87
00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:51.550
I mean put it this way,
it was,
it was very valuable.
One,

88
00:04:51.551 --> 00:04:54.940
I didn't understand this about extreme ownership.
I said this before too,

89
00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:56.460
by the way.
So there's,

90
00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.860
there's essentially two parts of it that make it extreme ownership.

91
00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.980
Actually there's three,
there's the dichotomy,
but aside from the dichotomy,

92
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:03.814
this is what it is.

93
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.940
You take responsibility and then you say what you're going to do to fix it.

94
00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:10.970
<v 1>The problem.
And then actually there's a third part,</v>

95
00:05:10.971 --> 00:05:13.940
which is you implement the solution.
Yes,
yes.
Okay.
You identify it,

96
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.510
you own the problem,
you identify a solution for the problem,

97
00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:18.740
and then you implement the solution.

98
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.180
<v 0>Yes.
That's what you do.
Yeah.
So a lot of times in the be,</v>

99
00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.941
especially in the beginning,

100
00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:25.760
like I would just be as far as me just kind of casually trying to understand it,

101
00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:29.300
I would focus so much on taking responsibility,
you know,
it was my fault,

102
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.810
you know,
kind of thing.
It's like,
well,

103
00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:34.790
they're taking responsibility.

104
00:05:34.791 --> 00:05:39.791
I mean is arguably more important than saying that it's your fault kind of

105
00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:41.680
thing.
It's essentially you're,

106
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:46.670
you're taking responsibility of the solution as well.
If not in a way,

107
00:05:46.671 --> 00:05:50.840
in a lot of practical cases,
you don't even have to identify who's fault it is.

108
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:55.370
If you take responsibility of the solution,
like if,
if I'm okay here.

109
00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:58.040
So if there's a football

110
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.920
<v 1>team,
right,
that's like the epitome of team,
not the epitome,</v>

111
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:03.860
but what a good example of teamwork.
Nevermind the seal teams or whatever,

112
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:05.000
but we'll go with it.
Well,

113
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.660
football is pretty soon it'll be more simple because it's,
so let's say,
okay,

114
00:06:08.661 --> 00:06:11.240
we've got to pass or whatever,
and boom,
the play,

115
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:15.010
the play starts and a guy gets through the front line.
Uh,

116
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.640
let's say the guard missed a block.
Obvious,
right?

117
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.780
He missed it.
Maybe he looked one way and it was supposed to look this way.

118
00:06:23.781 --> 00:06:26.000
You supposed to not pull any tried to pull or something.

119
00:06:26.001 --> 00:06:28.620
Maybe he just made a mistake.
He just made a mistake.
He's not in company.

120
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.520
Just made a mistake.
Whose fault is it?
The guards fall.
Okay.

121
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.120
But if the quarterback's going to take extreme ownership,
he's going to be like,

122
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:39.710
Hey,
no problem.
Hey,
this happened.
You know,
next time I'm going to remind them,

123
00:06:39.711 --> 00:06:42.950
hey,
on this play that play,
you know,
this red 46,

124
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.730
no curve twist or whatever you like,
you don't pull.

125
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:50.600
And he pro probably be like,
oh man,
I know,
I know it.
Don't go to scold them.

126
00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.700
Just be like,
hey,
you don't go,
hey,
no problem,

127
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.020
but we're just not going to do that anymore.

128
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:57.530
And then next time I call that play and be like,
you're good.
Right.

129
00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.393
I'm gonna check with them.

130
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.070
I didn't check with him that first time you made a mistake.
My check with them,

131
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:03.920
he won't make that mistake again.
And like when we are now becoming her driving,

132
00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.770
he's me.
You know,
it's kind of one of those things.

133
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:11.120
The quarterback took responsibility for solving the problem more so than he was

134
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:13.700
like,
okay,
loops.
Um,
that was my fault.

135
00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:16.880
I made a big deal out of it being his fault,
even though in his head it is,

136
00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:18.920
you know,
it's like,
okay,
this is my fault.
I should,
you know,

137
00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.910
I should make sure things are clear kind of thing.
Like the weather too.

138
00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.220
You know your weather.
Yeah.

139
00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.250
Well what bothers me the most about this question is I feel like,

140
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:34.130
I feel like I don't do a good job of explaining this because what bums me out as

141
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.090
someone,
whoever wrote this question and it's a good question.
I get the question,

142
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.980
I get scared that the person that's listening to the question goes now Jocko

143
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:43.910
doesn't quite get it.

144
00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:48.350
He doesn't quite get the fact that there was this one guy who is part of the

145
00:07:48.351 --> 00:07:52.790
team who made this mistake and no one,

146
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:57.260
you know we just,
we can't hold his hand every time.
Like that's not my fault.

147
00:07:57.261 --> 00:08:01.940
It's not our team's fault.
When bill drop completely drops the ball.

148
00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:04.700
That's not my fault.
It's not anyone on the team's fault.

149
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.130
And my point is is exactly what you are saying.
Echo.

150
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.370
Yes it is.
And if you look at it,

151
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.670
when bill makes the mistake himself,

152
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.570
he's alone in a room and he supposed to,
you know,

153
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:26.260
he supposed to put part a on top of part B and Bolt them together.

154
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:27.980
That's his part of the job.

155
00:08:27.981 --> 00:08:31.880
He's alone in a room doing that and he doesn't do it right.

156
00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:33.230
That's 100% his fault.

157
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:38.650
The answer is no actually who's in charge of training him?

158
00:08:39.530 --> 00:08:43.310
Who's in charge of checking,
who not even in charge of WHO's responsible.

159
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:46.730
We are a team.
That means we work together.

160
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.870
That means we confirm that we know how to do our individual parts of the job.

161
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:54.260
That means we check and say,
hey bill,
are you good?
Hey Bill,

162
00:08:54.261 --> 00:08:56.970
let me check your first three that you do to make sure you understand what's

163
00:08:56.971 --> 00:09:01.740
happening.
We do this together as a team and it makes me feel like a failure.

164
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.690
That people have a hard time understanding this and,

165
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.990
and I know it's,
it can be a stretch,
it can be a stretch and you know,

166
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.530
I give all those examples,
hey,
the machine gunner shoots in the wrong direction.

167
00:09:13.531 --> 00:09:15.060
Who's fault is that?
It's not the machine.

168
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.820
The machine gunner literally pointed the machine gun in the wrong direction,

169
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.550
pulled the trigger and shot in the wrong direction.
Who's fault is it?

170
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:23.790
It's the squad leaders.
It's the fire team leaders.

171
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:27.150
It's the platoon leaders because they didn't make sure that he understood his

172
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:29.970
field of fire.
Make sure he understood how to operate his weapon.
And by the way,

173
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:35.130
there's a chance that the reason that bill screwed this up and bill is incapable

174
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.490
of putting these parts together correctly.
And if that is the situation,

175
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.600
guess what?

176
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.900
It is the responsibility of the team to either get him trained up to where he

177
00:09:42.901 --> 00:09:47.250
can't do it or to tell the leadership that this guy cannot these incapable of

178
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:49.980
doing the job and therefore he needs to not be here.

179
00:09:51.510 --> 00:09:55.650
That's what ownership is.
That's what extreme ownership is.

180
00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.120
I think I know what it is.
What,
what,

181
00:09:58.121 --> 00:10:02.760
what makes it confusing or sometimes kind of kind of slippery like to grasp,

182
00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:06.180
you know,
cause it depends on who you ask.

183
00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.330
So a lot of times the thing is when,
when it's the machine gun,
his fault.

184
00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.300
The thing is if I'm,
if I'm not even a human being,

185
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:16.500
I'm just the disembodied brain.
Okay,

186
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.920
it's the machine that is fault and the leader's fault and that it's everyone's

187
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:23.460
fault if I'm,
you know,
but,
but if you ask the individual person,

188
00:10:23.461 --> 00:10:25.660
cause he asked the machine gunner,
hey,
okay Jocko,

189
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.330
you're the machine gun and you shot in the wrong direction.

190
00:10:27.331 --> 00:10:30.560
And I asked you who's fault is that?
What are you going to say now leaders will,

191
00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:33.480
well it's your fault.
No,
well let me,
let me tell you right now,

192
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:38.640
there are plenty of people and definitely plenty of machine gunners that when

193
00:10:38.641 --> 00:10:40.950
they shoot that weapon in the wrong direction,
you know what they say?

194
00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.040
I didn't get a clear brief on what the field to fired where no one until I

195
00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:47.310
didn't see the,
the markers for what the range limits were.

196
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:50.490
I didn't know where the other blue forces were.
No one told me.

197
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.310
So they're looking at it like it actually isn't their fault.

198
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.040
Now you get some good machine.
And actually guess what?

199
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.150
When you have a guy that's a machine gunner that says,
what was my fault?

200
00:11:00.151 --> 00:11:01.560
It was my leader's fault.
You know what the leader says?

201
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.650
You know what the leader says?
What good is this?
A bad leader,

202
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:08.550
the leader in this team,
the leader in this team?
You know what he says?
No.

203
00:11:08.551 --> 00:11:10.980
It was the machine gunners flop.
Yeah,
that's right.

204
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.450
And now guess who's fault it was?
It was no one's fault.
Yeah.

205
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:15.000
The machine gunner thing is the boss's fault.

206
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:16.320
The boss thinks it was a machine gunner his fault.

207
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.420
Now who's going to fix the problem?
The answer is no one.
No one.
Yeah.

208
00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:22.170
When you get a good team,
the machine going to goes to my fault,

209
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:24.020
I should have paid better attention of leaders is my fault.

210
00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:28.560
I sh and now you have every one taking ownership of the problems.

211
00:11:28.561 --> 00:11:30.870
Yes.
Yeah,
and that's the way it's supposed to be,

212
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:33.270
but that's my point and that's why it makes it so nevermind.

213
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.810
You're destined body brain,
that's making decisions over here.

214
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.490
I'm saying this is why it's hard for people to understand.
That's why sometimes,

215
00:11:41.491 --> 00:11:45.360
and I'm with them.
I'm like,
I was there.
It's kind of like,
hmm.
It's kind of like,

216
00:11:45.361 --> 00:11:47.730
sure I'm tricking.
Extreme ownership,
you know,
the typical,

217
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:50.710
I'm taking extreme ownership at the end of the day,
we all know as well,

218
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.040
some bills for fault,
but the reason that it is

219
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.710
<v 0>so hard because if I ask,
okay,
we have three guys,</v>

220
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:59.140
one of those guys as a machine gunner,
the other guy's a leader,
the other guys,

221
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:03.400
just another team member.
Uh,
he's,
you know,
he's the,
the sniper or something.

222
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.550
If I say,
Hey,
this machine that a shot in the wrong direction,

223
00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.610
individual meetings,
I,
they all take extreme ownership.

224
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.530
All of them are down there in the game.
All of them.

225
00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.210
I asked you machine gunner,
who's fault is that?
What's he going to say?

226
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.350
You're my fault.
Okay,
next guy who's fault it fires you my fault.

227
00:12:20.351 --> 00:12:23.200
I should've done.
And the squad leader,
my fault,
I should have told them,
right?

228
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.120
Yes.
So it the re now go back to the disembody brain.
It's kind of like,
wait,

229
00:12:28.121 --> 00:12:32.470
wait,
wait,
wait.
So it's like he did it.
It's hard to grasp.

230
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:36.010
Like that one guy,

231
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:39.760
it is his fault thing.
It's not just his fault apparently,

232
00:12:39.761 --> 00:12:42.340
because everyone said it's their fault.
Right.

233
00:12:42.341 --> 00:12:45.070
So he was obviously his fault by weight.
It's everyone's fault kind of thing.

234
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.210
So when you're the guy and you're saying,
okay,
his fault it,

235
00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.250
that little thing creeps in your brain that's like,
yeah,
wait,
it is his fault.

236
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:55.240
Yeah.
You know,
you and your team.
Yeah,
yeah.
And you're wrong.

237
00:12:55.300 --> 00:12:59.710
And I'd need to do a better job of explaining that to people because I see

238
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:04.330
questions like this on a fairly regular basis,
which is,

239
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.710
hey,
really?
You know,
there's like,
Hey,
I get ownership.
But really?
Yeah,

240
00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:12.510
that's what it means.
The,
but really that you need to check yourself on.
Yeah.

241
00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:18.070
Because the reality is you're responsible.
Yeah.
You wait,

242
00:13:18.071 --> 00:13:19.570
but if I'm responsible,

243
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:22.930
what about the machine that he just said he's responsible machine gunner.

244
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:26.190
You're was,
I'm,
no,
but the machine gunner said he's responsible.

245
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.260
See what I'm saying though?
I think that's the feeling that that Jeff,

246
00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.900
you went that creep in and that's going to be a problem.
Yeah.

247
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.080
Probably ever seen office space.
Remember that?
Okay,
I have seen that.

248
00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.020
So really when you think about,
okay,

249
00:13:38.021 --> 00:13:42.190
what's the big thing that he has the movie remember is you okay,
let me,

250
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:46.030
let me remind you.
Okay.
So in the beginning they were like,
Hey Peter,

251
00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:50.650
you were putting cover sheets on the tps reports from now on or we've been doing

252
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:55.180
that.
You forgot to do that,
right?
So first lumbered comes,

253
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:58.510
his boss for slumbered comes,
he's like,
yeah,
you know,
saying,
Hey,
let me read.

254
00:13:58.511 --> 00:14:01.360
He didn't do it in a dick way.
Annoying for sure.
But he said,
hey,

255
00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.360
this is basically a reminder.
Did you get that memo?

256
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:06.250
We're putting cover sheets on the tps particularly,

257
00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:10.890
I just forgot it was the one time thing,
no problem.
And he's like,
cool,
all that,

258
00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:14.830
you know.
So if you just do that,
do that,
that'd be cool.
And he's like,
cool,

259
00:14:14.831 --> 00:14:17.440
no problem.
You saw,
I'll even give you another copy of that memo.

260
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.400
He almost like over did it.
Not almost.
He did overdo it.
So he left.

261
00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:25.660
And then the other boss boom,
who's like one level down,
he came.
Same deal.
Hey,

262
00:14:25.661 --> 00:14:30.070
we're putting,
did you get that memo?
TPS reports,
cover sheets now,
blah,
blah,
blah.

263
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.490
He's like,
I got the memo.
I forgot one time thing.
It's like,
yeah,
I'm just,

264
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.440
all those bosses were do,
doing,
making sure the problem got solved,

265
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.370
right.
Doing everything in their power.
Even his other,
his friends were like,
Hey,

266
00:14:42.371 --> 00:14:44.800
what's up?
I heard you guys,
you're having problems with your tps.

267
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:48.190
So they were just taking extreme ownership,
taking ownership of the problem,

268
00:14:48.191 --> 00:14:52.040
trying to solve it.
But we give them crap about it.
Who Do?
Who

269
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.680
<v 1>Do we give a movie in a movie somewhere?
Yeah.
Yeah,</v>

270
00:14:54.681 --> 00:14:57.590
because they're trying to make it funny duty.
I know.
I know,

271
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:02.020
but that's kind of comedy,
but yeah,
I know.
But it's ironic,
right?
It is.
Yes.

272
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.120
So I'm not even mad at lumber for that listing.
