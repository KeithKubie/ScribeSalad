00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:02.736
(COUGHS)

00:00:02.736 --> 00:00:04.805
BoJack! Well.

00:00:04.805 --> 00:00:06.573
Jesus, you look shitty.

00:00:06.573 --> 00:00:09.343
Have you been eating your guilt
this whole time?

00:00:09.343 --> 00:00:12.412
(ALL LAUGH)

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:14.948
Yeah, you don't look
so hot yourself, Herb.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:16.516
I have cancer.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.387
And hello.
Who's this stunning creature?

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:23.690
And what string of bad decisions
has placed you
in BoJack's orbit?

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.460
-Uh...
-This is Diane.
She's writing a book about me.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.995
Pleasure to meet you.

00:00:27.995 --> 00:00:30.397
Is your book called,
 Portrait of an Asshole?

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:33.800
(LAUGHS)
I kid. It's funny,
because he ruined my life.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.569
I joke. It's what I do.

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:37.371
Please, come in.
You're letting out
all the cancer.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.506
(LAUGHS)

00:00:39.506 --> 00:00:42.376
(FORCED LAUGH)

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:43.844
TODD:
Almost. Ah...

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:46.880
Almost there.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.550
-Ooh! Drive, drive, drive!
-Oh! Oh, no.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.519
-I can't turn the car around.
-(LAUGHS)

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:54.755
-Whoa!
-We've got two sacks
of Kardashian swag

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:55.923
and the fuzz on our heels.

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:59.426
Drive the goddamn car!

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.895
(COUGHS)

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.832
Hey, Herb, is that your Vitamix?

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.601
BoJack has one, too.

00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:10.737
I wonder if you guys have
strong opinions about it

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.372
one way or the other.

00:01:12.372 --> 00:01:13.774
Well, the stupid thing
was like 600 bucks.

00:01:13.774 --> 00:01:15.776
I have used mine
a grand total of zero times.

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.978
I got it a month
before I was diagnosed
with cancer.

00:01:17.978 --> 00:01:19.880
I don't give a shit
about being healthy anymore.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.882
I don't even have cancer,
and I don't use it.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:24.985
-So who's it for?
-Exactly.
What is so great about liquids?

00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.021
Every article I read now
is "juice this"
and "juice that."

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:30.424
You know why?
Juice controls the media.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:31.591
Hey-oh.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.727
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:01:33.727 --> 00:01:35.662
Can't this thing go any faster?

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.931
Uh, I'm going as fast as I can.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.767
(TIRES SCREECHING)

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:42.035
You're doing a great job.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:44.371
Kenzie, stop talking to him.

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:46.473
Why? He's being nice.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:49.376
Remember the number one rule
of the Celebrity Stealing Club--

00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:51.011
"No falling in love."

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:53.513
Ugh.
That's your rule for every club.

00:01:53.513 --> 00:01:55.115
It's a good rule.

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:57.484
Whoa. Whoa, guys.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.786
I'm sensing
a lot of hostility here.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:03.690
Maybe we should take
our masks off and actually talk.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.360
You want me to take
my mask off? Fine.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.528
Happy? I took my mask off.

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.930
Did you?

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.866
Because I think
you're still wearing a mask.
57
00:02:12,866 --&gt; 00:00:00,000
BOTH:
Oh.
