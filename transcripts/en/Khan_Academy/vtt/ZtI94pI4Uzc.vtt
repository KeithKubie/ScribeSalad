00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.180
So let's take another
implicit derivative

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.380
of the somewhat
crazy relationship.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.160
And I've graphed the
relationship here.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.860
As you can see, it is
actually quite bizarre.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.300
e to the x times y squared
is equal to x minus y.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.830
This is some at least in the
range that's depicted here,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.510
the x's and the y's that
satisfy this relationship.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.890
Well let's take the
derivative of both sides.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.634
So we'll apply our derivative
operator to both sides.

00:00:28.634 --> 00:00:30.050
And actually this
is a good chance

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.700
to maybe explore some
different notation.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.480
We tend to be using
that notation,

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.600
but oftentimes you'll see
a derivative operator that

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.270
just looks like a big
capital D. So maybe we'll

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.181
do that right over here.

00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:43.180
So let me make it clear.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.770
This is the equivalent
of saying d over dx.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.990
I'll just use this
big capital D operator

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.980
so that you are familiar
with the notation.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.950
And instead of using dy
dx for the derivative of y

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.084
with respect to x, I'm just
going to write that as y prime.

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:03.500
So we get a little
bit of practice

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.209
with different notation.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.990
So let's take the derivative
of this thing right over here.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.699
Well we're going to
apply the chain rule.

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:11.573
Actually, we're going
to apply the chain rule

00:01:11.573 --> 00:01:12.410
multiple times here.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.500
The derivative of e to
the something with respect

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.810
to that something
is going to be e

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.150
to the something
times the derivative

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.920
of that something
with respect to x.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.470
So times the derivative
of xy squared.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.810
So that's our left-hand side.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.050
We aren't done taking
the derivative yet.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.900
And on our right-hand side,
the derivative of x is just 1.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.580
And the derivative
with respect to x of y

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.660
is just going to be minus-- or
I could write-- negative dy dx.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.820
But instead of writing dy dx,
I'm going to write y prime.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.090
As you can tell, I like this
notation and this notation

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.050
more because it
makes it explicit

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.585
that I'm taking the
derivative with respect to x.

00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:05.210
Here, we just have
to assume that we're

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.990
taking the derivative
with respect to x.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.440
Here, we have to assume
that's the derivative of y

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.810
with respect to x.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.570
But anyway let's stick with
this notation right over here.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:23.190
Actually, let me make
all of my y primes,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.940
all my derivatives of
y with respect to x,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.070
let me make them pink
so I keep track of them.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.650
So once again,
this is going to be

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.050
equal to e to the xy squared
times the derivative of this.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.717
Well the derivative
of this, we can just

00:02:37.717 --> 00:02:40.175
use the product and actually
a little bit of the chain rule

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:40.690
here.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.640
So the derivative of x is just
1 times the second function.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.290
So it's going to
be times y squared.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.800
And then to that,
we're going to add

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.210
the product of the
first function which

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.040
is this x times the derivative
of y squared with respect to x.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.840
Well that's going to be
the derivative of y squared

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.000
with respect to y, which
is just going to be 2y

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.910
times the derivative
of y with respect

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.605
to x, which we are now
writing as y prime.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.840
And then that's going to be
equal to 1 minus y prime.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.120
And like we've
been doing, we now

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.920
have to just solve for y prime.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.850
So let's distribute
this exponential, this e

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.230
to the xy squared.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.950
And we get e, or maybe I
should say y squared times e

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.240
to the xy squared.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.420
So that's that.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:53.980
Plus 2xye to the xy squared.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.550
y prime, the derivative
of y with respect to x,

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.690
is equal to 1 minus the
derivative of y with respect

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:05.840
to x.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.530
Now let's get all of our
y primes on one side.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.680
So let's add y
prime to both sides.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.520
So let's add-- and
just to be clear,

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.620
I'm adding one y
prime to both sides.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.170
So let's add a y
prime to both sides.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.860
And let's subtract this
business from both sides.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:28.810
So let's subtract y
squared e to the xy squared

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.220
subtracting from both sides.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.880
So we're going to subtract y
squared e to the xy squared.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:45.750
And we are left
with 2xye to the xy

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.040
squared plus 1 times y prime.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.590
We had this many
y primes and then

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:56.480
we add another 1y prime so we
have this many plus 1 y primes.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.930
That's going to be equal
to-- well, I purposely

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.530
added y prime to both sides
and so we are left with 1

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.890
minus-- this is kind of a crazy
expression-- y squared times e

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.050
to the xy squared.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.470
And now we just have to
divide both sides by this.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.100
And we're left with the
derivative of y with respect

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.860
to x is equal to this, which
I will just copy and paste.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.250
Actually, let me
just rewrite it.

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:29.870
Scroll down a little bit.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.680
It's equal to 1
minus y squared e

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.620
to the xy squared
over this business.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.540
Let me get some more space.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:50.160
2xye to the xy squared plus 1.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.090
And we're done.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.950
It was kind of crazy, but
fundamentally no different

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:58.060
than what we've been doing
in the last few examples.
