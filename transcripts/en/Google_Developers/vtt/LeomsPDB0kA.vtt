PHILIP WALTON: Hey everybody.

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.410
I'm Phillip.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:02.540
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: And I'm Nick.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.220
PHILIP WALTON: And
today we're here

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.337
to talk about Universal
Analytics, which,

00:00:05.337 --> 00:00:07.670
as you might have heard, just
recently came out of beta.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.420
And we've had our public launch.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.990
And we've taken a
bunch of questions

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.650
from users and the community.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.900
And we wanted to just take
some time to answer them.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.130
And just give everyone
a general overview

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.300
of what Universal Analytics is.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.234
So Nick why don't you
talk about just what

00:00:21.234 --> 00:00:23.150
it is for maybe people
that haven't heard yet.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.810
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.140
So Universal Analytics is
a huge fundamental shift

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.740
for Google Analytics.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.940
Really came about with
the fact that today users

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.760
are using more devices than
ever to research and learn

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.860
about businesses.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.457
Now for in the list, this is
becoming really difficult.

00:00:38.457 --> 00:00:40.540
In the past, when you just
looked at your website,

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.137
it was easy to just
have web tracking.

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:44.720
But now as users are interacting
with your business across all

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.950
these touch points,
we needed to rethink

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.700
how analytics works to allow
customer businesses to actually

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.190
understand all the
different touch

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.775
points that users
are interacting.

00:00:53.775 --> 00:00:55.650
As well as understand
how users are ending up

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.980
across those touch points.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.750
So Universal Analytics
is really to solve

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.420
that problem of how we can
provide a better view of all

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.870
the touch points users are using
to interact with your business.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:05.620
PHILIP WALTON: OK.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.995
And so what are some of the
differences between Universal

00:01:07.995 --> 00:01:10.594
Analytics and maybe what we'll
call classic analytics, what

00:01:10.594 --> 00:01:12.010
it was before
Universal Analytics.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.010
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Well
what it really comes down

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.560
to some fundamental
technical things.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.270
One of the technical things
was that, in the past, when

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.120
the web was the
center of the world,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.810
it was that cookies were
using to persist information.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.220
And so all your campaign data,
and all of your visitor history

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.450
information, like how
many sessions you've had,

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.999
that was all stored
in the cookie.

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.540
So as soon as we start taking
that environment out of the web

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.920
and start talking about mobile,
and tablet, and just devices,

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.030
these cookies didn't
really translate well.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.970
So what we did is we
actually ripped out

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.810
a lot of the information,
all that state,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.870
that were using the cookies,
and we pushed it to the server.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.110
So now with Universal
Analytics there's

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.350
a very easy way you can
send data into the platform,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.030
regardless of the
device you're on.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.730
In fact, all you need is an ID
that identifies a user, as well

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.750
as the information
about that interaction,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.290
and you can now measure
any sort of touch point,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.120
regardless of it's mobile, a
tablet, kiosk, game console.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.606
It's all available to measure
now with Google Analytics.

00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:11.480
PHILIP WALTON: Right.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.380
Because before, if I had
a cookie my web browser,

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.324
but then I went and
used my phone later,

00:02:16.324 --> 00:02:18.740
there would be no way to know
that it was the same person.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.010
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.830
PHILIP WALTON: So now we can
solve that problem, the cross

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.470
device--

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.790
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Well,
it's a good question, yes.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.070
So the first thing
is we can actually

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.120
send the data from
these different devices.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.590
PHILIP WALTON: Right.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.923
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: The second
part of Universal Analytics

00:02:29.923 --> 00:02:32.310
is this feature we
call user ID override.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.570
And stability, if you
have a logged in user,

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.380
that you could
actually explicitly set

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.990
the ID of that user.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.460
So if they're
logged in to the web

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.810
and logged into the
mobile application,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.814
you could explicitly
set the same IDs,

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:46.730
so now we have the ability
to actually measure

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.150
this user across
multiple devices.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.050
PHILIP WALTON: So it was in
beta, and now it's not in beta.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.420
Now it's been publicly launched.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.610
So what does that mean?

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.010
What are the differences?

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.200
What can the users expect
now that's no longer beta?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.360
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right, so
this change took a lot of work.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.010
From a lot of engineering
effort to actually move

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.370
all our systems to use
Universal Analytics.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.780
So that took some time.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.422
With the public and
the launch, which

00:03:12.422 --> 00:03:13.880
we announced a
couple weeks ago, we

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.130
announced a couple
really key big things.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.990
First, it was
completely out of beta,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.940
so it's publicly
available for all users.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.430
The second thing is we
now achieved 100% feature

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:24.740
capability.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.520
So all the features that we
didn't support in the past,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.490
we now support.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.009
For example, re-marketing,
audience reports,

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:33.800
all these double click
integration features

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.200
are now natively supported
with Universal Analytics.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.741
PHILIP WALTON: And
to be clear, these

00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:40.240
were things that were
supported in classic Analytics,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.600
were not supported in the beta
phase of Universal Analytics,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.200
but now that's out of beta
these things are supported.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.830
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Exactly.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.720
PHILIP WALTON: So everything you
could do in classic analytics,

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.500
you can now do--

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.410
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: You can now
do in Universal Analytics.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.990
PHILIP WALTON: Great.

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.200
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: There's a
couple of small other things

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.780
that we did.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.580
One is the new experience
for all new properties

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.950
is that you'll always be
Universal Analytics by default.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.015
So that was a big thing.

00:04:01.015 --> 00:04:03.390
The other thing we also rolled
out, which is really nice,

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.870
is a feature we call time
zone based processing.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.130
That gives you the ability so
that the data analytics account

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.230
is now processed with
the time zone that's

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.090
configured for that view.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.399
In the past, it was all
Pacific time and now it's view.

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.154
So customers in
Japan and Australia

00:04:19.154 --> 00:04:20.820
are really loving
this, because now they

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.010
actually get fresher data.

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.940
The other thing is we
announced that we're

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.404
going to start publicly rolling
out the user ID override

00:04:27.404 --> 00:04:29.320
feature, which we've
talked about for a while,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.171
but we'll now actually
start rolling out.

00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:32.920
And then the last part
of our announcement

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.917
was the ability in the
measurement particle--

00:04:34.917 --> 00:04:36.750
again this is the way
you actually send data

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.760
from any device-- to override
the IP and user agent fields.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.990
This was a huge developer
feature request,

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.550
and allows you to now
proxy data from a server,

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.430
so you can now do server
to server communication.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.490
So with Universal Analytics
it's not just about devices.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.660
It's also about servers,
because they actually

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:54.960
have a lot of important data.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.820
We can now properly measure
that within analytics.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.460
PHILIP WALTON: Let's go
to some user questions.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.330
The most common
question that we got

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.830
was what will happen to
my data after I upgrade?

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.090
There's a little bit of fear.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.760
I am I going to lose some of it?

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.480
Is there going to be down time?

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.440
What would you say
to those users.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.315
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: So
that's a great question.

00:05:12.315 --> 00:05:15.090
The upgrade has
actually two steps.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.400
And the first step is that you
actually transfer processing

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.110
from classic to
Universal Analytics.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.590
The second step is then you
retag from the classic gajs

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.964
code to universal code,
which is analytics js.

00:05:27.964 --> 00:05:29.630
PHILIP WALTON: So
where do you transfer?

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:30.220
You said the first step.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.429
Where you do that first step?

00:05:31.429 --> 00:05:32.428
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:05:32.428 --> 00:05:33.920
So in the admin
interface, there's

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:36.430
a section under the
property, and if it's still

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.332
a classic property, you can
actually go in, and manually

00:05:39.332 --> 00:05:40.790
go through the
process, and say you

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.460
want to upgrade and
start to transfer

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.160
the processing from classic
to Universal Analytics.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.290
PHILIP WALTON: So do it
on the Google Analytics--

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.580
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: On the site.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.010
PHILIP WALTON: --website.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.290
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Yeah.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.580
And so when people actually
take their classic property

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.680
and transfer processing
to Universal Analytics,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.320
we see a barely-- we worked
really hard to make sure

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.500
that there was no
data inconsistencies.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.140
So people see potentially less
than 1% change in that one day,

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.560
but longer term
we still maintain

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.580
all of your visitor history.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:17.260
So if we know the user came
back to your site five times,

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:18.330
we still remember that.

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.850
And we still remember all
the campaign information.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:23.200
So it's a very small
change when you actually

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.629
transfer processing.

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.420
PHILIP WALTON: So that
step anybody can do.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.800
Anybody with access to--
with authorization to go

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.530
in and manage their
analytics account--

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.320
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Anybody
with admin access.

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.870
PHILIP WALTON: --can change it.

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.480
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Correct.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.100
PHILIP WALTON: So you said
there's a second part.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.433
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: The second
part of the upgrade process

00:06:37.433 --> 00:06:39.980
is to actually retag your
site with the classic code,

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.850
from gajs, to the new
universal code, analytics js.

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.170
And so that process is
sometimes more involved.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:48.972
And so you can actually
continue-- the way

00:06:48.972 --> 00:06:51.180
we've designed the systems
is that you could actually

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.310
continue sending the classic
gajs data into Universal

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.490
Analytics and we'll process it.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:58.900
So that's still works.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.480
PHILIP WALTON: So that segues
nicely into the next question

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:03.089
that we got a lot.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.880
Do I have to change
the code of my website?

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.260
And so it sounds like
the answer is no.

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.900
You don't really have to change
the code of your website.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.570
At least not right now.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.010
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right now, you
don't have to change the code.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:11.600
We've really designed
it work well.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.180
And we know that
re-implementing tracking code

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.790
can be very difficult.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:17.970
So what we've
actually even designed

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.810
is that you could actually
implement on the same website.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:22.180
You can partially retag.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.560
Part of the website
can be classic gajs

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.490
and the other part
can be Analytics js.

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.780
You can't have the same page.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.446
But you can have them
on different pages

00:07:29.446 --> 00:07:31.190
sending data to
the same property.

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.620
So if you can't actually
get to your whole site,

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.720
you can actually start
implementing analytics js

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.928
and getting some of the
features of that new tracking

00:07:37.928 --> 00:07:39.740
code on this those pages.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.840
Now there is kind of
a broader story here,

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.380
and what we announced
was the public launch

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:47.290
of Universal Analytics.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.840
Our goal for this project
is to actually get

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.310
100% of Google
Analytics properties

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.640
to be processing by
Universal Analytics.

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.810
And that's a huge goal.

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:58.920
And we have a lot of great
people who are opting in.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.370
The other part of it is
that, over time, we'll

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.530
be manually
transferring properties

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:07.380
to Universal Analytics.

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.570
And so once 100 people actually
move to Universal Analytics,

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.750
we will then enter the next
phase of the upgrade process.

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:18.572
And that will actually
be where we announce

00:08:18.572 --> 00:08:20.280
that Universal Analytics
is the operating

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.060
standard for all customers.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.400
And at that point, we will
announce to deprecation gajs.

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.720
And so what that
means is that we

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.310
will continue to support
processing data from gajs,

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:34.960
the classic code, for
a minimum of two years.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.950
PHILIP WALTON: So if I
do nothing right now,

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.900
there's a chance that
everything will just

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.860
be fine for some
time to come now.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.699
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: For
like 2 and 1/2 years.

00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:45.490
PHILIP WALTON: You
probably should upgrade,

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.242
but it's not urgent
if you can't.

00:08:48.242 --> 00:08:50.200
If you don't have the
beans to do it right now.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:50.810
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
That being said

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.090
there are a lot of new
features that we're

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:53.480
adding to Analytics js.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.740
And actually the way we're
developing product now

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.810
is that all new features will
be Universal Analytics only.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.717
So over time, there
will be huge feature gap

00:09:00.717 --> 00:09:01.550
between old and new.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.040
So we do encourage
everybody to actually retag

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.442
when they have the opportunity.

00:09:06.442 --> 00:09:07.900
PHILIP WALTON: So
the next question

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.900
we addressed it a
little bit already,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.830
but I mentioned
that a lot of users

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.770
asked during beta-- some
users were recommended

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.450
not to upgrade,
because certain things

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:19.180
weren't available to them.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.540
And right now is there
is any reason why

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.360
somebody shouldn't upgrade?

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.990
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right now we
think everybody should upgrade.

00:09:24.990 --> 00:09:27.323
So the big thing was that we
didn't have all the feature

00:09:27.323 --> 00:09:27.920
support.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.572
But with the public launch
we support all the features.

00:09:30.572 --> 00:09:32.280
Now is the best time
to start considering

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.790
planning of how to upgrade.

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:35.460
Again, it's a 2-step process.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.230
The processing
part of it can just

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.610
be done by the admin
with a couple clicks.

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:42.020
The retagging, you can
still wait for a later time.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.650
But it's definitely something
people should looking into.

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.910
PHILIP WALTON: So you
mentioned that some people were

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.420
going to get
automatically upgraded.

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:52.480
So that might sound
scary to some people,

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.672
maybe they don't
want to upgrade.

00:09:54.672 --> 00:09:55.880
Should be worried about that.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.570
That's kind of the next
question that was coming up.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.236
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
It's a great question.

00:09:59.236 --> 00:10:01.700
And so again, the
goal is that we

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.420
want to bring great
features and products

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.550
on Universal
Analytics to market.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.500
So the goal is to get
100% of all our properties

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.420
to using Universal Analytics.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.040
We know some people
will upgrade,

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.510
or some people will
do the transferring.

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:16.230
But for the customers
who don't, we

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.760
will start auto transferring
those properties.

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.520
And again, because we
have full feature support,

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.150
there's nothing to worry that
you will be missing features.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.355
Because we're processing
all the classic data

00:10:26.355 --> 00:10:27.430
that you're spending.

00:10:27.430 --> 00:10:30.340
Again, there will be
minimal data discrepancies.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.930
We actually have now
in the change log--

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.800
in your analytics account
management change log,

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.960
we actually show when
the transfer has started.

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.390
So if Google has initiated
this for your property,

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.680
you can actually see
this in that change.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.820
But the goal here is that
way because the impact is

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.410
so small for doing
the transfer, we'll

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.819
just go ahead and
start transfer.

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:51.610
PHILIP WALTON: And as
we already mentioned,

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.480
because the old
code on your website

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.610
still works in
Universal Analytics.

00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.420
If Google auto
transfers somebody

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.590
and they're not even
aware of it, it's fine.

00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:01.090
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
It should be fine.

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:02.760
PHILIP WALTON: Nothing happens.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.150
So the next question is
when will this happen?

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.520
When will people
start being forced

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.787
that currently haven't
made the switch yet?

00:11:11.787 --> 00:11:14.370
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right, so when
will we auto transfer people?

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:15.203
PHILIP WALTON: Yeah.

00:11:15.203 --> 00:11:17.810
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: So we're
working on a long term plan.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:18.900
There's a lot of users.

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.420
What we'll be doing is for
sites that send us more data,

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.710
we'll be increasingly
transferring them

00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:27.770
to Universal Analytics.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.474
Our goal is then to--
certain customers

00:11:30.474 --> 00:11:32.265
have different integrations
with analytics,

00:11:32.265 --> 00:11:33.930
like AdSense, AdWords.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.700
So then we'll go to that phase.

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.597
And then finally, the last part
of it is our premium customers.

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:40.680
We're going to give our
premium customers the most

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.530
time to actually go in
and manually do this

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:47.180
or to make sure everything's OK.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:49.320
PHILIP WALTON: Great.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.522
So some people have asked.

00:11:50.522 --> 00:11:52.480
If I upgrade a property
to Universal Analytics,

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.494
will my automated
reports still work?

00:11:54.494 --> 00:11:55.410
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Yes.

00:11:55.410 --> 00:11:57.390
Everything in the product
will continue to work.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:59.223
PHILIP WALTON: So the
API, just to be clear,

00:11:59.223 --> 00:12:01.520
the API has not changed,
the reporting API.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:01.790
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:02.970
PHILIP WALTON: It's
just the way the data is

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:04.460
being collected that's changed.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:05.959
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
The way we collect

00:12:05.959 --> 00:12:08.580
data and the way we
process data has changed.

00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:13.330
The actual reporting continues
to use the same process data.

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:15.210
So that will all be transparent.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.717
All the scheduled reports
of the product, or the API,

00:12:17.717 --> 00:12:19.050
or even the reports [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:20.300
Everything will be consistent.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.130
PHILIP WALTON: And even if I've
written my own application that

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:26.564
uses the API on some schedule
to get new data every once

00:12:26.564 --> 00:12:28.230
in awhile, that
shouldn't change at all.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.910
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
That won't change.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:30.770
PHILIP WALTON:
Won't be affected.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.350
Great.

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:37.180
So one question we had was
that Classic Analytics supports

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:39.070
features like custom variables.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.790
Now in Universal Analytics,
we don't have custom variables

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:43.290
anymore.

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:45.230
We have something called
custom dimensions.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:46.420
Do you want to talk a
little bit about that?

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:48.820
And are those things being
automatically transferred?

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.300
Or how does that work?

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.300
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.264
So custom variables was
our original feature

00:12:53.264 --> 00:12:55.180
that allowed you to bring
your custom business

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:57.320
data through the tracking code.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:01.150
Custom dimensions is the next
evolution of that future.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.560
And unfortunately,
these two features,

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:07.360
we're not able to make them
compatible with one another.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.480
So the way it works
in Universal Analytics

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.680
is that when you transfer,
or if you are using Analytics

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.710
property, you can still
send custom variable data

00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:17.240
with the classic tracking code.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.750
It will continue to process
that just as we did in the past.

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:25.160
But if you start using Analytics
js, the new Universal Analytics

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:26.970
tracking code,
that does not have

00:13:26.970 --> 00:13:28.340
support for custom variables.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.860
It only has support
for custom dimensions.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:34.290
So there is a trade off
between when should you

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:36.020
start moving from
custom variables

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:36.979
to customer dimensions.

00:13:36.979 --> 00:13:38.478
And again, this is
something that we

00:13:38.478 --> 00:13:40.590
tried really hard to figure
out, a migration path.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.644
And it just didn't quite
work with the new model.

00:13:42.644 --> 00:13:44.060
And of course the
new model's more

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.830
flexible for a bunch of
things that we're working on.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:49.734
But longer term, we
would love for people

00:13:49.734 --> 00:13:51.150
to come up with a
plan on how they

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.270
can move from variables
to dimensions.

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:54.920
PHILIP WALTON: Great.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:14:00.240
So are there really any reasons
at all why somebody shouldn't

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.010
upgrade to Universal Analytics?

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:05.180
If somebody came in here
and they were skeptical,

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.964
they had the most
customized site possible?

00:14:07.964 --> 00:14:09.380
What would you say
to that person?

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.213
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: Right,
so we've tested it.

00:14:11.213 --> 00:14:13.720
We have 100% feature support.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.810
We really think at
this point everybody's

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:18.370
ready to start doing
the upgrade process.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.087
So if anybody hasn't
done it already,

00:14:20.087 --> 00:14:21.920
it's definitely something
to take a look at.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.630
And of course, for people
who just don't have the time

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.250
or is not really using
Analytics anymore unfortunately,

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.940
we'll be auto transferring
those properties

00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.180
over the next coming months.

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:31.930
PHILIP WALTON: OK.

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.490
So if people had questions,
wanted more information,

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:36.366
where should they go?

00:14:36.366 --> 00:14:38.031
NICK MIHAILOVSKI:
It's a great question.

00:14:38.031 --> 00:14:39.450
So we've really tried.

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:43.025
With these big platform changes
there's a lot of questions.

00:14:43.025 --> 00:14:45.860
So we have a couple great
resources for people to use.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.570
The first one is if you don't
know what Universal Analytics

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.800
is, we have a help center
that can help articulate

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.270
all the features and benefits.

00:14:52.270 --> 00:14:54.880
If you're specifically looking
for information on the upgrade,

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.940
we actually have a
whole upgrade center

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.747
that really talks you through
the benefits, the time lines.

00:14:59.747 --> 00:15:01.580
We've actually published
the whole timelines

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.420
that we've talked about.

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.720
It also has specific migration
guides that actually talk you

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:10.120
through what code changes you
need to do when you retag.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.570
Finally, for people who
still have questions,--

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:14.320
there's always people
who have questions--

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.607
we actually have a public Google
group for upgrade that people

00:15:17.607 --> 00:15:19.940
can actually ask questions
and our engineers take a look

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.700
at them to make sure
if there's any bugs,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.297
that we're actually
addressing them.

00:15:23.297 --> 00:15:25.380
PHILIP WALTON: Well thanks
everybody for watching.

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.754
Hopefully you learned something
about Universe Analytics.

00:15:27.754 --> 00:15:29.487
Once again, if you
have some questions.

00:15:29.487 --> 00:15:31.070
The resources that
Nick just mentioned

00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.610
are great place to look.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:34.220
And once again,
my name is Philip.

00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.511
NICK MIHAILOVSKI: And I'm Nick.

00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:37.180
And I hope you
have a great time.
