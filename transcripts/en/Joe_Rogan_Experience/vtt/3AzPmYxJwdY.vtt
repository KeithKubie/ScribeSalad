1
00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.670
Out of 10 were lot of ladies and gentlemen,
what's up?
It's hilarious.

2
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:06.610
He and the two of you guys together when you're shot,

3
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.920
when he told me he was your son,
first of all,
he instantly became my friend.

4
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.680
Second of all,
I was like,
what is it like having John Witherspoon as a dad?

5
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.970
That'd be crazy.
And mind you,
I only told you because he was asking me,

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.220
because I go to the clubs all the time,
hanging out in one.
Then,
you know,

7
00:00:23.221 --> 00:00:26.490
just kicking it with friends and he said,
well,
who's at the club now take?

8
00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.710
He's like,
he was telling you like JD who?

9
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.510
Who is it that a who's who to bring her?
They who?

10
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.260
The funny one who didn't want him to it and I'm like,
I was like,

11
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:36.070
I mean there's a bunch of them just like,
you know,
Brendan this.

12
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.550
Then I said Joe was always there.
He's got a bunch of people come to the show.

13
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:41.770
He's like Joe Rogan.
I know Joe.
That's my man.
My man.

14
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.560
We worked together when I was and he told me to say,
yeah,

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.240
yeah,
I saw you.
I think was Caroline's in New York.
We were doing,

16
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:55.270
I was doing like the eight and you were doing a 10 or something like that to

17
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:59.070
show,
but it probably was on a Thursday.
You know,
you probably did.

18
00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.360
Something was happening.
We are doing it close to each other a long time ago.

19
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.850
Long time ago.
Maybe.
Maybe 15 years ago.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Okay.

20
00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.470
I haven't been there in the wild.
I work,
I haven't been in New York in a while.

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.290
I started going in New York.
It's a weird one.
If you done,

22
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.010
have you done Kevin Dunn,
Carolina touristy,

23
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:20.880
all tourists and foreigners feels like,
right?
Right in Times Square,
right?
Yeah.

24
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.570
It doesn't feel like you're doing standup in New York.
Feels it feels weird.

25
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.380
It feels like what people want New York to be,
but they're from somewhere else.

26
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:32.940
Like a good percentage of them are wild.
Amala that's great.
Great Club.

27
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.870
Oh yeah.
They just,
you know,
it's different than the seller or you know,

28
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.460
danger fields is my favorite.

29
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700
Joey Diaz was just down there and he said he did Dangerfield like five,

30
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:45.330
six nights.
I never did Dangerfield.
Nobody does Dangerfield?
No,

31
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.770
it's half full all the time.
It's amazing that they're still around.

32
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.460
They're still around.
Somebody's gotta be sound coke

33
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.510
all the time to keep that place like that.
Um,

34
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.190
but the name alone brought probably brings people in,
but it's an iconic place,

35
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:04.680
man.
Yeah.
I like New York.

36
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.090
I just haven't been back to since Letterman gone.
I don't go do his show anymore.

37
00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.610
I hadn't been to Carolina and then about three years.
Four years.
But you,

38
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.220
you do a lot of clubs in the room while we were talking about 40,
40 some clubs.

39
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.380
Wow.
To clubs a year.
You know,

40
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:24.381
my agents come to my house in January and they tell me all the clubs I got that

41
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.740
year.
They changed what date we go over.
We go over hip at one.
All right.

42
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.580
June 15 June.
You're going to be in soon.
Y'All make the money be going get,
yeah.

43
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.720
Okay.
That's good.
Yeah.
That's the goal.
That's the goal.
So we do 47 club.
I said,

44
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:43.180
man,
this is too much work.
Ain't been 52 weeks in a year.
Yeah,
that's crazy.

45
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:48.060
I got to have some time off.
What about me?
Yo worried about this money,

46
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.440
but when you have time off,
all you do is complain about not being on the road,

47
00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.450
complaining about people telling me what to eat,
what to drink.
Oh my goodness.

48
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.420
I'd like to get me a little taste night.

49
00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.150
The need little taste.
That's what I'm saying.

50
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.880
Everybody look,
keep the wolf off your back.
That's right.
So I give him,
he,

51
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.340
I get me a little tastes.
The real problem is that travel though.

52
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:13.760
That's what we're talking.
It's too much.

53
00:03:13.761 --> 00:03:16.150
It's too little air travel over and over and over again.

54
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.630
And then we were freaking out about eight 37 and you were explaining to us that

55
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.170
yeah,

56
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.170
mostly they use them in overseas and some South Wales African countries and in

57
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.910
Asian country they use them.
Well,
they had like two planes that just got lost,

58
00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.870
right.
One from Malaysia.

59
00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.510
I think there's all pilot light and doing all that.

60
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.730
Lex Friedman is a software engineer and uh,
he's,

61
00:03:39.731 --> 00:03:43.750
he specializes in AI as a professor at Mit.
And he was explaining to me,

62
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.800
it's basically the software glitch was making it nose dive.
Yeah.
Yeah.

63
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.860
That's not,
that's not something I would want to hear.

64
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.540
I when I paid 2100 800 to get my seat.
If you're a software engineer,
you have to,

65
00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.740
you would have to up the pilot or a copilot to let them know like,
hey,

66
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.170
someone has to,
obviously they all know what they're doing in the cockpit,

67
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:05.530
but does someone know what to do with the computers going down?

68
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.910
Like it's a really good question.

69
00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.850
Do they have any training in how to reboot computers or,

70
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.870
or is there a bypass or a work around for the computers?
LEX does.

71
00:04:13.871 --> 00:04:17.860
Artificial intelligence is mostly what he does.
He works on like cars,

72
00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:19.570
autonomous cars and planes and stuff.

73
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.450
And he was talking about as these things get more and more updated,

74
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.320
you just have glitches happen.
Happens all the time with your phone.
Right?

75
00:04:26.321 --> 00:04:27.154
You get a,

76
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.420
a new bug and Twitter just crash on you all the time and they release an update.

77
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.570
But if you're on a fucking plane,
you,
what are you doing?
Yeah.

78
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:38.290
And how do you react?
What does it mean?
How do you react?
Wow.

79
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.350
You'd have to go through a flight simulation.
It's scary.

80
00:04:41.351 --> 00:04:43.180
There's a bug in the plane.
Here we go,

81
00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.980
run over all that software before they put it on a plane.
You know they had um,

82
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.500
the plane that crash.
What was the last plane?
Crack.
That was where in Africa,

83
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.720
I dunno,
there was two.
One was was one.
Russia?
No,

84
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.960
Russia.
No,
I think it was an Africa.
Anyway,

85
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.970
those pilots are trained to the end.
They to the hilt.
They train new pilots,

86
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.050
but they don't know themselves.
Some of the guys who was training to people,

87
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.100
what the heck's going on?

88
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.640
It was a pilot that was off work that was on the plane just before this plane

89
00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.710
crash.
Same plane.

90
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.310
They had trouble before and he came out of his seat and went up to the cockpit

91
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.390
and the cockpit and,
and say the plane.
She knew what to do.

92
00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.430
He'd only want to know what to do on a plan B in that fucking plane.

93
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.910
Looking down the aisle and watching that guy walk into the,
what are you doing?

94
00:05:40.911 --> 00:05:44.140
I pick a no,
you don't see no one.
They they protect that though.

95
00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.790
They put the food cart in front of the yeah.
Yeah.
Food caught stopping.

96
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.960
Anybody now they got a bolt on the door.
Those,

97
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.270
all those doors you had the cockpit pilot is in the bathroom taking a booboo.

98
00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.160
Yeah.
That's what that they don't have their own pilots bathroom.
No.

99
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.750
No Nigga we can fit it.
Can't fit on a plane.
Blocked the area.

100
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.720
Ready to put that full card dance.
He has seen that many times.

101
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:08.300
That's a weird move.
I don't you have like a dedicated thing for it.

102
00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:11.240
Why is the food cart yeah.
The thing you don't,
you have like a shit of a gate.

103
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.360
Someone called leap that right.
Should have another door.

104
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:17.240
Just like the guide on the carpet.
Yeah.
They should have like some like uh,

105
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.000
like you know they had do the one of those metal gates in front of those doors.

106
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:21.710
Windows.
Yeah.
One of those click,

107
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:24.620
clamp it down where they knew that didn't work because they had the riot in

108
00:06:24.621 --> 00:06:28.350
[inaudible] 66 and they told all them down.
Oh,
the gates on the,
Oh yeah,

109
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.150
I remember that.
I was watching them guide.

110
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.670
Something's due to the loc that fucking flew open.
Yeah.

111
00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.120
What could you do to stop someone from bum rush in the cockpit?

112
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:41.890
Those flight attendants are not going to stop.
No,
no hill.
Well,

113
00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.350
they should probably prepare planes with a flight attendant who has training

114
00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:46.131
like that in the future,

115
00:06:46.131 --> 00:06:49.820
like a female or male who's job that's too much with money.

116
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.740
Too much money.
Too much money.
Do it.
That's your private security.

117
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.790
The pilot is locked in the bathroom.
The other pilot and the store,

118
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:03.791
this is locked in the India booth where they fly the plane so you ain't getting

119
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:08.870
in there anyway,
I guess.
Yeah.
Unless when the pilot come up to the bathroom,

120
00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:14.910
then he's not when he opened the door,
but they got other guys got,

121
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.490
the students got to come out.
He got to go in.
It's just too complicated.

122
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:22.400
Now being the people that's sitting down going to know what's happening.
Again,

123
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.760
going to jump up.
I know somebody this,
that's chaos on a plane.

124
00:07:25.761 --> 00:07:28.400
If you start seeing all that that you're talking about,

125
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.440
well don't you think turbulence?
Chaos.
I was on a plane once.

126
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.810
Two dudes almost got into a fight.
The lady stopped serving them.

127
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:40.650
One guy was Paul,
he was putting his luggage in a spot above another dude's hat.

128
00:07:40.651 --> 00:07:42.620
And the guy said,
that's from my stuff.
And he said,
no,

129
00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.760
get whoever gets there first is the one that gets it.
And he's like bullshit.

130
00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.060
And he's like grabbing his arm and like,
you know,
like physical for a second.

131
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.650
I had a,
um,
you know,
I took my bag off to get some out of my bed.

132
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.660
I,
I'm on the plane first.
Some guy walked past me and shit.
Okay.

133
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.110
And then you look up [inaudible] he gonna put it,
hey bro,
she ain't back yet.

134
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.000
That go on up there.
He said,
well shoot,
it headed up,
down.

135
00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.200
I looked at this shocking.
He chose Shiree sure.

136
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.940
And he got in his seat and he's sitting next to me too.
Oh for the whole flight.

137
00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:22.460
He ain't shit man man.
Get the hell out of my way.

138
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.270
Take that crap out of here.
He thought I was a crazy man.
I forgot.
Huh?

139
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.430
I wasn't tough.
I get that.
No I wouldn't.
I'm on the plane is full now.
Yeah.

140
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:35.370
He one seat next to me open.
He gonna put this stuff down.

141
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.620
I'm going to get my stuff.
Trying to find my earphones

142
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.880
punk with putting stuff up there in front of boy.
You could just come in.

143
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:47.180
They have to place for you above my head.
I'm in my bag.

144
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.120
You don't think that's my day cause you were cause you were going through your

145
00:08:50.121 --> 00:08:53.000
bag to put their stuff up there looking for my thing.

146
00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:56.010
People just look for an opportunity to be a dick.
Yeah.
I think

147
00:08:56.010 --> 00:09:00.210
<v 1>planes are the closest that people get to walking.
That emulates road rage.
Yeah.</v>

148
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:02.190
The line.
Yes.
It's the closest thing.

149
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:06.300
Like when people get up and they get up too soon and then like they're pushing

150
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:10.020
forward already and you're like,
come on man.
Let everybody get up in the line.

151
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:12.640
Some people like Naya push through.
Yeah,
I was,

152
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.990
I was at the gas station just now and you know how they have the big oil
tankers,

153
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:19.620
they have to bring the gas to the gas station.
They were blocking,

154
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.610
they were blocking in where people needed to go to park.
And the guy who was,
uh,

155
00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.210
there was telling me that some lady was just there and she was mad at him cause

156
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:31.770
he pulled in a few minutes after she parked to get gas in the car and he was

157
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:34.980
saying that,
uh,
she was like,
you're blocking me and he's like,
lady,

158
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:37.110
I am either going to block you in or I'm blocking the street.

159
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.300
I can't block the full street with all the traffic.

160
00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.520
And then by the time she was ready to go,

161
00:09:41.521 --> 00:09:45.210
she finally was like nudging her way out of the gas station and the guy was

162
00:09:45.211 --> 00:09:48.100
trying to help her and she's like,
don't help me.
I don't need your help mark.

163
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:50.700
And she's like,
and he said,
I'm sorry,
it's going to be a minute.
She's like,

164
00:09:50.701 --> 00:09:52.530
I don't got a minute.
And then I asked him,
I was like,

165
00:09:52.531 --> 00:09:55.350
what kind of car is he driving?
He was like,
he was like a range rover,

166
00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:57.300
new new ranger.
I'm like,
oh,
she's got plenty of tasks.

167
00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:00.660
So one guy put his seat

168
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.000
<v 0>back before the plane took off.
You know,
you put and get comfortable here,</v>

169
00:10:05.001 --> 00:10:08.060
this seat all the way back into some crazy.
Hey Buddy.
Hey,

170
00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:13.370
you cannot put your seat back before the plane get up in the air.
You see

171
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:17.360
got you guys on dude,
somebody's leg.

172
00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.700
I got the back of the chair on someone's getting said buddy,

173
00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:22.310
I had been doing this for 20 and 30 years.
Yeah,

174
00:10:22.311 --> 00:10:24.740
I don't give a fuck what you been doing.
You cannot do it today.

175
00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:29.880
<v 1>They got into a spat.
Oh Man,
I got into passengers to passengers.</v>

176
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:34.040
That's what my was one passenger plane cop.
Cop.

177
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.250
Yeah.
There's,
there's videos of that all the time though.
I remember I saw one,
uh,

178
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:44.190
one of them out here leaving like a,
or coming into or leaving Burbank and uh,

179
00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:47.940
it was like two guys who either the plane just landed or they were just about

180
00:10:47.941 --> 00:10:52.290
takeoff and got into a full fist fight over mind you as a southwest flight over

181
00:10:52.291 --> 00:10:55.620
a seat that didn't belong to anyone,
you know,
because over there at that airport,

182
00:10:55.650 --> 00:10:59.370
they're probably going from Burbank to Vegas.
And then dude was like,
hey man,

183
00:10:59.371 --> 00:11:02.340
I'm taking a seat.
No,
no,
that's mine.
And the next thing you know,
it's,
it's a,

184
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.880
it's a fight in between the idol and it's crazy that they serve you boots on the

185
00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:10.050
plane.
You can get drunk at the airport,
you can get calls,
a drug,

186
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.970
and that drug is everywhere.
There's flying.
As he set up,
it's 100% set up and

187
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:18.380
<v 0>bring any alcohol through security.</v>

188
00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:22.820
Know that we usually look on secured,
we gonna use alcohol.
Yeah,

189
00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:27.900
it's hilarious.
And they'll pour that stuff brother.
Then they get Dick,

190
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.640
they all know me on the plane,
so they give me a bottle of the goal.

191
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:38.300
You think of man,
just the wooden spoon had wrap it up in a towel.

192
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.020
I can tell what I,
I'm like I'm gonna sneak out of here with this big as bottle.

193
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:48.190
I do it.
I put her in there.
Fuck it man.
I get it.
You know,

194
00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:50.840
you know they don't want like liquid bombs or some shit.

195
00:11:50.841 --> 00:11:54.760
They don't want you to bring in some no.
Yeah,
right it,
I got it.
It's true.

196
00:11:54.810 --> 00:11:56.860
I wish that wasn't something you ever had to think about.

197
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.960
But if it happens once every few years,

198
00:11:58.961 --> 00:12:01.950
it's enough that you gotta have to think about it.
Yeah.

199
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.860
You know I had unit can't have ounces,

200
00:12:05.861 --> 00:12:09.100
three ounces liquid in your bay,

201
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:13.270
so I had a three ounce bottle of my expensive Cologne,

202
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.780
but I use half of it so I ain't got no three hours.
I got,

203
00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.770
I got one and a half now we can take the whole thing.

204
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:25.460
Got You.
Okay Michael on that come calling me about Brianna dollars,

205
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.450

I'm taking $150 just go cause you got,

206
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.520
they took my colognes.

207
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.560
You spray it on yourself before getting on one more pumped in road.

208
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:38.770
I spray this on everybody else too.
That was,
that was,

209
00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.730
but they serious about that.
Yeah.
Some dude's still rock Cologne.

210
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:47.920
I work alone heavy.
I like,
oh,
I get it from Bergdorf Goodman.
I get this stuff.

211
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:48.940
She,
I grew up,

212
00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.850
it was a lot of pimps around the neighborhood and they wore the best cologne.

213
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.690
Them dudes was shot on a heavy,
heavy,
shiny.
No,
no,

214
00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:02.170
and he hit him.
Say it like this.
So when I got older,
that's what I would do.

215
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:05.620
I get clone.
Like
smacking yourself.

216
00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.580
Yes.
Pimps used to crack me up,
but it would be so sharp.
Yeah.

217
00:13:10.830 --> 00:13:15.360
Shoes be so shiny and they get that Cologne.
You smell me talking to him.

218
00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.140
He felt that boy smell good.
I'm broke.

219
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:21.640
I got about 3 cents in my pocket and holes on the bottom of my shoes and then

220
00:13:21.641 --> 00:13:24.420
pimps be at the end,
felt like,
yeah,
he's going to be out on a Monday.

221
00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.950
Just hang out again and keep doing what you're telling them.

222
00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:31.690
Keep doing what you're doing.
Oh boy.
UFC pimps up hoes down.

223
00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:37.030
Yo.
Yeah,
I know.
What's your name?
Real life.
It's like,

224
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:41.620
you know,
weird light.
It's up.
It isn't some clowns.

225
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.870
They like clowns.
They get there who get together and they,
they sweat.
They do.

226
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:50.700
That's what,
and that's where he lived.
I used to be around 12th Street.
You know,

227
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:55.370
you're the one in Detroit.
You Do,
you know I'm not well street,
uh,

228
00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:59.380
black bottom.
They called one place called black bottom.
Hasting Street.

229
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.720
All pimps and hoes.

230
00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.500
They had them big old had on and they didn't have back then,

231
00:14:05.501 --> 00:14:09.680
they didn't have high heel shoes on.
You know them,
what do you call it?
Yeah.

232
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.980
Detroit was booming.
Oh yeah.

233
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.880
Detroit fell off quicker than any city in the western world in terms of like,

234
00:14:18.071 --> 00:14:22.180
it was the richest city in the world.
They white of the card.
Yeah.
Motor city.

235
00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:28.000
Yeah.
Because the people,
the factories closed,
the factories closed.

236
00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:32.890
People had put their money into the house.
The car factory money.
Yeah.

237
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:36.400
They get that loan because you've got that.
You've been here 15 years,

238
00:14:36.401 --> 00:14:38.220
you're getting a good records,
you've got a good things,

239
00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:41.070
they give you a car and give you an a and a home.

240
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:44.980
But when that's like a failed board and people,
oh my God,
what am I gonna do?

241
00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.230
What am I gonna do?
What caused it?
Do you know?

242
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.650
I mean obviously I threes move manufacturing,

243
00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.810
moving to Mexico and other countries,
all that stuff.

244
00:14:53.811 --> 00:14:56.660
People have been to that for themselves.
Yeah.

245
00:14:56.790 --> 00:15:01.520
But in remoters full it him themselves.
But a lot of companies are still there.

246
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:06.470
It's just the nine just to bend them.
But like a lot of car companies,
you know,

247
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:10.400
like Ford,
right?
Gentleman,
not like it used to be GM Pratt gives you,

248
00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.300
they're still there,
but they're there in a much more limited role.

249
00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.430
But it's their own,
like the,
the,

250
00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:20.180
the what like the base or kind of like a warehouse or maybe they moved that to,

251
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.700
maybe they're,
you know,
that show top gear.
Yeah,

252
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:25.460
they do a new show called the grand tour.

253
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:29.570
They do it on Amazon and they did one episode where they went to Detroit and uh,

254
00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:32.480
they were in Detroit.
They bought a house for like two grand.
Oh yeah.

255
00:15:32.481 --> 00:15:37.280
You get a whole house,
so you get $6,000 six to that I think too,

256
00:15:37.281 --> 00:15:42.200
that can whole house like a house house.
You could live in it like,
yeah.
Oh yeah.

257
00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:46.610
It wasn't a bad house.
It needed some work.
But everybody moved.

258
00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.850
But nobody's there.
But he's gone.
Everybody that the,

259
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.850
when we were there when we drove through,

260
00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:54.290
it was like the amount of giant warehouses that are completely empty with all

261
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:57.800
the shattered windows.
It's very depressing.
It's very weird.
It's coming back.

262
00:15:57.801 --> 00:16:02.770
And I was,
yes,
there two months ago,
I,

263
00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:06.630
and my brother had died.
I went to his funeral and uh,
we drove around.

264
00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.960
I couldn't find my grandfather's house.
They told that shit now,
boy,
you know,

265
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:13.770
they had somebody burned it down,
some of the stuff like that.
But it was,

266
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.160
it was just like any other city.
To me,
it's coming back for sure.

267
00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.980
And let's also like,
you know,

268
00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:25.020
there's a lot of young businesses are starting up and craft businesses and you

269
00:16:25.721 --> 00:16:29.050
know,
even there's enough people around people of ingenuity,

270
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.720
they figured out a way.
It's just not going to be what it used to be,
Ben.

271
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:36.370
And it's whole new ballgame now.
It is a new ball game.
New People,

272
00:16:36.610 --> 00:16:41.490
these people that are young.
My son wasn't in Alexandra.
Alex,
he's,
how old is he?

273
00:16:41.491 --> 00:16:46.320
2123 he,
he loved choice.
He never seen this man.

274
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:50.050
We were downtown Detroit on Saturday night,
warm hot night.

275
00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:53.600
People walking around and he's beautiful women walking around there.
Elegant.

276
00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:57.700
My son went crazy.
They
go back to Detroit.

277
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.370
We don't,
well we don't go there.
And you're from there.
We don't,
we,

278
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.700
we just don't go to where his family's from a lot.

279
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:07.680
So it's one of those things where family gone,
hey,
you got something.

280
00:17:07.681 --> 00:17:12.140
You got relatives,
you don't know them.
Yeah.
[inaudible]

281
00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.990
my brothers,

282
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.500
I don't know my brother's daughters [inaudible] his brother.

283
00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:23.470
Neither does Alex and me.
That's why Alex is more inclined to his nieces.

284
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:27.710
Oh my God.
Did they loved him.
And they,
uh,

285
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.050
they walked around and I said,
look,
I'm going back to the hotel.

286
00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:33.110
I was getting too much harassment.
So I said,
I'm going back to the hotel.

287
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.110
So I hold the jar.
I told the driver,
take me back.
They can jump out,

288
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.960
you can pick them up later.
And they've got a ride.

289
00:17:38.961 --> 00:17:41.090
So they got back to the hotel about two,
three hours later.

290
00:17:41.091 --> 00:17:45.920
But I was sleeping by the end all.
But Detroit is nice when I was there,

291
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.760
I'm telling you,
man,
Detroit was nice.
Yeah,

292
00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:53.770
I did the Fox theater and it's so old that they have these pillars in the wall

293
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.980
that are stained from cigarettes.

294
00:17:56.010 --> 00:18:01.010
No click a like a darkish orangeish stain just from nicotine.

295
00:18:01.380 --> 00:18:05.670
That's great to have a beautiful home,
a beautiful theater.
Beautiful Theater.

296
00:18:05.671 --> 00:18:10.020
Yeah.
They had to replace one of the pillars,
one pillar that was clean.

297
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:12.410
And then the other pillars you go,
whoa,
that's cigarette smoke.

298
00:18:12.411 --> 00:18:15.930
And you get to really see it.
And everybody saying that,

299
00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:20.700
Frank Sinatra get it.
Everybody got their signature all over the place.
Oh really?

300
00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:23.820
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
I put my,
I put my senior down by 20 times.

301
00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:26.740
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

302
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.490
<v 0>I've been there about eight times.</v>

303
00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:32.350
It's a great player watching Jim stations down here.
Oh Wow.
Temptations.

304
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.960
Frankie Lymon and the teenagers.
That was a long time ago,

305
00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.660
but beautiful,
beautiful place.
Oh,

306
00:18:38.661 --> 00:18:42.470
the other place torn down the Olympia stadium where they used to play and scene

307
00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:47.360
in a piston.
He used to play basketball there.
They all,
they tore that place.

308
00:18:47.361 --> 00:18:51.370
Now that's all I was presently there.
Elvis Presley love kid.

309
00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:55.340
And I saw Elvis.
I was wanting to go to see the Kronk gym,

310
00:18:55.341 --> 00:18:58.130
but I think they tore that down.
I used to play basketball at the crunch gym.

311
00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.490
Really?
They see you used to be,
he used to be a basketball court there.

312
00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:04.580
Then they tore,
it might've torn it down now,
but they had,

313
00:19:04.581 --> 00:19:09.230
they built boxing rings around there.
All the boxes where we played ball,

314
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:12.230
they've got boxing around that.
And I went up there one day with my shoes.

315
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.220
I thought,
what the hell happened here?

316
00:19:13.221 --> 00:19:16.790
They didn't close the doors and everything turned into journey to boxing.

317
00:19:16.791 --> 00:19:18.050
Not even bake great boxes,

318
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.450
wasn't Tommy Hearns and then people came out of the shore.

319
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:25.560
Lennox Lewis and then he'll steward steward was there head coach there before so

320
00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.670
he died.
Yeah.
There wasn't a amazing champion.
It was white.

321
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.200
One of those places is a few places where you want to go.
Like when you're in La,

322
00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:35.360
you want to go to wild card.
You just want to say you've been there.

323
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:40.070
I want to go to the cage.
You when you counted take time.
Anytime.

324
00:19:40.071 --> 00:19:41.780
We'll tell me knocked the crap.

325
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:49.330

There's going to be fires in California.</v>

326
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:52.620
<v 0>Look through the the screen like this</v>

327
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.090

329
00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:04.550
We get real close with tickets to this boy.

330
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.340
I can't believe that he had dude.
I did.

331
00:20:09.050 --> 00:20:09.970
<v 2>Yes.</v>

332
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.910
<v 0>That's as you got to knock the fuck out.
That really serious about that.</v>

333
00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.290
I only ever gone to one of them live.
No,
no,
never.
Never.
No.
Yeah,

334
00:20:19.291 --> 00:20:22.700
let's hook that up.
Oh my filming.

335
00:20:26.570 --> 00:20:28.290
<v 2>I stay ready.
I'll be like,
I'll be like,</v>

336
00:20:28.291 --> 00:20:29.720
so what are your feelings about the fight?

337
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.750
Almost set up a tripod in front of him.
Oh my God.
Just react straight.

338
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:39.210
I see it on TV.
Go pro or something.
Oh yeah.
Don't go pro and Benji

339
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.010
<v 0>and eat it.</v>

340
00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:45.270
I love it when they do a little update on their background.

341
00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.630
They do a piece on the background.
As soon as I saw one,

342
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:54.700
this guy was within within Lufkin.
Oh,
he talking about,
well,
whenever,

343
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.420
whenever I whip your ass,
I want your wife to come home and clean my house.
I won.

344
00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:02.170
I want,
I want her to come and cook me a meal and she cook anything.

345
00:21:02.171 --> 00:21:06.970
I wanted to cook me.
This dude's on me.
Did He,
this guy was a resilient,

346
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.720
the guy that opponent,
he said,
well man,
come on man.
Do you,
you don't have to be,

347
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:14.470
that's just this play in this fight and you ain't got to talk about my wife and

348
00:21:14.471 --> 00:21:18.220
stuff,
man.
You don't tell me what to do to this Italian or something.

349
00:21:18.250 --> 00:21:22.720
<v 2>The [inaudible] son,
his name is,
we are resilient as Anderson Silva.
Oh yeah,</v>

350
00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.180
yeah.
Peas own and one guy.
Oh,

351
00:21:25.181 --> 00:21:28.170
he's about 43 Anderson's innocence.

352
00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:31.630
40 tail might be a little older than that.
Yeah.

353
00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.940
Anderson's greatest middle weight of all time.
First round.

354
00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:37.570
<v 0>This boy put his foot up.
Okay.</v>

355
00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.090
<v 2>What the fuck are you talking about?
The one where his ingles snapped.</v>

356
00:21:42.091 --> 00:21:42.731
Are you talking about that one?

357
00:21:42.731 --> 00:21:44.500
Are you talking about something or are we talking about kicked out different

358
00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:45.660
when he's talking about kicking them in this,

359
00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:46.941
<v 0>it was a fight,</v>

360
00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:51.941
but I never seen a foot come up that quick and that and it tolls.

361
00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:52.970
Hitting the motherfucker.

362
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:57.690
<v 2>Did
I say I ain't never seen nothing like this.</v>

363
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.650
Oh,
and boy,
that boy did.
I did.
Fell asleep.

364
00:22:01.651 --> 00:22:04.890
I think you're thinking of a different fight now.
Thinking of a v tour.

365
00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:09.910
Vito Belfort,
Anderson.
So within,
within,
within.
Yeah,

366
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:13.440
and he run in his,
that's the guidance.

367
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.000
That's the front kick to the face.
One that's like a legendary kick.

368
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.070
The other one was chill son Michel son in one.

369
00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:22.020
He kicked him and then he dropped him.

370
00:22:22.021 --> 00:22:25.710
They need him to the body and took them out with punches.
Unbelievable.

371
00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.210
How did the Mike,

372
00:22:27.211 --> 00:22:31.500
this unbelievable how he can work that foot.

373
00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:35.090
How do you feel about your son's impression of you?
It's really good.
You know,

374
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:39.250
he doesn't think it sounds like him at all.
He doesn't,
uh,

375
00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:42.240
w well here I only know it because this is how he talks to me all the time.

376
00:22:42.241 --> 00:22:46.470
He'll just be like,
um,
GED.
No.
What'd you,
what'd you,

377
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.650
what'd you do in a day you got work,

378
00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.310
shit back and talk to all them people hat.

379
00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:57.990
I never eat all,

380
00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:03.210
you'd be perfect for Amr.
We should just make that type of stuff like him,

381
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:04.230
him just breathing.

382
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.720
<v 0>I was in line at the airport coming from,
I think I was in</v>

383
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:14.750
Saint Louis or something like that.

384
00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:20.260
And so I'm behind his lady [inaudible] two or three people in front of her and

385
00:23:21.501 --> 00:23:24.860
I'm behind her.
So I'm,
I backed them weight,
making my little noise.

386
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.940
<v 2>She was back,
she will like an old,
Old Lady,</v>

387
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:35.690
<v 0>Tina woman,
Spanish woman.
And she looked back and she went back,</v>

388
00:23:35.691 --> 00:23:38.800
back to looking forward.
And then fee.
I said,

389
00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:43.330
<v 2>no Mama,

393
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:55.580
I don't remember making any noise.

394
00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:00.500
<v 1>That's what
you do when you got in the car today,
you got in the car and you</v>

395
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.560
[inaudible] got to express myself.

396
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:11.300
It's noises and noises and questions.
Those are,

397
00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.920
those are his like the moment you get in the car [inaudible] you see what

398
00:24:14.921 --> 00:24:15.580
happened,
how,

399
00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.580
how far we got to go to get the joke we and they were driving 30 miles an hour.

400
00:24:21.641 --> 00:24:23.820
He's like,
then you're going to face,
don't you think?
Let's do a

401
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.460
little quick little quick on the,
on the freeway.

402
00:24:27.461 --> 00:24:30.060
I'm like worth more on the freeway is 60 mile.
I'm going slower.

403
00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.020
No,
his voice,
his voice is just like one of many I've come across cause I,

404
00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.400
cause I do voiceover and all that stuff.

405
00:24:38.401 --> 00:24:41.880
So it's one of those things where I'm lucky enough to have that one in my back

406
00:24:41.881 --> 00:24:44.430
pocket because sometimes I'll throw it out there and people that I'd be like,

407
00:24:44.431 --> 00:24:47.160
I don't know.
A lot of people do a John Witherspoon impression.
It's interesting.

408
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:50.100
That's a practice on that.
Yeah,
man.

409
00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:53.470
<v 0>It's gotta be nice though.
Seeing him get into show business,</v>

410
00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:58.360
getting into stand up.
I guess so.
You like it?
Yeah.

411
00:24:58.361 --> 00:25:00.730
He's funny.
He,
I don't know.

412
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.200
I came from 11 kids,
11 kids.

413
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:08.830
So hope you'd be successful.
I'm going to try my best to be successful.

414
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.570
He's too busy counting his coins to worry about my [inaudible].
God bless us.

415
00:25:13.571 --> 00:25:14.710
O God bless us all.

416
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:18.830
<v 1>You're on your own.
Good luck.
But I mean,
oh he's,
you know,
he's supportive,</v>

417
00:25:18.831 --> 00:25:20.260
but he's one of those guys were,
uh,

418
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:22.840
cause I didn't want to do entertainment at all when I was younger.
I wanted to,

419
00:25:22.841 --> 00:25:24.500
I wanted to do art.
Then when I was drawing,

420
00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:27.320
I used to go to college and then I didn't know how to turn art into a career.
So,

421
00:25:27.321 --> 00:25:29.270
uh,
one of my friends like,
why don't you try acting?

422
00:25:29.271 --> 00:25:31.870
You always wasting time in class making us laugh.
And I was like,
oh,

423
00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.780
that's interesting idea.
So I started like doing commercial liked and whatnot.

424
00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:38.900
But,
uh,
uh,
I have friends who are comics,
like I don't usually bring up,

425
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:42.770
he's my dad.
Like it's something that just randomly happens usually like,
uh,

426
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:45.320
and when that comes across they're like,
oh,
that's crazy.

427
00:25:45.321 --> 00:25:49.160
So you've got like a well of information in the sense of being a good comic and

428
00:25:49.161 --> 00:25:53.730
writing and this and that.
I'm like,
ah,
like not that I don't,

429
00:25:53.970 --> 00:25:57.720
but it's just asking him questions about stuff like that is the funniest stuff

430
00:25:57.721 --> 00:25:59.530
cause he's just very like,
like you just said,
is there,

431
00:25:59.531 --> 00:26:04.350
it's very flat out and just kind of like,
oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Be Funny.

432
00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.140
Like,
how much more can you tell a guy though?
Really?

433
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:09.990
You just got to get your own,
you know,
we were talking about that last.

434
00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.160
<v 0>All right.
People ask me,</v>

435
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.310
do you go to the clubs and looking at your sign and help him?
Right.

436
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:22.390
<v 1>Hell No.
He won't.
He doesn't.</v>

437
00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.730
I featured for him and,
uh,
he doesn't watch my set.
Like I just go up and I do,

438
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:30.880
I do my time and I come into the Korean room,
I'm like,
Hey,
you ready to go?

439
00:26:30.881 --> 00:26:33.520
And he's like,
oh yeah.
Oh,
they sound like they were laughing.

440
00:26:33.521 --> 00:26:37.690
So sounded like you did all right.
I'm like,
yeah man,

441
00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:42.970
there's a father to do
any criticism,

442
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.520
any pointers or anything?
Huh?
You ever give him any pointers?
Eight tips.

443
00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:52.320
Mehta be funny.
I'm,
I'm on.
I'm usually the one,

444
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.140
I'm the one on the opposite spectrum.

445
00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:57.630
Giving him tips about like how he can,

446
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.210
how he can leverage like his,
you know,
his,
uh,

447
00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:03.720
his notoriety in this day and age on the Internet.
That's my thing.
Ah,

448
00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:06.250
so it's one of the things where like if I have a question about standup,

449
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.200
I'll ask,
but he doesn't,
you know?
Yeah.

450
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:11.550
You should definitely have a very active social media.
Yeah.

451
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:17.040
I help him run it.
So good.
Yeah.
Who's on there all the time?

452
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:21.570
Kevin Hart's always,
always,
here's the thing,
here's the thing.

453
00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:26.780
Literally creating his social media was just a fluke because one day,

454
00:27:27.091 --> 00:27:31.080
like five or six or seven years ago,
someone trended that he passed away.

455
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:35.220
And because of that,
we had to create social media for him.

456
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.600
So when that happened,

457
00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.380
he's calling me and I'm getting calls from random people who know him.

458
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:43.890
And also my cousins,
like I got,
I got family call me crying.
Like is he okay?

459
00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:46.500
Is Everything okay?
And he called me and he's like,
JD,

460
00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.760
you gotta help me out some wrong on the internet.
They think I'm wrong.

461
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:53.760
He's saying,
Ma my,
all my,

462
00:27:53.761 --> 00:27:56.500
all my family is calling me and I don't want to talk to them.
Like so.

463
00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:01.080
So we created them a Twitter that day and then through Twitter I told him,

464
00:28:01.081 --> 00:28:04.430
I'm like,
well just tell people you're around.
And we tweeted out like,
Hey y'all,

465
00:28:04.431 --> 00:28:07.490
this is the real John Witherspoon,
blah blah blah.
I don't listen to those phone.

466
00:28:07.491 --> 00:28:10.830
He's making up them rumors cause it was,
it was worldwide trending or whatever,

467
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.170
like Hashtag rip pops or something.

468
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.180
And then off of that is Twitter gained like 25 k and I'm like an hour.

469
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:23.930
And then later on down the road he got into Instagram kind of randomly where he

470
00:28:24.031 --> 00:28:27.900
just,
uh,
he had an Instagram,
didn't really post.
And then I think one day you did,

471
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.040
you did just a random thing where he was ram choked you.

472
00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.070
I talked to Megan and what's your name man?
Oh he was making,

473
00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.320
he was making a joke about like bill Cosby and whatnot and he was like big

474
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:44.010
canvas where I'm with them that does stuff bill and whatever other social media

475
00:28:44.011 --> 00:28:47.250
platforms randomly found it,
re posted it and now he's like,

476
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.760
he went from like six k to like 120 people following me.

477
00:28:50.761 --> 00:28:52.620
I just don't do anything.
Yeah,

478
00:28:52.621 --> 00:28:55.560
he doesn't understand like how social media is know there's like the future,

479
00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.690
but I try to keep them in the loop.

480
00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:02.320
It's a great way to avoid doing morning radio.
You don't like doing,
I hate

481
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.590
<v 0>doing,
I get it.
I got to get up Friday morning,
I get to,</v>

482
00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:10.390
I get to Kansas City at 10 o'clock that night,
Thursday,
tomorrow night,

483
00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:12.490
and then I had to get up Friday morning.

484
00:29:12.491 --> 00:29:14.290
I don't know the time or anything like that yet,

485
00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.870
but I probably do three or four radio stations.
Yeah,

486
00:29:16.871 --> 00:29:21.490
that's what I'm talking about.
We take we,
they drive you and you're so sleepy.

487
00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:24.520
Yeah,
I'm back over here and over here we're saying eat,

488
00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.480
take a nap later and then you still kind of wrecked when the first show rooms.

489
00:29:28.481 --> 00:29:29.770
You've got to do two shows.

490
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:36.220
So it's not fun and I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
you know,

491
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.100
I'm slowing down,
but if you build up your social media,

492
00:29:39.101 --> 00:29:42.350
you can cut that part of it hourly.
And I'm sure you have like relationships

493
00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:44.580
<v 2>with some those radio stations where you like them.
Oh,</v>

494
00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.980
you want to come in and do it?
That's cool.
If you want to do it,

495
00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:52.210
but to have to do it,
they have to do it is half to do it in your sleep.

496
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.650
It's just nice.
It's not good for your brain.

497
00:29:54.651 --> 00:29:57.460
And you can post like a story or on like on like it,

498
00:29:57.461 --> 00:30:00.580
or you could post an Instagram video saying like,
Hey,

499
00:30:00.581 --> 00:30:05.140
I'm going to be here this weekend.
Bill Bellamy.
Oh yeah.
Cut.
Cut It in half.

500
00:30:05.141 --> 00:30:08.380
Cut the time in half.
You don't have to do that.
Get up in the morning stuff,

501
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.970
<v 0>but they want to see me.
Yeah.
These Radio Djs,
right.</v>

502
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:17.600
Is there anyone that she pops,
they want to see pops.
Oh Man.
Coming in.

503
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:22.120
That's,
I ain't no damn leg and I needed some money and that's why I'm a comic.

504
00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.510
I'm go out and work all the time cause I need money.

505
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.600
<v 2>Definitely explain that.</v>

506
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:28.420
Cause I did have a question when I first started doing standup and I was like,

507
00:30:28.421 --> 00:30:32.360
Hey dad,
I'm from uh,
from a motivational standpoint.
I was like,
Hey dad,
what,

508
00:30:32.361 --> 00:30:33.250
what got you in the standard?

509
00:30:33.251 --> 00:30:35.200
What is it that like motivated you to want to do it?

510
00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:39.160
He looked at me and say motivated me.
Oh,
I was broke.

511
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.410
He was like,
I was broken.

512
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.590
Someone told me I was funny until I went to California and got on stage and just

513
00:30:44.591 --> 00:30:46.930
started making dollars.
I was like,
so then what are you doing here?

514
00:30:46.931 --> 00:30:50.230
You don't even like this?
And he's like,
I mean it's like I do my thing,
you know,

515
00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:55.810
I'm not a comic who just love to make people laugh relative.

516
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.050
What do you love?
Money

517
00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.020
count that shape.

518
00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.120
<v 0>Oh.
Oh my God.</v>

519
00:31:05.121 --> 00:31:08.720
Let me tell you sometime sometime on the way home,

520
00:31:08.721 --> 00:31:12.800
see if I had a good week though.
Some of them clubs pay a lot of damn money.

521
00:31:12.801 --> 00:31:17.660
He paid over 30 some thousand dollars for six weeks,
six nights,
four,
I mean four,

522
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:21.830
six shows in a weekend.
And I don't count the money,

523
00:31:21.831 --> 00:31:24.440
but when I do one nighters,
they,
you know,

524
00:31:24.441 --> 00:31:26.850
they had to pay you half of the money up front and again,

525
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:30.010
give you money just before you go on stage.
So I have some at my head,

526
00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:34.670
14 $15,000 in my pocket,
brother.
I'd be on that plane feeling that feeling,

527
00:31:34.671 --> 00:31:35.504
that money,

528
00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:42.870
<v 2>glass of wine,
tall glass of that.
These are his passions.
These are his passion.</v>

529
00:31:42.871 --> 00:31:46.530
Prior to them having a good time and look at it and I begin to count,

530
00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:47.470
I called it,

531
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:51.010
<v 0>bake up America,
check out my account.
Four o'clock in the morning,</v>

532
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:53.950
I punch in my theme punching isn't union.

533
00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.710
You have your balance is [inaudible] De de de.
De.
De.

534
00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:06.180
<v 2>That's so ridiculous.
We gotta get you gotta get to the APP.</v>

535
00:32:06.181 --> 00:32:08.070
We got to just get through this.
The Bank of America App.

536
00:32:08.071 --> 00:32:09.060
You saved the phone call.

537
00:32:09.630 --> 00:32:13.950
<v 0>I don't man.
I bet.
I bet.
To go through the motion hit you.
You like to hear it.</v>

538
00:32:13.951 --> 00:32:16.030
Tell him it's your last name and your social security number

539
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:22.350
<v 2>and you'll put your balance is,</v>

540
00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.480
<v 0>oh,
it's just so wonderful.</v>

541
00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:30.880
I was broken.
I was coming up,
man.
When did you start?
Huh?

542
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:35.310
Where'd you start doing standup?
Back in Detroit?
In Detroit.
I was,
um,

543
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:39.950
my brother used to go to acting class on Thursday and his wife,
I said,

544
00:32:39.951 --> 00:32:41.870
well that's pretty cool.
I should try to be an actor.

545
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.240
So I got in the yellow pages,
they had him yellow page.

546
00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:45.590
They don't have them now though.
You're awake.

547
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.180
I'd go through the phone and get the number,

548
00:32:47.570 --> 00:32:48.950
but they had the yellow pages I go through.

549
00:32:48.951 --> 00:32:51.140
I went to young patient and went to an acting class,

550
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:55.520
private acting lessons and I called the Guy,
he said,
$25 an hour.

551
00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.400
Come on over.
We can get started.

552
00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:03.940
So this teacher at John Pinkelman acting classes put in a comedy show once once

553
00:33:05.241 --> 00:33:07.010
a year and you see,

554
00:33:07.011 --> 00:33:09.790
I want you to be on the show was I don't want him about no comedy.
He said,

555
00:33:09.791 --> 00:33:13.100
well you this was very lucrative business.
You can make a lot of money.

556
00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.850
And so we really,
I wouldn't,

557
00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:22.400
I wouldn't,
it stole the show.
Why is it,
wait a minute,

558
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:27.110
that's funny.
Timing stole the show.
I used to do impressions of Nike and Cole,

559
00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:32.060
Johnny Mathis and uh,
wasn't boy Joe Cocker and all that stuff.

560
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:36.250
Oh,
Mick Jagger,
I used to Mick Jagger,
do you stoke,

561
00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.240
go eat,
go,
go.

562
00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.500
And they had about 500 people out there for the show.

563
00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.650
I'm bouncing across the state like Joe Cocker.
Boy.
It was so funny.

564
00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:47.640
And I got a standing ovation and I said,
wait,

565
00:33:47.641 --> 00:33:49.340
am I could probably make some money doing this.

566
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:54.680
So I really was money money was your number one motivation when you borrow money

567
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:59.040
is,
you know,
tell him my love and affection as some little,

568
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.230
I didn't have that at my wish.
I didn't have that luxury.
No luxury.

569
00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:04.760
Get out of my way so I can count this.

570
00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.870
Where did you start out in la?
What clubs did you start out here?
Oh,

571
00:34:11.871 --> 00:34:16.570
I drove from Detroit to La.
I moved to New York.
I moved to New York.
Um,

572
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:20.960
six 71.
1971.
I was about 30 years old,

573
00:34:21.140 --> 00:34:24.410
29 30 and I went to material,
could be a fashion model.

574
00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.040
I was passionate about Detroit,
really fashion commercials.

575
00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.020
I worked at Cadillac Motorcar and,

576
00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.430
and my job was plating bumpers,
these big fucking bumpers.

577
00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:40.850
And so the bumpers,
I would need the money's,

578
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:43.820
I'm picking this up cause you know you use night using in Trillium and you

579
00:34:43.821 --> 00:34:47.090
losing endorphins and everything else you got in your body to kick in and put

580
00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:48.590
this big bump on this fucking line.

581
00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.800
Do it to keep going and get into the plating pit.

582
00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.430
So I have now that number going down and I headed my three minutes.

583
00:34:55.431 --> 00:34:59.150
I look at his magazine,
I saw a gas stand next to a car.

584
00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:03.970
I looked better than that dude.
Damn.
I went into the,

585
00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:08.150
I went to the yellow pages again and got me a call.

586
00:35:08.151 --> 00:35:12.650
The acting lady called the am Marlene schools.
They say,
oh sure,
come on in.

587
00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.060
They gave me a job that weekend.
I thought I was hot.

588
00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:18.760
I went to New York then do look 10 times better than me.
They tall off.

589
00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.850
That's your motto.
See you.

590
00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:27.380
I'm the midget model.
So I couldn't do that.

591
00:35:27.381 --> 00:35:31.250
So I I uh,
I got the hell out of there.
I went back to you had went to New York.

592
00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:32.590
I went down there,

593
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.830
stayed in New York three years back to La and I met but back to Detroit and got

594
00:35:36.831 --> 00:35:39.870
a car and drove the de la by myself.
And when you went to La,

595
00:35:39.871 --> 00:35:43.830
you went to do stand up?
Yeah,
I went to do acting in and stand up.

596
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.130
I cut that Molly.
Now I've never said that shit at work.

597
00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:52.440
Where did you start out doing stand up here at the comedy store?
The store?
Yeah.

598
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:55.000
I was the first one that I was there with Mitzi.
Wow.
I will never,

599
00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:59.280
Mitzi first started,
had to please Sammy and Mitzi breaking up.

600
00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:05.040
Mitzi.
Sammy used to send me one of them the rules.

601
00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:06.000
Sammy was big.

602
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.800
He was a big time common keep working for Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin Lawler.

603
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:15.390
He opening for them.
Mitzi needed somebody.

604
00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.670
I needed a place,
so I'm,
I got a job.
Mission gave me a job as the MC left.

605
00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:23.040
Dave Letterman was the MC,
the first show I mc the second show.

606
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.950
He didn't have no money then either.
He had a wife,

607
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.250
he had a red truck and a dog named Bob.

608
00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.730
That's the only thing he came to la with and I just had this blue.

609
00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:38.210
I had this blue Mustang I boat for about 150 to dry the l $850 car drove tail

610
00:36:39.350 --> 00:36:41.310
all the way to la.
Wow.
You know,

611
00:36:41.311 --> 00:36:46.300
I was determined to get out there and get me some of that money
leak.

612
00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:48.150
All the transmission fluid.

613
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:51.960
I had to get up every 200 miles to feel the car backed up at all and

614
00:36:51.961 --> 00:36:56.400
transmission fluid every 200 miles on the mouse.
I bet that nightmare you.

615
00:36:56.490 --> 00:37:01.200
Oh,
oh.
You hear that shit and it's only only light.

616
00:37:01.201 --> 00:37:05.820
You see headlights on the car at that point.
God,
I'm going to stick.

617
00:37:05.821 --> 00:37:10.821
I had to stick with me and had a little fun and put that all in that car looking

618
00:37:10.921 --> 00:37:12.840
around.
You know what?
I'd be doing it again

619
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.530
and got the California.
No,
I actually went to Las Vegas Person.

620
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.400
I'm fuck you got stuck.
I got stuck at alone.
He told me about that.
What happened?

621
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:26.260
That blew his money,
I guess to me.

622
00:37:26.370 --> 00:37:29.280
I had a guy tell me how to keep this thing in front of your cute grab that.

623
00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:33.930
Oh here.
Yeah man.
Tell me my friend,

624
00:37:33.931 --> 00:37:34.920
he rich boy.
He said,
look,

625
00:37:34.921 --> 00:37:37.710
just go to go to Las Vegas for a sheet with the comics are doing.

626
00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.640
Then you go to La.
Then you know what they're doing and as long as they get,

627
00:37:41.641 --> 00:37:44.070
that's the comics.
They work in Las Vegas all the time.

628
00:37:44.850 --> 00:37:49.550
I went to some old ass joke,
Jewish joke.
They planned,
they tell it,

629
00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:54.060
but Gabe Kaplan,
this old,
funny big kid looking funny.

630
00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.350
He's a good actor,
but he,
he was,

631
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:02.820
I waste all my tests,
but I,
he told me stay there half an hour.

632
00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.630
I mean half of half of 30 days to stay there.

633
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:10.470
So I paid my rent for 30 days and I went that night,
got up my new,

634
00:38:10.471 --> 00:38:14.550
my navy suit on him and sharp is I can be born,
there's modeling clothes,

635
00:38:14.551 --> 00:38:18.420
you know what I mean?
Standing around,
you know,
have a big Ole afro man.

636
00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:22.980
I lost every dime I had at that fucking horseshoe casino.
I was,

637
00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:24.180
I went back home crying.

638
00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:29.260
So now I don't know what the Hell I'm gonna do here.
I didn't,

639
00:38:29.261 --> 00:38:33.930
it drove two and a half days across the country.
And so I,

640
00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:36.460
I called people in Detroit,
should I get some money?
But you know,

641
00:38:36.461 --> 00:38:38.230
when you call them,
you bring long ways,
way.
Hey,

642
00:38:38.231 --> 00:38:41.440
nobody got no man that people don't answer the phone.
He's all,
no,

643
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:42.274
I ain't got no money.

644
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.280
So I got some more borrow money from some of my friends and had to stay there

645
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:53.110
for six months till I got no money to go to la.
Well you said that,

646
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:56.470
didn't you tell me that you hit,
you did one of the slot machines and it,

647
00:38:56.490 --> 00:39:01.360
it hit with three grand or something.
I had $150 left.
I saw Diana Ross.
She,

648
00:39:01.361 --> 00:39:05.520
what I would do,
I would go at night and during the weekend,
during the week,

649
00:39:05.521 --> 00:39:10.280
I mean,
you can go to the front of the casinos and the guy in the front.

650
00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.580
Then he said,
I'm a comic.
I just want to sit in the back here,

651
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.390
watch them the comic.
And I'm gone.
They,

652
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.890
they let you do that shit there and ain't to anybody.

653
00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:21.340
Nobody's sitting there and he's got 2000 seats in those states or something like

654
00:39:21.341 --> 00:39:25.840
that.
So I had a dollar and a half left.
I saw Diana Ross,

655
00:39:25.841 --> 00:39:29.500
she had a great show.
So I'm gonna Outweigh,
I said,
I'm a play this fucking money.

656
00:39:29.510 --> 00:39:34.120
I ain't got just,
just be broke.
My check is coming from the unemployment.
Uh,

657
00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.150
it'd be here another day or two.
I can go without food for a day.

658
00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:44.860
He's Muslim.
He said,
Burger,
you better put some down here,
nigger.
Yes.

659
00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:52.270
So I put that money in the machine.
It Rung Up,

660
00:39:52.271 --> 00:39:57.130
I think it was 7,000 really?
Yeah.
I thought I fucked up something.

661
00:39:58.970 --> 00:40:02.410
Oh Shit.
Now what have I done?
The guy came over,
he said,
I just got on jobs.

662
00:40:02.411 --> 00:40:04.540
Just hold on sir.
I just got here.

663
00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:10.050
You had struck the Jackpot today.
What Jackpot I,

664
00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:14.650
he gave,
he came and pump.
Just put them $100 in my hand.
It was like a miracle.

665
00:40:14.651 --> 00:40:19.180
Even like,
like Moses came down to hand me some money or something.

666
00:40:19.181 --> 00:40:23.830
They was so damn.
Damn.
Money felt so good.
I went home

667
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:29.380
and packed my stuff.
I had about two more days on my rent.

668
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:35.530
I got in that car.
I got me some gas.
Joel,

669
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.720
you know how to have it in Vegas.

670
00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:40.090
They got the little island in the middle of the street,

671
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.220
drove over that damn thing,
going back,
going the opposite direction.
I said,

672
00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:49.000
hell with this I'm,
and when you go,
island costs are boom,
boom,
boom,

673
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:54.000
boom,
boom.
Cones come out.
Does come out and old cones.
Old stuff.
Come on the old,

674
00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:58.720
on the seat,
on your hand,
your feet being dirty,
dusty,

675
00:40:58.721 --> 00:41:03.460
all over it.
I drove all the way from three o'clock in the morning,

676
00:41:04.090 --> 00:41:05.590
four o'clock in the morning or whatever time it was.

677
00:41:05.591 --> 00:41:10.420
I drove all the way back to La and my friend let me stay at her house for about

678
00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.690
a month.
Candy.
She was a good friend of mine.
I'm dead.

679
00:41:12.691 --> 00:41:14.890
She let me do that cause that was,
that was amazing.

680
00:41:14.891 --> 00:41:19.840
She lives in Beverly Hills from,
from,
from apartment motel.
I mean,

681
00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:23.640
uh,
and no money eating potato worst.

682
00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:27.940
I sold and I know what time me to get some money.
I'm eating a baked potato,

683
00:41:29.290 --> 00:41:30.123
um,

684
00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:35.610
a white potato now with the white potato and some old bread at some syrup.

685
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:41.610
And I say,
I gotta get the Fuck Outta here.
This ain't,
this ain't normal.

686
00:41:42.980 --> 00:41:47.810
This is not good for the kid.
I come out here with big plans that went straight.

687
00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:51.030
I went straight to her house and I got a job at Gucci and I,

688
00:41:51.031 --> 00:41:53.440
I went to the comedy store and everything.
I just stayed there.

689
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:56.540
If you didn't go to Vegas,
would you have even gotten stuck?
No,

690
00:41:56.541 --> 00:41:58.910
I wouldn't have got,
that's a six month.

691
00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:02.420
That's a six month waiting game that you had to play because you lost the money

692
00:42:02.421 --> 00:42:07.160
on ads.
Worse his county airplanes coming in and taken off course.

693
00:42:07.161 --> 00:42:11.510
You can see them from my,
my door.
You see the plane and come into the Karen.

694
00:42:11.511 --> 00:42:12.420
I think the name of the hotel.

695
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:17.570
The plane terminal it come in.
You see him take off.

696
00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:22.040
That's all I did all day long.
He playing,
coming in as well.
Plane taking off,

697
00:42:22.730 --> 00:42:26.000
playing,
coming in,
playing,
taking off and you're just stuck.

698
00:42:26.001 --> 00:42:30.830
They're stuck in Las Vegas.
I've learned I deserved my monies.

699
00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:34.670
So people telling you you're love money.
Yes,

700
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:36.600
I deserve every died.

701
00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:42.710
I went through that shit.
Oh my God.

702
00:42:42.711 --> 00:42:45.170
That car lasted another four or five years.

703
00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:49.160
Really fit 65 Mustang.
That's a great car.

704
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:53.810
It a great car.
Regular gas.
I got to be some new tires.

705
00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:58.490
I told you I got to be some new tires,
a case of oil and a case,

706
00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.860
and I got,
I never got,

707
00:43:01.861 --> 00:43:05.780
I got my old color TV and a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken

708
00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.410
back then.
When you're trying to get up in the store,
how did,

709
00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.620
how did the auditions go?
What did they do?
No,
you're not.

710
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:17.210
You have to go through the a potluck.
You had to go through that?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Oh,

711
00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:18.950
hoping Mike the same thing to that,

712
00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:21.770
but it wasn't that many commentate the close at about 11 o'clock I didn't know

713
00:43:21.771 --> 00:43:24.150
comics that go on anymore.
How many comics were there?
Oh,

714
00:43:24.151 --> 00:43:27.830
it must have been about 10 15 really?
And when this is,
Huh?
What?

715
00:43:27.831 --> 00:43:32.340
Yours is 74 so it was at the beginning then as soon as we,

716
00:43:32.341 --> 00:43:36.510
soon as Mitzi,
Mitzi just started when I was there in the beginning,
she,
she,

717
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:41.360
she liked me.
She would get me,
she,
Johnny can come out here and work the door.

718
00:43:41.361 --> 00:43:43.220
You can do anything you want.
And I said,
I need a job.

719
00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:48.770
So I hustled the door.
Mitzi,
she said,
y'all better watch Johnny.

720
00:43:48.771 --> 00:43:53.330
He can make some money at that damn door.
What I would do,
I was,

721
00:43:53.410 --> 00:43:56.000
what'd he call Maitre d or something?
Where are you calling?
Yeah,
Maitre d.

722
00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:00.620
So I would put,
uh,
a reserved signs in the front seats up there.

723
00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.910
Reserved for the owners.
Grandmother reserved for the mothers.

724
00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Granted Mitsis father.
And so none of main movement.

725
00:44:10.001 --> 00:44:13.520
I mean the main room in the other room be crowded pattern.
I said,

726
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:17.090
we sold off sir.
He said,
what does the tables up there for?
I said,

727
00:44:17.091 --> 00:44:21.660
that's too onerous to grandmother be here soon.
He said with $500.

728
00:44:21.661 --> 00:44:23.600
So it put me in that seat right now.

729
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:30.560
So
I would make,
I would make,

730
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:33.960
I make two to 300 a night sometime.

731
00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:37.800
500,000 just at the door.
Missy did.

732
00:44:37.801 --> 00:44:42.000
She had me go mc and all that stuff.
Well you said 500,000,

733
00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:46.650
$500 found.
No,
it wasn't that kind of money.
That's a,
that pictures her.

734
00:44:47.130 --> 00:44:50.300
That's Mitzi.
No,
I know.
I recognized that picture.
Yeah,

735
00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:51.720
that's when she was younger though.
Yeah.

736
00:44:51.721 --> 00:44:54.690
There's a photo that was from the comedy store that was sitting around in the

737
00:44:54.710 --> 00:44:59.400
backroom and Taylor boss.
That's when I,
he passed it.
Yup.
That's when I,
um,

738
00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:03.600
I,
that's what I knew her when she was like that.
She was,
she's,

739
00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.570
that's the picture right there.
Yeah.
That's the picture he used.

740
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.950
She was a smart lady.
She was,
let me chase my brother.

741
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:16.230
She was a whip.
She was,
she had her ways.
Yeah,
she was,

742
00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:17.460
she was definitely eccentric.

743
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:20.550
But she's one of the most important people ever in comedy and comedy.

744
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:25.500
And people don't realize that.
A lot of people don't realize Mitzi was the shits.

745
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.290
She and that little,
it is crazy and running around.

746
00:45:28.291 --> 00:45:33.030
They little baby ain't no pimping.
No polytech sees the baby.
I know.

747
00:45:33.031 --> 00:45:36.330
I'm all Mitzi.
Mitzi.
And he ain't got to come back.

748
00:45:36.331 --> 00:45:38.760
We don't have nobody to work the door.
I can get up and go over there.

749
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:44.070
So I'm at the door.
I got,
uh,
eight o'clock show you don't eat a clock.

750
00:45:44.071 --> 00:45:47.110
So I mean what I'm seeing and,
and working the door and everything and,

751
00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:51.780
and hosting the room and all that.
So I'm up there on stage.
Um,
put the,

752
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.920
you've got a little broke you put across the door and closed the curtain and the

753
00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:58.920
beauty of people come up in the original room to come up the steps there.

754
00:45:59.190 --> 00:46:02.460
You know the original room?
Yeah.
So she's in a booth taking money,

755
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:06.180
taking pictures,
taking money and get selling tickets.
She and I,

756
00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:11.110
the only one they're working and the,
and the bar in the back.
So,
uh,

757
00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:11.963
Mitzi,

758
00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:16.260
I'm going to stay by Ba ba Ba ba Ba ba ba Ba ba now has got 10 people in the

759
00:46:16.261 --> 00:46:19.350

So let's go.
She said,
I'm just going here and I get them,
get there,

760
00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:22.920
give me the cover and you go ahead and put the robe back.

761
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.240
So now I'm up to about 15 minutes.

762
00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.170
She said about three minutes,
four minutes into my and Janny.

763
00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:36.260
There are people that line come down here and letting me and you cannot do your

764
00:46:36.261 --> 00:46:40.080

no more material.
Come on Johnny at the Mitzi,
I'm trying to finish my ag.

765
00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.870
Johnny,

I want to kick this money.
That's,

766
00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:47.340
I learned that commercial like get that money before they turn around and go,

767
00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:52.020
Oh God,
I,
that was a funny,
she sees the funniest lady.

768
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.620
She's a funny lady.
Let me tell you.
She was hot.
She was tough.

769
00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:59.460
Mitzi was tough.
She told me,
you stick with me.
I'll make you a rich man.
I said,

770
00:46:59.461 --> 00:47:01.710
Mitch,
I come here to be a comic.
I can come and be known.
Rich Man.

771
00:47:01.711 --> 00:47:05.760
I'd come and be a comic,
but she's too much trouble.
To much extent.

772
00:47:05.761 --> 00:47:09.570
You like sixth century,
two weeks,
century.
I didn't want to hang around too long.

773
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.810
The August still they're out of his mind.
See,
he's August is still there.

774
00:47:13.150 --> 00:47:16.530
Are you still in there?
He said last night and I know it.
I go there and see him.

775
00:47:16.531 --> 00:47:18.280
I see him all the time when they,
when I go by there,

776
00:47:18.281 --> 00:47:22.290
I want to go once a year or so,
but I see our guy,
I like August.
He was,

777
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.980
he was telling,
he's talented.
Yes,
genius,
but he didn't,

778
00:47:25.981 --> 00:47:29.950
he didn't want to lead the comic store.
He got a radio station downstairs.

779
00:47:29.951 --> 00:47:32.900
He told me they have a podcast.
What's the podcast?
Yeah,

780
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:35.990
they have a podcast studio.
You bet on that studio.
Yeah,

781
00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.770
but Mitzi Abenomic's you mutate.

782
00:47:38.830 --> 00:47:43.830
I knew her in 1974 when I went over there and I noticed when I got on,

783
00:47:44.170 --> 00:47:46.780
when I got on,
um,

784
00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:52.250
open Mike night for people who wanted to try to become on the regular show.

785
00:47:52.720 --> 00:47:55.480
Mitzi used to love impressionists.

786
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:58.000
She loved people who can do voices.

787
00:47:58.060 --> 00:48:00.420
And I just realized that after about three weeks of being there,

788
00:48:00.450 --> 00:48:05.430
trying to be funny,
I'm doing old Red Fox jokes.
I'm doing a book.

789
00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:06.930
And then she didn't.

790
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.760
And then the horse race was going in and the jockey,

791
00:48:11.761 --> 00:48:15.580
you ran nomadic.
My Dick,
the Horse's name was my Dick.

792
00:48:16.450 --> 00:48:18.190
Just fucking Redd Foxx used to be,

793
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:22.090
he would come out and he would be so fucking funny.
Um,
so at the end,

794
00:48:22.091 --> 00:48:24.900
the person come out and sing.
She loved people who saying,
uh,

795
00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:28.510
Tina Turner women at Santeen utter,
she put two or three of them.

796
00:48:28.511 --> 00:48:31.460
Rip Your hand each other.
They still the same song.
Jesus.

797
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:36.100
That's said Mysequel and crazy boy man.
Why?
Like Tina Turner,

798
00:48:36.450 --> 00:48:40.600
she put them up impressionist,
but she loved the women call.

799
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.820
Do you know the women?
All of them got the same impressions,

800
00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:45.680
but she put the two or three I'm on the same show.
Wow.

801
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:50.330
Same Impressions I went up to,
I started doing an impression that they,

802
00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:54.020
cause I did amend Detroit on the shoulder with the nat king Cole.
Him.

803
00:48:54.050 --> 00:48:58.330
She's all Johnny,
this is so wonderful.
I want you to work Friday night.

804
00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:02.910
She put me on early.
He put me on some nice times and shit,
but these,

805
00:49:03.310 --> 00:49:08.310
but she wanted me to stay with her on that door and emceeing help her out.

806
00:49:09.310 --> 00:49:11.680
She had me click close the door,
closed the place one day.

807
00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:17.170
I shouldn't be responsible for this to Nicole.
The doors lock the fucking door.

808
00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.440
Well she's always had comics work there all the beginning,

809
00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.230
all the time when I want it to where I wanted to work there.

810
00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:27.170
Most of them comics live in their house upstairs up there and Crest Hill.
Yeah.

811
00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.930
They lived on the hill there.
She bought all the property around there.
Yeah.

812
00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:35.380
Mitzi.
Oh out on so much here on some with money when she died.
Oh my God.

813
00:49:35.381 --> 00:49:39.220
The house up on this house,
the House that you know,

814
00:49:39.221 --> 00:49:41.440
the house she had up on the hill there.
Crest Hill.
Yeah.

815
00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:42.820
That's what the name of the House on the street.

816
00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:46.030
That was the one where I'll be on comics.
Lived in it,
right?
No,

817
00:49:46.031 --> 00:49:48.860
no comedy live behind the comedy store up the hill.

818
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:50.980
There's one at about three or four of those.
Yeah.
Yeah.

819
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:54.070
She owned by three or four.
I would have to have a party over there.

820
00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.360
The fucking party was fabulous.
I'm looking,

821
00:49:57.790 --> 00:50:01.960

822
00:50:01.961 --> 00:50:02.521

you know,

824
00:50:07.241 --> 00:50:11.230

Nothing.
Mitzi owned all that.

825
00:50:11.231 --> 00:50:14.200
That guy back there.
Yeah.
I almost bought that Crest Hill House.

826
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:17.020
Yo that was for sale back in the day.
I went to look at it,

827
00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.960
but I had a dog and I was pretty sure he's not,

828
00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:22.660
he was going to get out of that backyard,
had a crazy dog.
I was like,

829
00:50:22.661 --> 00:50:25.240
this is not good.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:34.070

He owns it.
I think I saw him.

833
00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.890
I saw him the other night at the,
at the store in the parking lot and he was,

834
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.760
he was telling me like,

835
00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:44.750

851
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:43.180

let me show you see are crazy crazy lady with the,
with the,

863
00:52:27.050 --> 00:52:30.310
with the pigs.
He used bring dolls on stage and punched him.

864
00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.880
He had a base too about like,
uh,

865
00:52:36.881 --> 00:52:39.560
the bare smokey the bear only you could prepare for it.

866
00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:42.340
He would pull out the bear.
Only you can prevent forest sizes.

867
00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:47.550
Fuck you punch the Para who is so meticulous and if people,

868
00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:51.040

he would go nuts.

869
00:52:51.041 --> 00:52:53.770
And he was like really crazy expressions.

870
00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:59.440
Unbelievably funny guy.
Like a naturally funny,
I was an east coast legend.

871
00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:01.540
Yeah.
He's one of those guys.

872
00:53:01.690 --> 00:53:02.780
<v 0>Then he got up,</v>

873
00:53:02.890 --> 00:53:06.150
I think he had a lady broke up or something and they got to do bore.

874
00:53:06.151 --> 00:53:09.130
So she moved out of,
Oh my God.

877
00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.080
book.
Did you know Bob was,

878
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.690
<v 0>Bob was another legend.
Another like east coast list.</v>

879
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.630
Just big giant guy.
He uh,

880
00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.490
he was like a long island legend.
So he didn't play comic store.

881
00:53:35.491 --> 00:53:37.970
That mom thinking he ever made it out here.
Oh,
he didn't make it out.
Okay.

882
00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:40.960
I don't know.
There's a few of them.
If he did,
he didn't stay.

883
00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:46.830
I'm hanging you Bob Woods.
Oh,
where I told you I didn't know him.

884
00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:50.620
Yeah,
it was a long island legend.
Really?
Yeah.

885
00:53:50.621 --> 00:53:53.910
It's like back in those days like a lawn,
there was like,

886
00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.850
he was a legend in long island around the same time.

887
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:59.130
Like those Boston guys like lending club,

888
00:53:59.790 --> 00:54:04.500
they were all big time in Boston back then.
We all do.

889
00:54:04.530 --> 00:54:06.840
All of Boston's got,
they were tough.
They don't have the club,

890
00:54:06.920 --> 00:54:11.360
they're not well they have laugh Boston that they do local headliners.

891
00:54:11.361 --> 00:54:14.540

But I mean they still have some good local talent.

893
00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:20.610
And then they do like the Wilbur,

894

but it used to be there was like 10 if I can clubs to fucking clothes.

895
00:54:25.201 --> 00:54:27.630
People believe that's what I like.

They come in late and they trying to get to the front when he got to see that

898
00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:37.250
they take 30 minutes as you bring your ass on my parachute jumper with somebody

899
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:42.900
to jump over the divider.

908
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:18.360

And you go,

909
00:55:18.361 --> 00:55:21.330
you do a show there and then drive all over the chicken peak hour and a half.

910
00:55:21.810 --> 00:55:26.040
Then I wouldn't have had thing and do another show on Friday.
Oh Man.

911
00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:30.540
I said I can't do this and it,
then you go out to the chicken pea.

912
00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:35.280
It's a Hawaiian Chinese Hawaiian restaurant.

913
00:55:35.310 --> 00:55:38.820

Oh Man.
Excellent.

917
00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:56.250
And the food was actually this gone.
I'm told the kids,

918
00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:01.590
the kids didn't want to stay there.
I think that's what it was.

919
00:56:01.830 --> 00:56:02.970
The mother and father died.

920
00:56:02.971 --> 00:56:06.960
They were all on the kids didn't want to keep running a beautiful play.

921

927
00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.810

928
00:56:34.811 --> 00:56:37.470

Like you have 1520 common,

932
00:56:50.061 --> 00:56:53.870

They had three comics and that's all they have.

933
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:56.780
So they make their money.
It's a whole different ball game

934
00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.160
<v 2>and there's like independent shows now.
That's,

UPDATES and I know I'm going to do it and December 12th to the 15th I think it

951
00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:54.710
might be an Arlington,
Texas,

952
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:58.960
but I know that you get with Chris Smith and number,

953
00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:03.020
they won't 10% but they book your way and you want to get to a club.

954
00:58:03.021 --> 00:58:07.100
You can get that.
They will have,
they have your book,
you'll,

955
00:58:07.101 --> 00:58:11.870
but you'd be in bed talking my book and books and books and books.

956
00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:16.000
<v 2>I'm booked too much.
Do you still enjoy the shows though?
Nope.</v>

957
00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:26.200
I've had enough.
You know,
your fans may or may not watch or listen to this.
Right.

958
00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.480
They know.
They know that.
You know it's hard work.
You're never performing.

959
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:33.460
Yeah.
When,
whenever,
whenever I've done,

960
00:58:33.461 --> 00:58:36.010
whenever I've done shows with him at the moment,
cause you know,

961
00:58:36.011 --> 00:58:39.430
I'll hang out cause after every show he'll try to sell merchant and take

962
00:58:39.431 --> 00:58:43.140
pictures of.
But uh,
as soon as he gets in the green room,
he's like,
Jay,

963
00:58:43.260 --> 00:58:47.380
do you see how hard at work?
You see this?
You see all this I'm doing right here.

964
00:58:48.610 --> 00:58:51.490
You don't know nothing.
You,
y'all know none about this hard work.
I'm like,
okay,

965
00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:54.420
coping is this job.
Yeah,
it's a great deal.

966
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:59.430
<v 0>Five,
six weeks in a row.
That's what I hate.
And I'm,
I'm on,</v>

967
00:58:59.610 --> 00:59:04.560
I'm on my second of five weeks,
the second,

968
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:09.180
second week now.
So I got to go next week I go to Hartford,
Connecticut,
Hartford,

969
00:59:09.181 --> 00:59:13.590
Springfield.
That's why you actually fly in to that.
Then I go to Memphis.

970
00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:17.320
<v 2>So wait,
you said you hate it,
but what,
why don't you just stop paper?</v>

971
00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:21.360
[inaudible]

972
00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:23.580
<v 1>well the only time,</v>

973
00:59:23.581 --> 00:59:25.850
the only time I've ever seen him do anything outside because you know,

974
00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:29.580
he's old school.
So it's one of those things where he's so used to like,
you know,

975
00:59:29.581 --> 00:59:31.670
he's so used to,
he got his agents,
his managers and the,

976
00:59:31.671 --> 00:59:33.420
he's so used to someone giving him work.

977
00:59:33.421 --> 00:59:35.100
So that's one of the things where I'm on the road.

978
00:59:35.101 --> 00:59:38.460
You're given the spots are giving up clubs and I was like,

979
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:40.350
what do you like doing?
Cause you asked that earlier.

980
00:59:40.351 --> 00:59:45.150
And like the one thing that we've made between like him doing comedy and now is

981
00:59:45.570 --> 00:59:49.260
we created a youtube channel for him where he does like a cooking show,
right?

982
00:59:49.650 --> 00:59:50.221
So he has,

983
00:59:50.221 --> 00:59:52.440
he has his own youtube channel because I do youtube and all this stuff.

984
00:59:52.441 --> 00:59:56.220
I do like gaming videos and a bunch of other random stuff,
sketches and blogs.

985
00:59:56.221 --> 01:00:00.120
But uh,
he was like,
well,
he's like,
well,
I guess I got a little time off,

986
01:00:00.121 --> 01:00:03.180
we can do some brand.
He's like,
maybe we can do this cooking idea.
Got,
and I said,

987
01:00:03.210 --> 01:00:05.280
sure,
let's do it.
We create the channel,
we make it.

988
01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:06.900
And it's called cooking for porter

989
01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:10.730
<v 0>people for poor people.
Because when you're hungry,
everything tastes good.
Yes.</v>

990
01:00:10.731 --> 01:00:15.560
And his channel is he John,
we'll eat a bunch of crap.
Cook a bunch of crap,

991
01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:20.300
but he can kind of chicken feed and rice.
Chicken,
chicken.
We did chicken feet,

992
01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.960
pig feet.
Ox Tail.
Uh,
chicken,

993
01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:28.740
chicken feet like tough.
You gotta be,

994
01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:32.990
he tried to Asian people eat.
It changes the way they eat every day.

995
01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:35.480
He tried to feed it to our dog and our dog ran away from him.

996
01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:39.260
So that's like a clip from the video delicacy.
It was,
that's what that was.

997
01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:44.210
And then I recommend wine.
I had wine,
tall,
glass of mad dog,

998
01:00:44.211 --> 01:00:45.510
2020 with the chicken.

999
01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:51.640
Put them chicken feet and Thunderbird.
Thunderbird one,
number one.

1000
01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:55.830
You know Cisco.
Wow.
Mad Dog.
2020.

1001
01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:00.510
He's good at finding their own band night.
Some Mexican Salad.

1002
01:01:01.050 --> 01:01:01.883
Yeah.

1003
01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:08.840
Hanging out like an old school to get hanging out in the front with the bottled

1004
01:01:08.841 --> 01:01:08.961
it,

1005
01:01:08.961 --> 01:01:12.200
bring it down here and had to be hand the crate and they bring it up and he that

1006
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:16.840
John.
Yeah.
Then you go buy some more in it.

1007
01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:20.060
I'm shocked that it hair go.
Hey,
you know that.
So I held,
yeah,

1008
01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:23.230
I helped him produce and create,
help him work on this.
Then

1009
01:01:25.170 --> 01:01:29.340
it gets good Putin,
you can pick fee right there in the end.
I got somebody,

1010
01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:33.740
Shelly threw my shit away.
I can't believe she,
she do old pig feet away.
Oh,

1011
01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:37.480
called light the kitchen too?
Yeah,
that's old school whose kitchen is out.

1012
01:01:37.550 --> 01:01:41.360
It's his house.
We have,
we bought the house next to us.
Oh Nice.

1013
01:01:41.361 --> 01:01:43.930
So I got the house next to me and I told the whole fence down,

1014
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:47.270
guest house kitchen,
and we got on an old kitchens.
I said,
I'm going to eat that.

1015
01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:48.920
Don't believe that.
That's perfect.

1016
01:01:48.921 --> 01:01:53.150
Kitchen for local show on cooking tight and old school.

1017
01:01:53.151 --> 01:01:55.130
It reminds you of like growing up.
Yeah.

1018
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:58.350
<v 1>And it works well.
You know,
we,
we,
we,
I don't know,</v>

1019
01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.460
well I think we may maybe 1215 of these things,
but people watch them.

1020
01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.290
It's just one of the things that he works on the road.
So I,

1021
01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.360
whenever free time comes around,

1022
01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.990
we used to sit back and knock them out and try to shoot him and I would edit

1023
01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:13.520
them and whatnot.
But now I'm busy so he has an editor so,
but you know,

1024
01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:16.180
I try to help them market it when it's finished.
I'm like,
all right,

1025
01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:19.680
post it on the social platforms,
get it out there and when that and that.

1026
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:24.060
<v 2>What about a comedy special?
I've done that.
If you're thinking about doing time,</v>

1027
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:29.100
you think about doing one now.
I did one.
I paid for it myself,

1028
01:02:29.101 --> 01:02:31.110
but how long am I my stomach to be?

1029
01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.380
I looked at her stomach and man,
oh man,
what the fuck out?

1030
01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:42.300
It's been $10,000 then it would have $15,000 stomach.

1031
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:48.960
Horrible.
How long ago was this that you filmed on?
Did it though?

1032
01:02:48.961 --> 01:02:52.650
I must have been,
let's see,
about four years ago.
Four,
five years.

1033
01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.980
Did you release it?
No,
I got it.
You're talking about that one?

1034
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.620
I thought you were talking about the one that's already done and out there.
No,

1035
01:02:58.621 --> 01:03:01.650
let's call.
You got to coordinate.
Yeah.
That one was from showtime.

1036
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:04.230
[inaudible] you didn't release it because he didn't like your stomach.

1037
01:03:04.231 --> 01:03:08.400
I ain't like misdemeanor.
But you didn't,
you didn't get your way,

1038
01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:13.710
but you also didn't get anybody to finish editing it.
Right.

1039
01:03:13.711 --> 01:03:18.090
That was the guy that did they finish it?
It's all finished.
It's finished.

1040
01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:20.810
I don't know.
That's the name.
Uh,
what's your friend named?
It doesn't edit.

1041
01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:25.400
[inaudible] animation and stuff.
Gabe.
Gabe did the album.

1042
01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:29.790
He did the artwork,
the artwork on it.
Oh that's random.
I didn't know you fit.

1043
01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:30.570
I thought he you,

1044
01:03:30.570 --> 01:03:33.720
you always shelf there cause you watched it and you didn't like the way he came

1045
01:03:33.721 --> 01:03:36.900
out and then you never finished editing and posting.
My stomach came out.

1046
01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.230
Usually take that right now.
Take that right now and sell that bad boy.

1047
01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:46.110
I gotta look at it.
I hate to see myself,
my stomach be,

1048
01:03:46.350 --> 01:03:50.280
once you get somebody else to look at it,
I'm going to do that.
Just walk away.

1049
01:03:50.550 --> 01:03:54.600
You can cut that one and sell that one and bring that stomach down.

1050
01:03:56.220 --> 01:04:00.980
Chase.
It never makes any sense there.
Makes me sense.

1051
01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:05.410
I Hate Joe.
She'll had them here for me.
I'll get some folks.

1052
01:04:05.420 --> 01:04:10.230
Don't get Joe,

Oh Oh my gosh.

You're not going to lose weight,

1057
01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:30.530
but they say you gotta stop.
We want to lose it while drinking outcomes.

1058
01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:35.820
They want you to stop drinking.

1083
01:06:16.601 --> 01:06:18.400
I would say something if I had somewhere to be,

1084
01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.850
I don't want you rushing down that freeway.
Oh,

1085
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:27.280
be at a dead.
Good for you.
You stepping up to being a dad to guy?

1086
01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:32.260
I got money at home.
I've got a couch.
It always comes full circle.
No,

1087
01:06:32.261 --> 01:06:36.140
I host this show.
Is it always like this?
Always?
Oh No.
People know.

1088
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:39.890
I've got friends who asked me.
So your dad just,
that's who he is or does it?

1089
01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:42.490
Is that a character?
I'm like,
oh no,
no,
no.
He got on from being himself.

1090
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:45.970
He's one of the lucky cause I shit.
Yeah.
I told,

1091
01:06:45.971 --> 01:06:47.590
I told him that jokingly back into it.
I was like,
I was like,

1092
01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:50.440
you know you're lucky,
right?
He's like,
what'd you mean?
I was like,
I was like,

1093
01:06:50.790 --> 01:06:54.210
I was like,
you are your,
where are you are because you are who you are and you,

1094
01:06:54.211 --> 01:06:57.460
you don't have to fake it.
You just supposed to,
when you're acting,
you should be,

1095
01:06:57.461 --> 01:07:01.440
you should be yourself.
Yeah.
You funny enough.
Definitely be yourself.

1096
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:06.190
Yeah.
I'm on the cartoon.
What did the Boondocks,
Nah.
Huh?

1097
01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:09.490
I didn't change my voice for the boondocks.
No,
I did all,

1098
01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:12.520
I did that and they coming back.
They come up,
boom,
and I was coming back.

1099
01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:15.820
It's a great show.
Yeah.
One of the best cartoons I've ever been.

1100
01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:18.180
I met the duty create and he was friends with my friend Todd.
Yeah,

1101
01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:22.420
I am recruiter.
Yeah,
that'd be beneficial.
We smart dude.

1102
01:07:24.060 --> 01:07:27.800
Very smart.
But like Jesus is also,
he wrote that y'all like Jesus.
Yeah.

1103
01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:31.690
That's another one that you're on that you had like that he like fell into.

1104
01:07:31.691 --> 01:07:34.810
That's the funny part.
Cause uh,
cause remember what the thing is,

1105
01:07:34.811 --> 01:07:38.740
I went in for that show to play one of the,
one of the leads or whatever.
Uh,

1106
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:40.720
it didn't happen but I remember,
cause he's,
you know,

1107
01:07:40.721 --> 01:07:41.860
he's friends with Aaron and whatnot.

1108
01:07:41.861 --> 01:07:45.130
Aaron just called him in to do a like a one day role.
Remember?
Yeah.

1109
01:07:45.131 --> 01:07:49.190
He wanted me to,
he said,
John,
we need you,
your character to um,

1110
01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:53.220
to just do the pilot.
I'll try it,
man.
I don't feel like doing though.

1111
01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:58.090
Jesus.
I'm a homeless man.
Shit,
somebody I got into,

1112
01:07:58.091 --> 01:08:01.690
I thought it was cool.
Yeah.
He said he wants the job is yours.
I said,
well good.

1113
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:05.170
So he went in to do like a,
like a guest star role and then they were like,
Dang,

1114
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:08.020
he's funnier than,
than what we were thinking.
So we,

1115
01:08:08.270 --> 01:08:11.120
so they gave him a role that he was a seat series,
right?
You did three seasons.

1116
01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:13.660
We did to the air and then we finished it though,

1117
01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.520
did a third one that it hasn't aired yet.
And I use,

1118
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:19.130
<v 0>when I did a Hollywood shuffle,</v>

1119
01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:23.480
I played a man who had lost everything.
He was homeless.

1120
01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:27.440
I'm sitting out there and Robert Townsend didn't have any money for wardrobe,

1121
01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:32.560
so I went to a secondhand store and goodwill and bought a couple of roles and

1122
01:08:32.811 --> 01:08:34.670
old shirt and I had a,

1123
01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:39.530
a t shirt of done a tour and put a pen to put it back up.

1124
01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:43.030
So that was,
I thought that was clever.
Uh,

1125
01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:46.640
so this happened 20 years ago.

1126
01:08:46.641 --> 01:08:51.641
I kept that outfit in my garage for 20 years and I used it on black Jesus.

1127
01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.360
Same thing I wore on the Hollywood shuffle.
Wow.

1128
01:08:59.370 --> 01:09:02.270
Let Shuffle up.
What was it?
A whole cake.

1129
01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:04.810
What's the name of that Hollywood shuffle does?
It doesn't have a shelf.

1130
01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:06.493
There it is.

1131
01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:10.480
<v 1>Yeah.
He ain't got honest,
but then they,
so the,
yeah,
so then they took,</v>

1132
01:09:10.481 --> 01:09:13.150
so then he wore it.
They,
they did their thing and then they were like,
well,

1133
01:09:13.151 --> 01:09:16.330
this thing stinks,
so we'll just recreate it for you.
They did everything over.

1134
01:09:16.331 --> 01:09:17.150
He got the same yeah.

1135
01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:20.990
<v 0>Outfit,
uh,
that,
I had this,
that and look at that.</v>

1136
01:09:20.991 --> 01:09:25.430
When I got done marijuana and I got my little wine looking at what whole case,

1137
01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.910
whatever happened to Robert Townsend.
What is he up to me?
He's a director now.

1138
01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:33.380
Just direct in different movies,
different movies and commercials and things.

1139
01:09:33.570 --> 01:09:35.180
He's 10 up to you.
Oh yeah.

1140
01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:39.020
<v 1>We just stopped on tour with him.
We worked all the big places.</v>

1141
01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:43.700
I remember his specials.
He always had those uh,
uh,
Hbo.

1142
01:09:43.701 --> 01:09:46.020
Comedy specials.
Yeah.
All human.
Wayne's did them.

1143
01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:51.010
<v 0>Did them.
Yeah.
Robert Town's,
he's still around.
I saw the picture on my phone.</v>

1144
01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:53.170
I don't know how my phone,

1145
01:09:54.370 --> 01:09:56.170
<v 1>I don't know.
It's probably a new jacket man.</v>

1146
01:09:59.170 --> 01:10:02.800
Directly lose my phone.
He does that at home.
He'll say,
hey,

1147
01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.470
I don't live with her mom.
I'm grown,
I'm married and all that stuff.

1148
01:10:05.471 --> 01:10:10.150
I live on my own with my wife.
He'll call me and say a JD,
you seen my,
uh,

1149
01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:13.390
my cameras.
I moved my camera and I don't know where it is.
I was like,

1150
01:10:13.391 --> 01:10:17.140
I don't live with you.
I have no idea where your things are.

1151
01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:21.430
He's like,
well yeah,
you know and hit my brother lives with him still side.

1152
01:10:21.431 --> 01:10:22.990
It's one of the things I'm like,
why did you ask Alex?

1153
01:10:22.991 --> 01:10:25.720
He's around or someone who's maybe at the house more often.

1154
01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.710
He's like not feeling like you might be the one who,

1155
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:30.880
who might know what he's saying here cause I seen you around here.

1156
01:10:30.881 --> 01:10:34.770
I know you come around,
you come take my dance,
take my stuff over to get me on.

1157
01:10:34.770 --> 01:10:37.750
Take,
take your stuff.
I get nobody had cameras.

1158
01:10:38.350 --> 01:10:42.450
I bought a camera and put it over there cause I know where it is that causes

1159
01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.440
over there.
I come back,

1160
01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.680
ain't over there and I have no idea where that number because I put it over

1161
01:10:47.681 --> 01:10:47.831
there.

1162
01:10:47.831 --> 01:10:51.850
That's because you and mom and Alex and whoever else won't Romans through the

1163
01:10:51.851 --> 01:10:55.090
house.
We'll move things around all the time.
I don't,
I'm not there.

1164
01:10:55.091 --> 01:10:58.790
I'm not there to move things,
but I know what I know where I put things in there.

1165
01:10:58.791 --> 01:11:01.510
Then when I come back it's not there but they,

1166
01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:05.210
but the thing is why do you call me when I'm never there?
You know what?
It

1167
01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:12.240
doesn't make any sense.
You then your Mama Mama will take his stuff.
Mom,

1168
01:11:12.241 --> 01:11:15.660
we'll go shoot her little her stuff because she liked produces desi little

1169
01:11:15.661 --> 01:11:18.510
independent movie.
So she'll,
when she grabbed your cameras,

1170
01:11:18.511 --> 01:11:22.290
that's where they moved to.
Did you feel pressured doing stand up?
Cause this is,

1171
01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:24.660
you know,
actually I didn't,
I didn't want to do it.

1172
01:11:24.661 --> 01:11:27.870
Never really cause I got into acting and I thought that was far enough.

1173
01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:29.460
I was like,
I'm a dad or does that,
I don't want to,

1174
01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:31.460
I don't want jumping on the rest of that stuff.
And it,

1175
01:11:31.461 --> 01:11:35.440
acting was just kind of like on a whim and then stand up was like a dare.

1176
01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:39.450
A friend of mine was like,
we should,
because we back in the day,
not too long ago,

1177
01:11:39.451 --> 01:11:42.990
maybe early 2011 or 12.
Uh,
it's not back in the day,

1178
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:47.430
but me and my boys were hanging out one night in our twenties and we just went,

1179
01:11:47.550 --> 01:11:51.870
uh,
we had come from a club and we drove past the laugh factory and I was like,

1180
01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:54.010
I was like,
you guys want to watch comedy because I don't know,

1181
01:11:54.011 --> 01:11:56.730
it was like 24 or something.
I was like,
I used to know that.
I was like,

1182
01:11:56.731 --> 01:12:00.990
the owner knows me from when I was a baby.
If he's there,
maybe.
Yeah,
yeah,

1183
01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:04.940
Jamie Masada.
But when I,
when I bought your baby,
that's,

1184
01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:08.760
and that's his baby.
That's his introduction to him.
Every time I'm there.

1185
01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:14.460
Whenever I,
whenever I do shows,
that's his introduction for me.
He'll be like,

1186
01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.450
he'd be like,
Hey,
by the way,
I want you to send me John,

1187
01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:20.460
Johnny with her splints on,
I used to get in when he was banned.

1188
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:26.280
I used to [inaudible] but,
uh,
we putting him on stage.

1189
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.350
We went there,
we went there randomly one night and I'm fucking funny.

1190
01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:32.760
That's good.
That's a good impression.

1191
01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.340
We went there randomly one night and I remember,
uh,
the door guy,
I was like,
hey,

1192
01:12:38.410 --> 01:12:41.850
it's Jamie here.
And he's like,
Jamie,
who like as if I didn't know him,

1193
01:12:41.851 --> 01:12:45.290
I was back in there.
I was like,
ah,
you know,
the owner.
And he's like,
tell him,
uh,

1194
01:12:45.450 --> 01:12:48.900
JD Wetherspoons here.
I didn't think anything.
I don't use my name like that.

1195
01:12:48.901 --> 01:12:52.350
But then he like comes down,
he's like,
buddy,
what are you doing here?

1196
01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:55.780
This and that.
You're doing comedy.
I was like,
no,
no,
no.
Me and my friends just,

1197
01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:58.680
we just want to watch a show.
He's like,
yeah,
come,
come in and let's get him,

1198
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:02.200
get him a bottle of wine,
all that stuff.
And we're just hanging out.
Uh,

1199
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:04.620
but then later,
like,
you know,
through the night he was talking,
he was like,

1200
01:13:04.621 --> 01:13:07.590
he was like,
so you're trying to do comedy like your dad.
I was like,
I'm good.

1201
01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:10.860
I don't want to,
I don't care to do that.
I'm fine.
And my friends were with me.

1202
01:13:10.861 --> 01:13:12.570
He's like,
come on.
He's like,
he's like,
you should try it.

1203
01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:16.320
You'll probably be funny.
Maybe even funnier than him,
buddy.
And I,
and I was like,

1204
01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.170
ah,
I don't know.
But then later on that same week,
he was like,
well,

1205
01:13:19.171 --> 01:13:20.370
if you ever want to come by these,
he said,

1206
01:13:20.371 --> 01:13:24.600
swing by through the open mic or whatever.
And uh,
and my boy Henry,

1207
01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.500
yeah,
Henry Henry was like,
hey,
we should do that,
man.
That'd be kind of funny.

1208
01:13:28.501 --> 01:13:33.000
You know,
maybe we be comedians.
I was like,
Nah,
I don't think so.

1209
01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:35.610
And then one night we just said,
I think,

1210
01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:40.050
I think I had someone's email from the laugh factory and hit him up and was
like,

1211
01:13:40.051 --> 01:13:42.060
hey,
me and my buddy are going to come by.
Maybe we can do the mic.

1212
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:45.330
And then they were like,
yeah,
sure,
we'll throw you up this and that.
And uh,

1213
01:13:45.331 --> 01:13:48.120
my buddy Henry,
uh,
he's the one who pressured me into it.

1214
01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.030
We practiced our jokes on camera at home to see how that would look.

1215
01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:55.590
It was the weirdest thing.
It was so weird.
We,
we,
cause I was,

1216
01:13:55.650 --> 01:13:57.210
I was like getting into like,
uh,

1217
01:13:57.510 --> 01:14:01.470
creating content and I was going to film school and I was making like my youtube

1218
01:14:01.471 --> 01:14:05.070
videos,
I was doing like sketch comedy on Youtube and then I like,

1219
01:14:05.071 --> 01:14:08.340
we shot like a little thing.
We watched it back.
I was like,
I guess,

1220
01:14:08.490 --> 01:14:12.880
and then we went to the mic that night and we went,
I did it.

1221
01:14:12.881 --> 01:14:16.780
I was at the back end of the,
the lineups.
So I actually had a decent crowd.

1222
01:14:16.781 --> 01:14:19.390
It was like,
cause you know,
it starts off,
there's nobody there.
It's just comics.

1223
01:14:19.391 --> 01:14:23.080
And then by the time it was my turn,
it was like close to the eight o'clock show.

1224
01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:24.880
So it was like 35 40 people.

1225
01:14:24.881 --> 01:14:28.390
I had three jokes for my three minute set clean and I did it.

1226
01:14:28.391 --> 01:14:31.720
And they did all right.
They let people laughed and I was like,
okay,
that's cool.

1227
01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:34.880
Random,
you know,
and I didn't think much of it.
Henry bombed.

1228
01:14:36.910 --> 01:14:40.450
Yeah,
no,
but it was just one of those things where after that,
um,

1229
01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:49.060
right up there past the Werewolf,
what does the camera,
no,
the camp,

1230
01:14:49.061 --> 01:14:50.900
the cameras or the cameras over there.
You could,

1231
01:14:51.370 --> 01:14:55.730
if you got to go piss say to the camp,
he just said,

1232
01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.710
oh man.
But yeah,
no,
so we

1233
01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.740
did your dad is when he grip.
Well,

1234
01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.150
I got a bit about how when you just get old you just don't care.

1235
01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:10.390
You just don't care about what you say.
He doesn't give a fuck.
No,
not at all.

1236
01:15:10.420 --> 01:15:12.710
But also like that's part of who he is.

1237
01:15:12.711 --> 01:15:17.140
Like his part of his business is not giving a fuck.
Yeah,
pretty much.
Yeah.
Funny.

1238
01:15:17.141 --> 01:15:21.010
Is he though man?
I mean he's the funniest dude.
I personally know that's,

1239
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:24.120
that's how I,
that's how I categorize it,
you know?
Oh,
that's,

1240
01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:29.170
that was my dad.
I would,
I would feel a lot of pressure.
I think it's pressure.

1241
01:15:29.171 --> 01:15:31.930
If I,
if I,
uh,
from the beginning always want to do stand up,
you know,

1242
01:15:31.931 --> 01:15:35.170
kind of like a Michael Jordan thing.
I never like it was,
it was all,

1243
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:40.350
a majority of the stuff I do now is very like just happenstance.

1244
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:43.420
It's like,
oh,
I just fell into this and I'm all right at it,

1245
01:15:43.421 --> 01:15:44.740
so I'll just keep doing it.
Why not?

1246
01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:49.750
When it comes to things like youtube and like I know you do unboxing videos and

1247
01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:53.860
gang related,
you can kind of do that now if you're a,

1248
01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:58.930
if you're an interesting person.
Yeah.
I don't really need much.
No,
no,

1249
01:15:58.931 --> 01:16:02.230
definitely not.
What the Internet now if dad came along today,

1250
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:04.470
you can just didn't exist and all of sudden exists.

1251
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:07.900
Didn't have this giant body of work and you just put a camera on your day like

1252
01:16:07.901 --> 01:16:11.200
this is my dad.
Your Dad could be fucking fair.
No,
blow up.
Yeah.

1253
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:13.480
If he was like a guy that works at the post office,

1254
01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.880
so regular guy film this guy at the post office.

1255
01:16:15.881 --> 01:16:17.020
You're telling your friends like,

1256
01:16:17.021 --> 01:16:20.830
did my dad is the funniest fucking got alive and then you put a camera on him,

1257
01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:23.170
he would blow up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's,
it's,

1258
01:16:23.171 --> 01:16:26.770
it's interesting and one that I never really think of because people always ask

1259
01:16:26.771 --> 01:16:29.380
me when I was growing up,
they'd be like,
oh,
how's it?
How is it that your dad,

1260
01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.690
how do you feel?
I used to get the whole time and the kids would be like,

1261
01:16:31.691 --> 01:16:34.600
your dads,
whoever,
blah blah,
blah,
famous this and that.

1262
01:16:34.601 --> 01:16:37.100
Friday the Wayne's brothers.
And I'm just like,
yeah,
but you know,

1263
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:40.720
to me it's just my dad.
Like,
he's just,
he's just a goofball.
It's normal.

1264
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:42.220
Like to you guys,
I get it to you guys.

1265
01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:44.560
You see somebody who's an entertainer and whatnot.
I'm like,
he's just,

1266
01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:45.910
he's always like that dude.
Have Fun.

1267
01:16:45.911 --> 01:16:50.680
Is he shoved his special cause he doesn't like it.
Oh,
he does funnier stuff.

1268
01:16:50.710 --> 01:16:54.800
He does.
He does.
Weirder stuff.
Find that special and get it out.
Oh,
I mean,
hey,

1269
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:56.680
we could post it.
It's definitely,

1270
01:16:56.681 --> 01:16:58.990
or I could sell it and nowadays he could hit up.

1271
01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.410
I'm sure his people get hit up Netflix.
Like we have a,
we have a body of work.

1272
01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:04.930
People would watch it.
That's the thing.
Yeah.

1273
01:17:05.190 --> 01:17:09.920
He talked them into doing the new special,
I've got to get that stomach.
Got It.

1274
01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.570
Got It.
Got It to you guys.

1275
01:17:11.630 --> 01:17:15.740
I'll have to talk them into coming back here and hitting the gym.
He does,
but he,

1276
01:17:15.741 --> 01:17:19.220
the thing,
the main thing is the consumption.
You know,
it's you.
All right,

1277
01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:23.060
let's cut back on drinking and then continue exercise and you'll see the change.

1278
01:17:23.060 --> 01:17:26.840
I told you,
I tried to tell him,
do a drink a every other day.
Dude,

1279
01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:28.890
she's interested in,
no,
it doesn't,
does it?

1280
01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.220
It sounds like he's 100% interested in drinking or,
or just enjoy,

1281
01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:39.210
he's 100% enjoying dead money and drinking my wine,
drinking my,

1282
01:17:39.250 --> 01:17:44.170
wow.
Yeah.
That's a good time.
He's back near man.
But uh,

1283
01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:46.670
that I live in his life and join it.
Yeah.
But that's,

1284
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:50.360
that's how I got into comedy and then I just kept doing it and my friend was

1285
01:17:50.361 --> 01:17:52.400
like,
yeah,
no,
I'm good.
How many years were you doing it now?

1286
01:17:52.910 --> 01:17:56.610
I would say I'd started in 2012 but I want to say I haven't,

1287
01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:59.000
I didn't continue in the beginning so consistently.

1288
01:17:59.001 --> 01:18:01.910
I did like Mike for the first,
uh,

1289
01:18:02.030 --> 01:18:06.560
two years and then I started getting booked on shows and then I kind of got
lazy.

1290
01:18:06.561 --> 01:18:09.920
It was one of those things where everything I was doing,
uh,

1291
01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:13.910
like I would weigh my options if something was more of an opportunity.

1292
01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.640
I would do that over trying to get better at stand up.

1293
01:18:16.820 --> 01:18:20.810
But now I've been consistent for like three years,
three to four years,

1294
01:18:20.811 --> 01:18:25.811
just like grinding at it because I've made strides doing things and acting and,

1295
01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:29.750
and uh,
and uh,
creating content on the Internet.

1296
01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:32.030
So now I kind of have a,

1297
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:35.600
I guess a little bit of a cushion to just go and get good now.
You know,

1298
01:18:36.110 --> 01:18:39.070
cause I've been working,
so if you're doing other stuff,
yeah,

1299
01:18:39.071 --> 01:18:41.500
I don't have to totally rely on it.
Well,
it's one of those things where it,

1300
01:18:41.501 --> 01:18:44.750
because I don't have to rely on it,
it's that much more,
uh,

1301
01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:48.470
it's that much more of something I want to approach.
I'm like,
oh,

1302
01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:51.290
well now I can like have fun.
I don't feel pressured.

1303
01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:55.580
Not with anything about that,
but more like,
I don't feel pressured to get booked,

1304
01:18:55.581 --> 01:18:59.450
get booked,
get on,
get,
you know,
get a special this money.
I just feel like,
oh,

1305
01:18:59.451 --> 01:19:03.920
I can just take time and get good now.
Yeah.

1306
01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:04.760
Around

1307
01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.230
<v 0>when prior was in his heyday.
Oh yeah.
That must've been something.
Oh yeah.
We,
uh,</v>

1308
01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:10.550
so you were,
you were just kind of,

1309
01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:14.620
that was [inaudible] 74 when you were just getting their prior,
but that was,

1310
01:19:14.621 --> 01:19:18.640
he was,
he was,
he was already,
he was in the peak,
right.
Big Time.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.

1311
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.540
Big Time.
And,
um,
what was I like?
It was,
he would,
uh,
you know,

1312
01:19:23.541 --> 01:19:27.290
when I was around the comedy store,
I was basically the host of the commies,

1313
01:19:27.291 --> 01:19:31.400
the one I emceed,
you know,
and I go to the door if they have a problem,

1314
01:19:31.401 --> 01:19:34.550
I go to the door and settle the problem and all that stuff.
Just Mitzi one.

1315
01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:38.300
She knew I,
I do on this stuff in,
it wasn't no fighting in them,

1316
01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:40.010
just being polite and stuff.

1317
01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:43.220
And Richard would come here and look in the back of bitchy prize in the back.

1318
01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:47.240
Said,
what are you doing?
Hey Richard,
how you doing?
He knew Paul Mooney,

1319
01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:50.450
Mooney was and David Banks,
all these,

1320
01:19:50.690 --> 01:19:52.700
anytime you got all these guys at the comedy store,

1321
01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.870
Richard wanted to do another album.
So what happened is,
um,

1322
01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:01.920
Richard,
first time I,
I saw Richard in the back,
I said,
Richard,

1323
01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:05.150
how are you doing spoon?
I just come by to see how you doing.
I said,
fine,

1324
01:20:05.151 --> 01:20:08.310
I'm doing Richard.
He never come out to see how I'm doing.
He just saying this to,

1325
01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:13.800
to set it up where he wanted to work on his act missing for a new album.

1326
01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:17.510
Um,
so I said,
Richard,
everything fine.
You want to drink?
No spoon.

1327
01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.280
I'll be finally one of those state.
And no,
no,
no.
I'm just come by and say,

1328
01:20:20.281 --> 01:20:23.310
how you doing?
I said,
well,
how are you doing?
How you doing?
Blah,
blah,
blah.

1329
01:20:24.090 --> 01:20:28.430
So I would go,
I need to go away and come back and a service.

1330
01:20:28.431 --> 01:20:30.600
You want anything you want to drink?
They didn't want to drink now.

1331
01:20:30.601 --> 01:20:34.890
So you want to drink,
he'd get up some of the red drink.
He liked all of it.

1332
01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:39.270
What do you call it?
Cherry in it.
It'd be like they kind of stuff and um,

1333
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:45.030
so I know to go away.
I go away and they told me Richard to drive you crazy,

1334
01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:49.640
come back,
which is going to drive you crazy.
So I'll go away,
come back Richard,

1335
01:20:49.650 --> 01:20:52.120
everything are fine.
Anything else you wanted?
Someone goes,

1336
01:20:52.121 --> 01:20:53.970
stays in the hospital and I don't want to go to jets coming.

1337
01:20:53.971 --> 01:20:56.430
I say what's bony or even play with you.
Hey boom,

1338
01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:58.620
be Holly spoon real out and shit.

1339
01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:01.890
And so when I go away and come back to Richard do two minutes,

1340
01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:04.860
some people said Richard Pryor came by the cops.
So he said,
sure.

1341
01:21:04.861 --> 01:21:07.500
I go up and do it to me.
He said,
when am I going?
I said,
going on,

1342
01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:10.140
went up this guy,
get off you.
I put you on right now.

1343
01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.440
And he'd go up there and do two and two hours.

1344
01:21:15.330 --> 01:21:18.780
Then he'll sit and he'll call,
he'll have,
his secretary called me the next day.

1345
01:21:18.781 --> 01:21:22.130
So thanks for helping me get on stage,
helping me get on stage.

1346
01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:26.340
He had to be pushed on stage.
That's a weird,
yeah,
that's amazing.
Anyway,

1347
01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:27.520
but Robin Williams,

1348
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:31.560
Richard would do like two hours,

1349
01:21:31.561 --> 01:21:35.340
but is that an hour and a half hour and a half regular thing?
Huh?
Who his album,

1350
01:21:35.341 --> 01:21:36.150
you know he got,
yeah,

1351
01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:38.730
he do his whole outfit and then he had his writers in the back of Moonee would

1352
01:21:38.731 --> 01:21:41.520
bet they're writing him,
give him,
coaching him on stuff to say,

1353
01:21:41.521 --> 01:21:42.360
you know that stuff.

1354
01:21:42.361 --> 01:21:46.860
He had all that and then he would have,

1355
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:51.750
or three weeks in the original room where he would work every night.

1356
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:54.990
He'd come home every night.
Wow.
It ain't like some comments give,
you know,

1357
01:21:54.991 --> 01:21:57.780
get too high to come,
can come back and he'll be bad at every night.

1358
01:21:58.590 --> 01:22:00.570
And so Mitzi put me on the show with him.

1359
01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:04.600
So I would open this show and do 45 minutes and the rich would come on and do

1360
01:22:04.601 --> 01:22:05.434
what I want to have.

1361
01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:09.780
And then we moved to the main room after about three,

1362
01:22:10.140 --> 01:22:13.170
about a month in divisional room.
We moved to the main room.

1363
01:22:13.171 --> 01:22:16.260
That's when the man and he would draw.
So miss will make so much money.

1364
01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:21.750
He would draw so many fucking people.
Old Holes ain't been out on the street.

1365
01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:27.060
Loans
for college,
first coat of Fur,

1366
01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:31.080
fake fur coat on pink and yellow and shit.
Then

1367
01:22:32.670 --> 01:22:36.510
he would have in the main room,
he would have,
oh my God,
he had Mick Jagger.

1368
01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:41.640
Uh,
what's the name of the board that,
uh,
what's his name?

1369
01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:43.710
Willie Nelson.
I hadn't,

1370
01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:46.560
I thought Willie Nelson go up on the stage and sing a song and the original
room.

1371
01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:50.760
Really?
Yeah.
I said really?
You got you.
You could be,
I got it.

1372
01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:54.930
Cause you got this single song.
God Love Willie Nelson.
He was so good.

1373
01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:58.830
He's still around though.
And he,
he's,
I'm scared to do that.
I'm so nervous.

1374
01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:03.260
Don't be nervous,
but he's fucking people.
He went up there and st one of his son,

1375
01:23:03.261 --> 01:23:07.330
boy,
uh,
was,
that was,
that was a thrill for me.

1376
01:23:08.110 --> 01:23:10.270
So then we moved to the main room,
but I,

1377
01:23:10.271 --> 01:23:14.950
but I would kill every night in,
in a,
in an audience like that.

1378
01:23:15.010 --> 01:23:18.250
I'm going to stand up patient because I would do Mathis and I learned from

1379
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:23.560
Detroit and Nat King Cole and them I would do met Johnny Mathis and my last bit

1380
01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:27.910
and I would do l green just before that.
Um,
and I,
and I w

1381
01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:31.000
I saw Al Green,
uh,

1382
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:36.030
throw roses out until the ladies one time I was at Intel when does it to this

1383
01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:41.560
theater down anyway,
he with roads and he hand wrote it to the ladies.
So I,

1384
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:43.980
when I was working at the comedy store and I'm in front of each,

1385
01:23:43.981 --> 01:23:47.890
I would get done the lines handled from the ladies and the lump sum lady did

1386
01:23:47.891 --> 01:23:52.000
exactly what I want her to say.
She said,
Al Green give us roses.
I said,

1387
01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:55.330
well you lucky these ain't plastic cause I ain't got no damn money.

1388
01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:58.660
I go home and watch TV so I can get them back to you tomorrow night.

1389
01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:02.530
And I did that and doing then Jay,

1390
01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:06.250
Johnny Mathis is just impressions and I added to my act because there a lot of

1391
01:24:06.251 --> 01:24:07.780
ladies out there and they love that shit.

1392
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:12.850
And I got the women through the rows and back at my feet.
I said,
damn,

1393
01:24:12.851 --> 01:24:16.570
this shit is cool in the motherfucker.
And Richard told me,
I said,
Richard,

1394
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:18.890
everybody said bitches,
you should take spoons on the road with you.
You,

1395
01:24:18.900 --> 01:24:21.820
you're going on the tour.
He said,
Oh,
I love you spoon,
but you too funny.

1396
01:24:21.821 --> 01:24:23.860
I ain't going.
I can't have you out there on the road with me.

1397
01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:27.940
He said I was too funny for him.
Wow.
And he took a fighter's,
you know,

1398
01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.670
find his hit the shore if find this would do impressions and stuff.

1399
01:24:30.671 --> 01:24:35.260
He doesn't all impressions.
So he took him on the road.
He told you,

1400
01:24:35.261 --> 01:24:38.740

I love you,

1401
01:24:38.741 --> 01:24:40.570
but you two down in front of you open for me.

1402
01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:46.000
I don't want it to be where I had to work that damn hard on women back at my

1403
01:24:46.001 --> 01:24:49.690
feet.
Boy dandelions.
That's a letter.

1404
01:24:49.930 --> 01:24:51.580
That was a great compliment,

1405
01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:56.340
but I have to do the billboard of the comedy store at Richard Pryor and John

1406
01:24:56.340 --> 01:24:59.260
Witherspoon.
Wow.

1410
01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:11.400

No.
Did they?
Yeah,

1411
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:12.630
They did that like a month or two ago.

1412
01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:17.060
<v 0>Wow.
Good.

Richard Richard.

1414
01:25:22.010 --> 01:25:26.570
I knew we weren't gonna last.
That's it.
We only did four shows.

1415
01:25:26.610 --> 01:25:30.890
They were scared to 22.
Richard was too fucking high

1416
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:36.680
and oh man.
What was he high on?

1417
01:25:37.250 --> 01:25:42.140
Cocaine and [inaudible] and stuff,
you know,
but I didn't have no money.

1418
01:25:42.141 --> 01:25:44.210
I probably would've gotten me something if I had some money.

1419
01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:48.530
I ain't no damn money.
I'm making this little $400,

1420
01:25:48.531 --> 01:25:52.970
$400 that they gave me for this week.
He said,
Yo,
y'all ain't making no money.

1421
01:25:52.971 --> 01:25:57.120
But I'm making $250,000 a show.
I told him,
damn.
Wow.
He's making not much to see.

1422
01:25:57.140 --> 01:26:01.560
There you go.
Look in there.
Richard Pryor and John with her spelling.
Wow.
Lj,

1423
01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:06.440

That's amazing.
77,

1424
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:09.410
but I know Richard,
we used go his house every Sunday.

1425
01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.790
We used to be at his house every Sunday and,
and he had um,

1426
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:19.560
he had um,
a barbecue.
Had people he had a little bit,

1427
01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:24.560
he got a gym boxing gym.
Where you box tennis court,

1428
01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:29.970
Swimming Pool.
Uh,
he had four,

1429
01:26:29.971 --> 01:26:33.980
about four acres over there and I remember,
was it,
where was it?

1430
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:38.750
It's on Parthenia.
Their house there was for sale recently for about 4 million.

1431
01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:41.720
But uh,
I don't think people realize that Richard Pryor live in it.

1432
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:45.140
They don't want to do,
they called the EAP caught on fire over there.
Whoa.

1433
01:26:45.170 --> 01:26:49.730
Limited time.
You got caught on fire.
He goes,
that house.
It was in the House Day.

1434
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:52.670
Fuck.
I would love to own that.
Something like Northridge or something.

1435
01:26:52.671 --> 01:26:56.500
Part of the day.
It's,
it's on Partina.
We used when I'm doing [inaudible],

1436
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:59.220
it's right down the street.
Don't feel,
yeah,

1437
01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:04.720
we just go over there every Sunday.
Imagine owning Richard Pryor's old house.

1438
01:27:05.370 --> 01:27:08.590
Uh,
I don't want to go in their book and that spirit might hit me up.

1439
01:27:10.140 --> 01:27:14.140
He on five on run past the swimming pool,
you know that he was,

1440
01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:17.090
he came days must have been crazy there.
Oh Man.

1441
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:20.600
And what's amazing about this is so cold boy,

1442
01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:24.950
when the stuff got on radio that Richard Pryor is in hospital in critical

1443
01:27:24.951 --> 01:27:29.240
condition,
he and from Burns from pipe that blew up.

1444
01:27:29.890 --> 01:27:33.860
Um,
his family went there and stole all of his,

1445
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:37.790
his people that he probably never seen in emceeing in years.

1446
01:27:38.150 --> 01:27:42.140
Jumped over that damn you had this huge fence and stole all these watches and

1447
01:27:42.141 --> 01:27:45.230

All this stuff taken out of his house.

1448
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:49.970
Then he say he's gonna so by they jumped back over the fence and put it back.
No,

1449
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:55.160

They jumped back on the fence with this stuff.
They put it back.
Yeah,

1450
01:27:55.161 --> 01:27:57.870

1452
01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:03.470
but 20 years now all of a sudden you're going to steal his watch.
That's crazy.

1453
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:08.150
Yeah.
It's a hard to be had so much fun over there.

1454
01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:13.900
And Sammy Davis Jr would come there every Sunday and the limousine and a Tuxedo

So when you were around,</v>

1475
01:29:44.381 --> 01:29:47.590

when he first saw you first started working there,

1476
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:52.030
that was,
yeah,
he was a big shift,
right?
That was a,
no one had seen anything.

1477
01:29:52.090 --> 01:29:56.170
Anybody like him before.
Oh no dive.
Even since,
yeah,

1478
01:29:56.710 --> 01:30:01.000
he was a,
Gary sold each one.
Dude.
What's so funny,
one time he,

1479
01:30:02.440 --> 01:30:03.273
he,

1480
01:30:04.090 --> 01:30:09.090
he bought some Chinese food with a hat on his head with a alone coat on.

1481
01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:14.100
There's some big sunglasses and ate it in front of this uh,

1482
01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:18.040
change Korean store just standing there when he's outside standing and want to

1483
01:30:18.041 --> 01:30:19.110
do.
And I did.
Oh,

1484
01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:26.290
fucking fucking Sam.
Why was he doing that?
That's crazy.

1485
01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:31.400
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

1486
01:30:32.130 --> 01:30:33.390
He had the same thing

1487
01:30:33.850 --> 01:30:35.380
<v 0>on this date at the comedy store.</v>

1488
01:30:35.381 --> 01:30:39.790
He will be upset with his sunglasses on and he would have Chinese food or Korean

1489
01:30:39.791 --> 01:30:44.791
food and he sit there and eat and tell some jokes and go back onstage at the

1490
01:30:45.851 --> 01:30:49.270
minimum individual rooms.
That's fine.
I've seen him crazy.

1491
01:30:49.271 --> 01:30:53.540
I've seen some crazy people in the original room by enabled,

1492
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:58.030
they were funny what a comedy store has a lot of history.
Oh my God.
Mitzi.

1493
01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:02.020
Mitzi.
Let them do it.
It was so nice to people.
She was brilliant.

1494
01:31:02.021 --> 01:31:05.170
Let me tell you something.
She knew to let the comedians run the place.

1495
01:31:05.380 --> 01:31:09.850
She was smart,
joke around about,
but then sailing a misfit toy.

1496
01:31:10.930 --> 01:31:13.710
She goes,
you know what,
she's,
I tried to tell her,
I said,

1497
01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:18.720
Mitzi give the comics $5 to buy some eggs and bacon on the way home.

1498
01:31:20.320 --> 01:31:24.100
She didn't want to do that and at the end of this ain't nothing.
This is cotton.

1499
01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:27.970
This is their college,
missy.
Anybody paid to get in here?

1500
01:31:27.971 --> 01:31:29.950
You better go on and get these people ain't gonna.
You're gonna.

1501
01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:31.000
They gonna mess up your room.

1502
01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:34.270
And then when she went to a big stink with the right,

1503
01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:38.070
the right medium for the strike,
big stink.

1504
01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:43.050
And then you had some people that will see,
you can tell some people crazy.
Uh,

1505
01:31:43.150 --> 01:31:46.190
what's the name jumped off the roof of the,
of the jail.

1506
01:31:46.270 --> 01:31:49.810
I had house hold is his name.
I knew his name.
I knew the kid.

1507
01:31:49.811 --> 01:31:53.920
I used to introduce some all the time.
Uh,
shit,
I don't have her name right now,

1508
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:58.300
but uh,
to meet you just give him something,
you know,
so they think that they're,

1509
01:31:58.301 --> 01:32:01.400
they've done something.
Most of them drove by here and,

1510
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:04.960
and they all want to succeed.
They want to like,
they succeeded at something.

1511
01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:08.710
She's paying us,
she's paying us for,
for four eggs,

1512
01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:13.540
but she didn't want to do with me up.
Now I don't know how much they get.

1513
01:32:13.541 --> 01:32:16.750
Today happens you get,
you don't know how much you can do.
You get regular,

1514
01:32:16.751 --> 01:32:21.450
so you get paid.
It wasn't get a percentage of what the take is for the doors.

1515
01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:25.990
Good in the main room.
So if the main room sold out,
you can make money.

1516
01:32:26.190 --> 01:32:27.550
And then they used to do that bar.

1517
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:30.670
I think the argument they'd been doing that for a long time.
They five bucks.

1518
01:32:30.671 --> 01:32:34.210
Yeah.
I think get four or $500 in the,
in the and in the main room.

1519
01:32:34.211 --> 01:32:37.930
In the main room you can make some money.
Yeah.
But for guys like us,

1520
01:32:37.931 --> 01:32:41.880
it's more important as a place to exercise.
It's like a joke.
Yeah.

1521
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:47.350
I did two shows there last night.
I used to love the work,
the uh,
and the uh,

1522
01:32:47.410 --> 01:32:52.060
with Richard Pryor.
Boy.
Wow.
What a wonderful the ordinances on every note.

1523
01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:54.730
Everything you say,
they're right there.
Oh,
I'd imagine.

1524
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:56.740
Oh they must have realized too.

1525
01:32:56.770 --> 01:33:01.630
Cause before when you think about like real giant famous comedians before,
prior.

1526
01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.710
That's like a tiny handful of them.
Nobody like him.

1527
01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:07.930
And he'd say he was just one of one.

1528
01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:11.820
Then I remember Redd Foxx used to come through there and I want to get me in

1529
01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.810
down double look up.

1530
01:33:12.811 --> 01:33:16.870
I say a and a coke and I ain't paying or none of that shit.

1531
01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:23.050
[inaudible]
red was so funny.

1532
01:33:23.051 --> 01:33:27.760
Boy Read my man read.
I bought it and I was at a gas station stop one day,

1533
01:33:27.761 --> 01:33:27.991
you know,

1534
01:33:27.991 --> 01:33:32.350
in the little stores and had cassette tapes of Richard Pryor performing live at

1535
01:33:32.351 --> 01:33:34.960
Red Foxes Club,
uh,
Red Fox at a club.

1536
01:33:34.961 --> 01:33:37.950
They just had a recorder and he's just fucking around.
Oh yeah.

1537
01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:40.840
You can tell he's ranting and raving.
Oh yeah.
He says hi.

1538
01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:44.710
Just laughing and talking shit on stage.
Like it's not prepared material.

1539
01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:48.910
Half of it.
It was amazing what a character.
Redd Foxx said,
boy,

1540
01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:50.800
he wouldn't pay his taxes.

1541
01:33:51.490 --> 01:33:56.080
So the government came there one night when he only people in the room took

1542
01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:58.630
everything,
everything.
Went to his house,
took everything.

1543
01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:01.780
He took a ring on his finger and he took his shoes.

1544
01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:06.810
They took it and they never made chicken raw to cook in the oven.

1545
01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:11.110
And so he,
they shut him down.
It's the place she had,

1546
01:34:11.111 --> 01:34:15.160
I think is on La Sienna because somewhere it was in la.
Yeah,
La yet.
Um,

1547
01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:18.970
so he crying.
Oh God.
He called Sammy Davis.
He called [inaudible],

1548
01:34:19.010 --> 01:34:22.570
they call it [inaudible].
They took her everyday now own.

1549
01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:27.900
I worked so hard to be who I am.
I do.
I just,
I only texted any of that bad.

1550
01:34:28.180 --> 01:34:29.380
They took everything.

1551
01:34:30.490 --> 01:34:35.490
So Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis junior and some other other friends,

1552
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:40.660
uh,
went to his club and work two or three weeks every night.

1553
01:34:41.350 --> 01:34:45.540
Two shows,
sold them out to get enough money to pay,

1554
01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:50.260
get his taxes and get his club back.
He was so happy to everybody's,
Oh my God,

1555
01:34:50.261 --> 01:34:54.070
I want to thank you for doing this for me.
Oh,
please just take my dick,

1556
01:34:54.071 --> 01:34:56.800

Let me just hug you.
Hugging everybody.

1557
01:34:57.950 --> 01:35:02.550
So they all went on these type of ways with Fox.
Still didn't pain.

1558
01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:06.430
<v 2>Fucking Texas.
No.
Come in and came and lean on his A's.</v>

1559
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:11.320
You son of a bitch.
You do.
They want friction out the name.
But I coming back now,

1560
01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:16.060
see,
oh my God,
we'll pay taxes again.
He paid no taxes.

1561
01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:19.910
Was this before or after Sanford and son?
It was before.
And I bet,

1562
01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:24.850
I don't think he paid after San,
he believed in Plano,
Texas.
My money

1563
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:27.340
pay my taxes.

1564
01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:32.910
<v 0>Uh Damn.
Yeah,

1565
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:34.423
I got,

1566
01:35:34.430 --> 01:35:39.290
I had tax problem that we had an apartment building in Beverly Hills.

1567
01:35:39.291 --> 01:35:42.860
I own apartment in Beverly Hills.
I said,
well,
I'm doing good.

1568
01:35:43.190 --> 01:35:46.280
I just ran my car past dancing.
That's my place.

1569
01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.990
And I swear the taxes got bad.

1570
01:35:51.020 --> 01:35:54.480
If something happened to me and they took that fucking place,
I had to sell it.

1571
01:35:54.740 --> 01:35:58.040
I didn't take it.
I to sell it.
I hate that need today.

1572
01:35:58.041 --> 01:36:01.840
I hate that you hit all that money you missed,
aren't ya?
Oh God.

1573
01:36:01.850 --> 01:36:06.320
Well just a rad pass and look at the place and,
and uh,

1574
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:10.140
and we'll get some lady called,
uh,
we,

1575
01:36:10.150 --> 01:36:12.740
we had him push the person to clean up the place all the time.

1576
01:36:12.741 --> 01:36:14.720
Sheet manager of the hotel.

1577
01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:19.340
And so my wife out there watering the grass and stuff.
I mean,

1578
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:21.970
she called the police,
uh,
called him and said,

1579
01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:26.720
there's a black lady out here watering the grass and we don't recognize her.

1580
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:28.790
And somebody who was a tenant,

1581
01:36:28.810 --> 01:36:33.460
are you talking about the manager Senate called the managers and he said was

1582
01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:37.790
probably the owner.
It was Angela.
I do it.
That's funny.

1583
01:36:37.820 --> 01:36:41.560
I used to go back there and sit cause they had the wash machine and dryer

1584
01:36:41.630 --> 01:36:46.610
outside.
Uh,
in the back you need the parking lot.

1585
01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:50.430
So he was,
it was outside but it was in enclosed.
I sit out there,

1586
01:36:50.431 --> 01:36:54.440
boy it would be so quiet back there.
I said,
boy,

1587
01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:58.160
Them don't chase my ass down the street and this,
this is much better.

1588
01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:00.190
I got a pocket full of money.

1589
01:37:01.410 --> 01:37:05.130
<v 2>I ain't want to leave
like a pocket full of money.</v>

1590
01:37:05.650 --> 01:37:10.230
Want to leave?
Ain't leave.

You need a,

1591
01:37:10.231 --> 01:37:13.600

Call it the pocket full of money podcast.

1592
01:37:15.290 --> 01:37:19.320
I thought about doing one.
Huh?
Have you thought about doing pause?
What does that,

1593
01:37:19.350 --> 01:37:23.890
that's what we're doing right now.
I don't want this to be on the air.

1594
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:31.030
You can't,

He's in a different realm,
Joe.

1595
01:37:32.490 --> 01:37:33.930
But you can sell out everywhere.

1596
01:37:33.931 --> 01:37:37.830
If he did that guarantee you money off selling fall.

1597
01:37:37.990 --> 01:37:41.220
[inaudible] told me that somebody took,

You could do,
like,</v>

1603
01:37:57.810 --> 01:38:00.900
you could do it every time you're on a plane talking to your phone.

1604
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:01.743
Where are you talking about?

1605
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:04.890
How much time do you do on the podcast or the theater or are you talking about

1606
01:38:04.900 --> 01:38:06.630
pot?
Pot came as much time as you want.

1607
01:38:06.850 --> 01:38:08.880
If I was in the theater and I'm doing a pocket,

1608
01:38:08.881 --> 01:38:12.080
you got to sit at a thing like this and you're not in it.
See,
I knew,

1609
01:38:12.090 --> 01:38:15.240
I knew he crossed it.
I was like,
what?
No,
no,
no,
no,

1610
01:38:17.210 --> 01:38:20.970
no,
no.
He's saying,
he's saying can you sell out theaters by yourself?

1611
01:38:20.971 --> 01:38:23.190
That's what he asked you.
I doubt that.
Okay,

1612
01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:25.410
so we established that you sell out clubs,

1613
01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.750
but then he was saying if you were doing a podcast,

1614
01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:31.230
kind of like what we're doing right now,
that's what this is.
Uh,
you could,

1615
01:38:31.950 --> 01:38:35.250
as you build up the podcast,
you could be promoting it and recording it.

1616
01:38:35.250 --> 01:38:36.270
You wouldn't have to do it in a theater.

1617
01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:37.950
You can do it at that comfort of your own home.
You can do,

1618
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:42.980
you can set it up like this,
just like this.
And then you,
you become popular.

1619
01:38:43.230 --> 01:38:46.740
Sure.
I mean you've got popularity behind you,
so I'm sure people want to hear it.

1620
01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:50.900
100%.
Yeah.
Just when I came into this,
you're gonna want to hear it.
Yeah.
I have,

1621
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:54.690
I have a podcast with Paul,
me and me and my brother Paul.
We have a protocol,

1622
01:38:55.110 --> 01:38:56.640
the JD and Paul cast.

1623
01:38:56.641 --> 01:39:00.570
It's just me and my buddy and we talk like video games and video games,

1624
01:39:00.571 --> 01:39:04.830
technology,
whatever your current current events and also like movie.

1625
01:39:04.831 --> 01:39:07.410
We'll do a little mini movie reviews on it.
Kind of set up.
Do you have,

1626
01:39:07.411 --> 01:39:12.150
do you have a microphone?
I'm like,
I'm like a tech dude,
so I have everything.

1627
01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:16.380
I,
my,
my office at my house is a,
it's like decked out with a bunch of stuff.

1628
01:39:16.381 --> 01:39:18.580
I brought him over there recently to help me.
I,

1629
01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:21.840
I get him to do videos with me just because it's like they're funny and I don't

1630
01:39:21.841 --> 01:39:23.520
care.
And like let's just make something random.

1631
01:39:23.521 --> 01:39:26.640
Because the other day we played mortal Kombat and I had him,

1632
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:30.590
I had him react to the fatalities.
So I was like,
that's a funny video.

1633
01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:34.050
My Dad reacts to mortal combat fatalities and literally we're watching it.

1634
01:39:34.051 --> 01:39:37.380
Literally he's just like,
Oh man,
look at her head,
go left and rang.
No,

1635
01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:42.300
this so amazing.
Yeah,
that stuff is,
and that's on my gaming channel,

1636
01:39:42.301 --> 01:39:46.770
which is run.
Jd run on youtube and stuff is too serious for me,

1637
01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:50.330
but like our,
our podcast.
But we've also,
we've,

1638
01:39:50.380 --> 01:39:54.300
I've also had him play Vr,
so because he wanted to play VR robot,
he's like,

1639
01:39:54.301 --> 01:39:57.330
do you have seen you doing the virtual reality?
Let me see.
You try to,

1640
01:39:57.690 --> 01:40:01.050
so we did the one with the shark attack,
that's another one.

1641
01:40:01.110 --> 01:40:03.930
This one wasn't even a game.
It was just like a tutorial.

1642
01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:06.780
Like you just put it on and live through the thing and it's like a deep ocean

1643
01:40:06.781 --> 01:40:11.760
dive and he was tripping out.
It's like this shot I shot a shotgun.
Sharks.

1644
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:15.830
Yeah.
Sharks in his face and he's screaming about it.
He's like,
he's like,

1645
01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:20.010
and mind you,
there was a point in the video,
uh,
where he's,

1646
01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:23.160
he's not talking but he's shaking and I thought something bad was,

1647
01:40:23.161 --> 01:40:26.190
I thought something's happening.
I'm like,
Dad,
are you good?
He was trying to,

1648
01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:29.730
he was like trying to kick and or strangle the shark,

1649
01:40:29.731 --> 01:40:32.640
which was virtually in front of me.
He was like,
he was like,

1650
01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:36.570
he was like this and I'm like dad.
And he just yells out at the shark.
He's like,

1651
01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:37.583
fuck Outta here.

1652
01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:42.720
[inaudible] her name was Shelley was standing in the cage.

1653
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:44.970
The cage take you down all your,
yeah.

1654
01:40:44.971 --> 01:40:48.780
I then bought him a playstation four to play the game at his house and I don't

1655
01:40:48.781 --> 01:40:52.950
know any of that stuff.
Your,
your son took it.
My brother took it cause my,

1656
01:40:53.290 --> 01:40:54.190
cause my brother uses

1657
01:40:54.190 --> 01:40:58.040
<v 2>it for Netflix.
He just watches the play.
There we go.
That's looking at him.</v>

1658
01:40:58.110 --> 01:41:01.930
Look at him going crazy.
Look.
Yeah,

1659
01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:04.180
he's bugging and that's me and my brother were going,

1660
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:08.710
we're like dying laughing about it and dumped it over my head.

1661
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:13.920
Yeah.
Looking back on my neck,
my neck.

1662
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:20.350
Oh my God.
Oh Man.
Oh my God.
This is the show.
Yeah.
No,

1663
01:41:20.351 --> 01:41:23.380
but it shows you and him.
We,
we've,
I mean we,

1664
01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:26.110
I tried to create stuff with them all the time just because it's random and

1665
01:41:26.111 --> 01:41:28.540
funny.
Back in the day I probably didn't do it cause people,

1666
01:41:28.650 --> 01:41:32.020
it's one of those things where,
uh,
it wasn't a huge deal.

1667
01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:35.740
But now this Washington's best,

1668
01:41:35.770 --> 01:41:40.180
some video titled Jamie for people.
My Dad freaks out playing with Er.

1669
01:41:40.460 --> 01:41:44.680
Yeah,

1670
01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:47.710

You do show with them once a week.
That's,

1676
01:42:08.351 --> 01:42:11.100
it might have to do an audio thing.
Oh my God.

Maybe more than that.
