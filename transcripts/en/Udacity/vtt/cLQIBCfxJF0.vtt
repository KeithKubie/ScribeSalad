00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.092
And the answer is the first message is the only

00:00:02.092 --> 00:00:05.133
valid message. The message is no good because

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:09.176
it’s encrypted using the public key of node 5 and

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.661
so node 1 won't be able to decrypt it. The rest of

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:13.828
this, all use the public key of node 1. The third

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:16.637
option won't work because there is only one hub.

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:18.610
And because there is only one hub, node 1 can

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.527
see that the message came from Alice and is

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:22.381
going to Bob and this is what we don’t want to

00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:23.679
know it to be able to learn.

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:26.074
The second option won't work because after node

00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:29.496
1, message is directed to go to node 3 which is

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.758
encrypted using a public key of node 4. And so

00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:33.424
node 3 won't be able to decrypt the rest of this

00:00:33.424 --> 00:00:37.104
message. The first option works, it’s encrypted

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:39.052
using the public key of node 1, so node 1 can

00:00:39.052 --> 00:00:42.567
decrypt it. It’s directed to send it to node 2 and it’s

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:44.859
encrypted using the public key of node 2 and so

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.373
that hub work. Node 2 is then directed to send the

00:00:47.373 --> 00:00:49.403
message to Bob which is encrypted with the public

00:00:49.403 --> 00:00:52.001
key of Bob, so Bob will be able to decrypt the

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:56.000
message and receive Onions Galore.
