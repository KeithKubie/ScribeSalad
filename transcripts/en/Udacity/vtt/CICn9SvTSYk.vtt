00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.764
Even though we can't split this into two separate inequalities and solve, this

00:00:04.764 --> 00:00:09.093
inequality does tell us something. It tells us that the values of x 4 and

00:00:09.093 --> 00:00:13.778
negative 4 are really important. If we did consider each of these factors by

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:18.450
itself an inequality these two points would be the end points of the solution

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.526
intervals. So let's say then that we're going to use these two points to break

00:00:23.526 --> 00:00:28.629
the entire number lineup into three sections. One over here, one in the middle

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:33.622
and one over here. Now that we have these three different regions in our number

00:00:33.622 --> 00:00:38.334
line, I'd like you to label each of those intervals with an inequality that

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:42.897
tells us what values of x lie in that interval. Make sure that you exclude

00:00:42.897 --> 00:00:44.425
negative four and four.
