00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.730
The journey in this lesson should have given you a good idea of how it is

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:12.710
possible to innovate under the covers. Externally, Sun was still

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.030
peddling UNIX boxes, but internally they

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.940
had completely revolutionized the structure of the

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.250
network operating system through the use

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.490
of object technology. If fact, the subcontract

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.850
mechanism that Sun invented as part of the Spring system forms the

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.400
basis for something that many of you who are Java programmers are using

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.210
a lot, namely Java RMI. In this lesson that you're

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.580
going to look at, we are going to study Java RMI and also Enterprise JavaBeans.
