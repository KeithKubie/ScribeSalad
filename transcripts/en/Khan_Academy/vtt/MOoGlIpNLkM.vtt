00:00:01.048 --> 00:00:02.210
- [Voiceover] The range of colors

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.676
that homeowners could use on
the exterior of their houses

00:00:05.676 --> 00:00:10.676
was blank by the
community's stringent rules

00:00:10.684 --> 00:00:13.250
regarding upkeep of property.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.548
So we're talking about the range of colors

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.706
that homeowners could use on
the exterior of their house.

00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:22.281
And it was blank by the
community's stringent rules.

00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:24.522
So stringent rules,
that means strict rules.

00:00:24.522 --> 00:00:27.622
They're not gonna allow
a lot of range of colors.

00:00:27.622 --> 00:00:30.002
They're going to be very, maybe, specific

00:00:30.002 --> 00:00:31.430
or they're going to try to limit

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.519
the number of colors that
you might want to use.

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:34.785
That's the way I'm thinking of this.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:36.584
Now let's look at the choices.

00:00:36.584 --> 00:00:39.510
So the first one is circumscribed,

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.319
which means putting boundaries
on things, limiting things.

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.349
That seems in line with
having stringent rules.

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:47.624
The range of colors that
homeowners could use

00:00:47.624 --> 00:00:51.001
on the exterior of their
houses was circumscribed

00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:53.707
by the community's stringent rules

00:00:53.707 --> 00:00:56.505
regarding upkeep of property.

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:58.142
That actually feels pretty good,

00:00:58.142 --> 00:01:00.882
so I'm gonna go with this one for now.

00:01:00.882 --> 00:01:02.635
They were trying to put restraints on

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:04.794
or putting limits or putting boundaries

00:01:04.794 --> 00:01:08.141
which is what circumscribed means.

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:10.048
Stringent rules would essentially

00:01:10.048 --> 00:01:12.347
circumscribe the range of colors.

00:01:12.347 --> 00:01:13.566
That makes sense.

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:14.971
Let's look at these other choices.

00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:17.606
The range of colors that
homeowners could use

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:19.161
on the exterior of their houses

00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:22.447
was bolstered by the
community's stringent rules.

00:01:22.447 --> 00:01:24.769
Well no, stringent rules
aren't going to bolster,

00:01:24.769 --> 00:01:26.487
they're not going to boost
the number of colors.

00:01:26.487 --> 00:01:27.926
They're not going to
give you more options.

00:01:27.926 --> 00:01:29.470
They're probably going to
give you fewer options.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.363
So let's rule that one out.

00:01:31.363 --> 00:01:34.741
The range of colors was embellished

00:01:34.741 --> 00:01:36.807
by the community's stringent rules?

00:01:36.807 --> 00:01:37.643
No, once again,

00:01:37.643 --> 00:01:39.419
embellishing means to add more,

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:40.801
to kind of put some frills on it,

00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.005
to make it a little bit more exciting

00:01:43.005 --> 00:01:44.829
if we're talking about
embellishing a story.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:46.443
So stringent rules are not going to

00:01:46.443 --> 00:01:47.986
embellish a range of colors,

00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:49.728
they're going to restrict
a range of colors.

00:01:49.728 --> 00:01:52.282
They're not going to make
it even more exciting,

00:01:52.282 --> 00:01:54.984
more flowery, more options.

00:01:54.984 --> 00:01:58.189
So the range of colors was insinuated

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.963
by the community's stringent rules?

00:02:00.963 --> 00:02:04.157
Insinuating means you're
implying something,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.400
you're hinting at something

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.606
without really saying it directly.

00:02:07.606 --> 00:02:09.719
Now stringent rules seem
like the type of rules

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.483
that they wouldn't try
beat around the bush.

00:02:11.483 --> 00:02:12.621
They would just get to the point.

00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:14.420
They wouldn't try to insinuate things.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.509
They wouldn't just try to hint.

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:17.729
They would be very specific about

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:19.389
"Look, this is what you can
do and what you can't do."

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:21.792
So I don't think community stringent rules

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:24.207
would try to insinuate a range of colors,

00:02:24.207 --> 00:02:25.553
they would just tell you,

00:02:25.553 --> 00:02:26.970
"Look, you're either
gonna do this or that,

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.444
"this is allowed, this is not allowed."

00:02:28.444 --> 00:02:31.665
That's what makes them
stringent, very strict rules.

00:02:31.665 --> 00:02:35.584
The range of colors was cultivated

00:02:35.584 --> 00:02:37.813
by the community's stringent rules.

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:39.391
Well once again cultivated means

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:41.307
that you're helping to kind of develop.

00:02:41.307 --> 00:02:42.828
You're cultivating a garden,

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:44.708
you're really fostering it,

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:46.043
you're giving it nutrition,

00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:48.689
you're really trying to
make something blossom.

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.664
And once again, stringent rules,

00:02:50.664 --> 00:02:52.045
that doesn't seem like something that

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.971
would try to cultivate a range of colors.

00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:56.828
"Hey let's try and think of more colors.

00:02:56.828 --> 00:02:59.172
"Let's make sure we've thought
of all the colors possible

00:02:59.172 --> 00:03:00.485
and all of the rest."

00:03:00.485 --> 00:03:02.006
That doesn't make a lot of sense

00:03:02.006 --> 00:03:06.006
that stringent rules would try to do that.
