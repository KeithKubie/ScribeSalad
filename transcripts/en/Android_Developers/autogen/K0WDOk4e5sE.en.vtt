question baby and about the assets

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
question baby and about the assets
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.990
question baby and about the assets
assets for the library projects I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
assets for the library projects I
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.110
assets for the library projects I
already asked that on the moderator

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120
already asked that on the moderator
 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.450
already asked that on the moderator
regarding the inheritance of the assets

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460
regarding the inheritance of the assets
 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.910
regarding the inheritance of the assets
because we have some like for example

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920
because we have some like for example
 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.580
because we have some like for example
sunbae fuse just some HTML files and

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590
sunbae fuse just some HTML files and
 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.270
sunbae fuse just some HTML files and
some graphics or PNG files not fancy

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
some graphics or PNG files not fancy
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.250
some graphics or PNG files not fancy
stuff and we have for example the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260
stuff and we have for example the
 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.229
stuff and we have for example the
library project with common HTML files

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239
library project with common HTML files
 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:30.980
library project with common HTML files
and common

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990
and common
 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.830
and common
images and now we need to always copy

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840
images and now we need to always copy
 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.650
images and now we need to always copy
these assets over to the final projects

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660
these assets over to the final projects
 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.780
these assets over to the final projects
in order to get the stuff down but I

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790
in order to get the stuff down but I
 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.570
in order to get the stuff down but I
think this would be a really nice thing

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580
think this would be a really nice thing
 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.360
think this would be a really nice thing
to let the SDK tools do that do it

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370
to let the SDK tools do that do it
 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.700
to let the SDK tools do that do it
because it's plain simple just copy the

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710
because it's plain simple just copy the
 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.610
because it's plain simple just copy the
essence over and do a simple inheritance

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620
essence over and do a simple inheritance
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.010
essence over and do a simple inheritance
and I'm just asking white and there

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020
and I'm just asking white and there
 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.830
and I'm just asking white and there
because it's so an easy feature in my

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840
because it's so an easy feature in my
 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.340
because it's so an easy feature in my
opinion I think it's because assets are

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350
opinion I think it's because assets are
 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.200
opinion I think it's because assets are
you did there it does it's a folder

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210
you did there it does it's a folder
 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.630
you did there it does it's a folder
location and its relative to the driver

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640
location and its relative to the driver
 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.330
location and its relative to the driver
space occasion if you if you read the

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340
space occasion if you if you read the
 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.370
space occasion if you if you read the
documentation carefully it says that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
documentation carefully it says that
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.320
documentation carefully it says that
although raw assets are not supported

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330
although raw assets are not supported
 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.210
although raw assets are not supported
for library projects that raw resources

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220
for library projects that raw resources
 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.810
for library projects that raw resources
are so anything you drop into rest right

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820
are so anything you drop into rest right
 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.290
are so anything you drop into rest right
side row should be okay I mean there's

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300
side row should be okay I mean there's
 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.870
side row should be okay I mean there's
really you know they're apart from a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880
really you know they're apart from a
 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.880
really you know they're apart from a
minor API difference on how you access

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890
minor API difference on how you access
 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.340
minor API difference on how you access
it there's not a lot of difference

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350
it there's not a lot of difference
 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.910
it there's not a lot of difference
between how you deal with a raw resource

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920
between how you deal with a raw resource
 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.660
between how you deal with a raw resource
versus an asset resource I had a quick

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670
versus an asset resource I had a quick
 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.970
versus an asset resource I had a quick
look around on this one and there is a

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980
look around on this one and there is a
 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.270
look around on this one and there is a
place from savvier from the adg team and

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280
place from savvier from the adg team and
 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.490
place from savvier from the adg team and
basically what it says is he's not come

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500
basically what it says is he's not come
 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.160
basically what it says is he's not come
up with enough time to work on an

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170
up with enough time to work on an
 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.830
up with enough time to work on an
intelligent solution for collisions

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840
intelligent solution for collisions
 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.360
intelligent solution for collisions
between assets are in the library

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370
between assets are in the library
 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.370
between assets are in the library
project and assets which are in your

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380
project and assets which are in your
 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.290
project and assets which are in your
actual application project so i think

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300
actual application project so i think
 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.580
actual application project so i think
it's just one of those things that's on

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590
it's just one of those things that's on
 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.050
it's just one of those things that's on
the list and just hasn't been got around

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060
the list and just hasn't been got around
 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.440
the list and just hasn't been got around
to yet okay that would be a good

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450
to yet okay that would be a good
 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.230
to yet okay that would be a good
explanation because it's I don't know

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240
explanation because it's I don't know
 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.180
explanation because it's I don't know
where there are so many collisions so

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190
where there are so many collisions so
 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.460
where there are so many collisions so
for example yet the order of the library

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470
for example yet the order of the library
 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.870
for example yet the order of the library
projects defined and you're also the

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880
projects defined and you're also the
 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.460
projects defined and you're also the
inheritance of the library projects

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470
inheritance of the library projects
 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.830
inheritance of the library projects
defined and I think because it's just a

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840
defined and I think because it's just a
 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.660
defined and I think because it's just a
simple folder with files of it you could

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670
simple folder with files of it you could
 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.220
simple folder with files of it you could
just copy them over in the right order

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230
just copy them over in the right order
 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.430
just copy them over in the right order
in the end you're done basically I don't

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440
in the end you're done basically I don't
 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.590
in the end you're done basically I don't
know what they really mean with these

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600
know what they really mean with these
 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.350
know what they really mean with these
complex collisions the problem comes if

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360
complex collisions the problem comes if
 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.900
complex collisions the problem comes if
any of the libraries require on an asset

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910
any of the libraries require on an asset
 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.320
any of the libraries require on an asset
of a certain name and a third library

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330
of a certain name and a third library
 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.150
of a certain name and a third library
further up the chain uses that same name

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160
further up the chain uses that same name
 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.310
further up the chain uses that same name
for a different type of asset you then

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320
for a different type of asset you then
 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.780
for a different type of asset you then
get undefined behavior in one of your

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790
get undefined behavior in one of your
 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.670
get undefined behavior in one of your
libraries because it doesn't know it's

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680
libraries because it doesn't know it's
 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.200
libraries because it doesn't know it's
not getting the correct asset under that

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210
not getting the correct asset under that
 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.350
not getting the correct asset under that
name so if you have a chat project that

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360
name so if you have a chat project that
 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.140
name so if you have a chat project that
has a list called

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150
has a list called
 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.940
has a list called
blar and something else that has a

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950
blar and something else that has a
 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.010
blar and something else that has a
graphic called blah you'll find your

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020
graphic called blah you'll find your
 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.140
graphic called blah you'll find your
chat library gets a graphic instead of

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150
chat library gets a graphic instead of
 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.610
chat library gets a graphic instead of
the list it expects and probably will

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620
the list it expects and probably will
 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.750
the list it expects and probably will
throw our errors that you shouldn't

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760
throw our errors that you shouldn't
 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:05:00.640

me and yeah I know we could just do this

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060
me and yeah I know we could just do this
 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.000

in the bog resources and I'm Batman and
 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.400
in the bog resources and I'm Batman and
done but basically you can't access the

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410
done but basically you can't access the
 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.070

wall resources so in west wall with the

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080
wall resources so in west wall with the
 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.830

web view which is really plain awful and

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840
web view which is really plain awful and
 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.710
web view which is really plain awful and
also if you do HTML pages it's a little

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720
also if you do HTML pages it's a little
 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.470
also if you do HTML pages it's a little
bit harder you know in the in the SS

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480
bit harder you know in the in the SS
 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.570
bit harder you know in the in the SS
folder you can just load the web you

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580
folder you can just load the web you
 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.070
folder you can just load the web you
called file / / assets and so on and

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080
called file / / assets and so on and
 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.990
called file / / assets and so on and
then you can just load the html5 and it

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000
then you can just load the html5 and it
 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.940
then you can just load the html5 and it
loads the images automatically at the

loads the images automatically at the
 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.950
loads the images automatically at the
end you're done and the other way round

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960
end you're done and the other way round
 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.770

you would have to yeah it's basically

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780
you would have to yeah it's basically
 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.960
you would have to yeah it's basically
playing harder to do this with the wall

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970
playing harder to do this with the wall
 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.970
playing harder to do this with the wall
resources instead of using SS for this

you can use a class in a library file

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180
you can use a class in a library file
 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.790
you can use a class in a library file
that actually just contains the string

what now we have the antibiotics and

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:36.620
what now we have the antibiotics and
 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.890
what now we have the antibiotics and
alpha and we just have our project and

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900
alpha and we just have our project and
 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.650
alpha and we just have our project and
then every project we copy over the

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:41.660
then every project we copy over the
 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.840
then every project we copy over the
first s folder from one library project

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:43.850
first s folder from one library project
 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:45.610

basically what the sdk tools should be

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960
basically what the sdk tools should be
 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.500
basically what the sdk tools should be
doing is any second manually copy the

that of course now the problem is the

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760
that of course now the problem is the
 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.920
that of course now the problem is the
Eclipse eggy the APK file built from the

a philosopher and it's not so easy to

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:07.880
a philosopher and it's not so easy to
 

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.570
a philosopher and it's not so easy to
get the application out of eclipses with

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580
get the application out of eclipses with

the correct staff so why not we do it

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.330
the correct staff so why not we do it
 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.700
the correct staff so why not we do it
manually yeah so basically that's what

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710
manually yeah so basically that's what
 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.000
manually yeah so basically that's what
we're doing but yeah could be much

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.010
we're doing but yeah could be much
 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.260
we're doing but yeah could be much
easier with some sdk tools update i also

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270
easier with some sdk tools update i also
 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.379
easier with some sdk tools update i also
had viewed them there were some patches

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:29.389
had viewed them there were some patches
 

00:07:29.389 --> 00:07:32.379

online and garrett before the transition

00:07:32.379 --> 00:07:32.389
online and garrett before the transition
 

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:35.740
online and garrett before the transition
to the new garrett server and there was

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:35.750
to the new garrett server and there was
 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.990
to the new garrett server and there was
a purchase online doing exactly this so

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000
a purchase online doing exactly this so
 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.090
a purchase online doing exactly this so
enabling the sdk tools but nobody

00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:40.100

yet are they in the new Garrett or are

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400
yet are they in the new Garrett or are
 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.860
yet are they in the new Garrett or are
they still just in the old Garrett I

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:47.870
they still just in the old Garrett I
 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.740
they still just in the old Garrett I
think it wasn't the old guard you might

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:50.750
think it wasn't the old guard you might
 

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:52.780
think it wasn't the old guard you might
want to see who submitted them and ask

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:52.790
want to see who submitted them and ask
 

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:54.400
want to see who submitted them and ask
them to resubmit them to the new Garrett

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.410
them to resubmit them to the new Garrett
 

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:55.810
them to resubmit them to the new Garrett
because I think the old Garrett's been

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:55.820
because I think the old Garrett's been
 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:03.159
because I think the old Garrett's been
pretty much abandoned now no no okay

00:08:03.159 --> 00:08:03.169
pretty much abandoned now no no okay
 

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:05.730
pretty much abandoned now no no okay
yeah basically I will all do the the

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:05.740
yeah basically I will all do the the
 

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:09.880
yeah basically I will all do the the
hacking for now but could be easier also

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:09.890
hacking for now but could be easier also
 

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:14.860
hacking for now but could be easier also

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:43.669
use when developing an app can we
 

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.640
use when developing an app can we
explain the use cases and some of the

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:45.650
explain the use cases and some of the
 

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.350
explain the use cases and some of the
benefits of using a loader over the

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:47.360
benefits of using a loader over the
 

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:50.800
benefits of using a loader over the
alternative mmm anybody want to take

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:50.810
alternative mmm anybody want to take
 

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:54.850
alternative mmm anybody want to take
that one should i take it basically the

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:54.860
that one should i take it basically the

the cool thing about loaders is it's the

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.250
the cool thing about loaders is it's the
 

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.110
the cool thing about loaders is it's the
it's the simplest way to keep the

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:02.120
it's the simplest way to keep the
 

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.240
it's the simplest way to keep the
contents of your view in sync with its

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:04.250
contents of your view in sync with its
 

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:07.750
contents of your view in sync with its
data source so like back before loaders

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760
data source so like back before loaders
 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.440
data source so like back before loaders
you had to actually watch

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:09.450
you had to actually watch
 

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:13.160
you had to actually watch
for for callbacks and events regarding

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.170
for for callbacks and events regarding
 

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:15.350
for for callbacks and events regarding
whether or not your data had changed and

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360
whether or not your data had changed and
 

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.730
whether or not your data had changed and
been updated and now the lawyers will

00:09:16.730 --> 00:09:16.740
been updated and now the lawyers will
 

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:18.500
been updated and now the lawyers will
take care of that for you so you make a

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:18.510
take care of that for you so you make a
 

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.890
take care of that for you so you make a
list view or a list fragment and you you

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:21.900
list view or a list fragment and you you
 

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:25.030
list view or a list fragment and you you
implement the the loader interface and

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:25.040
implement the the loader interface and
 

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.770
implement the the loader interface and
you say you have a content provider

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:27.780
you say you have a content provider
 

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:29.990
you say you have a content provider
that's feeding data into that loader you

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000
that's feeding data into that loader you
 

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.370
that's feeding data into that loader you
stuff something new into the content

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:31.380
stuff something new into the content
 

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.050
stuff something new into the content
provider unless your list view just

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:33.060
provider unless your list view just
 

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.700
provider unless your list view just
magically updates and you never have to

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:34.710
magically updates and you never have to
 

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:35.900
magically updates and you never have to
worry about callbacks or a

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:35.910
worry about callbacks or a
 

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:45.760
worry about callbacks or a
synchronization or anything like that

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:45.770
 

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:49.160
but we want to add anything to that the

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.170
but we want to add anything to that the
 

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:50.570
but we want to add anything to that the
life cycle events as well I think it

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:50.580
life cycle events as well I think it
 

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.890
life cycle events as well I think it
kind of really implementable with the

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:51.900
kind of really implementable with the
 

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.780
kind of really implementable with the
life cycle so it handles all your causes

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:53.790
life cycle so it handles all your causes
 

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.000
life cycle so it handles all your causes
and resumes for you I will reconnect the

and resumes for you I will reconnect the
 

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:57.710
and resumes for you I will reconnect the
data source and what good for any

00:09:57.710 --> 00:09:57.720
data source and what good for any
 

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.200
data source and what good for any
changes so essentially you write this

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.210
changes so essentially you write this
 

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:02.180
changes so essentially you write this
code it did a lot of hope of people all

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:02.190
code it did a lot of hope of people all
 

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:04.100

that stuff life cycle stuff for you so

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:04.110
that stuff life cycle stuff for you so
 

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.580
that stuff life cycle stuff for you so

knowing how that would work fine yeah

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000
knowing how that would work fine yeah
 

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.150
knowing how that would work fine yeah
the pop-up menu which you're talking

00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160
the pop-up menu which you're talking
 

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.350
the pop-up menu which you're talking
about which is kind of similar to the

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360
about which is kind of similar to the
 

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.670
about which is kind of similar to the
overflow menu you know where you hit a

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680
overflow menu you know where you hit a
 

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.670
overflow menu you know where you hit a
button in it and it expands now that's

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:10.680
button in it and it expands now that's
 

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.009
button in it and it expands now that's
also a good option another option could

00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019
also a good option another option could
 

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:14.360
also a good option another option could
be to just kind of move on to the next

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:14.370
be to just kind of move on to the next
 

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:15.949
be to just kind of move on to the next
action and default it's one of the

00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959
action and default it's one of the
 

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:17.480
action and default it's one of the
choices and allow the users have change

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:17.490
choices and allow the users have change
 

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:19.759
choices and allow the users have change
to the other choice you don't so i think

00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:19.769
to the other choice you don't so i think
 

00:13:19.769 --> 00:13:21.889

just try and avoid these modal dialogues

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899
just try and avoid these modal dialogues
 

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:26.329

and let me just bring up the page I
 

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:17.060
and let me just bring up the page I
guess the first one was to do with

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:17.070
guess the first one was to do with
 

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.519
guess the first one was to do with
taking pictures with the camera I was

00:16:20.519 --> 00:16:20.529
taking pictures with the camera I was
 

00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:23.370
taking pictures with the camera I was
having some trouble getting the photos

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:23.380
having some trouble getting the photos
 

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:28.050
having some trouble getting the photos
to be stored in a private area my app

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:28.060
to be stored in a private area my app
 

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.990
to be stored in a private area my app
rather than on the SD card I was just

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.000
rather than on the SD card I was just
 

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.940
rather than on the SD card I was just
wondering if there's any special trick

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:32.950
wondering if there's any special trick
 

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.470
wondering if there's any special trick
that I needed to do together to happen

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480
that I needed to do together to happen
 

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.240
that I needed to do together to happen
now you take another you want to put him

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:36.250
now you take another you want to put him
 

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:42.569
now you take another you want to put him
in an internal storage yes I honestly

00:16:42.569 --> 00:16:42.579
in an internal storage yes I honestly
 

00:16:42.579 --> 00:16:46.920
in an internal storage yes I honestly
never tried to do that I think there's a

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:46.930
never tried to do that I think there's a
 

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.170
never tried to do that I think there's a
problem with trying to do that because

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:49.180
problem with trying to do that because
 

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.150
problem with trying to do that because
the camera is a separate application so

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160
the camera is a separate application so
 

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.550
the camera is a separate application so
any areas would be able to would have to

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560
any areas would be able to would have to
 

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.780
any areas would be able to would have to
write it would have to be a publicly

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:54.790
write it would have to be a publicly
 

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:57.329
write it would have to be a publicly
writable of area there is but you can

00:16:57.329 --> 00:16:57.339
writable of area there is but you can
 

00:16:57.339 --> 00:17:01.110
writable of area there is but you can
actually pass when you launch the intent

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120
actually pass when you launch the intent
 

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.199
actually pass when you launch the intent
a permission to say you can inherit the

00:17:04.199 --> 00:17:04.209
a permission to say you can inherit the
 

00:17:04.209 --> 00:17:07.470
a permission to say you can inherit the
permissions of the sort of parent app so

00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480
permissions of the sort of parent app so
 

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.579
permissions of the sort of parent app so
I was thinking that that might give the

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:08.589
I was thinking that that might give the
 

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.980
I was thinking that that might give the
camera app permission to write to my

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:10.990
camera app permission to write to my
 

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.829

like shoot coming up when I was reading
 

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:23.400
like shoot coming up when I was reading

white management of audio settings ok so

if you're replacing the entire audio

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640
if you're replacing the entire audio
 

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.830
if you're replacing the entire audio
layer on the platform then maybe you can

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:34.840
layer on the platform then maybe you can
 

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.360

there's another method to ask the

there's another method to ask the
 

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.530
there's another method to ask the
platform to be the microphone but faking

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:46.540
platform to be the microphone but faking
 

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.630

bad solution it'd be interesting to have

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:52.930
bad solution it'd be interesting to have
 

00:27:52.930 --> 00:27:54.240
bad solution it'd be interesting to have
a look into the source code for it and

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:54.250
a look into the source code for it and
 

00:27:54.250 --> 00:27:57.600
a look into the source code for it and
see what it actually does and if you're

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:57.610
see what it actually does and if you're
 

00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:58.620
see what it actually does and if you're
in control of what you do with your

in control of what you do with your
 

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.240
in control of what you do with your

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:00.250

then sending it down your sip channel

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:01.630
then sending it down your sip channel
 

00:28:01.630 --> 00:28:05.000
then sending it down your sip channel
can you just not send it if you hit

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:05.010
can you just not send it if you hit
 

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:07.710
can you just not send it if you hit
yeah that's that's a workaround I just

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720
yeah that's that's a workaround I just
 

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.670
yeah that's that's a workaround I just
want to avoid that question because all

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:11.680
want to avoid that question because all
 

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.450
want to avoid that question because all
the the codec is done you know in MDK

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:15.460
the the codec is done you know in MDK
 

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.230
the the codec is done you know in MDK
it's done really down there and I want

00:28:19.230 --> 00:28:19.240
it's done really down there and I want
 

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.450
it's done really down there and I want
the application to catch whether I'm

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:21.460
the application to catch whether I'm
 

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.820
the application to catch whether I'm
muted or not muted to display the right

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:23.830

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:26.910
muted or not muted to display the right
user interface to the user stuff like

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:26.920
user interface to the user stuff like
 

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.590
user interface to the user stuff like
that if I don't have any choice then

00:28:28.590 --> 00:28:28.600
that if I don't have any choice then
 

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.300
that if I don't have any choice then
yeah I will do it down during the codec

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:30.310
yeah I will do it down during the codec
 

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.500
yeah I will do it down during the codec
itself I will just ignore that

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:33.510
itself I will just ignore that
 

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:35.640
itself I will just ignore that
information i will not compress it in

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:35.650
information i will not compress it in
 

00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:39.030
information i will not compress it in
our i will not have but I'm I'd rather

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.040
our i will not have but I'm I'd rather
 

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.570
our i will not have but I'm I'd rather
to have it done to do it just in the

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:42.580
to have it done to do it just in the
 

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:46.110
to have it done to do it just in the
application layer and first save logic

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:46.120
application layer and first save logic
 

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.330
application layer and first save logic
from the codec which is complex enough

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:48.340
from the codec which is complex enough
 

00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.930
from the codec which is complex enough

else I've had a quick look in the source

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:20.980
else I've had a quick look in the source
 

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.010

code and basically the mute microphone

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:23.020
code and basically the mute microphone
 

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.900

cools down to native code so i can vary

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:24.910
cools down to native code so i can vary
 

00:29:24.910 --> 00:29:30.840
cools down to native code so i can vary
by platform okay so i have so i have to

my Conover my first reaction right here
 

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.860
my Conover my first reaction right here
is platform-specific like the world's

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:52.870
is platform-specific like the world's
 

00:29:52.870 --> 00:30:07.250
is platform-specific like the world's
one all right I think London just fell

00:30:07.250 --> 00:30:07.260
 

00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:11.490
yep they seem pretty frozen none i'm

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:11.500
yep they seem pretty frozen none i'm
 

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.430
yep they seem pretty frozen none i'm
still alive london drops off every now

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440
still alive london drops off every now
 

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.550
still alive london drops off every now
and again yeah the the bridge is not

00:30:17.550 --> 00:30:17.560
and again yeah the the bridge is not
 

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:19.620
and again yeah the the bridge is not
that strong sometimes have we got spa

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:19.630
that strong sometimes have we got spa
 

00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:22.650
that strong sometimes have we got spa
yeah hey wait are you saying that London

00:30:22.650 --> 00:30:22.660
yeah hey wait are you saying that London
 

00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:29.600
yeah hey wait are you saying that London
Bridge is falling down are we are parted

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:29.610
 

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.580
in fact that they abused it really fast

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:32.590
in fact that they abused it really fast
 

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:38.550
in fact that they abused it really fast
quite surprisingly i'm gonna say the

00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:38.560
quite surprisingly i'm gonna say the
 

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.050
quite surprisingly i'm gonna say the
next word of that song because calling

00:30:40.050 --> 00:30:40.060
next word of that song because calling
 

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.580
next word of that song because calling
you my fair lady could be taken very

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:41.590
you my fair lady could be taken very
 

00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:48.540
