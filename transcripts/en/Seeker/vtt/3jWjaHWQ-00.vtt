00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.140
Abortion is an extremely contentious issue
for many people in the U.S. and around the

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.620
world, many of whom want to see a world with
few abortions.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.599
Luckily, science is on the case.

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:17.130
Hey there countrywomen and countrymen, Trace
here for DNews.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.980
Near the end of January, President Trump signed
an Executive Order reinstating something called

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.180
the “Mexico City Policy,” or “Global
Gag Rule,” blocking U.S. foreign aid to

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.411
any organization performing, advising on,
or endorsing abortion as a method of family

00:00:29.411 --> 00:00:30.411
planning.

00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:32.510
It was first signed by former President Reagan.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.129
Depending on the administration, the rule
comes and goes.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.239
Dispassionate data exists to try to understand
how to the decrease abortion rates, and restricting

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.859
access to abortion, counseling, and advisory
services doesn’t decrease the number of

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.399
abortions performed, but does the opposite!

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.359
A study by the World Health Organization,
looked at over 260-thousand women in 20 countries

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:58.659
from 1994 to 2008, and found once the Mexico
City Policy was reinstated the last time,

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.920
in 2001, the abortion rate more than doubled.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.140
They even created an algorithm to compare
those with and without exposure to abortion

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.440
advice, endorsement or services, and those
without access had more abortions.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.580
And this isn’t just worldwide, it’s also
in the United States.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.830
A study published in Perspectives on Sexual
and Reproductive Health examined abortions

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.100
in the United States, and found from 2011
to 2014, the rate dropped by 12 percent.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.600
Their study wanted to find out what caused
this huge drop.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.200
They looked at access to abortions and contraception
and also the closing of abortion clinics.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.880
They didn’t find a strong correlation between
closing clinics and decreasing rates.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.620
But, did think a decrease in unintended pregnancies
and increase in contraceptive use contributed

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.440
to the decline in abortions.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.140
The U.S. currently has the lowest abortion
rate since it became legal in 1973, and yet

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.640
people are still denying sexual health education
works.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.800
This study postulates that both contraception
and education are at play.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.300
Though they say more research is obviously
needed.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.630
Many believe unintended pregnancies are a
result of contraception failure, but according

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.050
to a report by the Guttmacher Institute, a
sexual health research nonprofit… that would

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.030
only account for 5 percent of all unintended
pregnancies.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.670
Of the remaining 95 percent: most was from
non-use of contraception, and a bit less than

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.790
half was incorrect or inconsistent use.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.740
This means a big chunk of our unintended pregnancy
problem is likely a lack of education!

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.970
A study in Plos ONE echos this sentiment:
with findings so strong they put them in the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.120
subtitle, saying “Why We Need Comprehensive
Sex Education in the U.S.”

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.370
Though, access and education don’t work
if people don’t accept them as options to

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.050
countering unintended pregnancies.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.720
According to a study done over 8 years published
in the Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.950
Medicine, more contraception instruction,
and education, correlated with lower rates

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.819
of 15 to 17 year old’s getting pregnant
-- what we call teen pregnancy.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.100
And there are proven methods to purely decrease
abortion rates.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.810
A 2012 study published in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology
followed over 9000 girls and women, and reported

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.209
teen birth rates dropped by 82 percent, and
abortions dropped by approximately two-thirds...when

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.710
they did this one crazy thing... gave them
free birth control access.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.370
Unintended pregnancies aren’t just something
we can write off with the flourish of a pen.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.090
A Studies in Family Planning paper, reported
40 percent of all pregnancies worldwide were

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.590
unintended in 2012; half ended in abortion,
but 38 percent resulted in unplanned births.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.730
Those unplanned births affect the lives of
everyone involved forever -- mothers, children,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.849
fathers, grandparents, social support networks,
et cetera.

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.290
According to a 1988 study in Family Planning
Perspectives, three-quarters of women seeking

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.910
abortions said, “having a baby would interfere
with work, school or other responsibilities,”

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.819
about two-thirds “could not afford” a
child, and half “did not want to be a single

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.060
parent or had relationship problems.”

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.650
Some women stated they weren’t mature enough
to have a child, and some still said their

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.550
parents wished them to abort.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.170
Clearly, unintended pregnancies will continue
to happen if we do nothing.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.340
And, according to dozens of studies, abortion
rates decline when people have access to contraception

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.780
and the education to use it properly.

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.410
Though there are many who have politicized
this issue, the data seems to indicate that

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.519
restricting access for political reasons might
cause more unintended pregnancies, and thus,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.070
actually increase the rates of abortion.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.280
Still curious about abortions?

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.440
Do you know how they work?

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.760
There is more than one kind, and we’ve got
each process explained, here.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.050
How do you feel about the U.S. having the
lowest abortion rate in a long time?
