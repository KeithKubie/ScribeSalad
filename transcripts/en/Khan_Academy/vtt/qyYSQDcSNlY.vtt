00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.820
- [Instructor] What I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.429
is think about the types of questions

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:05.750
that we need statistics to address

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.940
and the types of questions that

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.790
we don't need statistics to address.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.610
And we could call the ones
where we need statistics

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.610
as statistical questions,
statistical questions.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.940
And I'll circle the statistical
questions in yellow.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.480
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.560
and try to figure this out yourself first.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.810
Look at each of these
questions and think about

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.710
whether you think you
need statistics to answer

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.520
this question or you
don't need statistics.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.430
Whether these are
statistical questions or not.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.573
So I'm assuming you've given a pass at it,

00:00:36.573 --> 00:00:38.450
and now we can go through this together.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.680
So this first question is how old are you.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.080
So we're talking about how
old is a particular person.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.990
There is an answer here, and we don't need

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.510
any tools of statistics to answer this.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.340
So this is not a statistical question.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.980
How old are the people who have
watched this video in 2013?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.330
Now this is interesting.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.110
We're assuming that multiple people

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.943
will have watched this video in 2013,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.740
and they're not all gonna be the same age.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.350
There's gonna be some
variability in their age.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.880
So one person might be 10 years old,

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.310
another person might be 20,
another person might be 15.

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.770
So what answer do you give here?

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.550
Would you give all of the ages?

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.430
But we want to get a sense of in general,

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.690
how old are the people?

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.950
So this is where statistics
might be valuable.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.100
We might wanna find some
type of central tendency,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.760
an average, a median age for this.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.660
So this is absolutely
a statistical question.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.920
And you might already be
seeing kind of a pattern here.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.820
The first question, we were asking about

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.810
a particular person, there
was only one answer here.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.860
There's no variability in the answer.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.410
The second one, we're asking about a trait

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.030
of a bunch of people and there's
variability in that trait.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.790
They're not all the same age.

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.110
And so we'll need statistics
to come up with some features

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.930
of the data set to be able
to make some conclusions.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.660
We might say, on average
the people who have watched

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.860
this video in 2013 are 18
years old or 22 years old,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.160
or the median is 24 years old.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.200
Whatever it might be.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.200
Do dogs run faster than cats?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.610
So once again, there are
many dogs and many cats.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.680
And they all run at different speeds.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.250
Some dogs run faster than some cats,

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.160
and some cats run faster than some dogs.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.240
So we would need some
statistics to get a sense of,

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.800
in general, or on average,
how fast do dogs run?

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.660
And then maybe on average
how fast do cats run?

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.930
And then we could compare those averages,

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.470
or we could compare the
medians in some way.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.790
So this is definitely
a statistical question.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.230
Once again, we're
talking about in general,

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.840
a whole population of dogs,

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.680
the whole species of dogs versus cats,

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.620
and there's variation in how fast

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.470
dogs run and how fast cats run.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.690
If we were talking about a particular dog

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.410
and a particular cat, well then

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.990
there would just be an answer.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.480
Does dog A run faster
than cat B, well sure,

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.420
that's not going to be
a statistical question,

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.640
you don't have to use
the tools of statistics.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.020
And this next question
actually fits that pattern.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.770
Do wolves weigh, actually no,

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.840
this fits the pattern of the previous one.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.980
Do wolves weigh more than dogs?

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.790
So, once again, there
are some very light dogs

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.530
and some very heavy
wolves, so those wolves

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.230
definitely weigh more than those dogs.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.080
But there are some very,
very, very heavy dogs.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.530
And so what you would want to do here,

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.340
because we have variability
in each of these,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.270
is you might want to come
with some central tendency.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.170
On average, what is
the median wolf weight?

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.780
What's the average, the mean wolf weight?

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.880
Compare that to the mean dogs' weight.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.910
So once again, since we're
speaking in general about wolves

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.103
not a particular wolf,
and in general about dogs,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.790
and there's variation in the data,

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.300
and we're trying to glean
some numbers from that

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.440
to compare, this is definitely
a statistical question.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.253
Definitely a statistical question.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.470
Does your dog weigh more than that wolf?

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.860
And we're assuming that we're
pointing at a particular wolf.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.060
So now this is the particular.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.140
We're comparing a dog,

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.030
a particular dog to a particular wolf.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.700
We could put each of them
on a weighing machine

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.490
and come up with an absolute answer.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.210
There's no variability
in this dog's weight,

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.140
at least at the moment that we weigh it.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.450
No variability at the wolf's weight

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.470
at the moment that we weigh it.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.330
So this is not a statistical question.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.010
So I'll put an X next to the ones

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.823
that are not statistical questions.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.850
Does it rain more in
Seattle than Singapore?

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.430
So once again, there's variation here.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.560
And we'd also probably want to know

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.450
does it rain more in
Seattle than Singapore

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.000
in a given year, over
a decade, or whatever.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.330
But regardless of those
questions, however we ask it,

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.110
in some years, it might
rain more in Seattle,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.200
and other years, it might
rain more in Singapore.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.920
Or if we just pick Seattle, it rains

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.470
a different amount from year to year.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.303
In Singapore, it rains

00:04:42.303 --> 00:04:43.650
a different amount from year to year.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.070
So how do we compare?

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.280
Well, that's where the
statistics could be valuable.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.370
There's variability in the data,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.750
so we can look at the data set for Seattle

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.350
and come up with some type of an average,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.670
some type of a central tendency

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:58.310
and compare that to the average, the mean,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.350
the mode, whatever you
want, the mode probably

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.350
wouldn't be that useful
here, to Singapore.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.570
So this is definitely, definitely
a statistical question.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.540
Definitely statistical.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.970
What was the difference in rainfall

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.900
between Singapore and Seattle in 2013?

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.020
Well, these two numbers aren't known.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.190
They can be measured.

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.270
Both the rainfall in
Singapore can be measured,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.750
the rainfall in Seattle can be measured.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:22.680
And assuming that this has

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.080
already happened and we can measure 'em,

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.100
then we can just find the difference.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.800
So you don't need statistics here.

00:05:30.692 --> 00:05:32.170
You just have to have
both of these measurements

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.620
and subtract the difference.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.070
So not a statistical question.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.610
In general, will I use less gas

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.100
driving at 55 miles an hour
than 70 miles per hour?

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.440
So this feels statistical,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.380
because it probably depends
on the circumstance.

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.330
It might depend on the car,
or even for a given car,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.230
when you drive at 55 miles per hour,

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.250
there's some variation
in your gas mileage.

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.980
It might be how recent
an oil change happened,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.010
what the wind conditions are like,

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.883
what the road conditions are like.

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.770
You know, exactly how
you're driving the car,

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:06.690
are you turning, are you
going in a straight line.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:09.010
And same thing for 70 miles an hour.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.470
So when we're saying in general,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.510
there's variation in
what the gas mileage is

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.310
at 55 miles an hour and
at 70 miles an hour.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.660
So what you probably want to do is say,

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.050
well, what's my average mileage

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.690
when I drive at 55 miles an hour,

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.890
and compare that to the average
mileage when I drive at 70.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:26.290
So because we have this
variability in each of those cases,

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.483
this is definitely a statistical question.

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:35.050
Do English professors get paid
less than math professors?

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.300
So once again, all English professors

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.530
don't get paid the same amount,

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.100
and all math professors don't
get paid the same amount.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.930
Some English professors
might do quite well,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:44.980
some might make very little.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.610
Same thing for math professors.

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.070
So we'd probably want to
find some type of an average

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.660
to represent the central
tendency for each of these.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.520
So once again, this is
a statistical question.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.180
This is a statistical question.

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.290
Does the most highly paid
English professor at Harvard

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.380
get paid more than the most highly paid

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.860
math professor at MIT?

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.520
Well, now we're talking about
two particular individuals.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.170
You could go look at their tax forms,

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.810
see how much each of them get paid.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.100
I guess especially if we assume

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.070
that this is in a particular year.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.100
Let's say, and let's
just make it that way.

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:25.380
Say in 2013, just so that we
can remove some variability

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.920
that they might make from year to year,

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.450
make it a little bit more concrete.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.230
So if this was, does the most highly paid

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:31.530
English professor at Harvard

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.960
get paid more than the most highly paid

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.510
math professor at MIT in 2013,

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.850
then you have an absolute
number for each of these,

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.160
each of these people, and then

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.600
you could just compare them directly.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.710
And so, when we're talking
about a particular year,

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.570
particular people, then this is

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:48.210
no longer a statistical question,

00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:49.963
or it isn't a statistical question.
