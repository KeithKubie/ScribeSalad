00:00:01.013 --> 00:00:02.688
- [Instructor] What
we're going to talk about

00:00:02.688 --> 00:00:05.283
in this video is the
effect of price controls

00:00:05.283 --> 00:00:07.616
on changing how the surplus,

00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:12.515
the total surplus is reallocated between

00:00:12.515 --> 00:00:14.675
consumers and producers.

00:00:14.675 --> 00:00:17.102
And we already touch on
this in other videos.

00:00:17.102 --> 00:00:18.798
The video on rent control.

00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:21.190
The video on minimum wages.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:23.184
And so this is to make sure that we are

00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:25.713
taking away some of the big ideas.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.666
So, right over here I have my classic

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.604
demand and supply curves.

00:00:30.604 --> 00:00:32.658
Of course, the rental market.

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:33.908
At a high price

00:00:34.887 --> 00:00:36.595
the quantity demanded is low.

00:00:36.595 --> 00:00:38.666
The quantity that people would be willing

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.322
to supply is quite high.

00:00:40.322 --> 00:00:42.419
And at a low price, the quantity

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:44.345
that people would be willing to supply

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:46.349
is low, while the quantity demanded

00:00:46.349 --> 00:00:48.086
would be quite high.

00:00:48.086 --> 00:00:50.217
And we've seen from many videos so far

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.298
in our journey through economics

00:00:52.298 --> 00:00:54.237
that we have our equilibrium price

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:56.034
and our equilibrium quantity

00:00:56.034 --> 00:00:59.146
where these two curves,
or lines intersect.

00:00:59.146 --> 00:01:01.701
So, I'll call this Q sub zero

00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:03.801
and this is price sub zero.

00:01:03.801 --> 00:01:05.771
But let's say for whatever reason

00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:07.695
city officials in this city

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:09.356
where this rental market

00:01:09.356 --> 00:01:12.086
that this chart describes
the rental market for

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:15.435
they decide that P sub zero is too high

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:17.657
that their owners are
complaining that rent

00:01:17.657 --> 00:01:19.454
are too high in the market.

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:24.121
And so the city decides
to put in a price control.

00:01:24.121 --> 00:01:28.364
And in this case, they try
to implement a price ceiling.

00:01:28.364 --> 00:01:31.056
So they say, look, the price of rent

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:32.961
per square foot per month

00:01:32.961 --> 00:01:35.452
cannot go above this level

00:01:35.452 --> 00:01:36.785
right over here.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.437
So this is the price

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.339
ceiling.

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:44.417
Price ceiling, right over there.

00:01:44.417 --> 00:01:46.758
Now, what's going to happen here?

00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:49.043
Well, if this is the price ceiling,

00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:51.460
then right over here, this is

00:01:52.297 --> 00:01:54.514
the total amount of square footage

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.596
the quantity of

00:01:56.596 --> 00:01:58.111
I guess, square footage

00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.457
that is being willing
that people are willing

00:02:00.457 --> 00:02:01.467
to supply that.

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:03.176
The landlords, or building owners

00:02:03.176 --> 00:02:04.977
are willing to supply.

00:02:04.977 --> 00:02:06.375
But at this price,

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.305
you have a much higher quantity

00:02:08.305 --> 00:02:09.961
that is being demanded.

00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.939
This is right over here
is the quantity demanded.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.886
And when the quantity demanded at a price

00:02:14.886 --> 00:02:17.042
is higher than the quantity supplied

00:02:17.042 --> 00:02:19.637
well, then you have a shortage.

00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:20.685
Put this right over here.

00:02:20.685 --> 00:02:22.082
Is describing

00:02:22.082 --> 00:02:23.101
a

00:02:23.101 --> 00:02:24.105
shortage.

00:02:24.105 --> 00:02:27.017
And we talk about that in other videos.

00:02:27.017 --> 00:02:28.623
But let's think about what's happening

00:02:28.623 --> 00:02:29.940
to the total surplus.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.573
So when we let the market just get to an

00:02:32.573 --> 00:02:34.709
equilibrium price and quantity

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.646
the total surplus, actually let me just

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:38.291
draw separately the consumer

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.673
and the producer surplus.

00:02:39.673 --> 00:02:42.032
So this was the consumer surplus.

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:43.074
Right over here.

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:44.796
Before the government intervention.

00:02:44.796 --> 00:02:48.160
And then, this is the producer surplus.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.770
And we've talked about
this is other videos.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.440
But now what happens

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.137
when we have this price control?

00:02:54.137 --> 00:02:56.696
Well, this is the quantity supply.

00:02:56.696 --> 00:02:58.117
Now, all of a sudden,

00:02:58.117 --> 00:02:59.765
the total surplus shrinks.

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:02.785
The total surplus is now being depicted

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:05.311
by this white trapezoid.

00:03:05.311 --> 00:03:08.549
And also, think about
how things have shifted.

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.391
So one thing that you see clearly,

00:03:10.391 --> 00:03:12.485
what is the producer surplus now?

00:03:12.485 --> 00:03:13.867
The producer surplus is

00:03:13.867 --> 00:03:15.671
only this little yellow

00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:16.975
triangle, or this little.

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:18.026
I don't know my colors.

00:03:18.026 --> 00:03:20.192
This little blue triangle at the bottom.

00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:21.742
So you see very clearly

00:03:21.742 --> 00:03:24.414
that all producers suffer here.

00:03:24.414 --> 00:03:25.497
All producers

00:03:28.066 --> 00:03:29.816
all producers suffer.

00:03:30.923 --> 00:03:32.564
Now you might say, well, of course

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:33.619
this is a rent control.

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:36.481
But surely, the consumers
will benefit here.

00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:39.393
Well, it isn't the case,
it is the case that

00:03:39.393 --> 00:03:41.823
some consumers, the ones that are able to

00:03:41.823 --> 00:03:44.849
get into a unit, they might benefit.

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.603
So this right over here, some

00:03:47.603 --> 00:03:49.293
demanders, or you can say

00:03:49.293 --> 00:03:50.460
some consumers

00:03:51.344 --> 00:03:52.467
consumers

00:03:52.467 --> 00:03:53.536
benefit.

00:03:53.536 --> 00:03:55.690
But, not all of the consumers benefit.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.942
In fact, you have a shortage now.

00:03:56.942 --> 00:03:58.782
Before you had more people who were able

00:03:58.782 --> 00:03:59.793
to get housing.

00:03:59.793 --> 00:04:02.483
Now these folks are not
going to get housing.

00:04:02.483 --> 00:04:05.004
And, as in all of
economics you should take

00:04:05.004 --> 00:04:06.163
a grain of salt

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:07.171
in any type of

00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:08.756
oversimplified model like this.

00:04:08.756 --> 00:04:10.055
Or simplified, this is actually

00:04:10.055 --> 00:04:11.086
a very useful model

00:04:11.086 --> 00:04:12.575
for thinking about certain things.

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:15.344
Because, even these
consumers that are benefiting

00:04:15.344 --> 00:04:17.033
according to this model

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:19.878
for these consumers it
looks like their surplus

00:04:19.878 --> 00:04:22.606
has grown, or if you're
this kind of marginal

00:04:22.606 --> 00:04:24.156
renter right over here,

00:04:24.156 --> 00:04:25.175
let me draw it over here.

00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:26.173
If you are the marginal renter

00:04:26.173 --> 00:04:27.627
that was before, getting

00:04:27.627 --> 00:04:29.231
this much benefit.

00:04:29.231 --> 00:04:32.131
Now you're able to get
that plus all of that.

00:04:32.131 --> 00:04:33.810
But think about the things that this model

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:34.843
is not capturing.

00:04:34.843 --> 00:04:37.534
What's the incentive for the landlord now?

00:04:37.534 --> 00:04:39.840
Would they want to invest
in the building as much?

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.852
Would they

00:04:40.852 --> 00:04:43.037
would they maybe let the building

00:04:43.037 --> 00:04:44.552
kind of suffer a little bit?

00:04:44.552 --> 00:04:46.163
And there's also particular quirks

00:04:46.163 --> 00:04:47.985
for how rent control is implemented

00:04:47.985 --> 00:04:49.665
that might also change behavior.

00:04:49.665 --> 00:04:50.881
So always keep in mind

00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:53.588
what's not captured by the model.

00:04:53.588 --> 00:04:55.611
But in broad brush terms

00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:57.758
you put in a price control, in this case,

00:04:57.758 --> 00:04:59.458
you put in a price ceiling

00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:01.234
you're going to create a shortage.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.384
All the producers are going to suffer.

00:05:03.384 --> 00:05:05.031
Some of the consumers

00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:06.464
benefit, according to this model.

00:05:06.464 --> 00:05:07.464
But not all of them.

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:09.338
Because not all of them
are now going to be able

00:05:09.338 --> 00:05:11.604
to get a place to rent.

00:05:11.604 --> 00:05:13.898
Now let's move over to another market.

00:05:13.898 --> 00:05:15.348
Let's say the corn market.

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.781
And let's say

00:05:16.781 --> 00:05:17.878
once again

00:05:17.878 --> 00:05:19.912
we have our equilibrium price

00:05:19.912 --> 00:05:21.692
and our equilibrium quantity.

00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:23.186
So price of equilibrium.

00:05:23.186 --> 00:05:25.181
And this is our

00:05:25.181 --> 00:05:27.206
quantity sub equilibrium.

00:05:27.206 --> 00:05:29.865
But let's say in this
situation the government

00:05:29.865 --> 00:05:31.619
let's say the farmer, the corn farmers

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:33.064
are able to organize.

00:05:33.064 --> 00:05:35.290
And they're able to lobby
the government and say,

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.650
hey, we really suffer

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.678
when there's low corn prices.

00:05:38.678 --> 00:05:40.489
So where we want to
institute a price control

00:05:40.489 --> 00:05:42.702
we want you to institute a price control.

00:05:42.702 --> 00:05:44.409
We want a price war.

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.546
So the government says, okay corn farmers

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:48.084
you seem to be pretty serious about it

00:05:48.084 --> 00:05:50.748
so we are going to
institute a price floor.

00:05:50.748 --> 00:05:52.728
So the price cannot go

00:05:52.728 --> 00:05:54.041
below this level.

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:55.892
So this is a price floor.

00:05:55.892 --> 00:05:58.219
Well, what's going to happen now?

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:00.700
Well let's think about the quantity

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.123
demanded, and the quantity supplied.

00:06:03.123 --> 00:06:04.824
So that, right over there,

00:06:04.824 --> 00:06:06.438
is the quantity demanded.

00:06:06.438 --> 00:06:09.456
You see where the price
intersects the demand curve.

00:06:09.456 --> 00:06:11.663
And this right over here
is a quantity supply

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:14.303
where we intersect in the supply curve.

00:06:14.303 --> 00:06:15.731
Quantity supply.

00:06:15.731 --> 00:06:17.416
So in this situation

00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:18.729
your demand is less

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.070
the quantity demanded

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.260
is less than the quantity supplied.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:23.422
So in this case,

00:06:23.422 --> 00:06:25.005
you have a surplus.

00:06:27.218 --> 00:06:29.201
The farmers would want to produce more

00:06:29.201 --> 00:06:30.527
than people would want

00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:31.736
at that price.

00:06:31.736 --> 00:06:33.555
And also think about what happens to

00:06:33.555 --> 00:06:34.556
this total surplus.

00:06:34.556 --> 00:06:37.177
And in particular, the consumer
and the producer surpluses.

00:06:37.177 --> 00:06:38.452
So in the old world

00:06:38.452 --> 00:06:39.581
this was

00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:41.474
the consumer surplus.

00:06:41.474 --> 00:06:42.307
And,

00:06:43.844 --> 00:06:45.309
this right over here is

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:47.111
the producer surplus.

00:06:47.111 --> 00:06:50.393
In the new world, the
total surplus shrinks

00:06:50.393 --> 00:06:51.692
the sum of the two.

00:06:51.692 --> 00:06:53.214
We're now talking about

00:06:53.214 --> 00:06:56.096
this, the area of this trapezoid.

00:06:56.096 --> 00:06:58.925
Right over here, this sideways trapezoid.

00:06:58.925 --> 00:07:01.832
And you see that all consumers suffer

00:07:01.832 --> 00:07:03.538
because now the consumers surplus

00:07:03.538 --> 00:07:05.905
has been shrunk right over

00:07:05.905 --> 00:07:07.779
the consumer surpluses right over here.

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:10.376
There's consumers who are
now not even consuming corn.

00:07:10.376 --> 00:07:12.124
And even the ones that are consuming corn

00:07:12.124 --> 00:07:14.532
before, let's say this marginal consumer

00:07:14.532 --> 00:07:16.733
right over here was getting
all of this benefit.

00:07:16.733 --> 00:07:20.013
Now, they are getting a smaller benefit.

00:07:20.013 --> 00:07:22.271
So we could say, all

00:07:22.271 --> 00:07:23.354
all consumers

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.513
suffer.

00:07:27.508 --> 00:07:29.367
Now what about the producers?

00:07:29.367 --> 00:07:31.105
Well, the producers who are able to

00:07:31.105 --> 00:07:32.599
sell their corn

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:34.723
definitely get a benefit.

00:07:34.723 --> 00:07:36.952
So if you were this marginal producer

00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:38.201
right over here

00:07:38.201 --> 00:07:39.201
your surplus

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:41.600
right over here

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.971
would have been like that.

00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:45.592
But now you get even
a higher price for it.

00:07:45.592 --> 00:07:48.444
And so, one way to think about it

00:07:48.444 --> 00:07:50.290
is, some producers,

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:52.861
some producers for sure, benefit

00:07:52.861 --> 00:07:55.496
according to this model.

00:07:55.496 --> 00:07:56.536
So let me write that.

00:07:56.536 --> 00:07:57.811
So, some

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.464
producers

00:07:59.464 --> 00:08:00.964
producers benefit.

00:08:03.035 --> 00:08:04.930
But it's important to realize, once again,

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.411
that not all of the producers benefit.

00:08:06.411 --> 00:08:08.333
Because once again, we have a surplus.

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:10.125
If it's implemented this way

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:12.384
well, you might have a lot of farmers

00:08:12.384 --> 00:08:14.022
who aren't even able to

00:08:14.022 --> 00:08:15.176
sell their corn

00:08:15.176 --> 00:08:16.253
at that price.

00:08:16.253 --> 00:08:17.817
So it's an interesting
thing to think about.

00:08:17.817 --> 00:08:19.689
You should always take
models with a grain of salt.

00:08:19.689 --> 00:08:21.365
But it is a pretty interesting framework

00:08:21.365 --> 00:08:23.596
where governments often will try to do

00:08:23.596 --> 00:08:25.433
some type of knee jerk solution

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:26.813
to try to make something look good,

00:08:26.813 --> 00:08:29.069
or feel good to their constituents.

00:08:29.069 --> 00:08:31.178
But the end effect is that people might

00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:32.878
suffer more than they expect.

00:08:32.878 --> 00:08:34.764
They might cause a shortage when you put

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:36.395
a price ceiling.

00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:38.761
Or, it might cause a surplus

00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:41.094
when you have a price floor
