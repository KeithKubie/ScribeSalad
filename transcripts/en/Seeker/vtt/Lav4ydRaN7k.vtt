00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:08.110
Plants evolved here on Earth, but what if
we could take them with us to the stars?

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:13.820
Hey gang, Trace here for DNews with your Weekly
Space Update.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.989
Last year, NASA announced we'd found water
on Mars, and that got some people thinking...

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:22.849
could future astronauts grow crops in the
Martian soil?

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:28.230
It's taken us thousands of years to hone farming
on Earth; we could plant crops 'til the cows

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.250
come home but what's good for the Earth goose
may not be good for the Martian gander.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.610
Soil needs a lot more than water to grow a
plant.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.820
Soil on Earth contains living and dead organisms
including bacteria and plant matter, rocks

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.410
and minerals, and nutrients like nitrogen
-- it takes more than 500 years to form an

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.570
inch of topsoil on Earth.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.079
As far as we know, Mars doesn't have organisms
living in its soil to aerate and break down

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.720
the matter -- so this is a huge challenge.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.079
Not all dirt is created equal, there are 70,000
different types of soil in the United States

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.079
alone!

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.260
So, to simulate Martian soil we had to gather
information about Mars.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.960
The Mars Science Laboratory, Curiosity has
been doing JUST THAT, when it wasn't joyriding

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.799
around Mars and snapping selfies, of course.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.719
Martian soil contains carbon dioxide, oxygen
and sulfur compounds as well as carbonates

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.990
-- or things that indicate a presence of water.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.549
NASA gathered soil samples on Mars and then
composed an approximation of Martian soil

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.799
using the volcanic soil of Hawaii.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.780
From there, plant ecologist Wieger Wamelink
planted 14 plants and grew them over 50 days.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.420
Obviously, the plants were given carbon dioxide,
oxygen and water, but it's not just the obvious

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.420
resources.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.719
The seeds of a plant can sustain growth for
a while, that's what they're for -- to help

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:41.999
the plant gain a foothold.

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:47.009
According to PhysOrg, Wamelink expected the
plants to germinate and then die due to a

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.060
lack of nutrients.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.520
The researchers were surprised to find the
plants did quite well, using the phosphorus

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.909
and iron oxides to take root.

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.869
Unfortunately, the fact the plants grew in
a difficult soil environment is only one small

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:00.869
part of the puzzle.

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.649
The lower gravity and temperature of Mars
will make it difficult for water to be pulled

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.890
into the soil, and tougher for plants to evaporate
their excess moisture.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.940
Plus, the sun is much farther away, so any
Martian plants will need extra light.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.250
They're thinking LEDs at the moment, but no
one is quite sure.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.070
The moon is much closer, only a few days away.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.230
So, to Newt Gingrich's delight, the moon will
probably be the location of Earth's first

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.580
extraterrestrial colony.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.060
Wamelink is also trying to grow crops in the
moon's soil, called regolith.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.610
Because our moon has no atmosphere, the regolith
contains mainly meteorite pummeled rock dust,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.330
micrometeor debris, rocks and volcanic glass...

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.560
Not to mention radiation from the unchecked
solar wind.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.980
It would be HUGE if we can manage to get crops
to take root in ANY capacity on another planet.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.620
Not only for food, but for oxygen recycling,
and to give colonists something to DO all

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.620
day.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.300
It can get pretty boring to sit around in
a spacecraft all the time.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.300
But that's... another story...

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.370
And if this doesn't give you the train conductor
kick in the head excitement about the future,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.480
how about Shots of Awe with Jason Silva?

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:13.409
Watch Jason explore technology, space, human
nature and love.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:20.090
... Whoa.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.170
What does your gut tell you?

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.430
Are EARTH plants going to grow on the moon
or Mars?
