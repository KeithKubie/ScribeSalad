00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.670
MIKE: Is this yours?

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.100
MARK: Yeah, my dad
bought it brand new, '64.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.000
MIKE: No kidding?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.370
MARK: This is my first vehicle.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.500
FRANK: This is what you were
cruising around in high school?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.700
MARK: It is.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.270
MIKE: We're here with
Mark, in Virginia, picking

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.100
through his massive collection.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.930
We're finding old electronics,
signs, vending machines,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.500
and everything in between.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.830
[phone ringing]

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.270
Ah, this is Peter.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.870
MIKE: Frankie is
bird dogging a boat.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.330
And he is red hot on the trail.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.170
FRANK: Peter?

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.300
PETER (ON PHONE): Yes, Frank.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.230
Hey, did you get the
pictures on the boat?

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.270
PETER (ON PHONE): I did, indeed.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.170
FRANK: OK.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.430
OK.

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:21.000
So Peter's the man.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.830
He knows when they
were made, how

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.830
many there were manufactured--
where, when, what, everything.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.930
I mean, this guy is a
walking encyclopedia

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:29.770
when it comes to boats.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.900
It's a Chrysler flat head.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.930
- Chrysler Flathead.
- 6.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:37.530
6.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.770
But it's got going
for it, it's been

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.100
sitting inside for a while.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.570
And it is a 16-footer.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.370
And it could be done in like
your garage or something,

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.970
right?

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.900
FRANK: Right.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.130
OK.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.170
When Peter said
$15,000 to restore it--

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.630
I mean, that's four times more
than the boat's even worth now.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.070
That is turning
into a big project.

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.770
Hey, Peter.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.600
Thanks a lot.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.470
You're the man.

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.030
All right, take care.
- Goodbye.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.370
FRANK: Is this something you
would even consider selling?

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.830
MARK: Uh-- Frank, from
what he was saying,

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.500
I just wouldn't want
to sell it for that.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.170
It's-- it's more
sentimental value to me.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.230
Sure.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.500
MARK: At some point,
I hope I can fix it.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.730
FRANK: Mark says he's going
to get to this project.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.430
They took all the
trim off of it.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.930
They've kept it inside.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.230
And Mark's the kind
of guy to do it.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.030
Because if he had
to farm it out,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.000
it costs more money to fix
it than the whole thing

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.130
would be worth.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.830
He kind of just,
basically, described you.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.170
He's like someone
that remembered

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.300
the boat, someone that has
an experience with the boat.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.270
FRANK: Time.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.400
MIKE: And so if
you do it yourself,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.600
and you know what you're
doing, then you've

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.170
still got room on the back end.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.870
That's right.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.670
FRANK: Sure.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.830
I'm going to keep the boat.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.930
And I'll work on
it with my sons.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.330
You get the van rolling,
get the boat done--

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.170
FRANK: Oh yeah.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.300
Oh yeah!

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.470
MIKE: And you can pull
the boat behind the van.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.400
FRANK: That'd look great
going down the road.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.570
MARK: That thing
could do a wheelie

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.770
in front when you take off.
MIKE: Oh, my gosh.

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.000
That'd be cool, wouldn't it?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.400
MARK: I think we can get
it back looking like it did

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.000
when-- when my dad bought it.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.770
MIKE: All right.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.330
FRANK: Careful, now.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.970
I didn't get to buy
the boat, you know.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.100
But at the end of
the day, we got

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.730
a few nice little pieces here.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.700
You find some mint
Jenson triaxles--

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.570
I'll call you.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.530
I'm your man.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.770
FRANK: Give us a call.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.100
MIKE: All right, buddy.
FRANK: All right, take care!

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.270
MARL See you guys.
Mike and Frank were very cool.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.400
I'd have them back in a minute.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.370
I might sell Frank some
more of those fuel cans.

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:10.870
[honking]
- Later, Mark!

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:11.770
Bye!

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.970
[honking]

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.970
