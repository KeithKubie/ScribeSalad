00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.817
- So we have two examples here,

00:00:01.817 --> 00:00:04.065
where we're given the
magnitude of a vector,

00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:07.053
and it's direction, and the
direction is by giving us

00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:10.312
an angle that it forms
with the positive x-axis.

00:00:10.312 --> 00:00:11.845
What we need to do is go from having

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.450
this magnitude and this
angle, this direction,

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.770
to figuring out what
the x and y components

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.580
of this vector actually are.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.495
So, like always, pause this video

00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:25.453
and see if you can work
through this on your own.

00:00:26.531 --> 00:00:28.166
Alright, now let's work
through this together,

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:29.340
and it's really just gonna involve

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.282
a little bit of trigonometry.

00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:34.040
So, we wanna break this vector
down into it's horizontal

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.105
and it's vertical components,
or it's x and y components.

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:38.842
So I could draw it's,

00:00:38.842 --> 00:00:41.932
I could draw it's horizontal component

00:00:41.932 --> 00:00:44.043
just like this.

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.392
So it's gonna look something like--

00:00:46.392 --> 00:00:48.963
no, let me draw it, I can
do a better job than that.

00:00:48.963 --> 00:00:52.921
So, it's gonna look something like that.

00:00:52.921 --> 00:00:55.067
That's it's horizontal component,

00:00:55.067 --> 00:00:56.548
or it's x component.

00:00:56.548 --> 00:00:58.387
And then it's vertical component

00:00:58.387 --> 00:01:00.839
is going to look something like this.

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.776
It's going to look like that.

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:05.079
That's it's vertical
component, and notice,

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:06.560
if you add the horizontal component

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.991
and the vertical component,

00:01:07.991 --> 00:01:11.158
you are going to get your original vector.

00:01:11.158 --> 00:01:12.792
Now, I've just constructed
a right triangle,

00:01:12.792 --> 00:01:14.580
and in this type of a right triangle,

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.547
I could just use, actually,
some of my most basic

00:01:16.547 --> 00:01:18.743
trig definitions, or the simplest form,

00:01:18.743 --> 00:01:20.557
which is the Soh-Cah-Toa definition

00:01:20.557 --> 00:01:21.609
of the trig functions.

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:22.595
I might wanna break into the

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:24.741
unit circle definition later on,

00:01:24.741 --> 00:01:27.285
but if I wanna figure out
the magnitude of this base,

00:01:27.285 --> 00:01:29.558
right over here, we see
that that is adjacent

00:01:29.558 --> 00:01:31.678
to this 50 degree angle.

00:01:31.678 --> 00:01:32.878
It's not the hypotenuse,

00:01:32.878 --> 00:01:34.743
it's the other side that forms the angle.

00:01:34.743 --> 00:01:36.326
And so what trig function deals

00:01:36.326 --> 00:01:38.073
with adjacent and hypotenuse?

00:01:39.152 --> 00:01:40.735
Well, we could just put
a little reminder here,

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:44.101
Soh-Cah-Toah.

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:48.525
Well, cosine deals with
adjacent over hypotenuse.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.386
So we could say that if I call,

00:01:51.386 --> 00:01:55.079
if I call this x the
length of our x component,

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.658
we could say that the cosine,

00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:01.770
the cosine of 50 degrees of our angle

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.244
is going to be equal to the
length of the adjacent side,

00:02:05.244 --> 00:02:09.219
x, over the length of our hypotenuse,

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:10.930
which is the magnitude of the vector,

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.462
over four.

00:02:12.462 --> 00:02:13.944
And so, if I wanna solve for x,

00:02:13.944 --> 00:02:17.341
I just multiply both sides by four.

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:20.329
So I could get four times

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.679
cosine of 50 degrees,

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:25.131
four times cosine of 50 degrees,

00:02:25.131 --> 00:02:28.880
is equal to x.

00:02:30.264 --> 00:02:32.333
Now what about the y component?

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:34.949
The y component, what is that going to be?

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:37.585
Well, what, that side,

00:02:37.585 --> 00:02:40.522
the length of that side,
is opposite to the angle,

00:02:40.522 --> 00:02:41.774
the 50 degree angle.

00:02:41.774 --> 00:02:44.864
So what trig function deals
with opposite and hypotenuse?

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.040
Well, that is sine.

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:51.107
So we know that the sine of 50 degrees

00:02:51.107 --> 00:02:55.346
is going to be equal to y over
the length of the hypotenuse.

00:02:55.346 --> 00:02:58.539
Y over four, and so we can multiply

00:02:58.539 --> 00:03:00.688
both sides by four and we get,

00:03:00.688 --> 00:03:04.048
we get four times sine of 50 degrees,

00:03:04.794 --> 00:03:07.527
sin of 50 degrees,

00:03:07.527 --> 00:03:09.897
is equal to y.

00:03:10.592 --> 00:03:12.047
And so if I don't have a calculator,

00:03:12.047 --> 00:03:14.014
I could just write that this,

00:03:14.014 --> 00:03:16.543
this vector, I could write as,

00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:18.305
if I write it in the component form,

00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:22.417
it's x component if four
cosine of 50 degrees.

00:03:22.417 --> 00:03:27.417
And it's y component is
four sine of 50 degrees.

00:03:28.273 --> 00:03:30.656
And you might notice
something interesting here.

00:03:30.656 --> 00:03:33.814
I have cosine of the angle,

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:35.832
the angle we formed with
the positive x axis,

00:03:35.832 --> 00:03:38.233
I have that for the x coordinate.

00:03:38.233 --> 00:03:40.276
I have sine on the y coordinate,

00:03:40.276 --> 00:03:42.345
and then I just multiply
it by the magnitude

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:43.699
of the vector.

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.001
Can I always do that?

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:46.176
Well, it turns out you can,

00:03:46.176 --> 00:03:47.760
and this comes out of the
unit circle definition

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.858
of the trig functions.

00:03:48.858 --> 00:03:51.003
The unit circle definition
of trig functions,

00:03:51.003 --> 00:03:53.276
cosine, if you have a unit circle,

00:03:53.276 --> 00:03:55.652
so unit circle looks like this.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:58.819
A unit circle has a radius of one.

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.398
Cosine is the x coordinate of

00:04:01.398 --> 00:04:02.956
where you intersected the unit circle,

00:04:02.956 --> 00:04:04.795
and sine is the y coordinate.

00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:07.171
Or if you had a vector of magnitude one,

00:04:07.171 --> 00:04:09.495
it would be cosine of that angle,

00:04:09.495 --> 00:04:11.845
would be the x component,

00:04:11.845 --> 00:04:15.395
for the, if we had a unit
vector there in that direction.

00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:18.409
And then sine would be the y component.

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:19.788
Well, we don't have a unit vector,

00:04:19.788 --> 00:04:21.320
our vector has a magnitude of four,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.594
it's four times bigger than a unit vector,

00:04:23.594 --> 00:04:25.637
so each of the components are going

00:04:25.637 --> 00:04:27.195
to be four times bigger.

00:04:27.195 --> 00:04:29.289
So that's why we multiply the x,

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.278
the cosine of fifty by four
to get the x component,

00:04:32.278 --> 00:04:34.091
and we take the sine of 50,

00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:36.287
and we multiply it by four
to get the y component.

00:04:36.287 --> 00:04:37.462
And that's gonna come in handy

00:04:37.462 --> 00:04:39.250
when we think about this one over here.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.578
But we can get our calculator out,

00:04:40.578 --> 00:04:43.394
and approximate what
these are going to be.

00:04:43.394 --> 00:04:44.784
So let me get it out.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.395
Where's my calculator?

00:04:47.395 --> 00:04:48.723
Alright, there we go.

00:04:48.723 --> 00:04:50.715
So, 50, I'm in degree mode,

00:04:50.715 --> 00:04:52.477
gotta make sure, so 50 degrees.

00:04:52.477 --> 00:04:53.806
I'm gonna take the cosine,

00:04:53.806 --> 00:04:55.721
and I'm gonna multiply it times four.

00:04:55.721 --> 00:04:58.709
So times 4, is equal to two,

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:01.110
approximately 2.57.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.820
So this is approximately equal to 2.57,

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.398
is our x component, and
then our y component.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.001
Our y component, if I take 50 degrees,

00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:15.019
and if I take the sine of it,

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:17.241
and then multiply it by four,

00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:19.933
I get approximately 3.06.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.229
3.06, and we see that over here,

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:27.320
this x component looks
like it's a little more

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.852
than two and a half,

00:05:28.852 --> 00:05:29.823
and this y component looks like

00:05:29.823 --> 00:05:31.534
it's slightly more than three.

00:05:31.534 --> 00:05:33.347
So it all worked out, even
though this is kind of

00:05:33.347 --> 00:05:35.825
a sloppy, hand drawn graph.

00:05:35.825 --> 00:05:37.255
Alright, now let's tackle this one.

00:05:37.255 --> 00:05:38.523
This is interesting cause this,

00:05:38.523 --> 00:05:40.745
the terminal point, when we
draw it in the standard form,

00:05:40.745 --> 00:05:42.865
is in the second quadrant.

00:05:42.865 --> 00:05:45.087
So what would be the x
and y components here,

00:05:45.087 --> 00:05:46.364
and you can immediately tell,

00:05:46.364 --> 00:05:47.411
because we're in the second quadrant,

00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:48.918
our x component is gonna be negative,

00:05:48.918 --> 00:05:51.114
and our y component is going to be,

00:05:51.114 --> 00:05:52.750
is going to be positive.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.207
Well, we could just resort exactly

00:05:55.207 --> 00:05:57.021
to what we did just there.

00:05:57.021 --> 00:05:58.417
We could say this vector

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.845
is going to be the magnitude,

00:06:01.845 --> 00:06:03.760
it's x component is going
to be it's magnitude

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.957
times the cosine of the angle that forms

00:06:05.957 --> 00:06:07.489
at the positive x axis.

00:06:07.489 --> 00:06:09.252
Cosine of 135 degrees.

00:06:09.252 --> 00:06:10.478
And it's y component is going to be

00:06:10.478 --> 00:06:12.827
the magnitude times the sine of the angle

00:06:12.827 --> 00:06:15.330
that forms with the positive x axis,

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.633
and we'd be done.

00:06:16.633 --> 00:06:19.008
And we can evaluate each of these things,

00:06:19.008 --> 00:06:23.044
so we could get, let me get
my calculator out again.

00:06:23.044 --> 00:06:26.517
So if we take 135 degrees,

00:06:26.517 --> 00:06:30.637
and if I take the cosine of that,

00:06:30.637 --> 00:06:32.629
and then multiply it by ten,

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:35.387
times ten, I get approximately

00:06:35.387 --> 00:06:37.645
negative 7.07.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:43.592
So that's approximately negative 7.07,

00:06:43.592 --> 00:06:46.274
and then if I take the sine,

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:48.854
we're going to see something very similar.

00:06:48.854 --> 00:06:52.787
So 135 degrees, and I take the sine of it,

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:55.392
I get positive .707,

00:06:55.392 --> 00:06:57.717
and so let me multiply
that times the magnitude,

00:06:57.717 --> 00:06:58.968
times ten,

00:06:58.968 --> 00:07:01.074
is equal to 7.07.

00:07:02.024 --> 00:07:04.655
So 7.07,

00:07:04.655 --> 00:07:05.932
and we see that over here.

00:07:05.932 --> 00:07:09.150
This is roughly, looks like
it's a little more than seven,

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.244
looks like it's a little
bit more than seven

00:07:11.244 --> 00:07:12.291
in that direction.

00:07:12.291 --> 00:07:13.645
And we'd be done, and you might say well--

00:07:13.645 --> 00:07:15.484
once again, how did this work?

00:07:15.484 --> 00:07:17.910
Well, if I had a unit circle

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.170
right over here.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.652
And if I had a unit vector,

00:07:22.652 --> 00:07:24.951
so it's terminal point would
sit on the unit circle,

00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:26.815
that went in the exact same direction,

00:07:26.815 --> 00:07:29.241
it still formed 135 degrees,

00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:31.310
this point right over here,

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:32.409
it would have the coordinates

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:34.247
cosine of 135 degrees,

00:07:34.247 --> 00:07:35.703
sine of 135 degrees,

00:07:35.703 --> 00:07:36.853
let me make it a little bit more visible,

00:07:36.853 --> 00:07:38.155
this point right over here.

00:07:38.155 --> 00:07:40.990
Cosine 135, sine of 135

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.165
would be it's coordinates.

00:07:42.165 --> 00:07:44.234
Or for this unit vector right over here,

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:45.690
that going in that direction,

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:48.678
it's x component would be cosine of 135,

00:07:48.678 --> 00:07:51.309
and it's y component would be sine of 135.

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:52.586
Well the vector that we care about

00:07:52.586 --> 00:07:54.169
has ten times the magnitude

00:07:54.169 --> 00:07:55.855
of a unit vector in that direction.

00:07:55.855 --> 00:07:57.285
So it's x component is going to have

00:07:57.285 --> 00:07:58.869
ten times the magnitude,

00:07:58.869 --> 00:08:00.887
and so is it's y component.

00:08:00.887 --> 00:08:02.394
And you could even resort to

00:08:02.394 --> 00:08:04.769
your Soh-Cah-Toa definitions
to figure this out.

00:08:04.769 --> 00:08:07.221
We could construct a
right triangle if we like,

00:08:07.221 --> 00:08:11.997
we could say here is,

00:08:11.997 --> 00:08:14.210
we could say here is my x component,

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.846
that is my x component,

00:08:16.846 --> 00:08:18.276
it's gonna be something like that,

00:08:18.276 --> 00:08:19.221
and then there--

00:08:19.221 --> 00:08:21.954
and then my y component is going to look

00:08:21.954 --> 00:08:25.530
something like, I'm drawing
it a little bit imprecise,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.534
but I could draw that, let me
draw that a little bit better.

00:08:28.534 --> 00:08:31.565
My y component is gonna
look something like that,

00:08:31.565 --> 00:08:36.024
right triangle, and so
if I want this magnitude,

00:08:36.024 --> 00:08:38.348
the magnitude of this bottom side,

00:08:38.348 --> 00:08:39.523
I would say well, look,

00:08:39.783 --> 00:08:44.708
I know if this is 135 degrees,

00:08:44.708 --> 00:08:46.700
this angle right over here
is supplementary to that,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.712
so 45 degree angle,

00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:51.040
and so what trig function

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.751
deals with adjacent and hypotenuse,

00:08:52.751 --> 00:08:54.105
Well cosine.

00:08:54.105 --> 00:08:57.579
So I could say cosine of 45 degrees

00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.801
is equal to the length of this,

00:08:59.801 --> 00:09:01.921
so let me just call the length of that,

00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:05.011
oh I don't know, let me just call it x,

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:06.799
so the length of it, x,

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:09.404
over the hypotenuse, over ten.

00:09:09.404 --> 00:09:10.809
Multiply both sides by ten,

00:09:10.809 --> 00:09:14.104
you get ten times cosine of 45 degrees

00:09:14.104 --> 00:09:16.198
is equal to x.

00:09:16.198 --> 00:09:18.088
And cosine of 45 degrees is

00:09:18.088 --> 00:09:19.442
square root of two over two,

00:09:19.442 --> 00:09:22.957
so this is going to be
five square roots of two

00:09:22.957 --> 00:09:25.664
is equal to x, and you might say,

00:09:25.664 --> 00:09:27.963
wait, wait, I thought this
was supposed to be negative.

00:09:27.963 --> 00:09:29.470
Well, the way we just solved it right now,

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:30.364
with our right triangle,

00:09:30.364 --> 00:09:32.509
we just figured out our
magnitude of this side.

00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:33.658
And then we would just have to reason,

00:09:33.658 --> 00:09:36.621
ok, we're not going five square
roots of two to the right,

00:09:36.621 --> 00:09:38.766
we're going five square
roots of two to the left.

00:09:38.766 --> 00:09:41.908
So, the magnitude in the x direction,

00:09:41.908 --> 00:09:44.666
or not the magnitude, our x component,

00:09:44.666 --> 00:09:46.301
I should say, is going to be negative

00:09:46.301 --> 00:09:49.162
five square roots of two.

00:09:49.162 --> 00:09:51.001
And you could do the exact
same reasoning to say,

00:09:51.001 --> 00:09:52.303
well ten cosine of f--

00:09:52.303 --> 00:09:54.474
it's ten sine of 45 degrees

00:09:54.474 --> 00:09:58.245
is going to give us the
magnitude of the y component,

00:09:58.245 --> 00:10:00.492
and that's actually going
to be our y component.

00:10:00.492 --> 00:10:02.152
So, same exact thing,

00:10:02.152 --> 00:10:06.689
this is going to be
ten sine of 45 degrees,

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.346
which is five square roots of two,

00:10:09.346 --> 00:10:10.521
and if we took our calculator out,

00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:11.849
they would evaluate to approximately

00:10:11.849 --> 00:10:14.372
these things right over there.
