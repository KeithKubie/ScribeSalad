SAM DUTTON: Enter
the land of Lie-Fi,

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.090
and find out why Jaffa
the Cake thinks you

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.400
should give a developer a hog.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.150
I'm Sam Dutton, standing in
for Rob, who's on vacation.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:10.700
Lucky man.

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:18.120
Take a journey
with Jake Archibald

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.880
as he cranks up web speed via
smart markup, service workers,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.394
and much more to get
from good to great.

00:00:25.394 --> 00:00:27.560
Catch a glimpse of qute
furry animals along the way,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.140
and find out how
to handle Lie-Fi.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.189
JAKE ARCHIBALD:
I call it Lie-Fi.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.570
Offline is OK.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.680
At least it's honest.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.400
Can I fetch this?

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.790
No.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.230
Can I go here?

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:36.550
No.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.133
Can I do this?

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:37.650
No.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.150
SAM DUTTON: How the Streams API
will save us all from slowness,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.970
and, as Jake advises,
discover what

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.550
to do next time a
developer shows you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.290
something they've made.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.040
Interactive WebGL
infographics synchronized

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.150
with media playback.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.700
This stunning site counts
the cost of conflict

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.840
from World War II
onward, and it's also

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.970
an optimistic reminder
that many of us

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.840
are lucky enough to live in
a relatively peaceful world.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.880
Beautifully structured
and produced.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.209
Check it out.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.110
Now meet Chris
Lowis, audio guru.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.920
He's written a detailed
article about how

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.684
to synthesize drum sounds.

00:01:11.684 --> 00:01:13.100
Everything you
ever wanted to know

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.770
about building your own 808
to sample or to synthesize.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.700
The mighty Web Audio
API lets you do both.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.450
And before you know
it, you'll be partying

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.866
like it's 1982 all over again.

00:01:24.866 --> 00:01:27.460
Code and demos included.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.170
Filling in forms on the web.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.020
Don't make me think!

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.480
Forms are extra-hard
to get right on mobile,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.450
and this little article
gives ten short tips

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.430
for a better user experience.

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.080
Labels, fonts, tap
targets, input types.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.840
There's also a bonus
tips, but you'll

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.840
have to read the
article for that.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.470
Tooling is too damn complex.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.930
PAUL: To get going with
the web first, install npm.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.440
Then probably install Bower.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.100
And then we're going to
install Gulp or Grunt or both.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.797
And then--

00:01:55.797 --> 00:01:57.630
SAM DUTTON: Whatever
happened to Hello World

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.880
and the simple accessibility
of web development?

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.030
Paul and Jake slug it
over two pints of IPA,

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.530
and Jake explains how he
destroyed his headphones.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.520
And finally, are you
bored of the web?

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.290
Had enough hacking
JavaScript, CSS, and HTML?

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.330
Well, you need to get back
to BASIC, the language that

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.430
maybe sparked of the programming
boom and the whole demo scene.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.880
GOTO loops, the PRINT
command, syntax errors,

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.015
and floats that are
faster than integers!

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:27.920
Yup.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.750
Learn how to program
for the Commodore 64,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.750
the highest-selling
computer model ever.

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.419
So that's a wrap for
this week, folks.

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.460
And here's a little
something for all LazyWebbers

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.355
to feast your eyes on until
Rob Dodson returns next week.

00:02:41.355 --> 00:02:42.230
Thanks for having me.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.694
Thanks for watching.
