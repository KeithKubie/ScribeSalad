00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.756
(Big band music)

00:00:06.806 --> 00:00:08.842
- I think it's funny that
guys are never called crazy.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.612
Cause I feel like guys do
things that are like, crazy.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:14.781
But guys are never called crazy.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.783
For a guy to get called
crazy he's gotta be

00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:19.486
like naked in an alley,

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.888
jerking off on a dead pigeon.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.492
(Audience laughter)

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.926
Singing bible hymns.

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:31.097
♪ Over the river ♪

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.735
But even then we're like,

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:39.472
"Oh my God that guy is
homeless that is so sad.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.808
(Sigh)

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:45.645
Do you have a dollar,
give him a dollar."

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.380
But for a girl to
get called crazy

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.551
we just have to send you
two text messages in a row.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.321
"She's fucking crazy man.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:58.892
She's fucking stalking me, bro
she's obsessed with me man."

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:00.260
Like, I don't
know, I'm not crazy

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.327
I'm just locked
out of the house.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:03.663
Can you let me in the house?

00:01:03.663 --> 00:01:05.565
I'm not stalking
you, I live here.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:07.400
My house til we live together.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.570
I'm not obsessed
with you, I hate you.

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:13.273
Guys are never called crazy.

00:01:13.273 --> 00:01:16.443
But I feel like guys do things
that are actually crazy.

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:19.646
Like things that would put
you in an insane asylum.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:23.550
Like you guys will talk
to athletes, in the tv.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.157
And you think they
can fuckin' hear you.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:36.229
That's literal schizophrenia
that is a mental illness.

00:01:37.397 --> 00:01:39.132
Like I was watchin'
some of my guy friends

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.834
a couple months ago they're
watching a Giants game

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:43.269
and they were talking
to Eli Manning.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:44.804
Having a conversation
with this person.

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:47.273
They were like, "Eli listen
to me, Eli listen to me,

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.775
we have been through this bro."

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:52.011
I'm like bitch you have not
been through shit with him man.

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.780
He cannot hear you.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.115
And even if he could hear you,

00:01:55.115 --> 00:01:56.850
why would he take
advice from you?

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.051
You can't even
get your Heinekens

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.286
in the fuckin' garbage can.

00:02:02.188 --> 00:02:03.590
I feel like you
guys watching sports

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.091
should give you a little
more sympathy for us.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.826
Cause now you know what
it's like to yell at a man

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:09.596
and have him
completely ignore you.

00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:12.599
(Audience laughter)

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.169
Everyday is Sunday for us.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.174
You guys say the meanest
things to these athletes,

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:22.709
the meanest things.

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.776
Like they're watching Tom
Brady and they were like,

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:25.879
"Tom Brady you suck."

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.514
"Tom Brady sucks."

00:02:27.514 --> 00:02:28.982
I don't know that
much about football,

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.951
but I'm pretty sure Tom Brady
doesn't suck at football.

00:02:31.951 --> 00:02:33.186
I'm pretty sure you suck.

00:02:33.186 --> 00:02:36.389
I'm pretty sure all
you suck at football.

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:40.960
I just wish these athletes
would stand up for themselves

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.962
you know, against these
horrible things you say.

00:02:42.962 --> 00:02:45.665
I wish just one time Tom
Brady would look directly into

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:49.836
the camera and be like, "Hey
man, fuck you, I got this.

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:53.173
I make 20 million dollars a year

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.442
and you can't even
do a fuckin' sit up.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.946
Get off my dick, man."

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:05.118
