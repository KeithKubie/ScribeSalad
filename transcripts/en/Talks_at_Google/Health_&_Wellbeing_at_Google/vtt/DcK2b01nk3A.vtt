[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.100
JOE: Thank you,
everybody, for coming.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.910
It is my pleasure to
introduce Dr. Michael J Breus.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.954
He and I met now
about six months ago--

00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:15.120
MICHAEL BREUS: Yeah, I know.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.350
JOE: --at Health 2.0.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.440
And he, more than
anybody I've ever met,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.640
is a charismatic evangelist
for the power of sleep.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.780
And he is able to bridge the
divide between technology,

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.981
industry, academia more
seamlessly than anybody

00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:31.480
I've met.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.800
And that's why he's helping
us set up this Sleep Week.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.410
He's been responsible
for many of the ideas

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.520
around evangelizing--
that our team has around

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.390
evangelizing sleep at Google.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.292
And I'm-- we'll give it off to
him so that he can talk to you.

00:00:46.292 --> 00:00:47.250
MICHAEL BREUS: Perfect.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.208
Thank you so much, Joe.

00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:49.220
I appreciate it.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.720
All right.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.229
So how's everybody doing today?

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.854
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:00:51.854 --> 00:00:52.830
AUDIENCE: Pretty good.

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.246
MICHAEL BREUS: Who
in the audience

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:57.874
got a fantastic night of sleep
last night, got as much sleep

00:00:57.874 --> 00:00:59.790
as they could possibly
want, and have woken up

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.240
feeling completely
energized and ready to go?

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.560
One person.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.260
Two, three people
out of several.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.910
OK, so we know that sleep
is a big deal, especially

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.170
at a place like Google.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.839
So that's what I'm
here to talk about.

00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:16.380
But you know, if
you've been watching

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.590
during the week--
and first of all,

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.800
thank you everybody for
participating in Sleep Week.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.150
It's been pretty amazing.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.340
We've had some incredible,
incredible speakers--

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.430
Smith Johnson, flight
surgeon for NASA, Fred Maxik,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.650
one of the preeminent
leaders-- over 400

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.830
patents in the lighting
industry, so light and sleep

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.090
and how do those kind
of work together.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.600
We've also been very
fortunate to have

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.080
sponsorships through Sleep
Score and through Sleepio.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.940
So we've had some
really great opportunity

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.920
for people to see
new technology,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.780
check it out, have a
lot of fun with it.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.670
So today, I'm going to
talk about something

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.640
that's a little bit different.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.740
I'm going to talk to
you about something

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.020
called circadian rhythms,
and what do they mean--

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.760
Joe's favorite word, circadian--
and what can we learn from them

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.590
to be able to help
us not only be

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.830
able to sleep better at night,
but in our daily living.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.116
And so my newest book is
called "The Power of When,"

00:02:05.116 --> 00:02:06.990
and it looks at a couple
of different things.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.406
But before I start,
I thought what

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:10.320
I would do is really
talk to you about what

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.480
is sleep and sort
of how does it work

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.980
to give you kind of the basic
parameters from which to work.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.854
So this slide looks a
little bit complicated,

00:02:16.854 --> 00:02:17.730
but it's really not.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.850
So it turns out that there
are two distinct systems

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.600
in the brain for sleep.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.467
One of them is a drive,
kind of like hunger.

00:02:24.467 --> 00:02:25.050
So I'm hungry.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.410
I'm hungry.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.950
I'm hungry.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.440
I eat something, and that
hunger begins to dissipate.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.720
The same holds true with sleep.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.540
What we find is that there's
something in our brain

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.040
that makes us
sleepier and sleepier,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.650
and it's called adenosine.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.870
Adenosine is actually
a byproduct of cells,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.640
so when a cell eats
a piece of glucose,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.050
something comes
out the back end.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.354
Part of what comes out
the back end is adenosine,

00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:47.520
and adenosine works its way
through the bloodstream,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.460
gets into the brain, and it
goes to a very specific receptor

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.297
site specifically for adenosine.

00:02:52.297 --> 00:02:53.880
And as that builds
up, we get sleepier

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.410
and sleepier and sleepier.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.480
Now why all this talk
about neurochemistry?

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.120
Well, it turns out that if you
look at the molecular structure

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.580
of adenosine, and you look
at the molecular structure

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.630
of caffeine, they're
off by one molecule.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.130
Right?

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.860
So here's what happens is
when you're getting tired,

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.440
and you're putting down the
coffee or the energy drinks

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.150
or what have you,
that actually goes,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.940
and it fits really nicely
into that receptor site,

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.620
and it blocks the adenosine.

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.170
But then once your brain
burns through the caffeine,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.090
the adenosine comes
flooding in, and that's

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.001
where you get that
caffeine crash,

00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.500
because it's all that adenosine
and that's actually now made

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.120
its way through the floodgates.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.530
So that's sleep drive.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.252
We want adenosine to raise
at a very consistent level,

00:03:34.252 --> 00:03:35.210
get to a certain point.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.220
Usually, around 10:30,
11:00 o'clock at night,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.900
it kind of reaches
its max, and that's

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.580
when most people fall asleep.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.360
But that's not the
only aspect of sleep.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.070
There's also a circadian rhythm.

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.530
So the circadian
rhythm is a lot--

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.990
it's really your
biological clock.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.140
And what I mean by that is
kind of like with hunger

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.330
as well, so you ever
notice how you get hungry

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.360
with breakfast, lunch, and
dinner about the same time?

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.200
So the same holds
true with sleep

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.230
is you have this
circadian system,

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.780
and this actually makes
you want to get sleepier

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.731
at particular times
irrespective of adenosine.

00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:08.730
So how many people in
here, by a raise of hands,

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.440
have ever had the situation,
where you're exhausted?

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.270
You are absolutely dog tired.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.820
You've had the worst,
horrible, crazy day,

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.519
and you're physically-- all
you can do is crawl into bed.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.709
And you get into bed,
let's say, at 8 o'clock

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.966
at night, because you're
just so exhausted.

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:25.340
How many people
in here have ever

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.960
had that situation
occur for them?

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.620
OK, literally
everybody in the room.

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.380
Now let me ask you this.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.120
Do you fall asleep?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.022
Almost never.

00:04:33.022 --> 00:04:35.480
Your brain just starts going
and going and going and going.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.396
That's a situation where your
adenosine is very, very high,

00:04:39.396 --> 00:04:40.770
but your circadian
rhythm is off,

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.860
because you went
to bed too early.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.760
One of the number one things
that my insomnia patients do

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.590
is go to bed too
early, which sounds

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.330
completely counterintuitive.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.370
Like if I've got
insomnia, and I'm tired,

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.860
maybe I can get in bed
and catch up on my sleep.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.050
It doesn't really work that way.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.220
Same holds true for
the drive situation.

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.360
So how many people in here
have had a nice, big dinner,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.950
and they've sat
down on the couch

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.810
just because they were
watching a little TV,

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.185
and before they knew it, they
were out for about an hour,

00:05:08.185 --> 00:05:10.370
took an unscheduled nap?

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.730
Then when you go back and go
to bed at your normal bed time,

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.840
what happens?

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.970
You can't sleep, because
you've actually reduced

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.200
sleep drive at that time.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.480
Your circadian rhythm
is ready to sleep,

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.100
but your drive is
down, because you

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.800
got rid of some of that
adenosine during your nap.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.810
So we've all had
both of these systems

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.610
kind of go a little
kooky for us,

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.800
and so the goal here is
to be able to get people

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.140
to understand the drive,
understand the rhythm,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.320
and when those two are in
balance, that's when we sleep.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.085
So it turns out that all of our
hormones lead a circadian life.

00:05:43.085 --> 00:05:43.960
So what is circadian?

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.320
It's a 24-hour cycle, but
yet every hormone in our body

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.512
is very, very predictable.

00:05:49.512 --> 00:05:51.470
So if you look here on
the slides, you can see,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.030
for example, cortisol follows
a very predictable schedule.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.580
So does adrenaline,
and so does melatonin.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.240
Kind of interesting-- melatonin
is almost the exact opposite

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.050
of cortisol.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.180
But it actually
corresponds very well

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.660
with core body temperature.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.180
So as core body
temperature lowers,

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.610
we see melatonin rising.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:14.290
These are very, very predictable
situations in the body.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.240
So why is that
important, and how can we

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.490
use that to leverage
it for ourselves?

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.910
Well, has anybody in here
ever been called an early bird

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:22.570
before?

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:24.880
Like to get up really
early, 5:30, 6 o'clock?

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:25.540
OK.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.860
How about night owls?

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:29.140
I'm actually the night
owl side of things.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.334
So interesting.

00:06:30.334 --> 00:06:31.375
Yeah, I know you are too.

00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:34.612
So it's interesting when you
start to think about that idea.

00:06:34.612 --> 00:06:36.820
So when you think about an
early bird or a night owl,

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:39.370
if we actually looked
at their melatonin,

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.840
it actually falls under
the same wave form--

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.875
however, at different times.

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:47.500
So if we look here,
and we see the red,

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.150
that's an early
bird, and the blue--

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.230
that's a night owl.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.660
It turns out that even though
they have the same melatonin

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.080
curve, they're happening
at very different times

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.230
in their own
24-hour cycle, which

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.900
is very, very interesting when
you start to think about it.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.920
So Michael, you're telling
me that if I'm a night owl,

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.600
and I wake up at 7 o'clock,
6:30 in the morning,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.350
what's going on?

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.760
My melatonin faucet is
still running, running,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.464
running, whereas if I'm
an early bird, it's not.

00:07:16.464 --> 00:07:18.880
So this is why, for all of you
people who are night owls--

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.920
raise your hand again
if you're a night owl.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.590
This is why mornings suck.

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.370
Bottom line.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.290
There's nothing fun
about getting up

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.510
in the mornings for you
people because of this.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.480
Your melatonin is
actually still going.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.980
It's still moving
in that direction,

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.830
and that's where that
morning fog is coming from,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.870
whereas for all of
you early birds,

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.820
mornings are a breeze for you.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.770
However, doing
stuff late at night

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.910
doesn't always work out so well.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:46.505
So what I did was I
created a quiz for people

00:07:46.505 --> 00:07:48.130
to be able to tell,
because by the way,

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.116
there aren't just two of these
what we call chronotypes.

00:07:51.116 --> 00:07:52.990
So first of all, has
everybody in here gotten

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.100
an opportunity to take the quiz?

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.600
No?

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.430
OK, so if you
haven't-- you have, OK.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:59.650
So if you haven't had a
chance to take the quiz,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:06.220
go to thepowerofwhenquiz.com,
and it's available right now.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.250
You go on there, and it takes
like literally two minutes

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:09.846
to do it.

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:12.220
And then you'll be able to
learn what your chronotype is.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.050
And I'm going to go through all
of the different chronotypes

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:14.740
right now.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.251
But the quiz is a
little weird, because it

00:08:17.251 --> 00:08:19.750
doesn't take into-- it doesn't
ask you some of the questions

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:20.840
that you might imagine.

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.050
So it takes into account
things like personality.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.030
For example, there are
certain chronotypes

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.160
that are more introverted
and certain chronotypes

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.604
that are more extroverted.

00:08:28.604 --> 00:08:30.520
It takes into account
things like sleep timing

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.230
and preference, which
would make sense.

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.854
That would be kind of one of the
things that we should look at.

00:08:34.854 --> 00:08:36.940
And then it takes into
account sleep drive.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.750
So it turns out that all of this
is genetically predetermined

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.620
based on something
called your PER3 gene.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.170
Believe it or not, there are
over 80 different markers

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:50.395
for sleep in the
genetics of the--

00:08:50.395 --> 00:08:52.102
if you looked at the
whole microbiome,

00:08:52.102 --> 00:08:53.560
and you looked at
all of that area,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.080
you would actually find
that there are actually 84,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.274
I think it is, genetic
markers out there

00:08:58.274 --> 00:08:59.440
looking at the human genome.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.600
But the PER3 gene
is the one that's

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.390
the most really in there for
what we're talking about here.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:06.250
And it has a lot to
do with sleep drive.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:08.050
So when you're taking
the quiz, that's

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:09.758
what the questions
are going to be about.

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:12.570
And it'll give you what's called
a personalized ChronoCategory,

00:09:12.570 --> 00:09:14.440
or what I call a chronotype.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:17.080
So it turns out that
there's four, not two.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.210
And if you look
historically, we've

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:20.470
always known about the two.

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.480
Actually, there have been
quizzes and assessment tools

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:25.146
around for quite a while looking
at the early bird and the night

00:09:25.146 --> 00:09:27.910
owl, but not necessarily
people in the middle,

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.920
and also not necessarily
people with insomnia.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.710
So it turns out that
people with insomnia

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.680
actually have a very
different genetic makeup

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.570
in certain cases,
and a lot of it

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.357
is actually genetically
predetermined.

00:09:39.357 --> 00:09:41.440
So it's important for you
to be able to understand

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.190
and recognize that you
might fall into one

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.584
of those categories as well.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.000
So what I thought
I would do is go

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.860
through each of the
chronotypes while people

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:50.680
out there taking the
quiz and learning

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.457
what their chronotype is.

00:09:52.457 --> 00:09:54.040
That way they can
get an understanding

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.600
of some of the things that
are going on with them.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.080
So first one are
what I call lions.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.460
So I replaced the vernacular
of birds to mammals.

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.330
So first of all,
why did I do that?

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:07.520
Well, because I'm a mammal.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:08.510
I'm not a bird.

00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:10.640
And I really thought it
would make more sense

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.200
to look at different mammals.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.300
And by the way,
these animals all

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.270
actually have the chronotype
that we're talking about.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.202
So lions have a tendency to--
their first kill is at dawn.

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:22.160
They wake up very, very
early, and that's where

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.870
they do most of their hunting.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.600
But my lions as a group,
not as the animal,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.780
but now as all of us would be,
are pretty interesting folks.

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.390
They make up about 15%, 15%
to 20% of the population.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.420
And these are my early
morning optimists

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.720
with what we consider to
be a medium sleep drive.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:39.860
These are my go-getters.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.510
These are my COOs.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.720
These are the managers.

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.170
These are people who are
really good at asking people

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.270
to do certain things and
trying to move people

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:49.220
through a process.

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.010
They're likely to prioritize
health and fitness.

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.590
These are people who like
to do the marathons, who

00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:56.281
like to do the triathlons.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:58.280
These are your CrossFitters,
your Tough Mudders,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.900
people like that.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.150
But they also have a very
interesting tendency.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.842
They like to make a
plan almost every day,

00:11:04.842 --> 00:11:06.050
and they like to stick to it.

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:07.790
So they like to do the
first thing, and then

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.740
the second thing, and then
the third thing, and then

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.490
the fourth thing.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:12.715
They do not like to
derivate whatsoever.

00:11:12.715 --> 00:11:14.340
So how many people
in here, by the way,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.300
are a lion or an early bird?

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:19.684
So does any of that kind
of ring true for you guys?

00:11:19.684 --> 00:11:22.100
Is that sort of something that
sort of makes sense to you,

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.641
that you have a tendency to get
up very early in the morning,

00:11:24.641 --> 00:11:27.230
follow that plan, be
able to kind of be more

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.520
on the leadership side?

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.062
Is that something that people
find that resonates with them?

00:11:31.062 --> 00:11:33.020
Also, we know that these
people have a tendency

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.330
to go to bed really early.

00:11:35.330 --> 00:11:37.700
So these are my
8:30, 9 o'clockers,

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.310
because they're getting
up at 5:30 in the morning.

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:42.980
So it's not an uncommon
situation for these people.

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.830
Now I've had a lot of people
who are lions turn to me,

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.860
and they say, I feel so guilty,
because I can never make it

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.330
through dinner and a movie.

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.460
Dinner is fine, but the
movie-- forget about it.

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.480
I am out cold.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:56.060
I had one person tell me
at my most recent lecture

00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:58.760
that they actually go
to the movie early,

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.890
so they do like a
5 o'clock movie,

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:02.510
and then they go to
dinner afterwards,

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:03.860
because it's the only way
that they can actually

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:06.290
see any of the cinema
that they want to see,

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:09.810
because otherwise, they're
out cold every single time.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:11.220
So let's talk about bears.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.430
So bears make up about
50%, 55% of the population.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:16.474
So one in two people is a bear.

00:12:16.474 --> 00:12:18.140
Now before I talk
about bears, remember,

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.480
you can actually lean
more towards the line,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.160
yet still be a
bear, or lean more

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:23.780
towards what I call
a wolf, and still

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:26.300
be a bear, because there are
hybrids that are out there.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.037
But these are my
people who actually

00:12:28.037 --> 00:12:29.870
have a very healthy
sleep drive, and they're

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:31.790
what I call solar sleepers.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.960
So these people have a tendency
to follow our main schedule.

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:39.205
By the way, being a bear is
the best chronotype to be.

00:12:39.205 --> 00:12:41.330
Most people actually tell
me that they would rather

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:44.030
be a lion, and they have
what I call lion envy.

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:47.030
I'm not sure if that's
really the best way to be.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:50.870
The world really operates
on a bear's schedule.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:54.500
And so that's why we have
9:00 to 5:00 work schedules.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.620
This is why carpools and buses
go in their certain schedules.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.290
This is why literally
everything that we do kind of

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:02.990
runs in this sort of what
we call a solar schedule.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:06.980
So it's much easier
for bears in general.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.450
They get the work
done in society.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:09.824
They have a tendency
to really be

00:13:09.824 --> 00:13:12.057
able to accomplish a
whole lot, as well as

00:13:12.057 --> 00:13:13.640
they have a tendency
to be extroverted

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.605
and very open-minded.

00:13:14.605 --> 00:13:15.980
So these are the
people that it's

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.100
great to hang out with and have
lunch, because they've always

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.300
got the funny story to tell.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.410
They kind of know
the gossip that's

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:23.327
going on in the office
or something like that.

00:13:23.327 --> 00:13:25.910
They've probably been the ones
who are watching "The Bachelor"

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.709
and talking about it
with you incessantly,

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:28.500
that kind of thing.

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.740
But they're a lot of fun,
really interesting people,

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:33.620
and again, they make up
a large bulk of society.

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:36.830
And I said most of society is
built around their schedule.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:40.330
So wolves-- how many people
are late night people like me?

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:42.250
OK, so I'm a wolf.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.710
I don't go to bed
ever before midnight.

00:13:44.710 --> 00:13:46.660
It's very, very rare.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:48.220
If it was up to
me, I would sleep

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.679
until 7:30, 8 o'clock each day,
if that were even possible.

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:52.844
And I certainly wouldn't
go to bed at midnight then.

00:13:52.844 --> 00:13:54.940
I'd go to bed at
2:00, because I'm

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.884
that kind of a night person.

00:13:56.884 --> 00:13:58.300
And it's very
interesting when you

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.383
start to think about it,
because the world was not

00:14:00.383 --> 00:14:02.260
built for night people,
unless, of course,

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.820
you're a shift worker.

00:14:03.820 --> 00:14:06.760
But all of us get the
tag of being lazy.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.220
We get the tag of, you're
not a morning person,

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:11.350
and people seem to
schedule meetings for us

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:15.220
at ungodly hours of the morning,
and it never seems to work out.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:17.050
But we happen to be
very creative thinkers.

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:19.860
So wolves are actually
my introverts.

00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:20.972
They're very interesting.

00:14:20.972 --> 00:14:22.930
These are the most creative
people that I have.

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.990
They crave novelty
and risks, and if they

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.395
do bother to make a plan,
they never stick to it.

00:14:29.395 --> 00:14:31.020
They'll do the first
thing on the list,

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:32.200
then the sixth
thing on the list,

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:33.783
and then the fourth
thing on the list,

00:14:33.783 --> 00:14:35.830
and so they get distracted
very, very easily,

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.710
yet they still get a
lot of things done.

00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:41.920
I would say these are
my authors, my actors,

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.970
my musicians, people like that.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.177
They become deeply
loyal friends, too.

00:14:47.177 --> 00:14:48.760
These are the people
that will happily

00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.218
stay up all night
with you and talk

00:14:50.218 --> 00:14:51.970
with you, because they can.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.160
It doesn't bother them
to stay up all night.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.080
And they're really great people.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:58.540
Dolphins are my
problem children.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.460
So did anybody in
here take the quiz--

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:01.294
were they a dolphin?

00:15:01.294 --> 00:15:03.085
Do they want to raise
and their hand admit?

00:15:03.085 --> 00:15:03.610
OK.

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:06.832
So my dolphins are my people
who don't sleep very well.

00:15:06.832 --> 00:15:09.040
They have difficulty either
falling asleep or staying

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.690
sleep most of the time.

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.540
Not every dolphin is like this,
but I do have that happen.

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:17.420
These are highly, highly
intelligent people,

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.780
but they have very erratic
sleep schedules, like I said.

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.810
And sometimes they've
already tried multiple things

00:15:22.810 --> 00:15:24.610
to help them with their sleep.

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:29.770
And so a lot of this
vernacular comes from my work

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:30.700
as a sleep specialist.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.491
So I'm an actively
practicing sleep doctor.

00:15:32.491 --> 00:15:34.300
I've been practicing
for 17 years.

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:35.731
And my specialty is insomnia.

00:15:35.731 --> 00:15:37.480
And one of the things
that was interesting

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.150
is I had a patient come
to me, and she said,

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.140
I'm a terrible sleeper.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:42.556
So I started walking
down the road

00:15:42.556 --> 00:15:44.620
of cognitive behavioral
therapy with her.

00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:48.160
And we tried just about
everything, and nothing worked.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.440
And it was a complete
and total failure,

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.960
which is kind of rare when
you start to understand more

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.540
about the reasoning behind
what goes on with people

00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.860
who have sleep problems.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.110
And so I brought
her in, and I said,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:00.790
let's try to figure
out what's going on.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:03.790
And she said, well, it's not
that I can't fall asleep,

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:05.980
and it's not that I
can't stay asleep.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.770
She said, it's that I
sleep at the wrong time.

00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:10.900
And so then I started
thinking about my kids.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:12.790
So my daughter is
here with me today.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.490
My son and her have the
exact same sleep pattern.

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.250
If it was up to them, they
would go to bed at 2:00,

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.080
and they would
sleep until 12:00.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.330
And this is what happens in
our house on the weekends.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.939
Anybody in here have teenagers?

00:16:23.939 --> 00:16:25.980
So yeah, you know exactly
what I'm talking about.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.790
It's incredible.

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.990
And so they're wolves.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:30.340
And so I started to
think about this patient.

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.506
I discovered, you know what?

00:16:31.506 --> 00:16:32.890
She's actually a wolf.

00:16:32.890 --> 00:16:35.350
And so what I did
was I asked her boss,

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.155
can we change her work schedule?

00:16:37.155 --> 00:16:38.530
And he was like,
well, you better

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.630
do something quick,
because in about a week,

00:16:40.630 --> 00:16:41.910
I'm going to fire her.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:42.910
I was like, no pressure.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:43.409
Great.

00:16:43.409 --> 00:16:44.260
Fantastic.

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.440
So I go in, and I said, all
right, let's go with this.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.840
And we changed her work
times so that she came in

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.880
at around 10:30,
but she would work

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.570
until about 6:30, 7 o'clock,
so just a shift in her work

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.380
schedule.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.120
And after a week, I
called the boss back,

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.950
and I said, how'd it go?

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:03.922
He said, I don't know what you
did, but this is fantastic.

00:17:03.922 --> 00:17:05.380
He said her work
product is better.

00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.880
She doesn't fall
asleep in meetings.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.284
It's like a miracle.

00:17:08.284 --> 00:17:08.950
So I'm like, oh.

00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:10.020
I said, are you
going to fire her?

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:11.530
He's like, no, no, no,
we're not going to fire her.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.430
Well, great.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:14.290
So I called the husband.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.540
Well, I actually called her
to tell her the good news,

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:18.069
and the husband
picks up the phone.

00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:20.194
And he said something to
me that I'll never forget.

00:17:20.194 --> 00:17:23.876
He said, I like my
wife better, which

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.500
I thought was a really
strong statement

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.960
to make, number one, to
somebody he had never

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.990
talked to you before.

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:30.510
But what he was
telling me was is

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:35.590
he now understood a lot
more about her as a person.

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:38.400
And so the power
of when has a lot

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.390
to do with when somebody is
on and when somebody is off

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.500
and how all of these
hormones work together

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.480
in order for people to
understand these things.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.510
It's really a communication
tool more than anything.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.089
And what I find is as soon
as one person takes the quiz,

00:17:54.089 --> 00:17:56.130
they have everybody in
their family take the quiz

00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:59.130
and start learning more about,
how can I communicate better

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:01.080
within my family?

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.224
So again, highly
intelligent, my dolphins

00:18:03.224 --> 00:18:04.390
are superintelligent people.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:07.794
They do have a tendency to be
a little obsessive compulsive,

00:18:07.794 --> 00:18:09.210
and sometimes that
gets in the way

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:11.085
of their levels of
productivity, because they

00:18:11.085 --> 00:18:13.440
want it to be perfect
at every juncture.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.327
And that was a little
bit like this woman.

00:18:15.327 --> 00:18:17.160
But it turned out that
she wasn't a dolphin.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.480
It turned out that
she was a wolf,

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.313
and once we are able
to change her schedule,

00:18:20.313 --> 00:18:22.960
it actually worked
out quite well.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.320
So who cares about
all this stuff?

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:28.896
Remember, if you know what your
chronotype is, and then you

00:18:28.896 --> 00:18:30.270
know what your
hormones are going

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:32.400
to be doing throughout
a particular day,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.490
I can actually match
the times of day

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.040
when your hormones are
at a particular level

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:42.320
where it would be optimal
to do that activity.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.940
It's actually a matching game.

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.960
It's super simple.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.720
So this sounds too
good to be true, right?

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:50.053
How could he possibly be able
to do something like this?

00:18:50.053 --> 00:18:53.150
Well, so I've actually
got over 350 studies

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.170
backing me up on this.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.160
Now I didn't do 350 studies.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.460
What I did was I aggregated
data from around the world,

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:02.130
and it turns out that this is
an area called chronobiology,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.330
and it's been studied for
15, almost 20 years now.

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:07.460
And so we've got a
tremendous amount of data

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:10.940
at our fingertips to be able
to see, hey, what can we do?

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.130
What can we do better,
and at what time

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:14.750
would it be better to do it?

00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.630
So what I thought
I would do is I'd

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.610
take a couple of topics for you
and show you how that works.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:22.220
Now in the book,
"The Power of When,"

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.300
there's 50 different topics.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:26.870
So what I did was I went through
my day of every single thing

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.290
that I did during the
day, and I wrote it down.

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.870
Then I asked my
wife to do the same.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:31.250
Then I asked a couple of
friends to do the same,

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:33.830
and we came up with roughly
50 different activities.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.750
But I thought I would
do some on health

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.560
and then some in business so
that you could get an idea

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:39.782
sort of what's been going on.

00:19:39.782 --> 00:19:41.240
So I'd start off
with these topics,

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.890
and you'll find them
actually quite interesting.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:45.620
So first, let's
talk about caffeine.

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.737
So I've been walking around
Google's campus, and one

00:19:48.737 --> 00:19:50.570
of the things that I
noticed is you're never

00:19:50.570 --> 00:19:53.450
more than probably
like 50 to 100 feet

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.140
away from a source of caffeine.

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.700
That seems to be a theme here.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.830
And there's a lot of
coffee being drunk here.

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.000
So I get it.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.270
Caffeine is the most abused
substance in the world,

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.012
and it's the most used
substance in the world, which

00:20:08.012 --> 00:20:08.970
is kind of interesting.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:10.636
But did you know that
there are actually

00:20:10.636 --> 00:20:12.440
times, where you can
drink your caffeine,

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.320
and it will actually
give you more energy?

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.117
That's probably pretty
interesting to you.

00:20:17.117 --> 00:20:19.200
So it's all based on a
couple of different things.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.990
One is what's called
your cortisol rhythm.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.110
So cortisol is the
fight or flight hormone.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.960
That's the thing that if you're
in trouble, it kicks in gear

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:28.790
and helps you get out of there.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.090
Well, it's also the hormone
that helps pull your body out

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:33.792
of a state of unconsciousness.

00:20:33.792 --> 00:20:35.250
So when you wake
up in the morning,

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:37.130
your cortisol levels
are actually quite high.

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.630
When you go to sleep at night,
you want your cortisol levels

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:40.820
to be quite low.

00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.830
So thinking about
that for a second,

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:44.600
if our cortisol
level is high, and we

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.530
look at how powerful cortisol
is versus caffeine, what we now

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:52.160
discover is that
cortisol is like cocaine,

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.950
and caffeine is like weak tea.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.460
So it really does almost
no good to add caffeine

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:01.730
on top of an already elevated
system that's full of cortisol.

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:07.940
However, if you wait
approximately 90 to 120 minutes

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.480
after you wake up, your natural
cortisol level begins to dip.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.340
And that's when, if
you have caffeine,

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.040
it actually helps elevate
that cortisol level back up

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.750
and give you that
level of energy.

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:20.420
Previously-- so by raise of
hands, how many people in here

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.294
have coffee in the
morning as the first thing

00:21:22.294 --> 00:21:23.660
that they drink?

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:26.210
So that's bad.

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:27.500
OK, let me tell you why.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.110
When you're at sleep at
night, in your breath,

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:32.840
you actually breathe
out almost a full liter

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.220
of water every night.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.020
And so you wake up dehydrated.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.230
Caffeine is a diuretic,
so when you drink coffee,

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:41.731
all you're doing is actually
not adding fluid to the system.

00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:43.730
You're actually making
it worse, and your system

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:45.950
wants to actually get
rid of even more water.

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:47.658
Very first thing that
you should be doing

00:21:47.658 --> 00:21:49.970
is drinking a 12 to
16-ounce bottle of water.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:52.910
If you can, make it not
cold, but lukewarm, something

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:54.710
that was probably by
your bedside at night.

00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:57.291
But you want to rehydrate
the system, number one.

00:21:57.291 --> 00:21:58.790
Caffeine doesn't
help you with that.

00:21:58.790 --> 00:22:01.514
But waiting 90 to
120 minutes later,

00:22:01.514 --> 00:22:02.930
it actually works
out pretty well.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.210
The second thing has to do
with your metabolic rhythm.

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:09.152
So caffeine has a half life of
between six and eight hours,

00:22:09.152 --> 00:22:11.360
and so when you're talking
about something like that,

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:14.131
you want to stop caffeine
by about 2:30, 3:00.

00:22:14.131 --> 00:22:16.130
Otherwise, it can have
an effect on your ability

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:19.225
to fall asleep or get into
deeper stages of sleep.

00:22:19.225 --> 00:22:21.350
So I'm sure that there are
plenty of people in here

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:24.440
who will tell me, Michael,
I could have a cup of coffee

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.267
at 10:00 at night--

00:22:26.267 --> 00:22:28.100
I've got a couple of
people in the front row

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.690
here that are smiling--

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:33.050
and I could fall right
asleep, no problem.

00:22:33.050 --> 00:22:35.270
That's true, but
that probably means

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.260
that you're sleep deprived,
incredibly sleep deprived,

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.760
depending upon the
level of caffeine

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:42.020
that you could be bringing in.

00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:44.060
So one of the things
I could say to you

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:46.052
is if I put something
on your brain

00:22:46.052 --> 00:22:48.260
to monitor your brain waves
as you're falling asleep,

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.180
what I could probably
show you is because you've

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.520
got so much caffeine onboard,
you're actually not getting

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.561
into the deeper stages of
sleep, and that's where

00:22:54.561 --> 00:22:56.490
it can become very problematic.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:58.250
So the worst thing in
the world you can do

00:22:58.250 --> 00:22:59.541
is drink coffee in the morning.

00:22:59.541 --> 00:23:03.440
So for my chronotypes, this
actually works out really well.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.180
So this is our
first test is trying

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:08.150
to figure out when should each
of these people have caffeine.

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.112
So dolphins will probably
want to have it--

00:23:10.112 --> 00:23:12.320
and I had a couple of dolphins
here in the audience--

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.620
probably at 8:30 to 10:00,
and then you can have it again

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:16.910
between 1:00 and 2:00.

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:19.490
Lions are going to be a little
bit earlier, because remember,

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:21.740
lions have a tendency to
wake up early in the morning.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.480
Bears-- a little bit later.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.190
And then wolves, really--

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.140
and this is a
problem for us wolves

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.030
is because we're so
tired in the mornings,

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:31.310
and society makes
us get up earlier,

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:34.250
we're just pounding
coffee constantly.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.500
And what you'll find is that
all you're really getting

00:23:36.500 --> 00:23:37.370
is side effects from it.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:38.780
You're really not
getting the energy boost

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.779
that you're looking for.

00:23:39.779 --> 00:23:42.650
So I ask wolves to actually have
caffeine much later in the day,

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:44.684
but not too late,
because that's really

00:23:44.684 --> 00:23:46.850
when your energy systems
are going to be kicking in.

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:49.400
And then you really actually
don't need it as much.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.830
So I'm going to give
everybody a bonus hack,

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.410
and I call this the Nap-a-Latte.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:59.637
So let's say that you only got
4 and 1/2 to 5 hours of sleep

00:23:59.637 --> 00:24:01.970
the other night, and you got
a big presentation to give.

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.594
You got something
else that's going on,

00:24:03.594 --> 00:24:05.810
and you've really got
to be on your mark.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:09.650
So here's what I want you to do
is take a six-ounce cup of drip

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:12.140
coffee, which has the highest
caffeine content, about 100,

00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.430
110 milligrams.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:16.670
Put in three ice
cubes to cool it down.

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:18.860
Slug the whole
thing really quick,

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:21.800
and then take a 25-minute nap.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.132
You'll reduce the amount
of adenosine in your system

00:24:24.132 --> 00:24:25.340
so that you're not as sleepy.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.987
The caffeine locks into
those receptor sites.

00:24:27.987 --> 00:24:29.570
You're good for four
hours guaranteed.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.250
JOE: I do this about
three times a week.

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.770
MICHAEL BREUS: So Joe here
has commented that he does

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.280
this about three times a week.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.960
And it really works.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.210
It's really pretty impressive.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:40.790
I use this with all
my Fortune 100 CEOs.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:42.650
I use it for whole
executive teams.

00:24:42.650 --> 00:24:44.480
Three times a week
is about the maximum

00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.660
that you want to use it.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:48.860
You don't want to be
using it every day, Joe.

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.530
But it's true, and it works
really, really well, especially

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:53.904
on those days where you really
haven't gotten the quality

00:24:53.904 --> 00:24:56.300
sleep that you were looking for.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.239
Also, it turns out
broccoli is one

00:24:58.239 --> 00:25:00.530
of the things that will
actually help pull caffeine out

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.070
of your system.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:02.540
I've seen two
studies to show this.

00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:05.040
I don't know exactly what the
mechanism of action is there,

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.740
but it turns out that if
you've got too much caffeine

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.510
in your system, steamed
broccoli with dinner

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.510
can actually help pull
some of that caffeine out

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:12.315
of your system rather quickly.

00:25:12.315 --> 00:25:13.940
So is there a right
time to go running?

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:15.140
How many people in
here are runners?

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.010
I know Nick's a runner.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:17.930
OK, so we've got quite a few
people in here are runners.

00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:19.160
So this is very interesting.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.326
There are different rhythms
in the body that tell us

00:25:21.326 --> 00:25:22.700
when is a good time to run.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:25.410
So it depends on what you want
to accomplish with your run.

00:25:25.410 --> 00:25:27.320
So if you want to
burn fat, you actually

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.660
want to run more in the
morning on an empty stomach--

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:32.469
not a dehydrated stomach,
but an empty stomach,

00:25:32.469 --> 00:25:34.760
because your body's got to
get the fuel from someplace,

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.680
and so it's going
to pull it from fat.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:40.310
But what if you're a
performance-based runner?

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.220
Like what if you're training
for a marathon or CrossFit,

00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:45.800
or you're doing a triathlon
or something like that?

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.990
It turns out that there
are better times of day

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.809
for performance than
you might expect.

00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:52.600
And these are actually
based on chronotype.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.530
So lions are actually
best in the late morning,

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:56.510
which would make sense, because
they're early morning people.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.500
Bears in the afternoon.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.080
Wolves are best in the evenings,
and dolphins are actually

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.930
good in the morning, because
dolphins use exercise

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:05.930
to help relax them and
help kind of give them--

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.390
take that level of
anxiety and lower it down,

00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:10.850
although one thing I have
noticed about my bears

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:14.510
in general is if bears don't
exercise in the morning,

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.250
they just won't do it.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.380
So it's pretty interesting.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.720
They might do better
in the later afternoon,

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.205
but I promise you that 9
times out of 10, they're

00:26:23.205 --> 00:26:25.580
not going to do it if they
don't exercise in the morning.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.460
So I'd rather you exercise
in the morning, so maybe

00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.530
as a bear, you might burn
a little bit more fat

00:26:30.530 --> 00:26:33.380
than you might from a
performance standpoint.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.980
But what about
training for strength?

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:37.015
So we talked about cardio, but
what about strength training?

00:26:37.015 --> 00:26:38.850
So strength training
is very interesting.

00:26:38.850 --> 00:26:41.630
So when you look at the
muscle growth rhythms that

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.590
are out there, it
doesn't really matter

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:46.220
when you train if you want
your muscles to get bigger.

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:49.490
But if you want them to
actually get stronger,

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:51.450
there actually is
a rhythm based on--

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:52.370
God bless you.

00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:54.050
Actually, God bless all of us--

00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:56.981
based on-- that got the
biggest laugh so far.

00:26:56.981 --> 00:26:57.480
All right.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.170
Good to know.

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:02.000
So he timed that just
perfectly for me.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.650
So when you look
at muscle strength,

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:06.530
it turns out that there are--

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.790
it's a testosterone ratio.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.700
And so when we have
more testosterone,

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:12.320
we actually can have
better strength.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:15.212
And so looking at lions, bears,
and dolphins, and wolves,

00:27:15.212 --> 00:27:17.420
we actually know what their
testosterone rhythms are.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.610
And that's part of the
reason why they can actually

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:22.160
lift more weights
and actually be

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.760
stronger by doing their
exercise at different times.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.110
So we've talked about caffeine.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.150
We've talked about exercise.

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:30.800
It is St. Patrick's Day.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.830
I guess we have to
talk about green beer.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:35.720
So let's talk about
alcohol for a second.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.590
So it turns out that your liver
produces this thing called

00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:41.540
alcohol dehydrogenase.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.880
And what it does is it
actually helps filter

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.360
through and get that
alcohol out of your system.

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.180
Guess what.

00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:51.080
It doesn't really happen
very much in the mornings.

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:55.100
So if you're having brunch
and having mimosas and Bloody

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:57.560
Marys, you really need
about half the amount

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.450
of alcohol in the
morning that you

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.690
would normally to get the
same effect in the afternoon

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:03.770
or evening.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.740
So that's kind of interesting in
terms of your tolerance rhythm

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:07.550
will change.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:09.200
You are much less tolerant.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.750
Alcohol has a much bigger
effect on you in the mornings

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:13.790
than it ever will in the
afternoons or evenings.

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:16.070
But then there's this
thing called happy hour.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:17.480
And so what is happy hour?

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:19.130
Happy hour is
really interesting,

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:22.840
because when you look at it
from a biochemical standpoint,

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.770
this alcohol
dehydrogenase really

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.980
kicks into gear
about 4:30, 5:00,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.860
and it goes really
hard until about 7:00.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:32.750
So a lot of the
alcohol establishments

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.810
over the last 100 years or
so had figured out this,

00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:38.030
and they know that you'll
actually be drinking more

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.155
during this period of time.

00:28:39.155 --> 00:28:41.570
And that's why they give you
free food or reduced cost

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:43.370
food to drive you in
to then drink more,

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:46.550
because your body can
actually handle drinking more

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.270
at that point.

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.710
Now what ends up
happening is sometimes

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.380
you may drink in a
little bit of excess,

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.090
and then you end
up with a hangover.

00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.340
So there's something
called the hangover rhythm.

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:57.290
And so this is
actually, again, when

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.019
is your body able to pull
the alcohol in or out.

00:29:00.019 --> 00:29:02.060
And when you take all
these rhythms into account,

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.976
there's a couple of
things that you can learn.

00:29:03.976 --> 00:29:06.890
So this is what I call
strategic drinking.

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:09.950
So if you go by your
chronotype, here's

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.800
what you will learn is
that dolphins are actually

00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.440
good between 6:00 and 8:00.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.710
Lions, again, a
little bit earlier.

00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:18.440
Bears-- kind of in the middle.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:21.680
And then wolves-- we can
party all night long.

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:23.390
And so it's kind
of interesting when

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.280
you start to think
through the idea

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.250
of chemically or
biochemically speaking, what's

00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:29.270
going on in your body.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:32.240
How could that
possibly have an effect

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:34.250
on whatever it is
that you're ingesting,

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:36.602
whether it's caffeine,
alcohol, you name it?

00:29:36.602 --> 00:29:38.810
And then I also brought in
a couple of hangover hacks

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:40.910
for people who are wolves,
who have a tendency

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:42.621
to drink late at night.

00:29:42.621 --> 00:29:44.870
A couple of things to think
about-- one glass of water

00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:46.190
for every alcoholic beverage.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:48.467
Number one, it slows down
the sheer volume of alcohol

00:29:48.467 --> 00:29:50.300
you're putting in your
system, but remember,

00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:51.561
alcohol is a diuretic.

00:29:51.561 --> 00:29:53.060
And sort of once
you break the seal,

00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:54.830
and you go to the bathroom
once, you're done.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.210
You're just going to go to the
bathroom, go to the bathroom,

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:57.626
go to bathroom,
so you really need

00:29:57.626 --> 00:30:00.140
to rehydrate as best you can.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.870
I've seen two studies to show
that coconut water before bed

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:03.890
seems to help.

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.130
I have no data other than
these kind of-- and they

00:30:07.130 --> 00:30:08.310
were anecdotal case studies.

00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:10.018
They weren't really
anything really good,

00:30:10.018 --> 00:30:11.750
so give it a shot if you want.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:15.060
If you can, stop drinking
about three hours before bed.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:17.700
It takes the average human
body approximately one hour

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.340
per alcoholic beverage
to digest through it,

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.460
and so if you had two or three
beers or wine with dinner,

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:25.770
then if you stop it
like, let's say, 8:00,

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:27.270
then you would go
to bed at 11:00.

00:30:27.270 --> 00:30:28.500
Then it would be
out of your system.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.208
Remember, there's a
really big difference

00:30:30.208 --> 00:30:33.330
between going to
sleep and passing out.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:37.230
And so we want to be careful
about the passing out phase.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.300
Also, it turns out that
alcohol really pulls out

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.929
of your body magnesium
and vitamin B,

00:30:40.929 --> 00:30:42.720
so taking those in the
morning can actually

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.610
be very, very helpful.

00:30:44.610 --> 00:30:46.800
And then just time--

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.810
the whole idea of hair
of the dog that bit you

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:50.295
is never a good idea.

00:30:50.295 --> 00:30:52.920
So don't start drinking early in
the morning, because remember,

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.170
your tolerance rhythm
is going to have

00:30:55.170 --> 00:30:57.060
a pretty big effect there.

00:30:57.060 --> 00:30:58.144
When should you go to bed?

00:30:58.144 --> 00:31:00.184
This is a question that
I get asked all the time,

00:31:00.184 --> 00:31:01.650
because I'm the
sleep doctor, so,

00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:02.790
of course, that's the
question that people

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:03.720
are going to ask me.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.060
So it's really interesting,
but most people

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.830
don't know their bed time.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:10.110
They have a socially
determined wake up time,

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.693
but they don't
actually know what time

00:31:11.693 --> 00:31:13.050
they need to go to bed.

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.508
Like when was the last time
somebody told you to go to bed?

00:31:15.508 --> 00:31:17.250
When you were like
10, 12 years old?

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:20.250
So what I know is that most
people have this socially

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:21.450
determined wake up time.

00:31:21.450 --> 00:31:23.370
It tends to be around 6:30.

00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:24.900
So in our house,
we wake up at 6:30,

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.130
because the kids are
getting ready for school.

00:31:27.130 --> 00:31:29.670
And so I know it's
6:30, and so we

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.710
know that the average
sleep cycle is

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.780
approximately 90 minutes long.

00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:36.460
We know the average person has
five of these sleep cycles.

00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:39.110
So 5 times 90 is?

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:40.420
Come on, guys.

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:41.156
450.

00:31:41.156 --> 00:31:42.780
Nobody said there
would be math, right?

00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.380
OK, 450.

00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:46.600
So if we take 450
minutes, and we divide it

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.970
by 60 minutes an hour,
we get 7 and 1/2 hours.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.420
So if you do the math, it
gets kind of interesting.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.160
If we take with our
lions and with our bears,

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:57.280
we take 90-minute sleep
cycle, five sleep cycles,

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.350
and roughly 20 minutes
to fall asleep,

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:04.570
they have roughly 470 minutes to
count backwards from their wake

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.940
up time.

00:32:06.940 --> 00:32:10.350
And then they know
what time to go to bed.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.690
Another interesting
fact-- wolves and dolphins

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:14.340
don't get five cycles.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.350
They have a tendency
to get four cycles,

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:18.930
and it takes us
longer to fall asleep.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:22.110
So the total minutes
for a wolf or a dolphin

00:32:22.110 --> 00:32:24.990
might be closer to 400,
where the total minutes

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.740
for a bear or a lion
might be closer to 470.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:31.800
Eight hours is a myth.

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.670
OK?

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:34.620
Eight hours is a myth.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.980
Very few people need exactly
eight hours of sleep.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.780
I personally am a 6
and 1/2 hour sleeper.

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.310
I have been almost
my entire life.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.660
I go to bed around midnight.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:45.990
I wake up around 6:30,
because I'm a wolf.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:48.450
There's nothing wrong with
sleeping only 6 and 1/2 hours,

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.077
if you wake up, and you feel
energized, and you feel good.

00:32:51.077 --> 00:32:53.160
If you wake up, and you
feel bad, then guess what.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:54.450
You might need more time.

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:57.919
So try running this
experiment at home for a week.

00:32:57.919 --> 00:32:59.710
Take your socially
determined wake up time,

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.460
and if you're a dolphin or a
wolf, count back 400 minutes.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.970
If you're a lion or a bear,
count back 470 minutes.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.740
And if you're waking up within
five minutes of your alarm,

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.580
then guess what.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.590
You figured out how
much sleep you need.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:13.140
Some people, their sleep
cycle isn't 90 minutes.

00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:15.270
My sleep cycle is
actually 80 minutes.

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:16.810
So that's why it works that way.

00:33:16.810 --> 00:33:19.440
Now I've got the good fortune
of being able to test it out

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.810
in sleep labs, and I keep
something by my bedside that

00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:24.750
measures my sleep every
night called an S+.

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:27.406
And so I actually know exactly
what my sleep is all the time,

00:33:27.406 --> 00:33:28.780
and if you're
interested in that,

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.280
we can certainly get you the
information about that as well.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.560
But try out this experiment.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.760
You might be very, very
surprised at what you learn.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.230
So what's the good bedtime?

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:39.720
So I actually plotted
it out for everybody,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.630
but it's in the book.

00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:44.820
And again, you can figure it
out based on your chronotype as

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.470
well as your sleep score.

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:48.339
So I have wake up
times and bedtimes

00:33:48.339 --> 00:33:50.880
various throughout the evening
so that people can figure this

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.060
out.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.136
So what about sex?

00:33:53.136 --> 00:33:54.510
So this is a
question I get asked

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.880
every single time I
do something is, well,

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.330
is there a right time for sex?

00:33:58.330 --> 00:33:59.760
Is there a wrong time for sex?

00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:01.034
So my daughter's
in the room, so I'm

00:34:01.034 --> 00:34:02.730
going to ask her to put
her hands over her ears

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:04.063
so that she can't hear anything.

00:34:04.063 --> 00:34:04.860
Thank you, Carson.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:06.667
I appreciate you doing that.

00:34:06.667 --> 00:34:08.250
13-year-old daughter
in the audience--

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:09.291
what are you going to do?

00:34:09.291 --> 00:34:11.340
So is there a best time for sex?

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.530
So it turns out that
there are actually--

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.900
you don't really have to keep
your hands over your ears.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:20.400
It turns out that 72% of
people have sex between 10:30

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.710
and 11:30 at night.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:23.940
Now that makes sense, right?

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.710
You're in with your partner.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.600
You're not wearing
nearly as many clothes.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:28.770
You kind of look like,
hey, you interested?

00:34:28.770 --> 00:34:29.730
Yeah, sure, why not?

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:30.980
OK.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:32.135
And there you go.

00:34:32.135 --> 00:34:33.510
Kind of interesting
when you look

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:37.170
at your hormone distribution
at that particular time of day.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:41.040
So this is actually when
your hormone profile is worst

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.120
to have sex.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.370
You have low levels
of testosterone.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.830
You have low levels of
estrogen, low levels

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:51.780
of progesterone, low
cortisol, and high melatonin.

00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:54.870
I can't think of any
worse particular time

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:58.260
to try to have a sexual activity
when all of those hormones

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.100
are working against you,
not in the right direction.

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.516
So what am I going to do?

00:35:04.516 --> 00:35:05.640
First of all, we did this--

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.098
we looked at this,
and it turns out

00:35:07.098 --> 00:35:09.660
that lions actually have
their strongest desire

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:10.960
in the early morning hours.

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.480
Not a big surprise there.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.700
Dolphins reported a
very calming effect

00:35:14.700 --> 00:35:18.870
from having sex in the morning,
and wolves just stayed up later

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:20.790
and ended up having sex,
because, again that's

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:23.580
what their kind of whole
chronotype wants to do.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.910
And men prefer sex at
any time it's offered.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:27.880
This is not a joke.

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.620
This was true.

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:30.877
So it turns out that men
would-- if it was offered,

00:35:30.877 --> 00:35:32.960
it didn't really matter
what their chronotype was.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:33.960
They were ready to go.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:37.530
So what happens if you
are one chronotype,

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.650
and your bed partner is
a different chronotype?

00:35:40.650 --> 00:35:41.160
Right?

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:47.970
So I created a matrix in great
algorithmic Google fashion

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.370
to be able to tell people,
and I have an early evening

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:52.440
time and an early morning time.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:55.380
So you heard it here from the
sleep doctor and the power

00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:56.100
of when.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.850
Everybody should try having sex
Saturday morning at around 8:00

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:01.320
or 9:00 o'clock in
the morning just

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.440
to see if it's any
better than at night.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.810
And you might actually
be very, very surprised.

00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.790
There's a whole chapter
on this in the book,

00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:11.160
and I actually also
have a separate matrix

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.131
for heterosexual couples,
then for lesbian couples,

00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:16.380
and for gay couples, because
the hormone distributions

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:17.530
are very, very different.

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:18.690
So check it out.

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.944
I think you'll find
it quite fascinating.

00:36:20.944 --> 00:36:22.860
So now we're going to
move on to productivity.

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.600
So speaking of sex, we'll
talk about productivity.

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.640
So what are we going
to talk about here?

00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.890
There's a lot of really
interesting things

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:29.806
that are going on now.

00:36:29.806 --> 00:36:32.040
I'm actually being
asked by companies

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:34.474
to come in and chronotype
the entire company,

00:36:34.474 --> 00:36:36.390
because one of the things
that they're finding

00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:38.880
is they say, well, I've got
a preponderance of wolves

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.539
in my creative department,
which makes sense,

00:36:41.539 --> 00:36:42.830
because that's what wolves are.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:44.460
They're my internal,
introverted,

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.780
more creative people.

00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:50.370
And some idiot is having a
meeting for them at 9 o'clock

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:51.960
or 8 o'clock in the morning.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.400
Well, none of them
are even awake.

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.420
They can't even think
at that period of time.

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.670
So chronotyping the
company, and then working

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.670
with the scheduling
department, and then looking

00:36:59.670 --> 00:37:01.830
at the content of those
meetings turns out

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:04.622
to be incredibly interesting
for levels of productivity.

00:37:04.622 --> 00:37:07.080
And we're starting to find now
that people are getting more

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:10.260
and more productive simply
by using these types of tools

00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.694
at their disposal.

00:37:11.694 --> 00:37:13.110
So let's talk about
brainstorming.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.330
And so I know that
there's time spent here

00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:17.850
for people, where you have a
certain amount of time each day

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.184
to think about something
different or a different kind

00:37:20.184 --> 00:37:21.600
of project or
something like that.

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.030
Well, if you kind of are
trying to come up with ideas,

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:25.530
sometimes that's
not always so easy.

00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:27.238
How many people in
here feel like they've

00:37:27.238 --> 00:37:29.310
had their best idea when
they were in the shower,

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.610
on the treadmill, going for
a run, something like that?

00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:34.569
So there's a reason for
that, and it's called--

00:37:34.569 --> 00:37:36.901
well, I'm going to tell you
all these different rhythms.

00:37:36.901 --> 00:37:39.240
That one in particular is
called the distraction rhythm.

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:40.410
So have you ever
noticed how when

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:42.451
you're doing one thing,
and then all of a sudden,

00:37:42.451 --> 00:37:44.310
a new thought comes
flying into your head?

00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:47.530
So if your body is distracted
with a physical activity,

00:37:47.530 --> 00:37:49.690
whether it's a shower
or going for a run,

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:52.590
you actually you have a greater
likelihood of these ideas being

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:53.707
able to come to you.

00:37:53.707 --> 00:37:55.540
The connectivity rhythm
is very interesting.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:57.132
So there's only
certain times of day

00:37:57.132 --> 00:37:58.590
where your right
side of your brain

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.180
likes to talk to the
left side of your brain,

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.830
and there's a lot
of more interaction.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.140
It happens to be
earlier in the morning.

00:38:04.140 --> 00:38:06.180
The novelty rhythm is
something else as well.

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.856
So you ever get into
a new situation,

00:38:07.856 --> 00:38:09.480
meet a new person,
and all of a sudden,

00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.800
you've got so much
in common with them,

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.300
and they think like you,
and you think like them,

00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.799
and all of a sudden, you start
tossing ideas back and forth,

00:38:14.799 --> 00:38:17.280
and before you know it, you're
really connected with them?

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.140
That's actually how I met Joe.

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:19.769
We met.

00:38:19.769 --> 00:38:20.560
We started talking.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.360
I was like, oh, my god.

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:21.984
You like sleep.

00:38:21.984 --> 00:38:22.562
I like sleep.

00:38:22.562 --> 00:38:24.270
And we started talking
about it, and then

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.120
all of a sudden, here I am at
Google talking about sleep.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.650
So what happens is it
spurs on new ideas,

00:38:30.650 --> 00:38:34.139
so having those new experiences
can be very, very important.

00:38:34.139 --> 00:38:36.180
And then there's something
called the REM rhythm.

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.513
So most people don't know
this, but you move information

00:38:38.513 --> 00:38:40.950
from your short term memory
to your long term memory

00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:42.690
during REM sleep.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.370
That becomes
critically important,

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.980
because you create an
organizational substructure

00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:49.247
in your brain to
deposit information.

00:38:49.247 --> 00:38:51.330
And then you have connections
between these pieces

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:55.200
of information to retrieve
them to solve problems.

00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:57.060
So most of your problem
solving can really

00:38:57.060 --> 00:38:59.220
occur while you're unconscious.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.040
So first of all, if you've
ever heard the old adage of,

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:05.440
sleep on it before you make
a big decision, it's true.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.770
In our house, we never
make a major decision

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:10.380
without sleeping on it, because
there's so much information

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.570
that's got to be compiled
and kind of microprocessed

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:14.980
within my head, it's
really hard to do that.

00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:16.860
So being able to give
yourself that time

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.670
becomes very, very important.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:22.200
So I call these moments
of groggy greatness.

00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:24.330
And so the worst time
to try to brainstorm

00:39:24.330 --> 00:39:26.940
is between 11:00 and
3:00, because that's

00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:28.570
where you've had lunch.

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:31.710
You actually have a small spike
in core body temperature, which

00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:33.229
releases a little
bit of melatonin,

00:39:33.229 --> 00:39:34.770
so it's not necessarily
always great,

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:37.830
although for some of my
bears, that can actually

00:39:37.830 --> 00:39:39.030
be a decent time as well.

00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:40.377
But it just depends.

00:39:40.377 --> 00:39:42.210
Sometimes they have
something else going on.

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:45.030
But my dolphins-- and you notice
how early these times are.

00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:47.250
So for my lions,
4:00 AM to 6:00 AM.

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:49.170
Well, hopefully, you're
not awake at 4:00 AM.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:50.920
That's kind of where
the REM is coming in.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.350
But right after you wake
up, one of the best ways

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:55.450
to do something is take
a topic, and put it

00:39:55.450 --> 00:39:57.610
on a piece of paper and
a pen, and then put it

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.662
by your bedside.

00:39:58.662 --> 00:40:01.120
And when you wake up in the
morning, the first thing you do

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.620
is look at that
topic and write down

00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:04.780
everything you can think
about about that topic.

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:06.820
Within five to seven
days, I guarantee you,

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.291
you will come up with an idea
that you've never had before.

00:40:09.291 --> 00:40:11.290
Again, it's because of
this microprocessing that

00:40:11.290 --> 00:40:12.520
gets to go on in your head.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.728
And that's not the only time.

00:40:13.728 --> 00:40:15.850
The second time happens
to be in the afternoon.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.547
Now if you notice here,
Dolphins between 2:00 and 4:00,

00:40:18.547 --> 00:40:20.380
and I'm talking over
here that you shouldn't

00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:22.240
go between 11:00 and 3:00.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.060
Dolphins are different,
because their level of anxiety

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:25.750
is much higher.

00:40:25.750 --> 00:40:28.870
And so they can actually funnel
in and get to that moment

00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:31.420
a little bit earlier
when most of us can't.

00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:33.670
But again, what I did
was I lined up the times,

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:35.620
and so you actually
have two times of day

00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:38.350
where brainstorming is going to
be better than any other time

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:39.130
during the day.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:40.730
Now how many people in
here by a raise of hands

00:40:40.730 --> 00:40:42.938
have ever noticed that there
are certain times of day

00:40:42.938 --> 00:40:45.280
that they do things
better than others?

00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:47.110
So this is what I'm
talking about here

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.510
is if you're trying
to force a brainstorm,

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:50.620
it doesn't always work.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.680
But if you know what times
you're able to naturally get

00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.690
there, give yourself a shot.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.120
You might be surprised
at what happens.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.480
The same holds true for
being on in terms of being

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.550
able to be alert and focused.

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:06.806
So I'm sure a lot of you have
to present ideas to people

00:41:06.806 --> 00:41:08.680
and be able to talk to
people and tell people

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.880
all the kinds of things
that you're working on

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.900
and things like that.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.360
Well, it turns out that there
are certain chronotypes that

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.540
do this better than others.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.590
Lions, they love to
be in front of a room.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:19.240
Not a big surprise.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:21.640
My COO is my kind of
leaders of the pack.

00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:23.050
Not a big shocker there.

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:24.480
Dolphins-- not as much.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:26.230
They can do it, but
they would much rather

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.080
be in the back and kind of being
able to do their own thing.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.704
Wolves would actually prefer
to go to happy hour as opposed

00:41:31.704 --> 00:41:34.120
to give a major presentation,
which is what I would prefer

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.127
to do most of the time.

00:41:35.127 --> 00:41:37.210
And bears are actually
happy to be in the audience

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:40.000
and learn from the presentation,
not necessarily have

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.890
to give that presentation.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:45.040
But there are actually rhythms
for attending a presentation.

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.990
So let's say you want
to schedule a time,

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:50.470
so actually, the most flexible
time is between 2:30 and 3:00

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:51.850
in the afternoon.

00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:54.010
The second best time is
between 10:00 and 11:00,

00:41:54.010 --> 00:41:55.954
so not when somebody
just gets there,

00:41:55.954 --> 00:41:58.120
but after they've had a
chance to kind of settle in.

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:01.600
The least flexible time, as
you can see, 9:15, worst time.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.070
Second worst time
is 12:00 to 1:00.

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:05.980
So these are data that come
from a-- there was a software

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.630
program called Meet with Me.

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:10.219
And they had over half
a million meetings,

00:42:10.219 --> 00:42:12.760
and then you had to click that
you were attending the meeting

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:14.110
or not attending the meeting.

00:42:14.110 --> 00:42:19.060
And so these data actually are
full on, straight up objective.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.826
Turns out Tuesday afternoons
have the highest flexibility

00:42:21.826 --> 00:42:23.200
for meetings, and
Monday mornings

00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.210
have the lowest flexibility.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.530
Not really a big surprise.

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:30.790
Who wants to have an 8:00 AM,
Monday morning meeting, right?

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:31.990
Nobody.

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:33.055
Nobody wants to do that.

00:42:33.055 --> 00:42:34.930
And also, it's really
hard to start your week

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:37.330
off having that kind of
meeting and things like that.

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:40.450
Now aside from assigning
when the presentation be, how

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:41.762
about giving the presentation?

00:42:41.762 --> 00:42:43.720
So you want to have your
energy rhythm, so when

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.402
are you at your peak?

00:42:45.402 --> 00:42:47.110
When are you going to
be most articulate?

00:42:47.110 --> 00:42:48.310
When are you going to be
able to focus the most

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:49.779
and give the most information?

00:42:49.779 --> 00:42:51.820
And then engagement-- when
is your audience going

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:54.250
to have an interest in
what you're having to say?

00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:57.310
So I actually created,
again, another matrix

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:58.750
based on chronotypes.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.850
And what you'll find is
that different people

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:02.990
are on at different times.

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:05.410
This is why when I
chronotype a company,

00:43:05.410 --> 00:43:07.172
it gets really interesting
really quickly,

00:43:07.172 --> 00:43:09.130
because we've got the
presenter, and then we've

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:09.838
got the audience.

00:43:09.838 --> 00:43:12.130
And making that
match appropriately

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:14.290
turns out to be a
really interesting way

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:17.155
to increase levels
of productivity.

00:43:17.155 --> 00:43:18.530
A couple of things
about audience

00:43:18.530 --> 00:43:20.154
engagement that you
may know or may not

00:43:20.154 --> 00:43:22.970
know-- roughly 30 minutes after
you start, one in seven people

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:23.720
will be zoned out.

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:26.630
I can see people already
starting to get there.

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.960
After 45 minutes, one in three
will basically become a zombie.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.000
And then you do have
something that's

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.900
called cognitive
backlog that occurs.

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:36.776
So right now, I've
given you-- you're

00:43:36.776 --> 00:43:38.150
like drinking from
the fire hose.

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:40.580
I've given you so
much information.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:41.930
Don't expect to remember it all.

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:43.084
Check out the book.

00:43:43.084 --> 00:43:44.750
Don't forget that
this is all being live

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:47.041
streamed, and it's going to
be up on YouTube for people

00:43:47.041 --> 00:43:47.569
to watch.

00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:48.860
So don't try to take it all in.

00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.980
But you can't get that much
information in your brain

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.260
at any one given time.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.940
Best and worst
times to present--

00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:57.830
this is, again,
based on energy level

00:43:57.830 --> 00:44:00.740
for my different
chronotypes and worst times

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:02.520
for everybody in general.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.860
So even if you don't know
everybody in your audience,

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.950
these are the times
that you want to avoid,

00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:09.150
if you possibly can.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:11.480
So what about making a decision?

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:14.150
So it turns out that there are
on peak times, where you're

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.820
logical, very low risk
in your decision making,

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.100
and off peak times, where
you're far more emotional

00:44:19.100 --> 00:44:21.146
and high risk decision making.

00:44:21.146 --> 00:44:23.270
These are actually influenced
by sleep deprivation,

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.850
your personality, and what
we call the procrastination

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:26.690
rhythm.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:27.950
So everybody in here's
probably familiar with

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:29.120
the procrastination rhythm.

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.250
It turns out that this is
actually by chronotype,

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.700
and so some of my chronotypes
are world champion

00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.320
procrastinators--

00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.056
those would be the wolves or the
late night people like myself.

00:44:40.056 --> 00:44:41.930
The people who are not
big on procrastination

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:44.760
turns out to be the lions
and the early morning people.

00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:46.500
It's kind of interesting.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.870
So when is the best time
for you to make a decision?

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:51.286
So these are the times during
the day that you're actually

00:44:51.286 --> 00:44:54.170
going to make the most
clear-headed logical decision

00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:57.860
based on your endocrine system,
based on when your hormones are

00:44:57.860 --> 00:45:00.776
hitting the different highs and
lows throughout the day, which,

00:45:00.776 --> 00:45:02.150
again, is pretty
interesting when

00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:03.316
you start to think about it.

00:45:03.316 --> 00:45:04.370
Could I reschedule?

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:06.410
Could I rejigger my
schedule one way or another

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.710
to be able to allow me
to make better decisions,

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:11.150
to be able to be more
productive, things like that?

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.780
So can you hack your chronotype?

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.400
So the answer is yes, you can.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:19.340
I'm not sure you
want to, but you can.

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.520
So the strategic use of
light, caffeine, and melatonin

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.130
can do this, because here's
the thing to remember

00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:28.220
is if you're a wolf, and you're
living in a bear's world,

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.424
all you are is jet lagged.

00:45:30.424 --> 00:45:32.090
And these are the
components that we use

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:33.770
to help people with jet lag.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:37.700
So if you want to, you can
actually utilize light therapy.

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:40.250
I know we had Fred Maxik
talking earlier this week

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:41.864
about how to use light.

00:45:41.864 --> 00:45:44.030
And you can have melatonin
in the evenings, caffeine

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.040
and light in the mornings,
and you can actually

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.346
shift yourself.

00:45:47.346 --> 00:45:49.220
You can actually make
yourself into something

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:52.100
that you weren't genetically
predisposed to be.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.665
I don't recommend it,
but it is something

00:45:54.665 --> 00:45:56.540
that, unfortunately,
some of us have to do it

00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.400
whether we like it or not.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.050
And so thinking
through these ideas,

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:02.300
you don't necessarily want
to go against your genetics

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.580
if you can possibly help it.

00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.330
How do you make yourself
a morning person?

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.788
This is the second
biggest question

00:46:07.788 --> 00:46:10.880
I get after sex is,
how do I change myself

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.500
to become that morning person?

00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:15.080
So here's a couple of ideas
that you can try, if you'd like,

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:15.759
at home.

00:46:15.759 --> 00:46:18.050
So first of all, going to
bed at the right time for you

00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:19.760
every night-- again,
it's in the book,

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.920
but it's also based
on your chronotype.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:24.642
Number two, never hit
the snooze button.

00:46:24.642 --> 00:46:26.600
So by a raise of hands,
how many people in here

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.161
hit the snooze
button at least once?

00:46:29.161 --> 00:46:29.660
Come on.

00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:30.200
Don't lie.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:31.280
OK, keep your hands raised.

00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.238
Keep your hands raised.

00:46:32.238 --> 00:46:33.710
Twice?

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:35.640
Three times?

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.840
Four times?

00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:37.340
All right.

00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.240
So we ended at three.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:39.739
I was giving this
lecture, and I had

00:46:39.739 --> 00:46:43.079
somebody at seven times
for a snooze button.

00:46:43.079 --> 00:46:44.870
So let me tell you why
the snooze button is

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:46.966
the single worst
invention in all of sleep.

00:46:46.966 --> 00:46:48.590
So it turns out that
the average snooze

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:50.870
is between seven and
nine minutes long,

00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:54.530
and your body physically can't
get into a deep stage of sleep

00:46:54.530 --> 00:46:55.140
at that point.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.340
And we know that REM sleep--
remember from the creativity

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.710
stuff and the
brainstorming stuff--

00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:03.110
the bulk of it happens in
the last part of the night.

00:47:03.110 --> 00:47:04.700
So what you do by
hitting the snooze

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.310
is you actually knock down
your levels of creativity

00:47:07.310 --> 00:47:08.356
and brainstorming.

00:47:08.356 --> 00:47:09.980
I'd much rather you
just set your alarm

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.521
for the last possible
moment that you

00:47:11.521 --> 00:47:14.300
have to wake up, because you'll
get a lot more better quality

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.637
sleep.

00:47:15.637 --> 00:47:17.720
Get direct sunlight for
10 minutes in the morning.

00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:18.980
So once you've reached
over, and you've

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.650
grabbed your bottle of water,
because you're dehydrated,

00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:24.530
I want you to walk to the
window and get some sunlight.

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:25.370
Do me a favor.

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:26.820
Put on a robe.

00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.070
I have to tell this to people.

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:29.736
Lots of time, they
don't think about it,

00:47:29.736 --> 00:47:32.180
and then the neighbors
get a big scare.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:34.130
Remember to drink
your water, and let

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.020
there be light and music.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:37.400
So it's very, very interesting.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.110
How many people listen
to music in the mornings

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:40.235
when they're getting ready?

00:47:40.235 --> 00:47:42.960
So that's a great thing that
you do, and it works really,

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.460
really well.

00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:47.060
And you should use high
energy, high emotion music,

00:47:47.060 --> 00:47:50.530
so music that you love to dance
to that really gets you going

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:53.285
is fantastic, because then
you're using a secondary sense.

00:47:53.285 --> 00:47:55.160
You're not just having
light, but you're also

00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:58.140
having sound to help wake
your brain up in the morning.

00:47:58.140 --> 00:47:59.540
So one of the things that--

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:03.195
so in our house, my son
listens to music almost

00:48:03.195 --> 00:48:04.070
every single morning.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:05.870
My daughter doesn't
necessarily like it,

00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:07.666
and when it's too
early in the morning,

00:48:07.666 --> 00:48:10.040
because she can sleep in a
little bit longer than he can.

00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.140
And so the rule in
our house is at 6:30

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:15.350
is when you can actually
fire up the music.

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:19.220
And I walk in there, and he's
singing, he's dancing around,

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:21.200
and he's 15 years old.

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.590
To get a 15-year-old to get
up at 6:30 in the morning

00:48:24.590 --> 00:48:27.200
and be any level
of consciousness

00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.070
is almost an impossibility.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.370
So by having that
light that's coming in,

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.230
and then also having
the music, it really

00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:35.330
has a tendency to help you out.

00:48:35.330 --> 00:48:37.040
Exercising your body
and mind is always

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:40.070
going to be good, even if you
can only do 10 pushups or 15

00:48:40.070 --> 00:48:41.450
pushups in the morning.

00:48:41.450 --> 00:48:43.957
Do something to get
your heart rate up.

00:48:43.957 --> 00:48:46.040
If it's dancing around,
don't dance in the shower.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.230
Dance outside of the shower.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.750
We don't want anybody
slipping and falling,

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:50.500
but at the end of the
day, doing something

00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:52.184
to get that level of
energy up is good.

00:48:52.184 --> 00:48:54.600
If it's Saturday morning,
that's the perfect time for sex,

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:55.670
so go ahead and try that.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:56.295
You never know.

00:48:56.295 --> 00:48:58.800
It might help wake you up and
make you a morning person.

00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.300
The other thing I
want to talk about

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.140
is a cool, not cold shower.

00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:06.050
So this is something that I do
every morning or most mornings,

00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:08.077
and it's a meditation
technique that I do.

00:49:08.077 --> 00:49:09.660
And I teach it to
people all the time.

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.870
So you stand in front,
where the showerhead

00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:13.340
is right at your
head, and you have

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.800
it hit you literally
square between the eyes.

00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:18.290
There's like a waterfall
of water that comes down,

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.990
and it covers your nose, so it's
actually difficult to breathe.

00:49:20.990 --> 00:49:22.640
So you have to
open up your mouth,

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.654
and you have to concentrate
really hard on how you breathe.

00:49:25.654 --> 00:49:27.320
And if you sit there
for about a minute,

00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:31.370
you can't think of anything
other than your breathing.

00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:34.460
And so it really focuses you in,
and you really come out of this

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.930
really in the moment.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:38.864
While you're doing
that, take the nozzle,

00:49:38.864 --> 00:49:41.030
and turn it to get a little
cooler, a little cooler,

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.696
a little cooler.

00:49:41.696 --> 00:49:42.969
Don't make it cold.

00:49:42.969 --> 00:49:43.760
Just get it cooler.

00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:47.500
What happens is the blood
shunts into your trunk,

00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.500
and it actually causes
your heart rate to go up,

00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.230
and it actually helps
wake you up even more.

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:53.570
So by using this meditation,
and then when you turn off

00:49:53.570 --> 00:49:54.920
the shower, you are bam.

00:49:54.920 --> 00:49:56.150
You are in the now.

00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:58.970
That's a great time for
journaling and for creativity

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:00.920
or just getting your day going.

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.010
And then start your day
with a fairly decent-sized

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:05.960
protein-rich breakfast.

00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:08.850
Protein and good fat is going
to be much better for you.

00:50:08.850 --> 00:50:11.930
I was actually able to come
around to some of the cafes

00:50:11.930 --> 00:50:14.330
here, and they've got some
fantastic options here

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:16.621
at Google for you to be able
to do something like that.

00:50:16.621 --> 00:50:18.570
You want to avoid
carbs in the morning,

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:20.150
even though they
taste really good.

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:22.700
There's a lot of data to show
that carbs make you sleepy.

00:50:22.700 --> 00:50:25.630
And so if you're a wolf, and
you don't do well at mornings

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:27.980
anyway, a bagel is
about the worst thing

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.870
that you could possibly
put into your body,

00:50:29.870 --> 00:50:32.510
because all your body wants to
do after something like that

00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:33.350
is sleep.

00:50:33.350 --> 00:50:37.050
And so with that, I will
open it up for questions.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:38.780
You can ask me
questions about timing.

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:41.834
You can ask me questions about
sleep, whatever you want.

00:50:41.834 --> 00:50:43.250
AUDIENCE: You were
just mentioning

00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:46.910
about some protein-rich
breakfast options,

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:48.320
and what would those be?

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.250
MICHAEL BREUS: So
if I was looking

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:51.583
for a protein-rich breakfast,
I might consider something

00:50:51.583 --> 00:50:54.350
like an omelet with avocado
would be a great option,

00:50:54.350 --> 00:50:56.540
because you get the good
fat from the avocado,

00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.580
and you get the
protein from the eggs.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.770
A lot of people-- for
example, a lot of my people

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:02.570
who are night
people like wolves,

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:04.460
they have almost no
appetite in the morning.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.760
So for those people, a protein
shake or a protein smoothie

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.260
would actually work
out pretty well.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I hate
eating in the morning.

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:12.194
MICHAEL BREUS:
Yeah, and so do I.

00:51:12.194 --> 00:51:14.270
And so the only thing I
can literally choke down

00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:16.430
is a smoothie, barely.

00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:17.400
So that's what I do.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.930
AUDIENCE: Just
curious, is it just

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.840
the genetics 100% that
decides the chronotype,

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.342
or are there any external
factors or social factors?

00:51:26.342 --> 00:51:27.800
MICHAEL BREUS: So
it's the genetics

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:29.697
that determine the
chronotype, but it's

00:51:29.697 --> 00:51:31.280
the external factors
is whether or not

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:33.080
you can follow the chronotype.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.830
Also, it changes over time.

00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:36.920
So as an example with
my daughter, she's 13,

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:39.350
so she's going to
be more of a wolf.

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:42.590
But as she gets older, she
might be more of a bear.

00:51:42.590 --> 00:51:44.629
She might be more of a
lion, things like that.

00:51:44.629 --> 00:51:46.670
We also know that as we
get even older, like when

00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:50.401
we hit senior years like 55,
65, that kind of age range,

00:51:50.401 --> 00:51:52.650
then we also start to see
people go one of two routes.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:53.960
They either go in
towards the lion,

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:56.168
so you see a lot of people
having dinner at 5 o'clock

00:51:56.168 --> 00:51:59.450
and getting up super early,
or they go towards a dolphin,

00:51:59.450 --> 00:52:01.204
because they become
more medically frail.

00:52:01.204 --> 00:52:02.870
There's more medications
on board, which

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:04.550
can be disruptive to sleep.

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:06.340
AUDIENCE: You said
that for bears.

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:07.670
afternoon exercise is best.

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:09.100
But if they don't
exercise in the morning,

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.141
it's not going to happen.

00:52:10.141 --> 00:52:11.880
That's totally me.

00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.422
Why is that the case, and how
is it different for the others?

00:52:14.422 --> 00:52:15.838
MICHAEL BREUS: So
it's interesting

00:52:15.838 --> 00:52:17.490
when we look at
exercise in particular,

00:52:17.490 --> 00:52:21.410
but there's also a motivation
factor, an adherence

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:22.070
to exercise.

00:52:22.070 --> 00:52:24.230
And so there's some
data to now suggest

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:28.730
that if you do something
for between 21 and 25 days,

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:30.140
it becomes a habit.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:34.504
And so what I found with my
bears is if they're not willing

00:52:34.504 --> 00:52:36.170
to do it in the
afternoon, which, again,

00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:38.330
is where their strength
rhythm is coming from--

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:40.760
not necessarily fat
burning, but strength,

00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.140
not necessarily muscle growth--

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:44.320
then I can convince
them sometimes at least

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.320
to do it in the morning.

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.112
And then slowly, I try
to get them to do it

00:52:47.112 --> 00:52:48.778
towards the afternoon,
and they actually

00:52:48.778 --> 00:52:50.630
find that their
performance is better.

00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:52.338
AUDIENCE: What do you
think about napping

00:52:52.338 --> 00:52:54.407
during afternoons in general?

00:52:54.407 --> 00:52:56.240
MICHAEL BREUS: So
generally, I love napping,

00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.369
unless you're a dolphin.

00:52:57.369 --> 00:52:59.660
If you're a dolphin, or you
have any level of insomnia,

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.701
napping is about the worst
thing that you can do,

00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:03.487
because it, again,
lowers that sleep drive

00:53:03.487 --> 00:53:04.820
and makes it difficult to sleep.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.220
But a 25-minute nap
works really well,

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:11.090
and the Nap-a-Latte works
really well, if you try that.

00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:13.590
But I'm a big fan of the nap,
but you want to keep it short.

00:53:13.590 --> 00:53:15.900
Anybody here ever take
a nap and feel worse

00:53:15.900 --> 00:53:17.150
when they got up from the nap?

00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:18.590
That means you napped too long.

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:20.589
So if you're keeping it
to that 25-minute range,

00:53:20.589 --> 00:53:22.680
you only get about some
stage 1 and stage 2 sleep,

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.290
and it makes it
easier to wake up.

00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:25.100
Yes, over here.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.770
AUDIENCE: So if you had
to do just one thing,

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:29.210
and you were stuck
between forced

00:53:29.210 --> 00:53:31.370
to get up too early
for a long commute,

00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:33.860
forced to stay up too late just
to keep on top of the house

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:37.392
and help the kids with homework,
not a lot of options of change

00:53:37.392 --> 00:53:39.350
schedules, so it's really
overconstrained like,

00:53:39.350 --> 00:53:41.870
I think, many of us,
what's one first thing you

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:44.352
do to make it better?

00:53:44.352 --> 00:53:46.310
MICHAEL BREUS: I would
keep your sleep schedule

00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:48.554
the same on the weekends
as during the week,

00:53:48.554 --> 00:53:49.470
because what ends up--

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:52.356
so you're crunched from
both ends is what you're--

00:53:52.356 --> 00:53:54.230
the description that
you're giving me is I've

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.070
got to stay up late
to get stuff done,

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.320
and then I got to get
up early, because I've

00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:58.640
got a decent sized commute.

00:53:58.640 --> 00:53:59.750
So you've got this here.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.640
So lots of people
in that scenario

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.349
try to catch up on
sleep on the weekends,

00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:04.764
and what ends up
happening is they

00:54:04.764 --> 00:54:07.070
actually shift their circadian
clock and make it worse.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:09.410
So I'd rather you keep your
schedule as consistent.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:11.874
So if you wake up at, let's
say, 6:30 during the week,

00:54:11.874 --> 00:54:13.790
I'd ask you to wake up
at 6:30 on the weekends

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:16.730
as well, which I know
is not a popular idea.

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:19.430
But what you'll find is you
can fall asleep more quickly,

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.500
and you'll be able to
get into deeper sleep

00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.710
faster and stay there
longer the more consistent

00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:25.724
your sleep schedule is.

00:54:25.724 --> 00:54:27.140
So that would be
the first thing I

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:31.070
would say is keep your bedtime
and wake time consistent.

00:54:31.070 --> 00:54:33.500
The other thing I would do is
look at your coffee intake,

00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:35.520
and see if you can
tweak that a little bit,

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.020
because if you've got a commute,
and you're riding a vehicle

00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:40.550
or something like that, maybe
carpooling might be better,

00:54:40.550 --> 00:54:42.470
because your reaction
time is definitely

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:44.360
going to be slower, for sure.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.996
AUDIENCE: My
question, though, is

00:54:45.996 --> 00:54:47.870
what's the effect size
here on some of these?

00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:50.125
You're seeing better,
and I basically

00:54:50.125 --> 00:54:52.250
want to know how much better
my sex is going to be.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.300
MICHAEL BREUS: OK, so you
wonder how much better

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:53.990
your sex is going to be.

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.200
So that's a great question.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:59.330
So it really looks more at
does-- so in sex in particular,

00:54:59.330 --> 00:55:00.620
it's looking more at desire.

00:55:00.620 --> 00:55:02.030
And so when is desire around?

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:05.135
And so it's hard to
quantify exactly,

00:55:05.135 --> 00:55:07.010
but here's one of the
things I can tell you--

00:55:07.010 --> 00:55:09.380
and it's great that you
chose sex in particular--

00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:11.720
is we know that a
preponderance of men

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:13.910
wake up with an erection.

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:15.620
And so if that's
the case, clearly

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.960
mother nature is
saying, this is the time

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:20.487
that you need to be doing
this particular activity.

00:55:20.487 --> 00:55:22.820
So what I would say is I'm
going to actually put it back

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:24.861
on to you, and so what
I'm going to ask you to do

00:55:24.861 --> 00:55:26.870
is I want you to run
the experiment for me,

00:55:26.870 --> 00:55:30.202
and then let us know if it's
increased your sex life any

00:55:30.202 --> 00:55:31.910
more or less, and
we'll see what happens.

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:34.757
But right now, the
data isn't that clear.

00:55:34.757 --> 00:55:37.340
But when we look at these things
and we say things are better,

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:38.960
what we're finding
is anecdotally,

00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.610
a tremendous number
of people are--

00:55:40.610 --> 00:55:44.430
I get hundreds of emails
of people saying, holy cow,

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:46.340
this really is interesting.

00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:48.530
And I don't want people to
change their whole lives.

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:51.380
I want them to get their sleep
schedule down, and then just

00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.607
pick one thing from the book.

00:55:52.607 --> 00:55:54.440
There are literally 50
different activities.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.080
Most people look at
the sex part first,

00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.360
but if that's what you
want to do, go for it.

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:01.100
But you'll be surprised
at-- it absolutely

00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:02.875
is incrementally better.

00:56:02.875 --> 00:56:05.000
AUDIENCE: What is your
opinion on polyphasic sleep,

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.580
and how does it differ
from adaptive sleep habits?

00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:10.814
For example, habitual napping
at a set time per day.

00:56:10.814 --> 00:56:12.230
MICHAEL BREUS: So
for those of you

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:14.354
out there that don't know
what polyphasic sleep is,

00:56:14.354 --> 00:56:16.880
so this is an idea, where
you can get your eight

00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.931
hours in about four and 1/2.

00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:20.180
So everybody's ears perked up.

00:56:20.180 --> 00:56:21.420
Oh, how do I do that?

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:24.620
So what you end up doing is you
have a core amount of sleep,

00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.960
usually three sleep cycles,
about four and 1/2 hours.

00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:30.170
And then you take
25 to 35-minute naps

00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:32.329
at very particular times
throughout the day,

00:56:32.329 --> 00:56:34.370
and that can be the most
extreme situation, where

00:56:34.370 --> 00:56:36.050
you would actually
reduce total sleep

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.494
time by about 200 minutes.

00:56:38.494 --> 00:56:40.910
Here's the pros and the cons
of doing something like that.

00:56:40.910 --> 00:56:44.210
Yes, you do get more time,
but you don't really.

00:56:44.210 --> 00:56:45.960
So here's what goes
on is, first of all,

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.500
you're awake when almost
everybody out there is asleep.

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.960
So there's only so many things
you can do on the internet

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.751
to talk to somebody in
a different country,

00:56:52.751 --> 00:56:54.780
where you're kind of
done with that aspect.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:56.720
It turns out you
get very lonely.

00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:58.850
Also, if you have any
proclivity for depression,

00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.700
it comes out in spades,
because what you're doing

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:03.866
is you're really sleep
depriving the body.

00:57:03.866 --> 00:57:05.740
Now the body can handle
only so much of that.

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:07.406
Everybody that I've
ever worked with who

00:57:07.406 --> 00:57:09.770
wanted to do a
polyphasic sleep schedule

00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:12.140
stopped within three months,
because you can't even

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.460
do dinner and a movie.

00:57:13.460 --> 00:57:16.730
You can go out, and then
your hour and 1/2 to 3 hours

00:57:16.730 --> 00:57:19.010
is up when you have
to take your next nap.

00:57:19.010 --> 00:57:22.277
And so it really becomes
socially very difficult to do.

00:57:22.277 --> 00:57:24.610
AUDIENCE: Probably a lot of
new moms and dads out there.

00:57:24.610 --> 00:57:26.350
MICHAEL BREUS: Yes.

00:57:26.350 --> 00:57:27.610
AUDIENCE: Advice for them?

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.520
I remember something--
nap when the baby naps,

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:33.220
but what are your top three
tips for new moms and dads?

00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:36.280
MICHAEL BREUS: So new moms and
new dads-- so first of all,

00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.030
this is--

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:39.220
and it all depends
upon your baby.

00:57:39.220 --> 00:57:41.650
So we had two colicky babies.

00:57:41.650 --> 00:57:44.147
So both of my kids
had tremendous reflux

00:57:44.147 --> 00:57:45.730
to the point where
we had to have them

00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:48.820
on compounded Prilosec
to be able to keep them

00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:49.930
in a good spot.

00:57:49.930 --> 00:57:53.260
And so their sleep was
erratic until we did that.

00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:55.210
We actually did that
fairly early on,

00:57:55.210 --> 00:57:58.370
and we about got both of our
kids to sleep fairly easily.

00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:00.340
There's a great
program out there.

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:01.515
It's called Baby Wise.

00:58:01.515 --> 00:58:02.890
That's what we
used in our house,

00:58:02.890 --> 00:58:05.290
and it's an eat,
sleep, play program,

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:07.750
and it's really about the
consistency of the schedule.

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:10.750
Kids' sleep invariably
doesn't get messed up.

00:58:10.750 --> 00:58:14.260
It's their parents that don't
keep a good, strict sleep

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:14.980
schedule.

00:58:14.980 --> 00:58:18.094
So when Grandma and Grandpa's in
town, don't keep them up later.

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:20.260
If Grandma and Grandpa's
flight got in at 8 o'clock,

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:22.120
they don't get to see
the kids that night.

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:24.610
You don't keep them
up for that situation,

00:58:24.610 --> 00:58:26.890
because you end up with,
what is termed in our house,

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:28.112
a meltdown.

00:58:28.112 --> 00:58:30.070
And that's a whole lot
of no fun for everybody.

00:58:30.070 --> 00:58:32.530
So the more consistent the
schedule is, the better.

00:58:32.530 --> 00:58:33.855
That's number one.

00:58:33.855 --> 00:58:35.980
Number two, if you do have
a situation where you've

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:38.290
got a child that isn't
sleeping particularly well,

00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:41.140
you should use what I
call an on-call system.

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:44.710
So one partner has
Monday, Wednesday, Friday.

00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:48.190
The other partner has
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday.

00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:50.740
And then Sunday,
you flip a coin.

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:53.740
So if the baby is
crying, that individual

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.710
is responsible for that as
opposed to both people waking

00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:58.060
up, not getting enough sleep.

00:58:58.060 --> 00:59:00.430
So that has a tendency
to work, or if you've

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:02.855
got one person who's a lion
and one person who's a wolf,

00:59:02.855 --> 00:59:04.480
you can take different
shifts that way,

00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.880
where the lion can get up early,
and the wolf can stay up late.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.590
That has a tendency
to work as well.

00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:11.650
So it's really about managing
your time surrounding

00:59:11.650 --> 00:59:14.520
that situation, and checking out
that Baby Wise is pretty good.

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:16.180
AUDIENCE: But Tom
from the other side

00:59:16.180 --> 00:59:17.805
of Mountain View
says, how long does it

00:59:17.805 --> 00:59:20.530
take to train your body
for a new sleeping routine?

00:59:20.530 --> 00:59:22.210
MICHAEL BREUS: So
it's interesting.

00:59:22.210 --> 00:59:23.860
If it's a sleeping
routine that works

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.569
with your chronotype
and your genetics,

00:59:25.569 --> 00:59:26.860
then it doesn't take very long.

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.810
It'll adapt in usually
five to seven days.

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:30.804
If you're trying to go
against your chronotype,

00:59:30.804 --> 00:59:33.220
so let's say you're a wolf and
you're trying to be a lion,

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:35.770
it can take months to
be able to do that.

00:59:35.770 --> 00:59:37.270
And to be very
honest with you, it's

00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:39.250
not going to be
particularly successful.

00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:41.320
You really should try
to stick-- that's why

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:43.840
it's great to be a bear,
because bears kind of have it

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:46.000
in the best spot, because
they can kind of move.

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:48.416
And remember, you can be a
bear that wakes up a little bit

00:59:48.416 --> 00:59:50.495
early or a bear that stays
up a little bit late.

00:59:50.495 --> 00:59:52.120
So if you're following
your chronotype,

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.630
it's not hard to
snap back into it.

00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:55.720
But when you're going
against your chronotype,

00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.810
it can take a long time, and
it isn't necessarily very

00:59:58.810 --> 00:59:59.980
successful.

00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:01.370
Well, thank you all very much.

01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:02.880
I really enjoyed being here.

01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:06.530
[APPLAUSE]
