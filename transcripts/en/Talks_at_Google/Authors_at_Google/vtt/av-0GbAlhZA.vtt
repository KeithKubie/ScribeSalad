[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.310
SHARON ORLOPP: All right,
thank you and welcome.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.610
Please appreciate Thuhang.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.830
She's going to share
her story with us.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.325
But let's first give her a
big round of appreciation.

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:13.142
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:17.237 --> 00:00:18.820
THUHANG TRAN: I would
like to walk you

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.560
through for the
journey, the journey

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.790
that where [INAUDIBLE]
have the hope

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.460
and determination for
nonstop reinvention

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.280
from throughout my life.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.660
First thing first,
that I'm Thuhang Tran.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.400
I was lucky that
[INAUDIBLE] to Sharon,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.020
and that's how the story
coming to you today.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.960
So, this is the
journey that have been

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.440
go through for till I was born.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.920
And when I struck for
the polio and also, I

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.670
mean, during the Vietnam,
the Saigon fall in 1975.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.850
The first thing is,
infusion of hope.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.240
So, hope is the only way that
build up and be with me when

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.210
I was--

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.130
at least in my memories have
been formed and remember.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.300
So, I was born as a normal
child, run and walking.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.180
And then by the time I am
two and a half years old,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.377
I got contracted with polio.

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:25.960
And later on when I
came to the state,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.340
the doctor diagnosis
as a post polio.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.860
So, that is the
time that when I was

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.590
born as the the time of
during the Vietnam War as well

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.410
is hidden time.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.950
But during the time when I got--

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.320
my parents found out that I had
polio, and they very frustrated

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.390
and also devastated.

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.140
So my dad had been searching
and seeking for all my treatment

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.760
for myself.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.190
Like, been through acupuncture
and also like electronic shock

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.920
to make to activate
their nerves,

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.870
that maybe can help me to walk.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.785
But after so many attempts
with some different kind

00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:14.850
of treatment, I'm paralyzed
from the waist down.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.560
And, to further to get, at
least have something for myself,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.390
so my dad did further research.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.110
So finally he found out
there's another program that

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.230
can help children
had polio can come

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.910
to Germany to get treatment.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.410
So I got approval,
the paperwork,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.840
for to go to Germany by myself
as a five-year-old child,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.890
and to get treatments to surgery
and then physical therapy

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.480
so I can walk normally.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.240
And the paperwork is approval
for, I think June 1975.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.370
So with that, my mom and myself
as [INAUDIBLE],, because I'm

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.745
excited that I got the new
clothes with the luggage so

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.620
I can be travel, because
I didn't know that I

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.060
would be travel by myself.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.340
However, I just excited I got
new clothes and travel, right?

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.760
I never-- I couldn't imagine
that I would travel by myself.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.050
So, it's the hope that
I will be got treatment

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.060
and can be walk
normal again, have

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.970
been turned upside down
when the fall of Saigon

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.760
come in April 30, 1975.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.320
So I think in the
video that we say

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.250
that's just the test moment for
all of South Vietnamese people

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.120
because that the communists
took over the South.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.180
So when during that time my
dad has been based further

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.640
from the house, because we
lived in city, Saigon city.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.990
And my medic was based at
[INAUDIBLE] Air Force Base.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.650
And we lost contact
after two days.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.870
And then when we
heard, because we

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.450
live very close to the
[VIETNAMESE] Airport,

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.780
so there's a lot of
bombing an artillery,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.087
all the shadows over our roof.

00:04:05.087 --> 00:04:06.170
And it just get like that.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.390
And all the neighbor
having us to dig it

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.250
up the bunker, temporary
bunker, by our kitchen floor.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.640
So, we live in the
bunker for about two,

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.050
three days with a very limited
food and run out water,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.320
and it's very hot and humid.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.540
And I was like, at
that time I just

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.060
didn't know what's going on.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.320
And my brother and
sister was tired

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.910
and my young uncle was scare.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.690
And one time I remember that,
because it's so hot so we all

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.350
decided to just get up and then
just stay in the living room.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.110
Then when we heard
the siren went off,

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.600
then we all jumped-- my brother,
sister, and everyone jump,

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.100
right?

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.410
My mom couldn't got
me down to the bunker.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.020
She just throw me to my uncle
and my brother, catch me!

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.230
So those are the
moment that just

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.270
stuck engraved to my memory.

00:05:02.167 --> 00:05:07.470
Then April 30, the
North Vietnamese army

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.970
took over the south.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:13.350
And they changed all the names
name-- all the city names--

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.690
completely.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.880
Even alleys-- in Asia,
especially Vietnam-- we

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.300
have a lot of small
alleys-- we have it.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.500
Residents live there.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.230
So they and every
single street-- alley--

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.880
to honor the North
Vietnamese leader.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.620
So with that, then
they order all of us--

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.010
everyone who have a relative
that's working for South Army

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.570
Vietnam--

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:43.360
to burn all the paperwork
or pictures related to them.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:49.900
So I was secretly hiding some
of the pictures of my dad

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.570
and some of the paperwork
related to him--

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.970
and just hide it in some of
the dirt around the bunker.

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.820
And then of course, my mom
burned all other paperwork

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.180
related to my dad.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.940
And a few months later, we
found out, from my dear friend,

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.500
that he witnessed that my
dad's helicopter crashed

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.980
into the [INAUDIBLE] River.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:22.550
And his luggage just bounced
out from the helicopter.

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.590
So he took back to us
with his belongings.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:31.070
And of course, it's
the war-- right?

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.750
There's a lot of other
people-- lost their relative,

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:38.250
their loved one, and maybe
lost contact completely.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:40.340
So we accepted with that.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.402
And more on, we had the funeral,
without his body, for him.

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:54.210
So when I sat in the church,
I'd look at his picture.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:07:01.320
And I said, without his body,
maybe God just lets him-- maybe

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.240
he's somewhere else.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.270
So that hope infused
me during that time

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.100
that I believed that my
dad lived somewhere else--

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.990
he not die.

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:16.500
So at his funeral-- because
Vietnamese tradition--

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:23.760
we wear a white band
right [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.180
to mourn him for three years.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.970
And we move on with our lives.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.130
And the communists,
of course, took

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:36.600
over a lot of people houses,
and people became homeless just

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.950
over the night.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.020
They live under the bridge.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.570
And they force people--

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:44.565
woman, children-- to the famine.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:52.390
Most likely, those famine
areas was a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:55.840
So that a lot of people
lost their arms, legs,

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.630
because there were the mines--

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.810
had been blown up.

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:12.080
And like any other child,
we ate rotten food,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.220
was being hungry for many days.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:19.510
And I got malnutrition badly.

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:21.850
So my stomach lay
bloated all the time,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:23.800
because of the rotten food.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.500
And it's pain all the time.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.570
So whenever it's
pain, my grandma

00:08:28.570 --> 00:08:34.549
had to tap on my stomach
to have it calm down.

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:37.179
So when I mention my grandma--

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:38.809
that is the picture
in the middle.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:39.669
That's my grandma.

00:08:39.669 --> 00:08:43.510
She wears a traditional
dress right there.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:46.210
So because my mom and
my brother and sister

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:48.250
have been forced to
go to the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:51.460
Because I'm the youngest
and I was handicapped,

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.520
I stayed with my
grandma and my aunt.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.830
During that time that I saw
my grandma and my aunt--

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.310
they're really sad.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:09.420
So I determine-- how I can be
happy and be surviving more?

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.630
That way, I can help
my grandma and my aunt

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:16.480
to go through the tough
times, because they

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.330
been through the difficult
time as myself as well.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.610
So I tried to be positive.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.940
That's what hope
continued to help

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.300
me go through those struggles.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:32.730
And I just see the picture there
that I'm a skinny girl with--

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.150
at that time, I think, I was
7 or 8 or something like that.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:41.770
And when I start school,
after a few months,

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.650
my mom couldn't harvest
anything from the farming,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:48.680
because the government
didn't assist anything.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:52.180
My mom did the
farming by bare hands

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.040
and with the help
of the neighbor.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:59.420
So I remember one time that
I've been hungry so many days.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:04.420
And my mom brought back
the bag of corn on the cob.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:11.300
And I kept eating corn on the
cob for I don't know how many--

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.520
until I became sick.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.350
And after that, corn's
still my go-to food.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.850
And I still love it till now.

00:10:19.850 --> 00:10:21.350
But the rest of the
other food, I've

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.660
just never touched it again.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.730
And because my mom didn't
have money or anything

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:32.510
to have the soil or
fertilize-- so she

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:36.370
decided to took my brother
and sister back to the city.

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:40.720
And my house-- very small, with
three families living there.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:45.968
Actually, two families-- my aunt
and her two twin sons, my mom,

00:10:45.968 --> 00:10:48.010
my brother and sister,
and myself and my grandma.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.180
So it's very tiny.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:54.250
And we just sleep every corner
that the house allowed to.

00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:59.740
So my mom had do all kinds
job to survive and make sure

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.280
bring food to raising us
and my brother and sister,

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.570
even though they are
teenagers at that time--

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.260
but still working
to help my mom.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:13.090
And everyday, in the
afternoon, when I saw

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:19.570
the neighbor kid went
home after the school.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.693
And I just say, oh my gosh!

00:11:21.693 --> 00:11:22.610
What's going on there?

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:27.140
They're so happy and
lively and have fun.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.510
So I begging my mom--

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.340
Mom, I want to go to school.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:36.010
And my mom, because she didn't
want me to been through all

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.950
the teasing, the
bullying from the kids--

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:44.820
because during that
time the government--

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.110
or the people in general--

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:52.740
saw handicapped people
as useless human beings.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.910
The handicapped people
is like a burden--

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:59.610
burden to the society,
burden to their own family,

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:02.580
burden to the people
surrounding them.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:07.300
So after [INAUDIBLE] that
I wanted to make sure

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:12.520
my mom at least feels secure
that I can be OK with school.

00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.570
So I start school
very late age--

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:17.600
8 or something like that.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:20.440
And after a few
months, my teacher

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.410
helping me to start first grade.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:32.330
So because of the mindset from
the people and government--

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.770
the school didn't have--
the communist government

00:12:34.770 --> 00:12:39.240
didn't assist
handicapped people--

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.430
encourage them to go to school.

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:45.750
So the school didn't have
any ramps or accessibility

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.310
for the handicapped people.

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:49.310
It's all stairs.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:54.710
So when I was little, my mom
carried me on her back upstairs

00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:55.830
to the third floor--

00:12:55.830 --> 00:12:58.470
carried me down,
everyday like that.

00:12:58.470 --> 00:13:02.270
And when I get older,
a little bigger,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.190
and I got heavier for sure--

00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:06.590
so I didn't want my
mom have to do that.

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:09.080
So I had to reinvent myself--

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.300
how I can manage around.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.730
When I was little, I crawled.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:16.580
So my arm was my leg.

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.470
And my legs dragging
on the floor.

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:23.500
So all my trousers have
the holes in my knees.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.600
So my mom kept patching
different type animals

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.140
to make it fun for me.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.860
So when I at school,
at that time,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:34.640
I reinvented-- a found a way
how I can manage around myself.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.790
So I sat up and used my
hands to move my knee.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.390
But I sat at the down level.

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.390
When it came to the
state, the doctor

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.440
observed me moving
around like that.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.170
And he called it duck walking.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:52.170
So that's what I squatting
for years I went to school--

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:55.860
climb up stairs and come
stairs like that every day.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.170
And so I did the school.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:03.230
And not because of that
would be prevented me to

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:04.580
don't have fun--

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.010
don't have fun or hang
out with my friends.

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:08.360
So that's what I--

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.830
when I get home, I played
with my neighbor kids--

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.790
all kind of games
that they have.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.380
And I just squatting like that--

00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:16.970
just have fun with them.

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:21.380
At same time at
school, one time, I

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.550
figured out a way how I can
slide down to save time,

00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:32.180
So usually, at school, they
have built the handrail

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.330
around the stairway.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.400
So one time, I just
asked one of my friends--

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:41.970
because that friend helped me
carry my bag everyday upstairs

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.800
and downstairs.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.010
So I just created
some kind of fun.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.150
I said, let's do
some sort of fun.

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:49.670
And we just slide
down like that.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.470
One day, I slide down.

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:56.150
And then by the time we hit the
basement of the first floor--

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.460
and there, the
principal stood there.

00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.770
And she looked at me and
said, you're in trouble.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:04.460
So she called my
mom to the office.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:08.390
And all my mom got is
blaming that my mom didn't

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:12.750
know how to raise
me, because I'm not

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.150
supposed to do that at school.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:22.910
So I promised my mom
that I will be good.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:28.810
I don't want my mom to be
insulted from the school

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.310
principal or anyone.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.990
Because I sat there.

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.950
I heard them just insult my mom.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:39.640
So again, with that,
when I get home,

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.560
I said, no, I have
to excel at school.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.900
I have to be good.

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.970
So that's where I can show
people that with education, I

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.740
will have better life.

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.560
So that's what I did--

00:15:53.560 --> 00:16:00.750
so five years later, there
was a big life change for us.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:06.330
One day, my uncle with one
gentleman came to our house

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:12.940
and say that my
father was alive.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:16.950
And he lived in
San Antonio, Texas.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.220
I was like exciting and crying.

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:22.130
And at that time, my mom--

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:23.370
her business getting better.

00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:26.900
So she's selling rice, pen
by pen, back to the people,

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:29.120
so that means she
can gain some money

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.800
and then can raise us right.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:33.350
So I asked the neighbor
to come to the market

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:37.740
to make sure that my mom
and my sister come home.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:40.190
And by the time my mom
and my sister get home

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.690
and we all cry happy--

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:45.620
and the whole neighborhood
very happy that my dad is still

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.370
alive at that time.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:52.810
And then, because of the
control of the government--

00:16:52.810 --> 00:16:54.090
the communists--

00:16:54.090 --> 00:17:02.420
every single letter that we
wrote to our dad and our dad

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.819
wrote to us-- it
took six months,

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:09.760
because every single letter had
to be opened and inspected--

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.599
make sure that there's
no word or anything

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.290
against the government.

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:21.660
However, my dad very happy
that he found us and locate us.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:26.010
And then he asked-- the second
letter that he sent to us--

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:31.230
asking us to send him picture
and birth certificate.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.970
And at that time, my mom said,
we didn't have any pictures.

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:37.650
That's when I said, Mom, no.

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:39.030
We have some.

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:41.850
So my mom said,
where'd you get it?

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:43.770
I said-- the picture--

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:44.800
I didn't listen to you.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.035
I already hidden them.

00:17:46.035 --> 00:17:47.910
So she said, oh, my god!--

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:48.690
all these years!

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:49.560
I said, yes, Mom.

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:52.470
So that's what those-- at least
pictures, because at that time

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.790
I didn't want to forget my dad.

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:59.340
I didn't want to lose
his image or his picture.

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:03.180
Because at that time, we
thought that he's already died.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:10.130
So the length of the paper
process took forever--

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:12.180
took for forever.

00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.570
We separate for 15 years.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:20.980
And then we filed that
the paper about 10 years.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:25.110
So during the time that
we waiting for the paper

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:26.550
that we can come to the State--

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:31.860
so at that time, between the US
and the Vietnamese government--

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:34.930
there is very still--

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:36.830
intense, even though
they have a program

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:38.830
they call ODP, if you
heard about those.

00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:42.220
That means Operation
Departure Program--

00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:45.970
that they allow for
all the servicemen who

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:47.920
worked with the
previous government

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.150
can come sponsor their
family to the United States.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.930
And between 1980--
that was the time--

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:57.920
1980.

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:03.710
So between 1980 to 1989, because
of the length of the process,

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:09.320
we didn't know if we
could reunite with my dad.

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.660
So my brother escaped
the country by boat.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:16.020
So probably, you can
have friends and people--

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.720
the Vietnamese people-- if they
say, I escaped the country.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.740
I came here by boat people,
that's what happened.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.390
And this was also a
very darkest moment

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:29.400
for the Vietnamese
people as well.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.940
Because a lot of people
has been escaped by boat.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.700
And they sacrificed their life.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.400
They didn't know if they can
come to the United States.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.690
Some of them die in the ocean,
but just because of the hope

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.060
that, someday, they
can find freedom.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.770
So that's what--
during that time.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:51.950
And back to--
finally, we continue

00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:53.570
to move on with our
lives, because we

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.330
didn't know that we were going
to be see our dad, right?

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.460
And after three attempts--

00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.530
my brother-- two attempts
to escape the country

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.130
by boat-- my brother got
caught into a prison.

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:07.750
And my father had to
send some money back

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:09.640
through the black market.

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:13.060
Because at that time,
there's no relation

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:14.920
between US and
Vietnamese government.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.470
So my father had sent money
through the black market,

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:20.380
so people can find a
way to get us the money.

00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:25.930
My mom used those money to pay
for the expense for my brother

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:33.300
to escape the country and, also,
to bribe the policeman that can

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.090
release my brother from prison.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.930
So after three attempts
that didn't succeed,

00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:45.570
we moved on with our
life by do all kinds job.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.670
And during that
time, I just again

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.880
reinvent myself-- how
I can learn a new skill

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.470
and to survive as well.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.460
So I learn different
things-- do different jobs.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.820
I have done all kinds of
jobs, like sit there--

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.360
do embroidery for the
clothes and, also,

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:09.900
even making the car tire--

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:16.170
that's what I sit there, do one
string at a time on the rubber.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.810
So one time, my hand just
bleeding and calloused,

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:21.780
because of that.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.518
And--

00:21:22.518 --> 00:21:24.310
SHARON ORLOPP: We need
to switch to the US.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.630
THUHANG TRAN: Yes.

00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:25.840
SHARON ORLOPP: We're
running low on time.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.060
THUHANG TRAN: So with that--

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:31.770
1989-- I think it's summer time.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:34.430
Can you go to the next slide?

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:38.570
We received the
letter at US embassy.

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:41.480
It say, congratulation.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.310
Now, you come to
have an interview.

00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:45.710
And you can come to
the United States.

00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:49.390
So my life changed.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.020
And my family's life changed
again, one more time.

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:56.050
And the new life in the US--

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:57.320
it was a first.

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.280
It was a happy ever after.

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:03.690
Because after 15
years-- we separated--

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:07.840
we was able to
unite with my dad.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.820
However, this was challenging--

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:15.190
culture shock--
completely at first.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.690
And because we lived
apart for 15 years,

00:22:19.690 --> 00:22:23.880
there's a lot of differences
in our thoughts, in our minds,

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.920
and even how we communicate--

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:31.560
differences between
my mom and my father.

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.740
My mom think or act in East.

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.980
My dad think or
act in a West way.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:45.220
So they are completely opposite.

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.110
Same for us as well--

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.500
language-- completely
new language.

00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.990
And we struggle with that--
struggle in our own family

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:58.090
with our life, struggle
with the culture shock,

00:22:58.090 --> 00:23:02.290
and also facing with
the language barrier.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:08.062
And then at the same time, my
dad had bought health insurance

00:23:08.062 --> 00:23:10.520
for me, that mean prepare for
me when I come to the States,

00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.590
so I can have surgery.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.840
So that's what, in
the fall, happened--

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:21.010
the winter of 1989, I had
a surgery for my knee.

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:28.090
I spent two years for
physical therapy intensively--

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:34.480
learned how to walk again and
learned ESL at the same time.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.380
The first time ever I stood
up from the ground level

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.370
to the level that I can stand--

00:23:44.370 --> 00:23:45.900
I could stand--

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:49.050
I could feel that there's
some chemical in my brain--

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:51.940
changed--

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:53.530
changed completely.

00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:57.750
Because of I was in the
ground level for so long.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:24:03.870
And I could see the expression
from my mom and my dad.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.220
They was crying.

00:24:05.220 --> 00:24:07.380
But they happy.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:14.910
And because of one
income, my father had--

00:24:14.910 --> 00:24:17.430
he signed a paper
that he guarantee

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:21.450
that, when his sponsor the
family to the United States,

00:24:21.450 --> 00:24:26.410
he will guarantee that he cover
for all the expense for us.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:34.330
We won't get any assist from the
government or any kind program

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:36.770
that the government provides.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.300
So my brother and my sister--

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.460
working to help him out.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:44.860
And I, during the
time of two years--

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.070
physical therapy and then
went to school at night

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.880
with my sister.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.160
After work, she came
home and picked me up.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:57.180
And both of us learning ESL,
English as a Second Language.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:04.130
And technology-- technology
came to me at first because--

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:09.740
the first time I saw my dad
put the computer hardware--

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.350
he built a computer
from scratch.

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.870
At that moment--
that inspired me.

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.220
That's completely ooh and ahh!

00:25:18.220 --> 00:25:18.845
At that moment.

00:25:18.845 --> 00:25:21.650
I said, how you put the
hardware piece together--

00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:25.950
it becomes that
computer workstation?

00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:31.940
So when I finished my
ESL, I took the class

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:35.560
as an electrical engineer.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.580
So I enrolled the
first semester.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.700
And after one semester,
I said, oh my god--

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:45.800
how the circuits can
put together like this!

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.710
And I feel like, I
don't think that's me.

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:50.710
Because I feel, at that
time-- so dry to me.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:53.190
I want something creative way.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:55.350
And I share that with my dad.

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:58.020
And he said, well,
if you not so sure,

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.520
why don't you just
go to your school

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.405
and talk with the counselor?

00:26:01.405 --> 00:26:02.280
That's what happened.

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.890
When I talked to the counselor,
the counselor said, get me

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:08.370
the catalog with
all the computers.

00:26:08.370 --> 00:26:12.630
And at that time, I really
liked to become a computer

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:14.850
graphic design, because I
want to create something

00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.680
very creative way.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:21.600
Unfortunately, because we didn't
have enough money for my dad

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.900
to send me to UT Austin--

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:29.200
that's where they offered
computer graphic design.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:35.330
So I end up studied computer
science as my major,

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:39.890
because I drove
every day one hour.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:42.560
I got out the house
6:00 AM in the morning

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.500
and didn't get home until,
like, 10:00, 11:00 PM,

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.680
because I spent the
whole time at school

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.530
and worked there
as part-time job.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.220
And that's what I keep joking.

00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.390
I say-- and I
[INAUDIBLE] as well.

00:26:56.390 --> 00:27:00.730
I say, ramen noodles
is my best friend.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.530
So that's what-- I
ate that in library--

00:27:03.530 --> 00:27:04.850
anywhere.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:09.670
But it's a great
investment for education.

00:27:09.670 --> 00:27:12.890
Because like I mentioned
earlier, with me, when

00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:15.950
I was little, to
be better, i always

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:18.560
find out that
education will lead us

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:24.470
to different type
opportunities-- opportunities

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:26.850
and a better life.

00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:29.990
So being said that, I would
like to share with you just

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:33.080
a high-level-- key
level-- here's what,

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.920
throughout my life and
throughout my professional

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.940
career--

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.150
these are the three
things that, maybe, I hope

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:45.500
that you can take away for you.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:49.340
Embrace change with
the survival mindset.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.930
So through my life--

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:59.200
through the war,
poverty, and then

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.280
crawling on the ground
and then sit up and then

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.520
after stand up
after my surgery--

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.590
I always have to be
that way to survive.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:16.220
Had to survive that-- and then
you don't have to do much.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:21.600
Just think about different
perspectives in life.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:27.290
Reinvent-- most likely, I think,
in our professional world--

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.750
we can say, problem solving.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.850
People love to
solve the problem.

00:28:33.850 --> 00:28:37.060
But it's not like
rocket science.

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.600
It just happens to your
day-to-day activities and even

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.980
at work as well--

00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:44.080
how you're facing with--

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.780
interfacing with people,
with your co-workers,

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:50.410
and when the
production issues come.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:51.483
What is the problem?

00:28:51.483 --> 00:28:52.150
How to solve it?

00:28:52.150 --> 00:28:53.650
Good calls-- right.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:59.740
So that-- our activity--
day-to-day activities--

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:06.070
and seeing we are [INAUDIBLE]
and working in professional

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:11.260
world, throughout the years--

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:15.330
and I was lucky that I
had the great mentor, just

00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.430
like [INAUDIBLE]
and Sharon here.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.190
And now Sharon have been--

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.710
that is-- I believe in fate.

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:23.330
It just happened.

00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:27.930
It's just been in the fate that
I met Sharon and we partnered

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:29.630
to wrote the book.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:31.430
And that's what this is.

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:34.340
I said, establish your identity.

00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:37.520
How do you especially
focus on your strength?

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.360
And it took me a while
for me to figure out

00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.840
how I can excel at work
and what I will be good at.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.010
That's through the session
that I had with my mentor.

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.670
They helped me.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:52.250
They say, well, you're
good at technical.

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.220
Why don't you just stay
in technical software

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.860
and then build up from there?

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.450
That's what I built
up over the years.

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:03.690
And here I come today.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:07.120
And thus I learned.

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.020
And like I shared with
Angelo this morning,

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:11.270
every single where I go--

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:14.550
even this event--
I learned a lot--

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:15.740
how people interact?

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:19.730
And learn-- how do
people organize things?

00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:24.590
So thank you so
much for your time.

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:27.890
And thank you so much for
listening to the story.

00:30:27.890 --> 00:30:31.580
And I hope that you
enjoy reading the story.

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:34.850
And maybe it can relate
to some sort of--

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.630
whenever you struggle
or have a bad day

00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:41.800
or you hit the rock bottom,
just thing about that it will be

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.860
hope always--

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.670
infusing hope and full of hope.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:49.460
And someday, it will get better.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.585
SHARON ORLOPP: All right,
let's appreciate Thuhang.

00:30:51.585 --> 00:30:52.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.530
MODERATOR: We can take
about five or so minutes

00:30:57.530 --> 00:31:00.350
to answer any questions
from the audience.

00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:01.370
It's a great book--

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:03.030
incredibly inspiring.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:06.050
When you wrote it,
it was very intimate.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.390
You had to reveal a
lot about your family.

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:12.052
How does your dad and your
family feel about the book?

00:31:12.052 --> 00:31:16.453
THUHANG TRAN: At first,
especially my dad--

00:31:16.453 --> 00:31:19.070
he was reluctant.

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:24.615
He was reluctant that he didn't
want to start writing the book.

00:31:24.615 --> 00:31:30.820
The reason why-- most
likely, this reminded him

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.560
with all the bad memories.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:37.490
He saw a lot of his
friends during the war die.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:41.120
And it's so painful.

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:44.980
And this happened to me too--
because a lot of emotion.

00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.270
Even now, when I say
about it, I still

00:31:47.270 --> 00:31:49.550
carry those emotions with me.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:54.320
But when Sharon talked to me
about it and that I should--

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.220
I talked to him a few days.

00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.590
But we have to face it
somehow, one way or the other.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.050
We have to let it out.

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:04.060
And after that, he
agreed that, OK,

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:05.500
we can write a story about it.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:09.192
That's when Sharon came
to Bentonville, Arkansas.

00:32:09.192 --> 00:32:10.900
And she sat down and
interviewed with us.

00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:13.670
So that's why we overcome it.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:15.510
And my mom and my
brother and sister--

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.150
they said, excited about it.

00:32:17.150 --> 00:32:23.770
They're really happy that
their story and our story

00:32:23.770 --> 00:32:27.550
just come to light and at
least share with everyone,

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:32.170
that's how we've been through,
especially after the Vietnam

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:33.190
War.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.930
And there wasn't a lot
of people outside Vietnam

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:41.560
know about what the
life and how we lived

00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.980
under the communist rules--

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.235
how we facing those.

00:32:46.235 --> 00:32:47.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you
so much for sharing

00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:49.900
your very inspiring story.

00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:51.880
I wanted to ask you,
what would your message

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.750
be today for people who now
live under oppressive regimes,

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:57.340
like the Viet Cong?

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:00.760
How would you instill
hope within them

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.810
that, someday,
things could change

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:05.770
and they may have a happy life?

00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:09.190
THUHANG TRAN: That's
a great question.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.520
Again, you mentioned the hope--

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:15.190
and I hope that whoever--

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:19.810
they still live under
communism, not only Vietnam,

00:33:19.810 --> 00:33:22.750
but other countries as well--

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:29.310
they need to continue
to have a purpose--

00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:33.930
their life purpose, not give up.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:38.760
Even though that is under
communism country or any other

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:42.660
government, you need to
have a focus and find out,

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:50.570
what is the meaning of their
life and how they can make

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:54.550
small acts-- can
impact other people--

00:33:54.550 --> 00:34:00.210
and don't lose hope or
lose our focus on that--

00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:01.530
always seeking for a purpose.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.980
MODERATOR: OK,
and now we'll move

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.110
to the second part of the talk.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:08.610
Sharon--

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:09.280
SHARON ORLOPP:
All right-- great.

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:09.403
MODERATOR: Thank you.

00:34:09.403 --> 00:34:09.710
Thank you very much.

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:10.480
SHARON ORLOPP: Let's appreciate
Thuhang one more time.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.110
THUHANG TRAN: Thank you so much.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:12.152
SHARON ORLOPP: Thank you.

00:34:12.152 --> 00:34:13.560
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:15.998 --> 00:34:17.040
All right-- good morning.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:17.670
Good afternoon.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.906
Thank you for coming and
hearing Thuhang's story.

00:34:19.906 --> 00:34:21.739
I just want to spend a
few minutes with you,

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.610
talking about the
power of storytelling.

00:34:24.610 --> 00:34:27.380
Because stories connect us.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.679
They create that burning
desire to learn about others.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.570
And every single one
of us have a story.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:35.570
A lot of times, we make
assumptions about people

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:37.370
when we meet and see them.

00:34:37.370 --> 00:34:42.310
And human beings have that story
that create that connection.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:45.860
And so learning that
story is powerful currency

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.310
for understanding each other
and creating that inspiration

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.630
and getting that hope--

00:34:50.630 --> 00:34:53.250
and understanding the
resilience of human beings.

00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:56.010
So I'm just going to share
with you my personal story.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:59.780
My parents were married
at the tender age of 19.

00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:02.720
And I often say that the path
to the Chief Diversity Officer

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.480
role at Walmart started
long before I was born.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.750
It started with my parents and
what their lives were like.

00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:12.690
So much to the disappointment
of both sets of my grandparents,

00:35:12.690 --> 00:35:14.520
my parents decide
to get married.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.910
They were from very different
religious backgrounds

00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:19.730
and very different
socioeconomic backgrounds.

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:24.020
And so, as I grew up, I listened
to very negative comments

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.050
when we'd get together
with our relatives.

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:30.740
My family on my father's
side were very disappointed

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.960
that my father chose my mother.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.330
My mother's side-- they
thought my father's family

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:36.980
was arrogant and out of touch.

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.870
So we always heard
these negative things.

00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:39.980
And I don't know
about your family,

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.330
but when our family'd
get together,

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:43.872
they'd just tell it the way it
is, regardless of how negative

00:35:43.872 --> 00:35:45.230
it was or bad.

00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:49.730
So my parents made a very
purposeful parenting decision

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.370
to move away from
relatives, because they

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:55.580
wanted to stop that negative
stereotypes of comments

00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.387
that occurred.

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:58.220
So I grew up believing
that you should never

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.690
live near your relatives.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:01.850
So we moved thousands
of miles away.

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:04.640
And we only saw them
because we had to see them.

00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.650
But that experience
with my parents

00:36:06.650 --> 00:36:10.550
made them very strong advocates
of the Civil Rights movement

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:12.170
and the Women's Rights movement.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.940
So they made another
parenting decision.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.990
When I was 12 years
old, they moved us

00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:17.990
to a neighborhood that
was predominantly African

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:19.645
American and Hispanic.

00:36:19.645 --> 00:36:21.020
So we moved to
this neighborhood.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:22.670
And we were not welcome.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.860
So we had our yard set on fire.

00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:27.110
Our home was vandalized
several times.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.300
My parents owned a small
landscaping business

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.130
that was also vandalized.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.870
But I was never afraid.

00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:34.480
I was 12 years old.

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:36.420
And I just wanted
to make friends.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:38.045
I wanted to know,
who am I going to sit

00:36:38.045 --> 00:36:41.130
with on the school bus every
single day when I go to school?

00:36:41.130 --> 00:36:44.570
And so our family lived in
that neighborhood for 30 years.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:48.380
And what it taught me is that
we're all more similar than we

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.740
are different.

00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.690
We all want to be respected.

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.220
We want to be included.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:55.410
And we want to be valued.

00:36:55.410 --> 00:36:59.570
And so that created in me
this core belief that we all

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.720
deserve respect and inclusion.

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.290
And that's what led
me to all my work

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:04.620
in diversity and inclusion.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.300
But it started with my parents
and what they did for me.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.010
We're going talk a
little bit about why

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:11.630
stories are so important.

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:14.140
And some of it is because
they're so memorable.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.730
We'll go to the next slide.

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:17.480
You're always going
to remember the story.

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.580
You may not remember
the data or the facts.

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.840
But you're going to
remember those stories that

00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.465
stick with you.

00:37:21.465 --> 00:37:23.400
A lot of things that
Thuhang shared today,

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:25.567
you're going to go home and
share with other people,

00:37:25.567 --> 00:37:27.190
because it really
reminds you of that.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:29.720
And when you think
about things at work

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.760
and you're presenting
pitches or ideas

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.480
or thinking about-- how do
you put it in a story format

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:37.130
that people remember?

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.140
And I know, Google's
big on data.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:39.927
I know that.

00:37:39.927 --> 00:37:41.510
Math and science are
really important.

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:42.780
Logic's important.

00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.530
But there's also that
emotional content.

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:48.540
And stories are
emotion in motion.

00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:50.000
So how do you link
a story to what

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.790
you're trying to sell at work
and make it more understandable

00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:53.700
and more relatable?

00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.695
I think it's important, because
stories touch the heart.

00:37:56.695 --> 00:37:58.070
And when you touch
the heart, you

00:37:58.070 --> 00:37:59.480
change the way people think.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.185
And you change the behaviors.

00:38:01.185 --> 00:38:02.310
So we'll go the next slide.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.110
And it talks about the
different types of stories.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:05.943
So when you're telling
stories, particularly

00:38:05.943 --> 00:38:08.732
at work or at events, there's
a couple of different genres.

00:38:08.732 --> 00:38:10.940
And you'll hear leaders that
share them this way too.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:13.255
So one of the main
stories is who am I?

00:38:13.255 --> 00:38:14.630
So when there's
a new leader that

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.920
comes to a group,
a lot of times,

00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:18.110
you'll hear who they are,
what's important to them,

00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:19.700
life experiences
that they've had.

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:21.990
Or they may talk
about why I'm here.

00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.830
What's my purpose?

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:24.530
What do I hope to do?

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:26.270
They'll talk about
values and action--

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:29.150
what their core values are and
how they demonstrate those.

00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:30.500
Then, also-- vision.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.670
And then there's
teaching stories.

00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:35.630
So what I'm going to close with
is a vision and action story.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:38.243
So I've told you a
lot about growing up

00:38:38.243 --> 00:38:40.160
and my passion around
diversity and inclusion.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.550
So we'll go to the next slide.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:44.840
And this is what I call
"The Swimming Pool" story.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.610
So I lived in
Arkansas for 12 years,

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.050
while I worked with Walmart.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:50.230
And my whole life,
I've been passionate

00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:51.550
about diversity and inclusion.

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.945
I feel like my parents did
an incredible job, moving us

00:38:53.945 --> 00:38:55.820
to the neighborhood
where we looked different

00:38:55.820 --> 00:38:57.200
than everybody else.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.880
So I've wanted to do the
same with my children.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:03.440
And so we've done a lot of
diversity immersion trips.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.343
We invite a lot of very
different people to our homes.

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:08.510
Four times a year, I used
to invite about 200 people

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.880
to our home from Walmart who
were from different countries

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:11.963
and different backgrounds.

00:39:11.963 --> 00:39:14.940
And I was always very
purposeful on what we did.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:17.990
But my main message to my
kids has always been, speak up

00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:19.250
and speak out.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:21.870
If you see something that's not
right, do something about it--

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:22.370
right?

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:22.940
Speak up.

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.523
And speak out.

00:39:23.523 --> 00:39:26.300
That's what everybody
is obligated to do.

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.150
So one day in Arkansas, I'm
at a community swimming pool.

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:30.770
It's Memorial Day weekend.

00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:33.358
And I have my 12-year-old
daughter with me.

00:39:33.358 --> 00:39:34.400
And she's a good swimmer.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.450
So I'll start with that.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.400
So she jumps into the pool.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.470
And I lay down on a lawn
chair and go to sleep.

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:41.780
That's bad parenting.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.663
But there is a lifeguard.

00:39:43.663 --> 00:39:45.080
And my daughter
is a good swimmer.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:48.290
And I needed a break
from a long week at work.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.130
So I'm sleeping.

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.320
I'm kind of dozing in and out.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.000
And I hear this man yell,
why don't you morons get out

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:56.950
of the pool?!

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.180
Now, when we had walked
into the pool area,

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:01.880
all of the children in
the pool were white,

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.700
except for two
African-Americans.

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.730
So I heard that man yell that.

00:40:07.730 --> 00:40:08.660
I kind of woke up.

00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.130
I sat up.

00:40:10.130 --> 00:40:11.750
And I looked in the pool.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:14.480
And I didn't see the
African-American children.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.920
So I motioned my daughter over.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:17.750
And I said, what just happened?

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:20.540
And she reiterated
what the man had said.

00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:25.280
So in that moment, I
have a lot going on.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:28.910
Am I going to do what I've told
my children for years and years

00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:31.430
about speak up and speak out?

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.800
Or am I going to be silent?

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.120
And this is in a community--

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.710
I don't know the
man that yelled it.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:39.080
I don't know anybody
else at the pool.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.310
What am I going to do?

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.350
And so I thought about,
what am I going to do?

00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:47.570
And I decided that I was going
to address the man separately,

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.970
after the holiday
weekend was over.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.090
So on Tuesday, after
Memorial Day weekend,

00:40:53.090 --> 00:40:55.730
I drove to the
swimming pool area.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.897
And it was only me and
him that were there.

00:40:57.897 --> 00:40:59.480
And I hadn't told
my husband or people

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.850
at work where I was going to.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.120
But I walk into this building.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.395
He's sitting by this desk.

00:41:03.395 --> 00:41:05.270
I said, hey, I want to
talk to you about what

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:07.040
happened on Saturday?

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.890
I said, did you say, why don't
you morons get out of the pool?

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.090
And he jumps up from the desk.

00:41:12.090 --> 00:41:14.367
He says, are you
calling me a racist?!

00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:15.950
And my first thought
was, nobody knows

00:41:15.950 --> 00:41:19.250
I'm in this building
with this man by myself.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.320
And I thought long and
hard about-- how do I

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:23.790
reply to his question?

00:41:23.790 --> 00:41:27.110
So I said, I'm not
calling you a racist.

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:29.330
But I'm concerned
about how it made

00:41:29.330 --> 00:41:33.950
all the children and everybody
feel when you yelled that.

00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:37.910
So he proceeded to tell me that
he calls Hispanics "morons."

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:39.440
He calls women "morons."

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:42.830
He was what I would call an
equal employment offender.

00:41:42.830 --> 00:41:45.320
He let me know, that's
his approach on life.

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.420
So I tried to explain
my point of view.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:49.670
He tried to explain
his point of view.

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.040
We ended the
conversation with neither

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.080
of us agreeing with each
other's point of view.

00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:01.537
So two years later, I went back
to that pool with my daughter.

00:42:01.537 --> 00:42:03.620
It had been two years since
I'd been at that pool.

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:04.703
My daughter and I walk in.

00:42:04.703 --> 00:42:06.400
It was another holiday weekend.

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:06.900
We walk in.

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.900
He says, you-- you--

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:10.578
I know what you do for a living.

00:42:10.578 --> 00:42:13.120
I don't know how he found that
out-- probably through Google.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.017
But he said, you-- you--

00:42:15.017 --> 00:42:16.350
I know what you do for a living.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:17.805
He said, I want to thank you.

00:42:17.805 --> 00:42:20.180
I want to thank you for having
that conversation with me.

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:23.030
He said, I haven't called
anybody a moron since.

00:42:23.030 --> 00:42:25.310
And I said, well, you and
I are always connected,

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:27.570
because of that conversation.

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:29.398
So that's a values
and action story.

00:42:29.398 --> 00:42:31.190
And I think that's what
we all have to do--

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:32.720
is determine what
our core values are.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:33.637
And how do we live it?

00:42:33.637 --> 00:42:36.900
And then, how do we share
their stories about it?

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:42.940
So I'm going to click to
the second-to-last slide,

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.150
just to close up.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.990
So what I want you to do
is always share your story

00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.810
about inclusion.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:49.698
What we did today, it's
a great icebreaker.

00:42:49.698 --> 00:42:51.490
It's something you can
do at team meetings,

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:52.520
you can do at events.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:54.040
But find out people's stories.

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.110
Have curiosity
about other people.

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.540
Find out what their story
is, and share your story.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.130
And then look for
those moments that

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:01.900
are teaching moments
or learning moments

00:43:01.900 --> 00:43:04.660
that you can share with people
that also have an underlying

00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:07.870
theme around respect
and inclusion for all.

00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:10.270
And then, have a point of view.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.100
And then speak up
and speak out when

00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.467
you see things that are wrong.

00:43:13.467 --> 00:43:15.800
But Thuhang and I want to
thank you for your time today.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.467
We really appreciate
you having us here.

00:43:17.467 --> 00:43:18.040
Thank you.

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.265
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:19.265 --> 00:43:20.140
MODERATOR: Thank you.

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:21.182
THUHANG TRAN: OK, thanks.

00:43:21.182 --> 00:43:23.190
[APPLAUSE]
