00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.580
All right. We already knew that lines B and

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.260
D should be in the final list, since they were in both files.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.240
Before, we didn't really know whether the lines had been there at the beginning

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.110
of the day or whether Jake and Rachel had both added them.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:13.930
But now we know, it was already there.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.660
Now let's look at A.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.660
At the beginning of the day, line A was present.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.890
Rachel's file still contains it, so she didn't do anything with it.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.720
But Jake's file doesn't contain it.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.790
That means that he removed line A.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.710
So we don't want it in the final file.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:27.850
Now let's look at C.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.980
C doesn't appear in the original and Jake doesn't have it either, but

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.870
Rachel does.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.120
Since it wasn't there to begin with,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.690
we know that she added it, so it should be in the file.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.650
The same thing goes for E.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.330
Since it's not in the original, but Jake has it,

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.730
we do want it in the final file.
