00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
- [Instructor] Consider the
closed curve in the xy-plane

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.500
given by this expression here.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.520
Find the coordinates of
the two points on the curve

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.540
where the line tangent
to the curve is vertical.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.510
So pause this video, and see
if you could have a go at it.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.270
So I don't know what the exact shape

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.970
of this closed curve is.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.630
But if I were to draw some
type of a closed curve,

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.560
maybe it looks something like this.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.730
This isn't the one that's right over here.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.320
This one also has two points

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.510
where my tangent line is vertical.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.630
One point would be right over there.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.690
Another point would be right over there.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.360
Now, how do we figure this out?

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.570
Well, what we could do is
use implicit differentiation

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.330
to find the derivative
of y with respect to x,

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.500
and think about the x and y values

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.270
that would give us a situation
where that derivative

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.080
is nonzero in the numerator
and zero in the denominator.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.290
So let's do that.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.460
So let's just, let me rewrite everything.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.400
I have x squared plus two x

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.800
plus y to the fourth plus four y

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.600
is equal to five.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.670
I want to take the
derivative with respect to x

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.470
of both sides of this equation.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.380
I'm trying to find an expression

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.590
for the derivative of y with respect to x.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.010
And so what am I going to get?

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.140
This is going to be equal
to two x plus two plus,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.480
derivative of this with respect
to y is four y to the third

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.490
and then times the derivative
of y with respect to x,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.400
that's just straight
out of the chain rule,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.600
plus derivative of this
with respect to y is four,

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.590
times the derivative of y
with respect to x, once again,

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.950
straight out of the chain
rule, is equal to, whoops,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.030
I want to take the derivative
with respect to x here,

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.770
is equal to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.680
zero.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.100
And now we just have to solve for dy/dx.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.780
So there's a couple things we could do.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.380
We could take the two x plus two

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.680
and subtract it from both sides,

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.020
and we could also factor out a four dy/dx

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.020
out of this stuff right over here.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.100
So let's do that.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.290
Let's subtract the two x
plus two from both sides

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.670
and factor out the four times dy/dx.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.670
So we will get four times dy/dx

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.930
times

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.670
y to the third

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.410
plus one

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.010
is equal to,

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.160
is equal to,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.990
I subtracted this from both
sides, so I'll get negative two.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.800
And actually, let me
factor out a negative two,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.240
so negative two times x plus one.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.380
And now I just have to divide both sides

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.690
by four times all of this business.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.510
And I am going to get the derivative of y

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.300
with respect to x is equal
to negative two times

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.740
x plus one

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.530
divided by,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.730
divided by

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.510
four times y to the third

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.610
plus one.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.230
And actually, this can be rewritten

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.670
as being equal to negative of x plus one

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.730
divided by two times y
to the third plus one.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.720
I just divided the numerator
and the denominator by two.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.160
Now, why is this useful?

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.290
Well, we could think about
what y values, because y is

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.240
the only variable we have
in the denominator here,

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.440
would make the denominator equal zero,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.940
and then find the corresponding
x values for those y values

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.130
by going to our original equation.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.330
Well, this is going to be zero,

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.470
zero when

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.740
y is equal to negative one.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.370
So when y is equal to negative one,

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.960
let's figure out what x is.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.560
And to do that, we just
have to substitute y

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.170
equals negative one back
in our original equation

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.560
and then solve for x.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.410
So let's do that.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.760
Let me clear this out since
I need that real estate.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.210
So if we go back and we substitute

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:30.600
y equals negative one up here,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.600
we're going to get x
squared plus two x plus one,

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.270
plus one

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.510
minus four is equal to five.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.090
This is going to be negative three.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.930
Subtract five from both
sides, you get x squared

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.180
plus two x minus eight is equal to zero.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.590
This is just simple factoring.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.370
So it's going to be x plus
four times x minus two.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.870
What two numbers, when
I take their product,

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.720
I get negative eight?

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.553
Four, negative two.

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:00.470
When I add four, negative two,
I get a positive two there,

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.610
is equal to zero.

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.570
So x is equal to negative four,

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.130
or x is equal to positive two

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.070
when y is equal to negative one.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.830
So to answer their question,

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.900
find the coordinates of
the two points on the curve

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.840
where the line tangent
to the curve is vertical,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.980
well, the answer here would be,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.430
get a little bit of a drum roll,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.010
it would be the points

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.700
x equals negative four

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.820
and y is equal to negative one and

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.570
x equals two and y is
equal to negative one.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.403
And we're done.
