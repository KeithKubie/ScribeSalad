00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
How do you define race?

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:09.520
If you had to describe why you think you’re a member
of one race and someone else was a member of a
different one, you’d probably focus on appearances –

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.200
your skin, your hair, maybe even the
structures of your bodies and faces.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.740
But most of the time, those physical criteria
mean different things, depending on the culture
you’re a part of.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.620
An obvious example is skin color.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:26.680
We use the words White and Black to describe
two races, but the distinction in skin color
between those races isn’t as clear cut.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:33.440
A White person who’s spent the summer at
the beach might come home with brown skin,
but getting a tan doesn’t change their race.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.540
And light-skinned Black people may have skin
that’s not all that darker than that tan.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.140
Clearly, race is about more than just the
literal color of someone’s skin.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.440
So let’s talk about race, and why it’s
a topic that goes more than skin deep.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:56.360
[Theme Music]

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.140
Much like gender, race is a socially constructed
category.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.220
In this case, it’s used to categorize people
who share biological traits that a society
thinks are important.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.460
So, you might be wondering: how can race be both
a social construct and something based on biology?

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.940
Well, the key part of that definition of race
is the last part: what a society thinks is important.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.240
Sure, skin color varies widely across regions
of the world.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.240
But so does eye color, and we don’t consider people with
blue eyes a different race than people with brown eyes.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.040
And while physical traits are often used to describe or
identify a race, they’re not always applied consistently.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.860
Take for example, the so-called ‘one-drop’
rule in the United States,

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.340
where even the smallest amount of
African American ancestry is enough to classify
someone as Black rather than White.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:45.120
The opposite, however, isn’t true – someone
with one Black parent and one White parent
is almost never considered white.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.800
Plus people from different places or different
time periods have defined racial groups differently.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.780
Nowadays, light skinned people of European descent
are typically considered `White’ in the United States.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.120
It doesn’t matter whether your heritage
is British or Irish or Italian or Polish or
German – you’re just ‘White.’

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.320
But that wasn’t the case a century ago.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.340
In the early 1900s, anyone who wasn’t a White
Anglo-Saxon Protestant was considered ‘ethnic’ –

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.220
so for example, if you were Italian or Irish,
you weren’t considered white.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.620
Likewise, today, being Jewish is often seen
as an ethnicity in the United States.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.680
But Europeans are more likely to think of
being Jewish as a race.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.440
So, that raises the question: What’s the
difference between ethnicity and race?

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.900
Well, ethnicities are socially constructed categories
based on cultural traits that a society finds important,
rather than strictly biological traits.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.900
Essentially, an ethnic group is a group that
has a shared cultural heritage.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.180
Language, traditions, religion – these are
all types of culture that can determine your
ethnic background.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:46.080
Two people of different races might share an ethnicity
– and conversely, two people of the same race might
be of totally different ethnicities.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.920
Japanese and Vietnamese people are both considered
Asian, but they come from different cultural backgrounds.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.520
In fact, a term that many people think refers
to race – `Hispanic’ – actually refers to ethnicity.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.860
To explore this a little more, let’s go to the
Thought Bubble to talk about the differences between
the terms Hispanic, Latino, and Latin American.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.230
The term “Hispanic” first appeared as
a racial category in the US Census in 1970,

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.040
as a way of describing those whose heritage
originated in a Spanish-speaking country.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.820
Before then, the Census referred to those
people as Spanish-Americans –

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.020
even though tracing back their origins to Spain would
mean going way, way back for many of them.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.920
And for others, it’d be totally inaccurate.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.840
But in day-to-day conversation, most people
from Spanish-speaking backgrounds were usually
referred to by the country of their heritage,

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.500
like Mexican American or Cuban American, or
sometimes more broadly as ‘Latin American.’

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.460
This last term is also where we get the word
`Latino’ – and the de-gendered latinx.

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.360
It’s a shorter version of the Spanish word
‘latinoamericano,’

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.360
and it refers to someone whose heritage
originates from nations in the Americas
that are south of the United States,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.520
including Mexico, all of South America,
and the Caribbean.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.880
Now, not all Hispanics are Latino.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.340
Being from Spain for example, makes you Hispanic
but not Latino – and not all Latinos are Hispanic.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.760
Brazilians speak Portuguese, meaning that
they are not considered Hispanic.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.460
But regardless of which term you’re using,
Hispanic or Latino, neither of these distinctions
are based on physical appearance.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.900
Unlike race, which is based on observable,
physical traits, ethnicities aren’t.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.900
And in fact, two people of the same ethnicity
can be entirely different races.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.380
For example, both Cameron Diaz and Rosario
Dawson are Cuban Americans, which means they
are both Hispanic, but Cameron Diaz is white
and Rosario Dawson is Black.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.540
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:26.060
Though race is more commonly used by society
as a way to organize people and distribute power,

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.980
both race and ethnicity play a role in how people
are perceived and, therefore, the opportunities that
are available to them.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:39.000
A person’s race influences a whole host of social
outcomes, from their education to their income to
their experiences with the criminal justice system.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.420
But which races or ethnicities are advantaged
or disadvantaged depends on when and where
we’re talking about.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.840
For example, in the United Kingdom, there’s
been a lot of unrest about immigration from
Eastern Europe, especially Poland.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.500
Incidents of hostility and violence against
Polish immigrants have increased in the wake
of the UK’s exit from the European Union.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.960
But while Eastern Europeans are
considered an ethnic minority in the UK,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.580
people in the US are much more likely to think
of Eastern European immigrants as just White –
they’re not thought of as a minority.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.880
And that’s because what constitutes a minority
is more complex than you might think.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:16.060
Sociologists define a minority as any category of people,
who are distinguished by physical or cultural difference,
that a society sets apart and subordinates.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.200
Now, notice that there are two important parts
of that definition:

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.660
First, minorities share a distinctive identity
based on physical or cultural traits.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.040
Second, minorities occupy a lower status in
society and have less access to the levers
of societal power.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.760
Notice how that definition doesn’t say anything
about the size of the group.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.160
In sociology, a minority group’s relative
size isn’t important.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.860
For example, women are considered a minority, even
though they make up about 51% of the United States.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.200
And a group that’s a minority in terms of
size can still be a majority in terms of power.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.600
South African apartheid is an example of this.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:55.640
From 1948 to 1994, a white minority maintained
a system of racial segregation and discrimination
against Black South Africans.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:02.960
Right now, non-Hispanic Whites are the majority
group in the United States in terms of sheer size,
making up 61% of the US population.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.540
But that’s rapidly changing.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.500
As of 2015, babies of color being born now
outnumber non-Hispanic white babies.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:15.200
And five states are already minority-majority states:
California, Texas, New Mexico, Nevada, and Hawaii.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.300
How can a state or country be minority-majority?
Isn’t that, like, an oxymoron?

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.380
Well, for one thing, even if non-Hispanic
white Americans no longer make up more than
half the country,

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.620
they’ll likely remain a larger group than any
other single race.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:33.300
But also, to be a minority in the sociological
sense of the word, a group must be in a position
of disadvantage.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.860
And as we’ve discussed many times before,
non-Hispanic White Americans tend to have
higher incomes,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.900
live in better neighborhoods, and are more likely
to have more prestigious jobs and better educations
than racial and ethnic minorities.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:51.060
But before we can make comparisons between
different racial groups in the US, we should talk
about the races that make up the United States.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:56.140
The US Census uses six different
categories of race when collecting data about
the demographics of the country.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:00.960
White refers to anyone who reports their origins as
being from Europe, the Middle East, or Northern Africa.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:07.480
So, Irish, German, Italian, Lebanese, Iranian,
Moroccan – they’re all ethnicities that go
under the heading of white.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.180
Yes, you heard me right.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.800
People of Middle Eastern descent are categorized
as White by the Census, even if they often aren’t
treated as if they’re white.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:22.420
Why? Well, what’s now become known as ‘White’
originates from a term to refer to people of
Indo-European descent: the ‘Caucasian’ race.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:29.420
The term Caucasian started as a reference to the
Caucus Mountains, which run through the modern day
countries of Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:36.740
Back when race was understood as a purely biological
phenomenon, everyone from Europe all the way down
to India was lumped into one ‘Caucasian’ group.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:40.700
So yesterday’s ‘Caucasian’ contained most
of the people who count as today’s ‘white’,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.120
but also captured groups that nowadays get
labelled as Asian, such as Indians or Pakistanis.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.980
Now, many Hispanic Americans are also counted
as White in the Census.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.720
‘Hispanic’ is considered an ethnicity, not a race,
for Census purposes, so in the 2010 Census,

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.940
52% of Hispanic Americans identified
themselves as white,

00:07:56.940 --> 00:08:03.260
while 36.7% identified themselves as ‘some
other race,’ and smaller percentages identified
themselves as one of the other racial groups.

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:11.900
Black or African Americans are the second largest
racial group in the United States and are defined
as individuals with African heritage, including
those who are Afro-Caribbean.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.640
Since many African Americans’ ancestors were
forcibly brought to the United States as slaves,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.800
the countries that their ancestors
originated from are often unknown.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:26.560
To this day, the remnants of slavery and the Southern
plantation systems can be seen in the geographic
distribution of Black Americans around the country.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:31.180
Though many Black Americans moved to
Northern cities during the Great Migration
of the early 20th century,

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.880
most remained in the South, in a region that has come
to be known as the Black Belt of the United States.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:39.390
The third racial category used in the Census
is ‘American Indian or Alaska Native,’

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.300
which refers to anyone whose origins are indigenous
to the contiguous United States and Alaska.

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:47.900
Though Native Americans numbered in the millions
when Europeans first arrived in the 15th century,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:53.600
today, they control only 2% of the country’s
land area, make up just 0.2% of the US population,

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.340
and remain severely disadvantaged in terms
of access to education and income.

00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:07.060
The fourth Census category for race, Asian,
refers to origins in Eastern Asia, Southeast Asia,
or the Indian subcontinent, including China, India,
Japan, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Vietnam.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:13.740
The largest subgroup of Asian Americans are
those of Chinese ancestry, who make up a little less
than ¼ of the total Asian American population.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.340
The fifth Census category is Native Hawaiian
and Other Pacific Islander,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:22.020
which refers to people whose origins are from
Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:26.740
As I mentioned before, Hawaii is one of the states
where a minority race is the majority race for the state –

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.200
and in fact, it’s the only state that has
always been minority-majority.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.480
The last Census category is just a catch-all
‘Some Other Race.’

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:36.840
You might remember that about a third of
Hispanic Americans fall into this group;

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.800
if a person lists a country of origin that doesn’t fit
one of the other categories, they get stuck in this group.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.720
You might be thinking that these categories
don’t seem like the racial groups you typically think of.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.860
And that’s ok!

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:50.860
In all likelihood, the way that the government
defines races will continue to change,

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.260
to incorporate our society’s changing notions
of race and ethnicity.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:02.840
And something that should be clear from everything
we talked about today is that races aren’t fixed
immutable categories – they are defined by societies.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.800
Today we learned the difference between races
and ethnicities.

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:10.220
We discussed how definitions of races and
ethnicities have changed over time and across places.

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:13.600
We also discussed the terms minority and minority-majority.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.399
And we finished up by discussing how races
are defined in the United States.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:24.060
