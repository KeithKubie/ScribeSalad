MALE SPEAKER: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.600
interesting developer community.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:11.440
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.520
has asked this question.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.846
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:15.180
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.010
answer show, so if any
of you out there

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.260
would like to ask questions.

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:30.540
Hi there, Welcome to Apps
Script Office Hours.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:31.140
I'm Jan.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.850
This is Ikai.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.050
IKAI: Hi.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.990
JAN: For those of you who
haven't joined us before,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.950
Office Hours is chance where we
can tell you a little bit

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.820
about what's been going on in
Apps Script and go over

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.920
release notes, things
like that.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.890
But we also have time to take
questions from you, either

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.670
live, if you've joined
us in the Hangout,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.510
or on Google Moderator.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.185
So if you go to
developers.google.com/live,

00:00:50.185 --> 00:00:53.320
you can find the entry for this
Office Hours, and you can

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.330
find the link to post
questions on

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.480
Google Moderator there.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.800
IKAI: And for those of your that
have joined us before,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.920
you'll notice our fancy
new studio.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.245
We're broadcasting live
from the rain forest.

00:01:04.245 --> 00:01:06.690
But no, this is our first time
using new equipment, so we

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.810
apologize for a couple technical
difficulties that we

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:09.670
might stumble over.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.880
But going forward, we're going
to have this fancy new studio,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.390
so it's going really going to
make our stuff look really

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.910
cool, I think, really
high quality--

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:17.900
JAN: Make us look really cool.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.700
IKAI: Yeah, and I get to live
out my childhood fantasy of

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.030
being Anderson Cooper.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.650
So yeah, so let's get started.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.030
JAN: All right, so the first
thing I do, I'm going to

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.790
switch over here to the Hangout,
and I'm going to

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.440
share my screen so that I can
walk you all through some

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.590
recent releases since our
last Office Hours.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.890
So hopefully you can
see these now.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.540
So I'm going to kind of
work backwards from

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.970
the most recent ones.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.470
Last night, August 22, so we
fixed two issues that some of

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.040
you may have experienced.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.660
The first one, where it was
happening with spreadsheets.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.330
This only happen for a period
of about 24 hours, where if

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.890
you were making a copy of a
spreadsheet that had multiple

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.770
projects contained within it,
only one of those projects was

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.290
getting copied with
the spreadsheet.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.880
That's resolved now, so it
should be working as expected.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.980
Then the second issue was a
couple related things with the

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.770
script gallery, where installs
from the spreadsheet script

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.500
gallery were not installing
properly, either with an error

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.170
message or with no error message
but the script wasn't

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.510
showing up.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.460
So that is fully resolved now,
as well, so you shouldn't have

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.000
anymore trouble there.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.105
And then we had this regular
release on August 20 with a

00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:28.480
few fixes and some improvements,
so I'll just run

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.730
through these quickly.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.570
So now, UI App widgets have
set_style_attribute methods so

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.890
that you can set multiple
attributes at once instead of

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.760
calling set_style_attribute over
and over and over, once

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.530
for each attribute.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.230
So that should help you reduce
the number of times you have

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.730
to call that in your code.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.160
We also increase the maximum
file upload size in web apps

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.560
to 50 megabytes, so this now
matches the limit for the Docs

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.520
List service.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.960
There is a new way of calling
logger.log now that allows you

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:02.440
to do string formatting.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.920
This is actually really useful,
so definitely check

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.470
out the docs and see if that's
something that might help you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.290
as you're kind of logging and
debugging your applications.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.590
There's a few other fixes.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.190
One was to the Date Picker
widget, where sometimes it was

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.100
having strange values if you
chose a date before 1970.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.340
Another issue with All
Day Event Series.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.210
They weren't being scheduled
properly for

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.870
certain time zones.

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.522
There's one with HTML
form elements.

00:03:28.522 --> 00:03:31.750
It's causing those not to
be able to be sent in

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.540
google.script.run callbacks,
it's for HTML service.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:35.980
Ikai, I think you have
some insight there.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:38.510
IKAI: Yeah, we've been looking
at some reports that this is

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.510
still not working for some
people, so we'll be

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.920
investigating that, figure out
what's going on, if that's an

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.750
issue with the service, or if
that's just something else

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.410
that's making it really
confusing to figure out what

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.250
the source debug is.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.380
That was one I was real looking
forward to because I

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.030
know that, going forward, we're
going to be supporting

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.380
HTML service a lot more.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.120
We're going to be adding a lot
more new features and then

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.400
improving performance, so we
want to get that one working

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.880
because you can't
submit forms.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.406
Make things hard.

00:04:05.406 --> 00:04:07.700
JAN: So we'll get the rest of
that ironed out for anything

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.510
that might still be
happening there.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.990
An issue with embedded charts
returning the wrong data type

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.120
was fixed, and then there was
also an issue with charts

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.709
where we were ignoring the
advanced parameters for data

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:19.779
source URLs.

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:22.770
And then finally, one that I'm
super excited about is we have

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.410
streamlined the process for
publishing apps to the Chrome

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.060
Web Store, so you no longer have
to go through the process

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.960
of doing the URL verification
through

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.270
Google Webmaster Tools.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.010
That's just not required
for your apps anymore.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.280
It's kind of taken care of
behind the scenes, so that

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.420
significantly streamlines
the process now.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.810
It's about two clicks instead of
two clicks and some copies

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.780
and pastes and opening
back up again.

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.950
So definitely check that out
if you had gone through the

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.610
process before.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.270
It's much, much smoother now.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.800
OK, so one other thing I wanted
to mention before we

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.940
jump into questions.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.430
Hopefully, you can
see this here.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.850
There is a blog post that went
out today on the Google

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.710
Analytics blog, and also
cross-posted on the Google

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.400
Apps developers blog and the
Google developers blog,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.450
announcing a really great script
that takes advantage of

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.450
the integration between
Apps Script and

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.890
Google Analytics now.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.730
This blog post talks a little
bit about ways that you can

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.580
pull analytics data into Google
Spreadsheets really

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.470
easily, build custom
dashboards.

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.730
There's a great video explaining
how the script that

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:27.880
they've published in the
script gallery works.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.960
And at the end, you'll notice
they also have something fun,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.780
so the analytics team is
offering Google Analytics

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.750
developer t-shirts.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.440
The first 15 developers who
build a solution that solves

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.350
some sort of business problem
using both the Google

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.860
Analytics API and Apps Script,
so check that out if you're

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.015
interested.

00:05:47.015 --> 00:05:49.050
IKAI: I have the second
announcement, which is that if

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.120
you don't follow the blogs, we
announced that we will be

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.640
having an Apps Script
Hack-a-thon in Austin, Texas.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.400
This will be on Thursday,
September 13, 2012.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.590
So I will be there, I believe
Eric's going to be going, and

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:03.770
we'll have at least one other
team number coming.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.650
There might be one or
two on the way, so

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:06.840
definitely sign up.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.550
If you want to find the blog
post, it's at googleappsdevelo

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.410
per.blogspot.com, and
just scroll down.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.250
Jan posted it about
a few day ago.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.580
So just check it out, there's
a sign up form, and all the

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:20.280
information you need, so
hopefully we'll see you there.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.190
And if not, we're looking at
doing some other cities at

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.920
some point in the future,
so we'll get your

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.538
city soon, some point.

00:06:28.538 --> 00:06:36.460
JAN: OK, so let me pull up the
questions here, that we have

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.710
in Moderator.

00:06:39.955 --> 00:06:44.120
All right, so looks like we
have two questions here.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.730
The first one, let me read
through it, and then we'll

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.860
tackle each of these.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.530
"Is it possible to add a control
to a geomap in order

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:53.690
to be able to choose what year
and month to view the data?

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.685
I've tried and failed
multiple times." You

00:06:56.685 --> 00:06:57.460
familiar with what--

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.960
IKAI: Let me take a look at
this question real quick.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:01.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.680
to add--

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.680
well, Rusty, are you on
the chat right now?

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.010
Are you on the Hangout
right now?

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.580
Because I'd love to hear more
about what you're asking.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.770
It's not quite clear to me.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:19.120
JAN: Yeah, I'm not sure what's
being referred to as geomap

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.020
here, if this is something
related to the charts API, or

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.160
if this is something related
to the map service.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.370
IKAI: Oh, could this be related
to fusion tables?

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.250
JAN: I'm not sure.

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:29.690
IKAI: OK.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.630
JAN: I think what we're going to
need in this case-- let me

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:36.910
just see in the Hangout.

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:42.230
No, we don't have anybody typing
furiously in the chat

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:43.010
for the Hangout.

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:44.620
So I think we'll need a little
more details here.

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.430
I'll post a response afterwards,
trying to get some

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.020
more details about this
question, and then we can take

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:52.550
a look into it.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.030
So the next one here, "Are
Google Apps Script dashboard

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.650
quotas by domain,
user, or script?

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.950
I received a too much traffic
error while posting three

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:04.730
large posts using URL Fetch app
eight minutes--" I guess

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.820
that's eight megs, four
megs, [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.750
"It appeared to be below
all publish quotas.

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:10.270
Why does this occur?"

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.940
So in most cases, the quotas
are going to be--

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.440
so it kind of depends
on the quota.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.830
Some quotas are per user.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.710
Some quotas are per user, per
script, so this URL Fetch one

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:27.900
is most likely going to be--
and then some quotas are

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:29.340
actually time based as well.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.650
So some of them will be short
term quotas, so you can do x

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:35.900
amount of whatever that task
is or x amount of data

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.669
transfer in y amount of time.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.490
So if this is a too much traffic
error, I'm guessing

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.570
that it's probably the amount of
bandwidth that you're using

00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:50.460
in a small amount of time that
you're hitting, so again, this

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.210
would be a good one for us to
get a little more detail about

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.750
specifically what
you're doing.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.370
It's also the case that the
dashboard is not exhaustive,

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:03.380
so it doesn't list every single
quota that exists.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.120
We're trying to expand
what's listed there.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.070
It lists most of them,
but not all of them.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:11.700
So if there's a quote that
people are commonly running

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.250
into, we may need to add that
to the dashboard as well.

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.910
But I do believe that URL Fetch
does have some sort of

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:23.840
limitations around the amount of
data that you can transfer

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:28.130
or request in a given short
period of time, so if it's

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:33.576
possible for you to kind of
space that out a little bit,

00:09:33.576 --> 00:09:34.530
that may help.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:36.780
IKAI: I would suggest, at least
for purposes of testing

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.930
to figure out what exactly it
is, put a sleep between these

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:42.260
three things.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.100
I'm not saying do this for your
production application,

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.010
just so we can I figure out
where you're hitting the

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:46.670
bandwidth limit.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.900
I mean if you put, what, a 30
second, 60 second sleep, I

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.280
think that should be sufficient
to figure out if

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.870
it's because you're posting too
quickly or if you're just

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:56.850
going over some other limit.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:59.020
Like there might be something
else going on, so we want to

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:02.350
narrow down what could be
tripping this limit.

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:03.146
Now--

00:10:03.146 --> 00:10:04.060
Yeah, go ahead.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:04.470
JAN: No, go ahead.

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.250
IKAI: I was going to say the
good news is that, going

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:08.730
forward, we are working on
raising a lot of the different

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.780
quotas, so it'll be a lot
harder trigger them.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.910
But in the meantime, we want to
figure out what's causing

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.230
this, and we want to understand
what you're doing

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.420
with Apps Script so that, if it
makes sense to raise this

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.470
quote, and it sounds like it
does, that we can do so.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.720
JAN: So another thing I would
like to know in this case is

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.860
for these requests that you're
making, if you're a Google

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.160
Apps customer, are they
within your domain?

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:33.826
So for example, are you
transferring things within--

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.600
files within your own domain
or something like that?

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.130
Because that may be different
use case than if you, for

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:43.330
example, you were making
requests out to some third

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.550
party API or from some third
party site where you have

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.700
files stored or something like
that, because there may be

00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:52.600
different things that we can
do if this bandwidth is

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.960
constrained within your own
domain, if that makes sense.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.670
So it'd be good to know just
a little bit more.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:59.530
Oh, yes?

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:02.490
AUDIENCE: Yes, I was using the
Apps Script to read those

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.610
three files out of Gmail.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.760
They were attachments under an
email, and I was trying to

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.060
post them to our third party
collaboration system through

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.220
HTTP posts.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:18.890
And I could successfully do it
with smaller files, just when

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.120
I got to the three bigger
ones in that use case,

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.450
it basically failed.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:27.890
JAN: OK, so in that case, it may
be helpful for us to take

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:28.780
a look at ourselves.

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:33.420
We'll contact you afterwards to
get a little more details,

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.360
so we can try to reproduce
this and see specifically

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.610
which limit you're hitting and
see if we can give you some

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.240
possible solutions that
would work for what

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.350
you're trying to do.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:44.720
AUDIENCE: OK, good, thank you.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.846
JAN: OK.

00:11:46.846 --> 00:11:50.265
All right, look like we had a
third one come in here while

00:11:50.265 --> 00:11:50.880
we talking.

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:53.270
So "I'm using forms as a part
of my apps, and I was

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.640
wondering if there's a way to
get the user ID or email

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.150
outside my domain.

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:59.120
I wanted to get this information
so can prevent

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.470
users from submitting the
form multiple times."

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:06.550
So if you are using Google
spreadsheet forms, the built

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:09.280
in forms that are part of Google
Spreadsheets, no, I

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.950
don't think that's possible
unless you put a field

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.810
specifically asking the user
for their email address.

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:17.950
The only way that you can
automatically get that with

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.510
Google Spreadsheet forms as if
it's within your domain, and

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:22.190
you've enabled that option.

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.800
If you are using HTML service
or UI App or something like

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.670
that, and you have published
the web app to run with the

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:32.180
permissions of the user who's
accessing the app rather than

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.910
running as you the developer,
then you can actually call

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:40.150
session.get,
activeuser.get_email and get

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.330
their email address that way.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.770
So that maybe another option
depending on how you're doing

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.630
this, but again, if you're using
a Google Spreadsheet

00:12:46.630 --> 00:12:48.630
form, only if you're doing
that within your domain.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.960
IKAI: And this is a little
bit of trivia.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.820
Jan can actually write code
using speech to text as you

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.386
just demonstrated.

00:12:54.386 --> 00:12:55.120
JAN: Wouldn't that be nice?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.160
IKAI: Session dot use dot dot,
that was pretty good.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.520
JAN: OK, do we have any
live questions?

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.020
AUDIENCE: Well, a couple of
questions that came up.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.110
Very nice set, by the way.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:12.510
It looks nice.

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:13.760
JAN: Thank you.

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.340
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
the new Logger.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:19.880
Did that--

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.870
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.560
IKAI: Oh, you're talking about
the bug where, when you do a

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:27.960
post, it doesn't log things.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:29.720
I don't think we've
resolve this yet.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.820
Eric, do you know if
we've resolved--

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:33.420
I don't believe that we've
actually fixed this bug.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.600
I think that it's still--

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:36.490
JAN: We still have some work
that we're doing to get

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.970
logging working in web apps, so
that would include things

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:42.250
like doPost.

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:44.760
So we're still working
on that one.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.690
AUDIENCE: OK, cool, because
it was working before

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.150
something got fixed.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.810
IKAI: It was working, I think,
about a week and a half ago.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:53.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, about that.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.940
JAN: There's some changes that
we need to make to get that

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:56.890
working again.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:14:00.700
There's some other cases where
Logger is not currently

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:05.040
working in all cases, aside
from just doPost, so we're

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.340
actively working on that.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.280
If I'm remembering correctly,
I think it's not going to be

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.870
too much longer before we'll
have that fix out for you.

00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:17.160
So we'll definitely update
in the tracker once

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.750
it's actually confirmed.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.870
AUDIENCE: Actually, that
reminded me of something.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.220
One of the things that I would
do is I built my own little

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.610
Logger to just-- through
email because it was

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.300
nice and one liner.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.290
One of the things that I've
noticed recently, and I

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:33.160
haven't distilled it down to
what the exact problem is, it

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.140
seems if you have Gmail Apps
and Mail, it's asking for

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.790
authorization a lot.

00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:40.670
JAN: Yes.

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:42.160
AUDIENCE: I see you nodding,
so does that mean that

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.365
somebody's already tracked or
put that issue out there where

00:14:44.365 --> 00:14:45.260
you're aware of it?

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.340
JAN: So that's actually
something that's very specific

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:50.040
to Gmail App, and it's
intentional because Gmail App

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:54.060
is one of these services
that's very, I guess,

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.500
sensitive could be the word.

00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.510
I don't mean that in any way
capital S sensitive kind of

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:00.060
way, but it's--

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:01.980
AUDIENCE: Attractive
to people to abuse?

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.460
IKAI: No, no, no, I just
mean that it's

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.810
accessing your inbox.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:08.120
It's one of the ones where we
want to be extra careful and

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.700
make sure that the user, the
person running the script,

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.510
knows what the script
is doing.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:17.060
Any time you make a change to a
script that uses Gmail App,

00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:19.390
it's going to prompt you for
authorization after any change

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.530
that you make it, so if you're
just using this for logging,

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.020
try Mail App [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:24.700
Mail instead.

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.070
Especially, if you're just using
it to send email, not to

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.680
read things from your inbox or
apply labels, Mail App may be

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:32.710
the way to go for you because
Mail App works a little

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:33.090
differently.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:35.730
It's just for sending mail
instead of for accessing your

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:38.930
inbox and messages, you can
click that, so that will

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:41.420
probably save you a lot
of frustration.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.590
IKAI: Another thing you can
do is you might build you

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:47.060
something in Spreadsheets
API or Script DB.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:49.840
Now, the trade off is that it's
no longer a one liner,

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.990
but the good news is that if you
write this function once,

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.070
you could just go ahead and use
it in any other script you

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:54.880
write in the future.

00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.390
AUDIENCE: Well, it's also the
advantage of the email, too,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:59.710
is you get-- it's
instantaneous.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.980
It was a little bit better than
Logger because you have

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.040
to run it and then
open Logger.

00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:07.140
This was, you could have another
window running with

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.540
your email, and it
just pops up.

00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:11.210
And if you put the information
you're looking for in the

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:15.400
subject line, it's really fast,
and they also the time

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.250
in there so it doesn't
end up in a thread.

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:20.060
So it's a different subject
line, and they just pop up.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.730
It's really efficient
that way.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.250
But I hadn't even really
mentally distinguished between

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:27.880
Gmail App and Mail App, so
that's kind of good.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.250
So I probably should use Mail
App more often anyway for

00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.170
other things as well.

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:32.540
Right?

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:33.840
For any time I'm
sending email?

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:38.150
JAN: If you're just sending
email, then it's probably the

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.370
simpler way to go, but if you
want to do anything around

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:46.960
accessing inbox threads or
messages or adding labels,

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.710
then you've got to go with
the Gmail service.

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:50.631
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK, I didn't
realize there was a

00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:52.830
difference.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:54.800
And then my last question was
is you mentioned that you're

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:58.440
coming to many different cities
for Hack-a-thons.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.500
Any in Canada, Toronto,
or Montreal or Ottawa?

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:02.990
JAN: We don't have
any plans yet.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:07.180
We actually don't have the rest
of our cities planned for

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:08.320
the rest of the year.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.569
JAN: Right, we're still working
on it, although I will

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.010
tell you that some of the
Canadians here have been

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.680
trying to drag me to Montreal
for some time now.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:15.680
JAN: I hear it's awesome.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.210
IKAI: So I hear.

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:21.990
Not in the winter, so not any
time in the next few months.

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:23.885
No, we're thinking about it,
and since we're just in New

00:17:23.885 --> 00:17:27.232
York City, we should just
be a bus ride away.

00:17:27.232 --> 00:17:28.200
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that's true.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.690
I'm down there fairly
often, so it might

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:30.590
be kind of fun to--

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:33.070
IKAI: I mean, it'd be a bus
ride for us to you.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:35.260
Although it is a lot easier for
us to run events in New

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.392
York City, so we might just
do that to do that.

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:41.160
JAN: Yeah, we'll just have to
see how things go, but we'll

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.150
be sure to post them on the
Google Apps developer blog and

00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:48.140
also on the
developers.google.com/events,

00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.680
I believe it is.

00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.950
Anything that we're hosting,
we'll end up posting there as

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:52.880
well, so that's a good
place to go.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.000
That's for all of developer
relations, you can find our

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:56.540
events there.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I've got all the
notices for the others, so

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.080
it's all pretty cool.

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:00.560
JAN: OK.

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.410
One other thing that I wanted
to mention when you were

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:04.280
talking about logging
and debugging.

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.350
So if you're running your
scripts from the editor, and

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:11.720
you want just a quick way
to throw up some debug

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.800
information onto the screen, you
can also just use Throw.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.070
And I use it sometimes instead
of logger.log when I just want

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:19.050
to do something quickly.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.050
If you throw something, and
then give it the string of

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.020
whatever you want to display,
you'll get this

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:24.920
red bar at the top.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.010
So basically, you'll be throwing
an exception, but

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.660
then if you click the details
link from there-- it's a very

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.240
dirty way of doing things.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:33.780
You can click the details link
from there, and then whatever

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.520
you have thrown will
show there.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:37.420
And it can actually--

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.430
I think that it'll buffer more
text than Logger currently

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:44.930
will, so sometimes if I've got
a big chunk of text that I

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:48.490
want to log, I will sometimes
use Throw.

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:49.900
IKAI: But it also
stops execution.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.630
JAN: Oh, yeah.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.950
IKAI: If you want that.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:55.330
JAN: If you want that, then
it gets the job done.

00:18:55.330 --> 00:18:56.710
AUDIENCE: Well, generally, when
I'm putting it in, I've

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.660
got a problem, and I need
to find something.

00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:00.990
So the fact that it
stops there--

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.760
it was stopping around
there anyway, so

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.900
that's kind of cool.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:06.760
Thank you for that.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.110
IKAI: Have you used
a debugger at all?

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:10.840
AUDIENCE: I have.

00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:12.470
But the last little while,
I've been doing a

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:15.650
lot of UI app stuff.

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.570
Unfortunately, it
doesn't really

00:19:18.570 --> 00:19:20.355
do what I need because--

00:19:20.355 --> 00:19:22.600
JAN: Well, hopefully, soon we'll
have the logger working

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.570
again for you in web apps,
and that'll get you

00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:27.810
back on your way.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:28.930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, debugger,
if there's some

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.270
possible way that--

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.080
I can't envision it.

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.990
That's why I've never actually
asked for it as a feature.

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:36.290
If there's some possible way
that you could kind of, as a

00:19:36.290 --> 00:19:40.300
UI app was running, you could
get the variables, you know

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:41.760
just the values and the
variables, that

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.460
would be kind of neat.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.250
Or like a real time logger, if
you could open a window.

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:47.960
Actually, maybe I should
do that as a feature,

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.690
enhancement.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.320
IKAI: That would be a good
feature, not just for UI

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.027
service, but also for HTML
service and anything that has

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:58.056
a, we call head, non-headless
apps.

00:19:58.056 --> 00:19:58.452
JAN: Yeah.

00:19:58.452 --> 00:20:03.400
I guess the question would be,
then, which instance of it are

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.810
you attaching to.

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:06.060
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:11.470
IKAI: Oh, no, we're talking
about that when you attach

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.670
debugger to UI.

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:14.900
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see, debugger.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:18.780
IKAI: Because the difference is
that, yeah, you could have

00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:23.030
multiple people attaching to
multiple GUIs, and which one

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.210
would you attach to, right?

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:25.480
So--

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.770
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:32.330
AUDIENCE: --logger might help,
too, because you could

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.770
essentially do that.

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:36.720
If you could open a Logger
window, rather than waiting

00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:39.750
until the end, wherever Logger's
being written, that

00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:42.570
you have a real time Logger
window because what I often

00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:44.220
will do is I'll define
my own variable.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.480
So if I've got i, I'll have i
equals and then put the value

00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.890
in my Logger, so I know what
value's being displayed.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.580
If you had a real time Logger,
whenever Logger wrote to it

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.480
that it would display in that
window, you wouldn't

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:00.720
necessarily get the debugger in
the sense that you stopped

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.480
the code, but you would
real time be able to

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.786
see what was happening.

00:21:04.786 --> 00:21:06.670
JAN: Yeah, definitely put it
in the issue tracker and we

00:21:06.670 --> 00:21:09.230
can have the engineering team
take a look and see if it's

00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:12.190
something that'd be feasible
for them to do some time in

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:13.496
the future.

00:21:13.496 --> 00:21:16.670
The answer might be that it's
not, but we'll be happy to

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.876
look into it for you at least.

00:21:17.876 --> 00:21:22.120
IKAI: Or my ideal world answer
is that it is, but as part of

00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.240
a greater framework of
log enhancements.

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.910
Like right now, as you know, the
Logger's only good for the

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:27.440
one execution.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.440
I mean, you might want a logger
that lasts a few days

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.600
or whatever.

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.028
Right?

00:21:32.028 --> 00:21:32.884
JAN: Right.

00:21:32.884 --> 00:21:34.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:35.720
Cool.

00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:37.500
JAN: OK, so we have a couple
more minutes here.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.230
Any other live questions that
we can jump back over?

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:44.930
And I'll check and see if
we've got anything more.

00:21:44.930 --> 00:21:47.185
Oh, look at that, we have a
couple other questions.

00:21:47.185 --> 00:21:47.530
IKAI: Oh, wow.

00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.560
JAN: I'm going to have to go
back to screen sharing here.

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.390
IKAI: We're popular
hours today.

00:21:55.390 --> 00:21:56.820
I mean--

00:21:56.820 --> 00:21:59.150
JAN: So let's see how much
we can get through--

00:21:59.150 --> 00:22:00.790
let me pull this screen
back up--

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.330
in the next two minutes.

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.721
All right, so Script DB--

00:22:06.721 --> 00:22:08.690
OK, so this question about
Script DB being quota'd.

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:13.265
Does it count against the script
author's drive quote?

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:15.550
So it says "Script DB counts
against script author's drive

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:17.800
quota, but where can the quota
be queried and viewed?"

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.300
So actually, I think that it's
not the drive quota that it's

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.290
counting against, if I
remember correctly.

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:26.690
IKAI: I think there's just
a Script DB quota.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:29.870
JAN: Specific script DB quota,
and we don't currently have a

00:22:29.870 --> 00:22:34.630
way for you to query directly
how much you've used.

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:37.446
I think, there is a feature
request in for that.

00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:38.390
I'm pretty sure.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:40.850
If there's not, definitely
raise one.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:46.710
So that's something that we
do acknowledge a need for.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.560
We have also heard requests to
have Script DB quota be tied

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:55.470
to drive quota, but it currently
is not today.

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.640
"So I've noticed that logger.log
doesn't work inside

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.850
callback functions." Yes,
that is the bug we were

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.070
referencing, where Logger is not
currently working in web

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:04.010
apps and in a couple
other cases.

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.140
We're working on it, and it
hopefully won't be too much

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.710
longer before we have that
fixed up and rolled out.

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:10.760
IKAI: That is not intentional
behavior.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.910
JAN: Right, so the team is
working hard on that.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.670
And then I have two questions
about components.

00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:18.300
One, "Is there a way to get the
selected item on a list

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:21.540
box from another component's
click event?"

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:24.000
And two, "Set_tag isn't working
inside callback

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.280
functions when I set it and try
to get that null at the

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.190
same time." So that last
question would be one that

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.520
would be really great for us
to get on Stack Overflow,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.990
along with a snippet of code
of the script that you're

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.740
running that's seeing this
behavior because that will

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.790
help us take a look and give
you some suggestions better

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:46.760
than we can kind of doing
30 seconds right here.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.290
But that's definitely a UI
app question that we

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.200
can take a look at.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.180
If you post it on Stack
Overflow, we or another app

00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:57.700
script person will
take a look.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.690
IKAI: And I want to say hi to
Marcello, who is one of our

00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:03.150
GDG organizers in Bolivia.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:03.800
JAN: Awesome.

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.620
IKAI: So how you doing?

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.170
Welcome to the Hangout.

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.520
And he's not on the
live video, so he

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.401
can't say hi back.

00:24:10.401 --> 00:24:13.590
JAN: Well, hi from us, to you.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:17.810
OK, I think we're out of time,
so thanks for joining us, and

00:24:17.810 --> 00:24:19.470
we'll be back next week.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.270
I also want to mention that next
Friday, we have a special

00:24:22.270 --> 00:24:25.530
additional session where we're
doing, instead of Office Hours

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:29.240
on Friday, we'll be doing kind
of a chat interview style

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.960
format with a external Apps
Script developer, Andrew

00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:37.300
Stillman, who has actually
written a lot of the popular

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:39.920
scripts in the script gallery.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.280
So it's on the calendar for
Google Developers live.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.066
Be sure to join us if
you're interested.

00:24:46.066 --> 00:24:46.530
All right?

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.070
IKAI: All right, and
that's a wrap.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.320
We'll see you here next time.
