yeah and if you really want to take it
 

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.060
yeah and if you really want to take it
to the mat on that argument I mean the

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:16.070
to the mat on that argument I mean the
 

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.670
to the mat on that argument I mean the
statistics are like extreme you know the

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:18.680
statistics are like extreme you know the
 

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.580

right and I mean and honestly if you
 

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.190
right and I mean and honestly if you
really want to unpack that you have to

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:30.200
really want to unpack that you have to
 

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.720
really want to unpack that you have to
go back to slavery right and the

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:31.730
go back to slavery right and the
 

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.630
go back to slavery right and the
devastating effects of that on

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:33.640
devastating effects of that on
 

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:36.130

comes to savings they're you know
 

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.940
comes to savings they're you know
they're going to be thinking really of

00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:51.950
they're going to be thinking really of
 

00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:54.010
they're going to be thinking really of
of living hand-to-mouth if you have

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:54.020
of living hand-to-mouth if you have
 

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.050

00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:03.549
intellectual response we have to some of
what's going on in society and I think

00:38:03.549 --> 00:38:03.559
what's going on in society and I think
 

00:38:03.559 --> 00:38:05.260
what's going on in society and I think
of Samantha bee who is my own personal

and she can get away with saying what
 

00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:13.059
and she can get away with saying what
we're all thinking because it's

00:38:13.059 --> 00:38:13.069
we're all thinking because it's
 

00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:14.710
we're all thinking because it's
entertainment well that's right and

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720
entertainment well that's right and
 

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.569
entertainment well that's right and
comedians cut through that divide I mean

00:38:16.569 --> 00:38:16.579
comedians cut through that divide I mean
 

00:38:16.579 --> 00:38:18.460
comedians cut through that divide I mean
they're like no one would think of

00:38:18.460 --> 00:38:18.470
they're like no one would think of
 

00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:20.829
they're like no one would think of
comedians as intellectuals and so it's

00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839
comedians as intellectuals and so it's
 

00:38:20.839 --> 00:38:22.569
comedians as intellectuals and so it's
very interesting that they're assuming

00:38:22.569 --> 00:38:22.579
very interesting that they're assuming
 

00:38:22.579 --> 00:38:24.789
very interesting that they're assuming
that role yeah a public intellectual I

00:38:24.789 --> 00:38:24.799
that role yeah a public intellectual I
 

00:38:24.799 --> 00:38:28.000
that role yeah a public intellectual I
mean what I'm arguing is we shouldn't

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.010
mean what I'm arguing is we shouldn't
 

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.339
mean what I'm arguing is we shouldn't
lump all literary fiction is being

00:38:30.339 --> 00:38:30.349
lump all literary fiction is being
 

00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:31.630
lump all literary fiction is being
brilliant and we shouldn't love all

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640
brilliant and we shouldn't love all
 

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.430
brilliant and we shouldn't love all
commercial fiction as being trashed

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440
commercial fiction as being trashed
 

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:35.170
commercial fiction as being trashed
right because I don't think that's the

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:35.180
right because I don't think that's the
 

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.589
right because I don't think that's the
case do you think that the existence of

00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599
case do you think that the existence of
 

00:38:38.599 --> 00:38:40.270
case do you think that the existence of
those categories and the

00:38:40.270 --> 00:38:40.280
those categories and the
 

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:42.510
those categories and the
marketing machinery that is behind them

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520
marketing machinery that is behind them
 

00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:46.180
marketing machinery that is behind them
creates traps for writers that kind of

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:46.190
creates traps for writers that kind of
 

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.910
creates traps for writers that kind of
silo them sometimes in one direction or

00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:48.920
silo them sometimes in one direction or
 

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.560
silo them sometimes in one direction or
another in terms of the structures of

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:50.570
another in terms of the structures of
 

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.660
another in terms of the structures of
what they're trying to percent because i

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:52.670
what they're trying to percent because i
 

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.950
what they're trying to percent because i
can tell you i still remember the day

00:38:53.950 --> 00:38:53.960

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:55.570
can tell you i still remember the day
that i was basically told to choose a

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:55.580
that i was basically told to choose a
 

00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:59.740
that i was basically told to choose a
path yeah yeah it was about to ensue

00:38:59.740 --> 00:38:59.750
path yeah yeah it was about to ensue
 

00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:01.660
