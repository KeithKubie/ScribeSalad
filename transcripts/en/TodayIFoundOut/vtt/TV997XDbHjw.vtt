00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.880
Hello I’m Daven Hiskey, you are watching
the Today I Found Out YouTube channel.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.700
In the video today, we’re looking at how
fluorescent light bulbs work and why they

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.780
buzz.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.620
Comprised of a sealed tube coated on the inside
with a phosphor powder and usually filled

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.060
with argon and a tiny bit of mercury, the
way in which fluorescent bulbs produce light

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.900
is extremely fascinating.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.849
While the underlying physical mechanisms in
the fixture and bulb can vary a bit in design,

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.640
in a nutshell a fluorescent light works via
two electrodes at either end of the tube emitting

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.830
electrons as they heat up.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.970
Eventually, an arc is created (via varying
mechanisms depending on the fixture and bulb

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.090
design) with the electrons shooting across
the bulb through the ionized gas from one

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.030
electrode to the other; as they move through
the tube, the tiny bit of mercury in the bulb

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.650
is vaporized and as the electrons collide
with its atoms, it excites the electrons in

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.480
the atoms to higher energy levels.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.829
However, this higher energy level is unstable
and post-collision, as the electrons rapidly

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.770
return to their original energy level, they
release photons, albeit mostly ultraviolet

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.489
(UV) light that we humans cannot see.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.500
Not a very useful light source at this point!

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.380
The photons in the UV light, however, in turn
excite the electrons in the phosphor that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.740
is coating the bulb, similarly causing them
to move away from their nuclei to a higher

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.070
state; the phosphor electrons then quickly
return to their original state, at which point

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.670
they also release energy in the form of photons,
but this time mostly in the human visible

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.539
spectrum, creating the bulk of the visible
light that makes these bulbs useful in office

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:24.939
buildings the world over.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.820
Now to the buzzing- Absent preventative measures,
the current in the fluorescent tube would

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.259
rise to dangerous levels owing to the fact
that the electrical resistance of the ionized

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.229
gas in the tube drops progressively as it
heats up.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.369
So without something put in place to stop
the current rising too much, this would be

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.710
a cascading problem.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.860
Eventually, it could well flip your circuit
breaker or the bulb could explode.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.429
Whatever the case, your lights would quickly
stop working.

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.060
To manage that, fluorescent bulb fixtures
are equipped with a ballast of some sort.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.240
This ballast classically comes in the form
of an iron core wrapped in copper wire.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.549
The result is a device that slows the current's
growth, keeping it at a safe level for the

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.950
bulb to operate efficiently.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.909
Important to the discussion of buzzing is
that the electricity energizes the ballast

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:06.380
into producing a magnetic field.

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.490
This is, in fact, how this type of ballast
works in the first place- as more current

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.240
is passed through, the magnetic field gets
bigger, opposing the change in the current

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.830
flow and thus slowing its growth enough for
the alternating current (AC) to switch directions,

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.040
with it dropping to zero and going back up
in the opposite direction in the process.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.080
Standard alternating current rates are usually
60 Hz a.k.a. 60 cycles per second (such as

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.320
in the United States) or 50 Hz (such as in
the U.K.).

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.760
Aptly named, for half of an AC cycle, the
current's charge moves in one direction, and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.020
for the second half, the charge moves in the
other.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.660
All of this switching back and forth further
affects the ballast's electromagnetic field,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.390
since each time the current switches direction
(every half cycle), the polarity of the magnet

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.990
also switches; so, since the electromagnet
is fluctuating at twice the frequency of the

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.000
AC current, its flicker rate is at 100 Hz
or 120 Hz, depending on what country you're

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
in.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.330
During these fluctuates in magnetic field,
the ballast's core is physically squeezed

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:06.500
and released in a process called magnetostriction
that, at a frequency of either 100 Hz or 120

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.310
Hz, produces the infamous buzz.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.310
Of course, not all fluorescent bulb fixtures'
buzzes are alike, and this is due to differences

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.920
in the fixture's ballast type, size, how the
ballast is mounted, fixture design and the

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.030
degree to which the ceilings, walls, sheet
metal, etc. muffle or amplify the sound.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.640
Such a common nuisance, the industry publishes
"sound ratings" for ballasts, and even recommends

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.070
in which settings different ratings are appropriate.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.930
For example, those ballasts with an "A" rating
are the quietest (20-24 decibels), and they

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.211
are recommended for libraries, churches, reception
areas and in TV and radio stations, while

00:03:39.211 --> 00:03:45.320
only a "C" level (31-36 decibels) is recommended
for a "general office area," and retail stores

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.810
can get by with "D" ratings (37-42 decibels).

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.020
For those who hate the buzzing (or perhaps
have issues with migraine headaches being

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.140
induced by the fluorescent bulbs and their
flickering light), electronic ballast (as

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.650
opposed to the old school magnetic ones) are
available and are even quite common today,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.270
such as generally found in Compact Fluorescent
bulbs (CFLs).

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:08.240
These ballasts typically operate at a drastically
higher rate than 100 Hz or 120 Hz, usually

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:21.680
in excess 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.039
of 20,000 Hz.
