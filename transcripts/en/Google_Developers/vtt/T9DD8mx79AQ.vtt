00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:08.650
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:11.660
I'm Timothy Jordan, and you're
watching "The Developer Show."

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.170
And we're doing another
episode of Google I/O 2016.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.820
Right now we're about to take
a look at the Firebase Sandbox

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.449
booth.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:20.490
And I'm here with Magnus.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.110
Hi, Magnus.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.394
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Hey!

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:26.866
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:29.098
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
All right, Magnus.

00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:31.830
Let's take a look at what's
inside the Firebase booth.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.644
First of all is the Firebase
Test Lab for Android.

00:00:35.644 --> 00:00:36.560
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.200
TIMOTHY JORDAN: This
is an actual rack

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.149
as it looks like
in the data center.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:41.690
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Yes, that's correct.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.470
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
I want to hug it.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.170
You want to hug it?

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.440
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: It's amazing.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.860
The thing with this thing
is you can feel the heat

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.000
from these devices as they are
testing different apps right

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.855
here at Google I/O.

00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:54.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
It's really cool.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.120
I mean, I knew, conceptually,
that there was going

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.310
to be a rack full of devices.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.660
But it's literally a
rack full of devices.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.410
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah,
it's quite amazing.

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.620
I mean, a rack like
this, you would typically

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.440
see just rack computers
stuffed in here.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.280
But here, you see real devices.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.270
And if you zoom
into the screens,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.080
you can actually see the apps
being tested by these robots.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.030
I mean, it's amazing.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.560
People or companies, they have
sometimes hundreds of devices

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.710
that they have on a device
[INAUDIBLE] in order

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.660
to test their apps.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.280
With this type of
technology, all of that

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.900
can go away,
because you can test

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.640
all of that stuff in
the cloud and stuff.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.194
And all you do is you
head over to the console--

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:35.110
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.010
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah,
upload your app.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.896
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:38.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: You
make a few clicks,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.830
and then it just
goes off and running.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.200
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Correct.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.790
It's amazing.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.248
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:44.352
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:46.620
Magnus, this is beautiful.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.420
And I know it's data.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.195
Help me understand
it a little more.

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.200
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So what we did
is that we took real analytics

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.960
data from Firebase Analytics.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.230
And then we created this arty
LED representation of it.

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.600
So what you see in these
LEDs being lightened up

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.250
is actually real data
from Firebase Analytics,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.595
from the Bingo Blast app.

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:12.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
it's beautiful, too.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.220
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah, it is.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
it's a great way

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.430
to start a
conversation about data

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.300
and take it to the console.

00:02:22.212 --> 00:02:24.670
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: So here you
can see the Firebase Analytics

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.410
dashboard.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.710
You can see the number
of active users.

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.290
They're going up or down.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.000
The average revenue per user.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.250
How many of them have first
opened the application.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.460
So see the growth you have in
terms of application usage.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.620
Their engagement.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.590
How much in-app
purchases they have done.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.410
It's just amazing.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.600
You have all this
data available right

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.490
there in the Firebase
Analytics dashboard.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.865
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's very cool.

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:50.350
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.330
You can scroll down
here, and you can even

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.330
get more information-- the
app version that's out there,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.360
the different device
models being used,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.276
and also the location
in the world.

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:01.250
And also, if I go
down here, you can

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.909
see the country, the region,
the demographics of the users,

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:06.200
and what they're interested in.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.239
It's absolutely amazing.

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.530
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And one of
the things they talked about

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.480
in the overview talk
and in the keynote

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.637
is audiences, and
being able to segment

00:03:15.637 --> 00:03:16.720
by different demographics.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.760
Can you show us that?

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.886
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yeah.

00:03:17.886 --> 00:03:20.420
So you can go in and you
can select Audiences here.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.990
So if anyone did
a purchase which

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.630
was larger than $10
from the country is BR,

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.157
then we want to
target that audience.

00:03:29.157 --> 00:03:30.240
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very good.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.595
Let's take a look
at one more thing,

00:03:31.595 --> 00:03:34.130
and I think this is one of the
highlights of all of Google

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.678
I/O, which is foosball.

00:03:35.678 --> 00:03:36.594
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Sure.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Here's
foosball, and this is Ali.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.305
We found him.

00:03:43.305 --> 00:03:44.930
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
Yeah, we did. [LAUGHS]

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.550
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Ali, you
built this amazing thing

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.100
with some other DevRel folks.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.143
Tell us about it.

00:03:49.143 --> 00:03:51.514
ALI AFSHAR: So it's a
foosball table, essentially.

00:03:51.514 --> 00:03:52.480
TIMOTHY JORDAN: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.880
ALI AFSHAR: When you
play a game of foosball,

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.976
when one team scores,
they press their button.

00:03:55.976 --> 00:03:56.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yeah.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.080
ALI AFSHAR: And that offlays
the score on the table,

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.445
and it puts a request to
Firebase Database, which

00:04:02.445 --> 00:04:03.537
I know you know all about.

00:04:03.537 --> 00:04:04.370
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Yes.

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.560
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN:
And we have triggers

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.630
on that data that then
run and update the score,

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.674
so that we have the High
Score table over that

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:15.090
and the little
lights on the table

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.130
to replace the
abacus-like features

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.430
on the standard foosball table.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.700
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well,
should we play a game?

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.940
ALI AFSHAR: Sure.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:23.814
We could watch those.

00:04:23.814 --> 00:04:26.010
I don't want to
embarrass you too much.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.115
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Oh.

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:27.430
I think you will
embarrass me, but I

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.220
think everybody wants
to see that happen.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.660
So let's grab the next game.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.160
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:50.551 --> 00:04:53.960
MALE SPEAKER: Your
honor, Your Honor.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.090
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, so
that's Firebase foosball.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.910
I wouldn't say a fair match,
but certainly a decisive one.

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.760
