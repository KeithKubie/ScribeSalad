00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.333
No single tool in
the human arsenal

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:18.300
explains our existence
more than fire.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.633
One of the things we
talk about in the show

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:22.800
is that on the one hand,
fire is one of the most

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.567
destructive forces, right?

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:26.400
Like you can cook your
food on the one hand,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.433
but you can also like
burn your village.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.300
Early humans quickly
discovered that fire

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.066
was a very destructive force.

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:40.600
At the same time, however, when
domesticated, when harnessed,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.767
it eventually would lead us
to power our jet engines,

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:48.767
you know, controlled
explosions even in a car

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:50.700
is what makes engines work.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.300
And so it's this capacity that
human beings have to harness,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.133
to creatively harness
potentially destructive forces

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:04.066
and use them towards creative
ends that I think is amazing.

00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:07.867
[explosion]

00:01:09.934 --> 00:01:11.867
We are a fire species.

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:14.934
And these are the stories
that have made us human.

00:01:14.934 --> 00:01:18.567
This is our evolution,
the never-ending journey.

00:01:18.567 --> 00:01:24.033
We have only our past to help
us navigate and face our future.
