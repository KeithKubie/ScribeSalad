(singing)

00:00:07.306 --> 00:00:08.708
What the...

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.476
Guys!
- Huh?

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.178
- Everything okay, buddy?

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:16.015 align:end position:100%
- Did one of you
happen to use my towel again?

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.583
- Oh, come on!

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.519
Why do you always
have to blame us?

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.088
- Uh, maybe it's because
you're the ones

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:25.491
with the oozing purple
back sores!

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:27.226
- Well, that's--
Good point.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:28.895
- You need to respect
my things, okay?

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:30.096
I mean,
how would you like it

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:32.398
if I just messed
with your stuff all the time?

00:00:32.431 --> 00:00:33.933
Huh? What's this here, huh?
- [gasps]

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:35.001
- I think I'll mess with it.
- No, no, Jeff!

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:37.336
- Oh, doesn't feel so nice,
does it?

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:39.205
[overlapping shouting]

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.177
- Universal peace is possible.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.847
And the plans for it
are all right here.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.949
[all screaming]

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.353
[drums beating]

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:01.027
- Earth will pay!

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.362
[all cheering]

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.597
- Whew, we got lucky.
