00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, you may actually remember the first postulate from Unit 4.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Let's say you wake up in a train but this isn't just any train--this is the train of physics.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the thing that's so nice about the train of physics is that it has a completely smoother ride,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
it's silent, and the track is completely straight,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
also the windows are blacked out, so you can't see outside.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Let's say you just woke up in this train and you don't know if it's still,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
if it's at rest or if it's moving in a constant speed.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
My question is what experiment can you do to determine if the train is moving at a constant speed

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
of it's at rest in the tracks.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Maybe you could drop objects and absorb their trajectory if they fall.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Maybe you could push objects along the floor of the train and maybe by pushing them forwards

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
or pushing them backwards, you can see something different if the train is moving.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Or maybe you can hang a pendulum from the ceiling and if the train is moving forward,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
may be the pendulum would behave in some strange way.

00:00:54.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Okay, so I want you to think about these options and select all that apply before you hit submit.
