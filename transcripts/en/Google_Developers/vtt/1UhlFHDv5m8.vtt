VISHAY NIHALANI: Thanks
for coming out today.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.000
My name is Vishay Nihalani.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.770
And I'm joined by Flo Thng.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.595
Flo and I are both product
managers who work

00:00:06.595 --> 00:00:09.440
at Google on AdMob.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.100
So just by show of hands, how
many of you here are familiar

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.530
with AdMob?

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.510
And how many of you are
app developers?

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.010
Excellent.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.640
And how many of you app
developers have actually

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.310
included AdMob in one of your
applications, either to

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.785
monetize or use AdMob
to promote?

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.210
FLORENCE THNG: Yay!

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.000
VISHAY NIHALANI: Well, it's
great to see that so many of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.360
you are active and
have used AdMob.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.440
You guys are at the center of
a thriving mobile ecosystem.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.730
And we're really proud
to be part of that.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.590
Every day we see that users are
downloading more and more

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.580
applications and spending
more time in those

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.100
applications as well.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.380
So at AdMob, our goal is to help
be a partner for you and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.780
help you promote and monetize
your application successfully.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.430
The pace of growth
is absolutely

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.780
staggering with apps.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.960
And no doubt, that growth
creates some interesting

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.810
challenges.

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.890
At AdMob, we see three
major challenges.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.050
These are around discovery,
monetization, and the user

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.800
experience.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.620
There are now over 1.6 million
applications across the Google

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.200
Play and iOS app stores
combined.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.880
That's great choice for users.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.740
But what does that mean for
you as an app developer?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.620
As an app developer, that
means that you have to

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.370
constantly jockey for place in
the marketplace rankings in

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.420
order to get your app in
front of your users.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.860
So it's important to be
incredibly deliberate about

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.920
how you promote your
app to your users.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.430
On the monetization side, as
your user base grows, you

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.370
expect your revenue
to grow with it.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:43.720
And doing that might
involve working

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.070
with multiple ad networks.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.090
But working with multiple ad
networks can be challenging

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.990
both technically and
operationally.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.020
And on the user experience side,
it's important to be

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.020
tactful about how you show
ads to your users.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.780
A bad experience can ruin
the user's experience.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.040
It can put off your existing
users from using your app.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.120
And it can turn away new users,
if they see bad reviews

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.139
in the app store.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.880
And as a developer, you're
including content from

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.340
third-party sources.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.960
So you want to make sure that
the content that shows up in

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.510
your application enhances
your brand, rather

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.850
than tarnishes it.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.230
You want to make sure that the
ads that show up are relevant,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.425
engaging, and appropriate
for your users.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.720
So at AdMob, we have large
teams that are focused on

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.170
solving some of these
challenges for you.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.630
On the discovery front, we're
working with Google Play to

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.580
help drive more app downloads.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.430
We just announced that there are
a bit over 48 billion app

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.670
downloads through Google Play.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.100
This is tremendous.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.480
On the monetization front, we're
committed to driving

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.420
more app spend into
mobile apps.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.540
Just this year, we announced a
partnership with AdWords to

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.250
allow the over one million
advertisers in AdWords to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.490
reach your users
in mobile apps.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.530
This is just the first step to
opening the floodgates of

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:04.680
monetization.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.550
And we hope to see tremendous
growth in this area.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.720
And of course, we want to help
preserve the user experience.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.270
We have a team at AdMob that's
working on building innovative

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.170
new ad formats that help
preserve the user's experience

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.660
within your application.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.220
We're building ad formats that
inherently verify that the

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.310
user is actually interested in
the ad content before kicking

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.590
them out of your app and
onto the landing page.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.160
So with an eye toward solving
some of these challenges, I'm

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.820
really excited to announce the
launch of a brand new AdMob.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.930
This new AdMob is laser-focused
on apps.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.490
At the same time, we've brought
the power of AdSense

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.220
and AdWords to mobile apps.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.180
We've leveraged more than a
decade of innovation and

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.480
experience to bring you the
scale and reliability that

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.200
Google offers across all
of its ads products.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.360
Our goal is to make it
incredibly simple for you to

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.350
promote and monetize
your applications.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.050
The idea is to make it very
simple for you to promote and

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.980
monetize so that you, as an
lone app developer with an

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.890
idea, can go to becoming a
team of app developers,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.040
working on building a
sustainable business--

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.320
like Chris, in this video
we're about to show.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.450
We hope that this will be a
familiar aspiration for many

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.792
of you in the audience.

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:21.118

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.760
-Inspiration can come from some
pretty unlikely places.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.950
But once it hits, there's
a lot of work to do.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.870
Designing an app takes months
of programming, problem

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.260
solving, and testing.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.730
But finally, you have something
you're happy with.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.280
And now with AdMob, you can
earn a return on all your

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.020
work, by showing relevant
ads in your app.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.590
Then with AdMob's promotion
tools, watch your app take off

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.510
in a bigger way than you
imagined, from success at

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.850
home, to downloads online.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.870
AdMob connects your app
with millions of

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.110
advertisers and users.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.590
So now that you're earning
money, you have more time to

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.330
build your business, and
get inspired for

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.105
your next great app.

VISHAY NIHALANI: And with that,
I'd like to introduce

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.010
Flo, who's going to talk about
some of the features that

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.596
we've built into the new AdMob
to improve ad promotion.

00:05:22.596 --> 00:05:23.980
FLORENCE THNG: All right.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:24.630
Thanks, Vishay.

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.780
Hi, everyone.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.860
You saw some flashes of the new
interface in the video.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.660
Now let's dive into the demo, so
we can share with you some

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.890
of the exciting features in the
new AdMob to help you get

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.450
more users and make more
money from your apps.

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.870
We redesigned the UI into
three core sections--

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.000
Home, Monetize, and Promote.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.350
Home tab is basically
a dashboard.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.810
We pull together all your stats
in one place to help you

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:54.160
get an overview on how your app
business is performing.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.640
On the top here you can see a
summary on how much money I've

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:02.060
made from my apps today, and how
many downloads that AdMob

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.930
has driven to all my apps.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:10.120
When you scroll down, we can see
more granular stats, like

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.730
RPM, fill rate, conversion.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.910
It's nice to see that we're
getting more and more

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.200
conversion here.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.390
And the best part, my favorite,
is that we've

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.600
organized all of this by apps,
so you can quickly review and

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.380
figure out the action needed.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:27.720
For example, Line Up!

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.850
Is getting quite a
number of users.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:33.300
Maybe it's time for us to
start monetizing it or

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:37.330
Flood-It! here, which is
actually earning me quite a

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.320
bit of money.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.160
So I could consider actually
promoting it even more, which

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.670
brings us to Promote tab.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.820
Promote tab is the hub for
advertising with AdMob.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.085
One of the advantages
of advertising with

00:06:52.085 --> 00:06:54.070
AdMob is our scale.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.080
Because we work with app
developers worldwide, like

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.860
yourself, we have billions of
users in the AdMob network.

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.330
And we've designed it so that
you can create a campaign to

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.900
reach all of these users with
just a few simple steps.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.240
So I'm going to create
a new campaign today.

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.720
And our first step is to
just pick a campaign

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.990
that I want to promote.

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.090
I see a lot of you enjoying your
Chrome Pixel, so I will,

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.230
in honor of that, promote
a Chrome app.

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.260
All you have to do is
just type it in.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:30.370
And you see that we pull
automatically from the two

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.020
major app stores, the most
likely app that I was looking

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.100
for, which in this case
is Chrome Beta.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.180
So I'll just select it--

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:42.200
no need to put any package ID.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.580
And you can do image
ad or text ad.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.680
I didn't have time to
create an image ad.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.970
So I'm going to go with
text ad today.

00:07:48.970 --> 00:07:52.890
Good thing is AdMob is going to
help me make this text ad

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.580
more engaging and informative.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.730
So all I have to do is create
a campaign name, an ad name,

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.790
put a bid for CPC.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.070
So I'll put in $0.08.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:09.280
We pull in the destination URL
directly, save you some steps.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:24.010
And the best part here is we can
preview what it looks like

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.420
in different formats--

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.730
in tablets, in phones.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.460
And we've made this a lot
more informative and

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.610
engaging for the users.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:36.809
Because you can see now there
is that Chrome logo, the

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.169
review information, the
rating information.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:42.620
The goal is to make this app
informative, so that users

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.275
will click on it and
then download.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.650
The next step is figuring out
who do I want to target with

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:54.760
this promotion.

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.980
So because this is I/O specific,
I might want to

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.065
target just people
in San Francisco.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:06.900
And each of these targeting
settings

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.630
is very easily editable.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.780
AdMob, also, because we're
connected to Google Play will

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:18.310
know automatically that Chrome
Beta requires Android 4.0 and

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:20.610
up in order to run properly.

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.540
The OS setting is
correctly set.

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:25.620
This is only going to get
shown to users who are

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.890
eligible to download your app.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:39.410
Now I just need to set a daily
budget, name this, and I've

00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:42.580
just created the Chrome
app promotion.

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.800
Now what I want to know is, how

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.850
effective is this campaign?

00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:51.420
How many users is it going
to generate for me?

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.470
And how much are these
users going to be?

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.630
The good thing is we've
integrated conversion tracking

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.300
into the campaign
creation flow.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:04.650
So if you're promoting an app,
all you have to do is hit

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:06.790
Confirm and Finish here,
and you're all

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:08.160
done for Android app.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.395
Or if you happen to have
analytics data, and you know

00:10:11.395 --> 00:10:14.470
what is the value for conversion
for your app, you

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:16.320
can put in this optional
value here.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.570
I'm going to put $2.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.650
And just with that, AdMob up
will automatically start

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.260
tracking the users who have
clicked on your app and then

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.420
downloaded it.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:32.880
For iOS, it is a little
bit more involved.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.350
You will have to include a
short-code snippet in your

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:40.525
app, which you can access from
the App Conversion tab.

00:10:40.525 --> 00:10:44.080
If you click on Edit, this
nice little pencil here,

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.610
you'll be able to get
the snippet here.

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.070
And we've made it easy, because
you can just email it

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.000
to yourself, which I'm
going to skip now.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.420
If you're an app developer--

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.950
and I'm sure many of you
actually have multiple apps,

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.520
not just one--

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.620
you can jump start your new app
by cross-promoting it to

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.370
your existing user base.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.760
And AdMob allows you to do that
easily with house ads.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.110
So when you create a new
campaign, you can also select

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.550
to create a house ad.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:20.880
For example, if I want to
promote the Chrome app here to

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:23.855
users, I'm going to just
do the same thing.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.120
All of this is the
same as before.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.260
The one new step is, we now
display all of the ad units

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:45.360
that you have created
for your app.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.790
So I'm going to select Color
Drips and Flood It!, which

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.570
means that this Chrome promotion
is going to show in

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.280
these two games.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.530
I save it.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.980
And because this is a house ad,
and we're promoting this

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:08.090
to your own inventory, you don't
need to set a budget.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:11.940
We can actually do
this for free.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:14.010
Next is to just allocate
your inventory.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.530
So don't forget to do
this so that your

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:17.780
campaign will start serving.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:20.210
Once everything is set up,
I've set up a house ad

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.680
campaign, regular campaign,
you can monitor the

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.950
performances of all of these
campaigns through our

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:28.760
Reporting setting, which is
in this All Apps table.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.930
So I can easily see which one of
my apps is converting well,

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:37.210
how much it is costing me to
convert, and what is the cost

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:37.820
per conversion.

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.700
So this is really cool.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.010
Because I've set up conversion
tracking for all of these

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.320
apps, I'll be able to know how
much it's costing me to get

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.690
somebody to download
a Chrome browser.

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:49.440
The next step is
to optimize it.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.860
So if you click on any one of
these apps, you be able to see

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.380
that I've set up multiple
campaigns.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.810
Some of them are doing better
than the others.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.950
And I've set up multiple apps,
and some are converting better

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.240
than the others.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.450
So I might want to actually
optimize.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:09.160
And we allow inline editing.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.630
So I can just go in here and
say, maybe I need to actually

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.330
bid higher and get
better users.

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:20.140
Or I can go to Campaign tab and
say, the second campaign

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:21.070
is doing really well.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.775
I want to actually increase
the budget.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.080
This is all, however,
quite manual.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.560
You have to actually go in
there, figure out which one is

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.430
doing well, maybe create
your own model.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:36.340
So today we're really excited
to announce a new feature in

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.800
AdMob, which is called
Conversion Optimizers.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:43.220
Conversion Optimizers will allow
you to set the bid based

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:45.690
on a target cost per
acquisition.

00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.520
Basically, you just tell AdMob
how much you're willing to pay

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:51.740
for users, and let us do
the heavy lifting.

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:54.010
We are going to look at your
conversion history.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:56.880
So we look at your campaign,
which one is performing well.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:59.620
And we look at a bunch
of other signals.

00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:02.270
And we have very complex models
in the back-end--

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:02.890
all of these.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.990
So then we can predict when an
impression comes out whether

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:07.790
it's going to be very
valuable for you.

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.730
So we're going to bid
higher for it.

00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:11.900
And then for the less-valuable
click, we're going to bid

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:15.140
lower for it.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:19.420
In order to do this, you just
have to click Edit on the

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:26.510
Campaigns, sorry.

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:48.190
OK, so when you click
on the campaign--

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.270
we're having some network
problems.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:54.140
But you should be able to
actually switch bidding from

00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.350
bidding on CPC to bidding on--

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.120
I'm going to show it to you
a different way, sorry.

00:15:12.490 --> 00:15:13.890
This is what happens
when we run a

00:15:13.890 --> 00:15:16.090
live demo, quite exciting.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.290
So you can see here, you will be
able to switch your bidding

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:31.780
option from focusing on clicks
to focusing on conversion.

00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:34.960
You can put in a target cost
per acquisition here.

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.150
I'm putting in $1.08.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.950
That's how much I'm willing to
pay to get a user on Chrome,

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:41.230
because my ARPU is really,
really high.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.680
I can put in a lower number and
actually reduce my cost

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.680
per acquisition.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.810
Just keep in mind that means the
number of downloads that

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.920
I'm going to get is
going to be lower.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.180
If I had put in a larger number,
like $2, I will get a

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:54.440
lot more downloads.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:57.430
What we recommend is actually
put in a conversion cost close

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.740
to what you have right now.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.730
So Conversion Optimizer, it's
important to keep in mind it's

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:09.850
not the same as a guaranteed
cost per install.

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:11.230
Results are going to vary.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.090
However, most people who have
implemented it have seen

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:15.800
really great results.

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.740
So our early testers have
seen reduction in

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.780
conversion costs by 20%.

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:24.660
We work with GREE, one of the
game developers in Japan.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.760
They implemented Conversion
Optimizers across multiples of

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.590
their campaign.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.790
And they were able to reduce
their cost of user

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.630
acquisition by 50%.

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.030
Basically the same budget, they
get twice as many users.

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:38.930
Who doesn't love that?

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:42.180
So with this, hopefully all of
you now can create your own

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.640
app promotion campaign.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.350
We strongly suggest when you
do that, set up conversion

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.610
tracking so you'll be able to
know how much it costs to get

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.480
your users.

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.620
And please try out Conversion
Optimizer, so AdMob can help

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:54.070
you optimize your budget.

00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:57.380
With that, I'll hand it back to
Vishay, who is going to go

00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:59.460
through Monetization tab,
and help you make more

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.710
money with your app.

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:07.030
VISHAY NIHALANI: Thanks, Flo.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:10.869
So now that you've promoted
your application, you've

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:14.079
gotten tons and tons of
downloads, the next step is to

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:16.040
consider monetizing
those users.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.450
So I'll quickly walk you through
what it's like to set

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.440
up monetization in one
of your applications.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.530
So let's say we want
to monetize the

00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:26.569
same Chrome Beta app.

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:31.360
So I first select
the application.

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:33.850
As you can see, one of the
changes from the legacy AdMob

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.340
to this new interface is that
your inventory is actually

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:39.410
organized by application.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:41.880
This is great for you because
it adds organization.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.120
But it's also great because
it allows us to run some

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.710
interesting quality models to
really optimize your apps,

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.020
rather than arbitrary
ad units.

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.740
So let's say we want to
set up an ad unit.

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.040
It's quite simple.

00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.260
Let's say you have a banner
on the bottom screen.

00:17:59.350 --> 00:18:02.130
You can create this ad unit, see
a nice preview of the ad

00:18:02.130 --> 00:18:04.160
unit, save it.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.810
And just like on the promote
side, you can easily email the

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.150
instructions on how to
integrate the ad

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:10.510
unit to your developer.

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.050
So once you've done that and
released your application,

00:18:16.050 --> 00:18:18.760
you'll start to see revenue pour
into your application.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.900
It's fairly simple.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.610
Now the thing to consider is
making sure that you're

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.200
showing the right ads
to the right users.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.160
So with our new Publisher
Controls feature, we allow you

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:32.690
to very easily categorize all
the ads that are showing up in

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:36.770
your application and allow or
block them by category.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:40.440
So as you can see in this
interface, we launched the

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.570
ability for you to sort your
ads into hundreds of

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:43.720
categories.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.730
So you can make sure that
only appropriate ads

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.330
show to your audience.

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:49.880
We also have the ability to
see how much revenue is

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.670
actually coming from each
category of ad, so that you

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.930
can make an intelligent decision
on the risks versus

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:59.340
rewards of blocking certain
categories.

00:18:59.340 --> 00:19:01.810
Many of you also may have
a concern about showing

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:05.320
competitors' applications'
advertisements in your app.

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:08.770
So with this new feature, we
allow you to actually block

00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:11.480
ads by the landing page URL.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.430
So for example, if you're Chrome
and you want to block--

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:18.880
let's use an arbitrary
example.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.890
Let's say you want to block
a particular game.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.620
You can grab the URL from the
iTunes or Google Play store,

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.820
drop it in here, and
click Block.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.660
And we'll make sure that that
competitor's apps don't show

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.980
up in your application.

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:37.950
So now that you've set up your
publisher controls and your

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:41.590
filters, you may find your
inventory start to grow.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:44.120
And in that case, you may want
to work with multiple ad

00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:46.330
networks to monetize
your inventory.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.470
So we've made it incredibly
simple to add multiple ad

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.840
networks to your ad source.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.640
So assuming that you've dropped
the SDKs into your

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.840
application already, it's
very straightforward

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:56.890
to add more ad networks.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:19:58.490
Because each ad unit
by default is

00:19:58.490 --> 00:20:01.210
configured for mediation.

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.700
So to do that, simply add
another ad network.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:08.995
Let's say in this case we want
to add the AdMob eCPM Floor.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.160
Click Save.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.810
And essentially, the way
mediation works is, we'll send

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:19.770
the request to the
highest-paying ad network.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:22.980
If that network doesn't fill the
ad request, we'll kick it

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.640
down to the next highest-paying
ad network and

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.410
so on, in order to maximize your
revenue per impression.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.830
So simply set up what you've
been getting paid for each ad

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:36.820
network, and by default
we'll start to

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.070
optimize your revenue.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.730
So we hope these features will
be incredibly useful for you

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:47.140
as you monetize and promote
your application.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.950
Just to recap, we launched five
key improvements in this

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:51.760
new interface.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:53.610
These are smarter app promotion
and Conversion

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.170
Optimizer, simplified mediation,
robust add

00:20:57.170 --> 00:21:00.680
filtering, intelligent
reporting, and some of you in

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.440
the audience may be really
excited to hear that for

00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.900
developers who are outside of
the United States, we are

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:12.700
launching local currency
payments all over the world.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:14.720
We hope that this will make it
easier for you guys to get

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.090
paid and to start spending
your money.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.620
So with that, I'd like to show
you some of our really

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.790
exciting new ad formats, which
we believe are really

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:25.760
innovative and will really catch
your user's attention.

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:31.780
So the first--

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:32.710
I often play this game.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.420
It's called LineUp.

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:41.290
And the basic concept is to
clear all these blocks away.

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.365
I can play this game while
I'm waiting in line at

00:21:44.365 --> 00:21:47.500
the cafes at Google.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.350
And so, in between levels--
let's say I'm

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:50.690
done with this level--

00:21:50.690 --> 00:21:51.940
I start a new game.

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:58.275
I think we're having some
network connectivity issues.

00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.740
There we go.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:05.490
And so just like with TrueView
on the web, we've introduced

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:06.890
TrueView on the mobile apps.

00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:10.840
So in this particular case, in
between the levels is the

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.570
natural time to show an ad.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:15.050
We can actually present this
video ad to the user.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.800
They can watch the ad, see if
they're interested in it.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.930
If they are, then they can
keep watching the video.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.160
In this case, I've
seen this ad.

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.660
It's pretty cool.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:25.230
It's the Chrome ad from Paris.

00:22:25.230 --> 00:22:26.940
It's pretty sweet.

00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:28.250
But I've already
seen it before.

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:29.590
So I want to skip it, and
I want to get back to

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:30.780
playing this game.

00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:33.000
So to do that, I just click
the Skip Ad button.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.070
And just like that, I'm
back in the game.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.850
So we hope that ad formats like
this one will help to

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:43.240
preserve the user experience,
and also increase the

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.120
advertiser ROI, so that they're
only receiving clicks,

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.850
and they're only receiving
users who are actually

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:50.720
interested in the content
they have on offer.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.560
So with that, I'd like to show
you all the story of Tony

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.730
Fingerroos.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.390
You might have heard of him
from the game, "Hill Climb

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:02.020
Racing." In three months,
working long hours by himself,

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.530
he built an app that now has
tens of millions of downloads.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:07.630
We believe our new platform
will help create many more

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:09.330
success stories just
like this one.

00:23:18.583 --> 00:23:20.540
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:23.090
-I like cars a lot myself.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.483
That's one of my hobbies.

00:23:24.483 --> 00:23:28.480
I own this old Toyota Supra,
which we built the engine and

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.880
all that stuff into.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.980
I guess it's a little bit in me
that I want to do something

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:38.605
on my own, build things, even
if it's a game or a car.

00:23:38.605 --> 00:23:40.040
My name is Tony Fingerroos.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:43.020
I come from Oulu, We have
a start-up there called

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:43.810
Fingersoft.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:46.640
It creates mobile
games and apps.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.270
After developing several years
for plasticine game that was

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:52.300
still unpublished, I just wanted
to see some results and

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.790
get my work shown to people
around the world.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:59.200
So I started working on "Hill
Climb Racing" alone.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:02.040
I spent like three months
working on it,

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.620
about 16 hours a day.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.070
The character itself, it's
actually drawn by my fiance.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:13.380
"Hill Climb Raising" has over
60 million downloads.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.280
That's quite a lot.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:17.610
And that's really started
generating revenue.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.910
About 40% comes from
advertisements.

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.400
And AdMob is our cornerstone.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.600
With AdMob, you have several
different ways to show

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:27.590
advertisements.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.630
So we placed them on the
bottom of the screen.

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.430
And during game play, we hide
all the apps so it doesn't

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.940
interrupt the user at all.

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.930
We have users all around
the world.

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:37.080
So we have the field

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.770
advertisements in global scale.

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:42.160
And I think AdMob is doing
a real good job.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:45.770
I got enough money from AdMob so
I could develop Fingersoft

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:47.760
applications and games
full time.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.882
If I show it like this--

00:24:49.882 --> 00:24:50.780
is it?

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:51.560
-Yeah, that's great.

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.100
-This is the office
we started, just a

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:55.100
room from my place.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.430
You can see me there.

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:58.530
This is the new office.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.340
There's the workstations.

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.040
That's the pool table.

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.110
Then of course, the Finnish
style sauna, which we can

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:08.050
relax in and design new
products and ideas--

00:25:08.050 --> 00:25:11.060
so have a few beers
and take it easy.

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.560
I think it's awesome when you
get to create something, and

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.520
you get it finished.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.670
And then you receive
customer feedback.

00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:19.030
And if they like it,
it's really nice.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.320
When people like it, and we
liked it, that's great.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.930
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:31.680
VISHAY NIHALANI: So I hope you
guys are all as excited to

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:34.220
access the new AdMob as
I am to share it.

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.900
We'll be rolling out this new
interface to new users.

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.165
And if you have an existing
account, be on the lookout for

00:25:39.165 --> 00:25:41.280
an upgrade notification.

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.290
You can upgrade to the new
AdMob without making any

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:44.930
changes to your existing
applications.

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:45.730
So you don't have
to go through an

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:48.130
extensive release process.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:26:01.080
And with that, we'll turn it
over to Q&amp;A. Go ahead.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.330
I think there's a mic there.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.480
AUDIENCE: While we're waiting,
just a quick one.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.890
If you're just totally
new to ads--

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:13.980
you've been a developer for a
while, but totally new to the

00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:14.830
whole ad world--

00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:19.640
what's a good resource just to
start to understand what CPM

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.450
and all that stuff means?

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:22.280
VISHAY NIHALANI: We
have extensive

00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.360
documentation on our website.

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.280
I can point you to the
support site offline.

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:34.610
AUDIENCE: My question is more
on the videos-- so the

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:37.120
inner-stitched video ads
between say a click and

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.880
something else that's coming
next, as you showed there.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.150
How do you--

00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:43.160
is there a way that
that works?

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.310
I don't know, maybe this is
more of a double-click

00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:49.760
question, but can you run your
own video ads within that?

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.160
Is there a way to control
that inventory?

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.240
Is that all sourced inventory
from AdWords or what

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:56.940
you guys are doing?

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.430
VISHAY NIHALANI: Right, so today
all the inventory is

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:02.200
sourced from AdWords and
the YouTube network.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.600
But we're working on ways
to improve our house ads

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.200
functionality to allow you to
serve your own video ads into

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:08.720
applications as well.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.970
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:14.490
AUDIENCE: My question
is about--

00:27:14.490 --> 00:27:17.610
you mentioned that you're
enabling payments in local

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:20.450
currencies in quite a
number of countries.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.800
I'm interested in knowing
what countries are

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:24.570
you covering in Africa?

00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:25.790
VISHAY NIHALANI: That's
a great question.

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:26.780
We have a huge list.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.690
I don't know it off the top my
head, but I could certainly

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:31.030
point to the resources.

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:33.680
We are launching local currency
payments just all

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.190
over the world.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:38.050
So we'll definitely
let you know if

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.300
your country's supported.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:44.880
AUDIENCE: Hey, I have a
question regarding the

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.640
conversion tracking.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.950
Let's say I'm an advertiser,
and I want to

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.370
advertise at AdMob.

00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:51.640
But I'm also advertising
in other ad networks.

00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:55.220
So how well does the new AdMob
work with third parties for

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:59.180
conversion tracking and all
these kind of things?

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.505
FLORENCE THNG: So if I get the
question correctly, does the

00:28:01.505 --> 00:28:04.450
new AdMob support conversion
tracking with other networks?

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.480
Is that the question?

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so when I want
to set-up AdMob, if I can use

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:11.890
third-party tools for conversion
tracking, so I can

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.475
[INAUDIBLE] or if I can AdMob to
also track the conversions

00:28:14.475 --> 00:28:15.270
from other networks.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:16.480
FLORENCE THNG: That's
a great question.

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.780
So for now, we only support
tracking, conversion

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.670
tracking for AdMob.

00:28:21.670 --> 00:28:24.780
And the URL conversion tracking
with third-party URL

00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.110
we're going to support very
quickly after launch.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.160
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.280
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have a question

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.460
regarding the filters.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.600
Is it possible to use a wild
card stew, a block string of

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.640
keywords, or does it have
to be that exact URL?

00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.560
Because just in case that URL
changes on the other end from

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.650
the advertiser.

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:45.810
VISHAY NIHALANI: That's
a great question.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:49.980
For now we don't support just
filtering by keywords.

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:51.410
But the URLs are pretty--

00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.200
we use regular expressions
to match patterns.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:57.440
So if you put in a regex,
it should work.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:59.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:28:59.940 --> 00:29:02.520
AUDIENCE: So, I'm pretty
interested in the video ads.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.980
So if you're just [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:09.330
the video in like for five
seconds, so that's not counted

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:11.990
as a valid ad, right?

00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:14.880
So you don't have to
pay for that, or--?

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.700
VISHAY NIHALANI:
That's correct.

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:16.530
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:19.840
And another question is the
in-house marketing.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:23.700
So we should be in the same
AdMob account, right?

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.360
So if I want to do the
in-house ads, so

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.530
we should be in--

00:29:28.530 --> 00:29:30.360
FLORENCE THNG: Yes, house ad
will be in the same account.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:40.000
AUDIENCE: Yes, but sometimes in
our firm, each person has

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.670
his very own account.

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:45.860
So how to solve a problem
like that?

00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.060
FLORENCE THNG: That's
a good question.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.160
If you stop by the sandbox
later, I'll actually just

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.240
address that with you.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.490
AUDIENCE: All right, thanks.

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:03.160
VISHAY NIHALANI: Cool.

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.440
Well, thanks, everyone,
for coming out.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:04.930
FLORENCE THNG: Actually,
I think there's--

00:30:04.930 --> 00:30:07.840
VISHAY NIHALANI: Oh,
one more question?

00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:12.930
AUDIENCE: Is there possible to
insert animated ad banner?

00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:14.770
FLORENCE THNG: Yes, animated
banner will be supported.

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.470
AUDIENCE: Which format?

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:25.610
For example, can I insert
a Flash ad?

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:26.470
FLORENCE THNG: I can
get back to you.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:28.761
I don't think-- it's just a
regular format I don't think

00:30:28.761 --> 00:30:30.011
Flash will be--

00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:39.365
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you have any
recommendations on different

00:30:39.365 --> 00:30:40.000
ad formats?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.990
So between banners,
interstitials--

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:47.310
what performs the best for
different types of apps?

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:50.150
VISHAY NIHALANI: Yeah, that's
a great question.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:53.000
I think there are a couple
things to keep in mind.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.240
Typically, you want to keep the
ad placements in places

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:56.410
where it makes sense
for your users.

00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.710
So for example, if you're
playing with a game, as you

00:30:58.710 --> 00:31:02.730
saw from the video, Tony's
video, you want to keep the ad

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:04.150
in a way that it's not going
to interfere with the

00:31:04.150 --> 00:31:04.780
experience.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.350
So, in his example, he's got
it on the menu screens.

00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.220
For different ads, for different
apps, different

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.580
things work.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.920
We typically find that
interstitials have higher

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.850
conversion rates and
click-through rates, just

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.160
because there's more
of a canvas to

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.170
create an engaging ad.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:23.700
But it really depends
on the application.

00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.550
So definitely play around
and experiment.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.310
AUDIENCE: OK, hi.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.600
I'm not really [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.820
with AdMob, but I have a
question about offline

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:40.430
application and your AdMob.

00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:43.765
We have a connection for the
people who don't have a Wi-Fi

00:31:43.765 --> 00:31:45.640
or a connection.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.420
What happens?

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:49.290
Can you explain it
a little bit?

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:50.690
VISHAY NIHALANI: Yeah, so,
that's a great question.

00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:53.930
We've heard this feature request
a number of times.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.730
We've nothing to announce
just yet.

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.130
But we're certainly thinking
about this use case.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:00.030
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:01.280
Thank you.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.330
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm curious about
whether this system is

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:10.870
compatible with these
regulations that are coming

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:15.370
into effect in July related to
advertising to children under

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:20.350
the age of 13, or whether you
have, in fact, terms of

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.910
service that would say you can't
use this system with

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.460
children under the age of 13.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:30.280
It's C-O-P-P-A, COPPA,
regulation.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.080
VISHAY NIHALANI: That's
a great question.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.600
I'll have to follow-up with
you offline on that one.

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:37.680
In general, our goal is to--

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.200
we always keep the user
experience at the forefront of

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.140
what we do.

00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.590
We want to make sure that we're
compliant with all of

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:48.860
the legal regulations, and just
keeping users in mind as

00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.110
we develop these ads.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:32:59.220
Cool, thanks.

00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:00.010
Well, thanks a lot
for coming out.

00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:02.190
Definitely come and visit
us at the I/O booth

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:03.660
we have just outside.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:06.470
And we're happy to answer any
more questions you might have.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:07.720
Thanks.
