00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.770
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:08.070
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe: Good morning.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.370
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:10.670
&gt;&gt; Jane McAuliffe:
I'm Jane McAuliffe.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.380
I am the director of national
and international outreach

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.140
at the Library of Congress and
it's my pleasure and privilege

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.120
to welcome you to the Library of
Congress National Book Festival

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.370
and to one of its two
stages that we have devoted

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.710
to the art of fiction writing.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.190
National and international outreach
is the division of the Library

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.420
of Congress that is responsible
for this wonderful event.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.870 position:56%
The division was created just a year
ago to enhance the library's efforts

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.340
to serve Congress, the
American people, and the world

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.120
and to foster partnerships
with other cultural

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.270
and academic institutions; both
in this country and abroad.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.710
The Library of Congress is thrilled

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.660
to present this annual
event for the 16 time.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.400
We certainly could not offer
the free celebration of books

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.780
and reading that this is without
the generosity of our donors.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.000
The Library of Congress is your
nation's library and I welcome you

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:29.010
to visit us in person on Capitol
Hill or online at www.loc.gov.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.380
Today we have an outstanding
line up of authors on this stage.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.190
They are among our finest writers

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.640
and their subjects range
thematically from the intersection

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.270
of rural life and faith to science
fiction, from espionage and romance

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.240
to stories based on
real life events.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.360
The theme of this year's festival
is journeys as represented

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.270
by the art on our festival poster.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.040
Books take us on journeys, often

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.570
to places we would
otherwise never venture.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:14.370
Fiction in particular challenges
us with new perspectives

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.890
and opens worlds to explore.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.280
In addition to the author
presentations you will hear today,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.510
please visit the expo
floor at the lower level

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.720 position:56%
where you will find family friendly
activities, you'll find the Pavilion

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.560
of States, and you will find
the Library of Congress Pavilion

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.970
where you can learn more
about your national library.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.340
Now it is my pleasure to introduce
our next speaker for the first time

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.150
to a National Book Festival stage.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.600
Avid reader, children's librarian,
professor, deputy commissioner,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.150
and then chief librarian of the
Chicago Public Library and CEO

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.070
of Baltimore's Enoch
Pratt Free Library.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:03.220 position:56%
Please welcome to the podium, a
woman who recently added a new title

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.740
to her resume, ladies and gentlemen
I present you the 14 Librarian

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.540
of Congress, Dr Carla Hayden.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:20.350
[ Applause ]

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.150
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Wow.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.260
[ Applause ]

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.560
Thank you Jane.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.590
Welcome to all of you
the 16 annual Library

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.830
of Congress National Book Festival
and my first official event.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.010
Can you imagine what this
is like for a librarian?

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.310
[ Laughter ]

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.800
This is a marvelous, marvelous way
to start my tenure and the theme

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.510
of the festival this year
is journeys and I'm going

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.550
to be inviting everyone to journey
with me on Twitter as I discover

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.340
so many of the treasures
of the Library of Congress.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.900
So we're starting, in fact
we've already started today.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.120
Stephen King has already
retweeted [laughter].

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:18.630
So it's going to be something, but
this today it is a special pleasure

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.020
to be able to present the
Library of Congress' prize

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.620
for American fiction, which
recognizes the contributions

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:37.100
of an American literary author
whose body of work is distinguished

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.280
and the prize has been given to
such notables as Tony Morrison,

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.400
Phillip Roth, John Gresham,
and this year the Library

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:57.180
of Congress is presenting the award
to a person that many of you know

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:03.620
and who has touched
readers around the world.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.510
The recipient of this year's
award is Miss Marilynne Robinson.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:28.040
[ Applause ]

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.870
Because we are live on Facebook,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:36.780
I am going to just give you just
a little bit about Miss Robinson

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.750
because she is the author of
books that have touched us

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:48.560
for over two decades and she
has been an award winner of,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:58.400
and I'm looking at my, look at
these awards; the Pulitzer Prize,

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.650
the Penn, the Hemmingway
Award for First Fiction,

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.370
and then 24 years later for Gilead,

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.680
she received the National
Book Critics Circle Award

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.350
and the Los Angeles Times Prize.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:18.950
She is what you would call the
epitome of an award winning author

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:25.480
and she was, in this instance,
roundly and unanimously nominated

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.130
for this prize by a jury made
up of Nobel Prize winners,

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.980 position:56%
Man Booker Prize winners, prominent
literary critics, and former winners

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:38.170
of the prize, the ones
that I just mentioned.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:42.600
And as acting Librarian of
Congress David Mow said at the time

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.670
with the depth and
resonance of her novels,

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:49.490
Marilynne Robinson
captures the American soul.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.680 position:56%
We are proud at the Library of
Congress to confer this prize on her

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.370
and her extraordinary work.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.120
Please join me in celebrating
the winner of the 2016 Library

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:04.510
of Congress Prize for American
Fiction, Miss Marilynne Robinson.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:31.250
[ Applause ]

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:32.550
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: [Inaudible]
what a joy

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.180
and what a privilege
and an honor to be here.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.270
I'm someone who has
been a devoted fan for,

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:44.070
since 1980, since your first novel.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:48.420
I have followed your work as so
many of us in this audience have

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.660
and beyond this audience watching.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.960
It's very rare, I think, that
we have an American author,

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:04.080
contemporary American author
who digs down and speaks to us

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.940
or doesn't really speak
to us, shows us and brings

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.150
out in us somehow things of
conscious and loneliness and faith

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:21.060
and love in the way that
Marilynne Robinson has.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:24.920
I have to admit that I
am, at full disclosure,

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.880
an avid partisan, unabashed
partisan.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:35.150
I was on the jury, I was fortunate
to be on the jury as the chair

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:38.900
of the Pulitzer committee that
gave Marilynne Robinson the prize

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.000 position:56%
for Gilead, of which I'm very proud.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.190
A wonderful, wonderful
resonant book.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:47.700
Marilynne, I wanted to ask you, I
wanted to talk to you a little bit

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.810 position:56%
about how it is, these unforgettable
characters that you, that you paint

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:59.090
for us, that you engrave really
very deeply in our souls.

00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:04.690
These are characters
that come, obviously,

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:10.340 position:56%
from not only from your imagination,
but also from a deep sense

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.580
of your spiritual self and perhaps

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:19.010
of the spirit of all
of us in a sense.

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.310
Can you tell us a little bit
about where these spring from.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:30.860
John Ames, the extraordinary hero
of Gilead and who appears again

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:36.860
in Lila, and appears throughout
in the trilogy really of Gilead

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:41.560
and then Home and then
Lila, the most recent novel.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:45.670
All of these characters, it's a
little bit Faulknerian in the sense

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:49.310
that we go back to Gilead in Iowa.

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.880
Tell us a little bit about
where they come from.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.310
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: You know
I really don't know [laughter].

00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:02.190
I know that's not a terribly useful
response, but it is interesting

00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:07.150
from my point of view that I can't
write unless there is a character

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:08.450
in my mind.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.750
I have to wait for them.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.460
They're not ideas of mine.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:16.370
Somehow, I mean, you know
somehow or other a voice somewhere

00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:22.120
or a character and surprisingly
when I begin to have the conception

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.040
of the character I really know
quite a lot about her or him.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.650
It's an uncanny experience really.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:36.450
I assume that what I do is sort of
watch the world and glean traits,

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.250
mannerisms, and attitudes
and so on out of,

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.530
you know my encounters
with people in general.

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:46.250
Not because I intend to, but you
know things stay in your mind.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:50.410
That's the best I can say actually.

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:52.960
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: How did,
how was it that John Ames,

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:57.540
which is such a distinctive
voice, the pastor of the church,

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.390
one of the churches
because Bouton is a,

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.680 position:56%
is that how you pronounce it Bouton?

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:02.980
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Bouton.

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:04.280
Bouton.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:08.540
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Bouton is fellow
reverend in another church,

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:11.710
but how is, how did you, how
did that voice come to you

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.450
because it's a very distinctive
voice and I think we can all sort

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.190
of hear it and summon
it, your readers.

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:21.780
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Well
I've, it's kind of a long story.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:26.380
I was in a hotel in Province Town.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:32.920 position:56%
I was going to spend Christmas with
my sons, neither of whom was married

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.930
at that time and so I had a
room for me and a suite for them

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:41.720
and an otherwise empty hotel,
on the tip of the Cape.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.890
And it was very beautiful and
they were both delayed coming

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.950
and so I was there in
this solitary hotel

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.350
in this wonderful winter sunlight
streaming into the windows and so,

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:58.770
and I always have a notebook and
a pen with me; you never know

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:02.320
and [laughter] and this
voice, the first sentence

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:10.000
of Gilead is actually the first
thing that came to me in that voice

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.990
and I was surprised frankly because
having only written Housekeeping

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:17.840
at that point, I assumed
that I would always write

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.980
from a [inaudible]
woman's perspective.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:25.400
And then here was this man
[laughter] talking with me

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.510
in effect, you know who had
read all the same books I had.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:33.040
[ Laughter ]

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.390
And it was, I really
enjoyed writing that book.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.440
It was easier than I think
any of my other books

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.170
because I actually positively
enjoyed spending time

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.610
with that voice.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:49.030
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: It's a marvelous
voice and I don't want to suggest

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:54.660
that there's anything
Manichean in your world view,

00:12:54.660 --> 00:12:59.400
but there is a sense, you get a
sense in the book that there's,

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.740
there's, you know there's
the good soul

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:08.460
and then there's the troubled soul
or the difficult life and the,

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:16.130 position:56%
and the good life, the introspective
studied spiritually thoughtful life

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.390
and then this sort of, the
person of abandon a little bit,

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.880
a little on the wild side.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.530
There's that, it's
not black and white.

00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:27.170
I don't want to suggest
that it's black and white,

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:33.840 position:56%
but there's always a sense of a kind
of a struggle between the people

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.390
who have strayed, should we say,
and the people who are trying,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:43.060 position:56%
trying very hard to stay the course.

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:50.690 position:56%
And actually you are someone who is,
you've got your doctorate actually

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.400
in English, I believe, but
someone who has studied theology

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:02.590
and religion for a very long
time and steeped herself in that.

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:08.570
Can you tell us a little bit
about that sense of your,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:13.810
maybe even Biblical sense
of right and wrong and good

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:18.510
and bad and, and grace and evil.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:22.180 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Well I know
that you don't want to be Manichean,

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.590
but you are a little more
Manichean than I am [laugher].

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:33.640
I don't, I mean this may be related
in a way to the way that I think

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.640 position:56%
about my characters is sort of given

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.580
to me rather than inventions
of mine.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:45.510
I don't, you know even Biblically
speaking, you know there are lots

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:50.650 position:56%
of people, you know like David, King
David and so on who err enormously

00:14:50.650 --> 00:14:53.880
and nevertheless very important,
very highly valued people.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.540
I don't think we can actually,
I mean I think that a life

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:05.920 position:56%
like Jack's, shall we say, that,
that encounters a great deal of sort

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.420
of psychological discomfort
and all the rest

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:10.370
of whatever you want to call it.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:13.510
I think if we absolutely
it's precious in a way

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:17.500
as esthetically satisfying
as a life like John Ames,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.710
which basically, what should I say?

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:25.700
He does not expose himself
to a world of temptation

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.000
or [inaudible], what I mean.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.970
He lives in this very aware and
even uncomfortably aware of living

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:38.380
within a very highly defined role
in history and all the rest of it.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:44.370
I don't, I think that there are
very, very many ways for people

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:51.340
to be esthetically
interesting, shall we say and I'm,

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:55.090
my own particular theology suggests
very strongly that God is sensitive

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.770
to these esthetics
and, you know beyond

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:59.820
that I don't particularly judge.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:04.260
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Well I
certainly get that sense.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:08.640
Jack, of course, is the character
who really was present throughout

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:15.960
in a sense at least in, in, as
part of the whole constellation

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:22.390
of the trilogy, but he is
the son of reverend Bouton.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:25.960
I get the feeling though
in Lila, for instance,

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:29.140
I mean here is someone
who one, isn't sure.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:37.560
She's, she's very much
attracted to and even loves

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:44.370
and says she loves John
Ames, Reverend Ames and his,

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:50.110
what he represents and finds
him beautiful in so many ways.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:54.230
We're not sure she's going
to stick with it somehow.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.920
I mean you end the novel
wondering whether she actually

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.990
and she's landed sort of in
this wonderful spot for somebody

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:08.000
who has had as troubled life as
she has and yet there is that,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.430
still that remaining
kind of wildness.

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:13.390
There's a deep goodness in
her too, so I understand

00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:18.420 position:56%
about what you're saying that we are
not all lack of [inaudible] at all,

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:23.540
but Lila, tell us a
little bit about her.

00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:25.210
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Well
you know I, there were things

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:27.060
that I knew about Lila from Gilead.

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:29.560
I mean she's, it's funny
she's sort of there

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.230
in my peripheral vision, you know?

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:38.000
But I mean it was consistent
with what I knew about her,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.700
that she had to be outside
the kind of acculturation

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.210
that produced people
like John Ames, you know?

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:48.800
He has a whole vocabulary
to describe and to,

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:53.270
you know to explore things
that are important to him.

00:17:53.270 --> 00:18:00.680
I wanted her to be in her own
way without any of that apparatus

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.020
of learnedness and
tradition and so on.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.840
Be a good theologian as he is?

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.620
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And she is.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.850
She is. She is the one who is
reading the Bible and telling

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:16.530
at least the reader in, in,
in the words of the book.

00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:17.830
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Yes, yes.

00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:20.580
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah and that's
wonderful, sort of I think,

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:27.470
device because she, she very much
a deeply spiritual person herself.

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.150
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: And
one thing I liked about making

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:34.480
that character is that, you know
when you really look at the Bible,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:38.090
the orphans and the widows
and so on are really the text,

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:40.850
you know how well are
they cared for?

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:44.940
How much are they acknowledged
and so on and all the Kings and so

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:49.960
on just rise and fall depending on
their adequacy to this population

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.720
that would be like Lila, you know?

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.110
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: So Lila,
for those of you who have,

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.450
you really must read this
book and the whole trilogy,

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:06.230
but Lila is someone who has had
a very difficult past and poverty

00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:13.000
and very gritty sort of childhood
and young womanhood and she comes

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.980
to marry Reverend John Ames who is,
obviously deeply in love with her

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:24.620
and has lost his former family
and is deeply in love with her.

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:31.900
But there is, there is
another character in this novel

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.980
that I want you to talk about
because it is, it was very present

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:41.720
in my, as I read it, it is
the knife that Lila carries

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:47.660
and it is very much a part of
her identity, very much a part

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:51.700
of her relationship
with her adopted mother,

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.980
if we want to call
[inaudible] adopted mother,

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.320
but there's the knife, you know
and the knife is very present.

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.030
It's almost like that Chicavian
thing about the gun, you know --

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.050
[ Speaking Over One Another ]

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:05.350
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson:
Except I broke the rule.

00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:06.650
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: You broke the rule?

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:07.950
[ Laughter ]

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:09.250
The knife is never used.

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:10.550
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson:
The knife [laughter],

00:20:10.550 --> 00:20:12.180
to pare apples it is used.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:15.530
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yes to
pare apples it is used.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:17.210
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: You know
that's funny because that's

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:21.650
such a byword that the workshop,
you know the checkout saying

00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:23.200
if there's a gun on the mantel,

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.810
it has to be fired before
the end of the story.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:27.110
So --

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.410
[ Laughter ]

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:30.580
A little act of rebellion
on my part perhaps.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:31.880
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Right.

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.180
[ Laughter ]

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:35.360
Yeah there's a knife packed
right here and it's never used.

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.660
It's very, very present.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:38.940
You're very aware of
it and you're weary

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:40.420
that it's going to be used or --

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.170
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson:
It's her inheritance.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.470
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: It's
her inheritance.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.370 position:56%
It's everything she has, yeah, yeah.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.340
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson:
It's quite wonderful.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:53.370
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Now I have to say
Marilynne you were born in Idaho.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:58.370
Your father, if I remember
correctly, was in timber.

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.670
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson:
Lumber, we lumber.

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.470
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Lumber.

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:04.370
[ Laughter ]

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:08.880
And your mother worked at home.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.520
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Yes
she was a classic housewife

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.260
of the period, yes.

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.830
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: And you grew up in,

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:19.050
it seems to me I've never been
there, but in that beautiful sort

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:24.710
of lake area which is, which
is beautiful and full of nature

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:27.370
and inspirational in that sense.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.760
Your writing is full of nature

00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:33.870
and it's very important
to you, I believe.

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:38.390
Could you tell us a
little bit about that?

00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:40.110
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Well
I think that probably growing

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:45.340
up where I did where, you know the
length of wild landscapes seemed

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:49.530
so authoritative and enormous and
the human landscape seemed so minor

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:55.530
and perhaps temporary, you know?

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:58.040
I never stopped being
aware, you know?

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.490
I mean it's like an engrained
habit of, you know everything,

00:22:02.490 --> 00:22:06.790
I mean trees, you know
I mean what can I say?

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:11.090
Nature is extraordinary,
very beautiful, very complex,

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:15.560
in exhaustible in terms of
the attention you can give it,

00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.960
the interactions of
light with leaves

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.550
and all the rest of it, you know?

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.630
So it's on my mind, it is --

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:25.110
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: It
feeds you in a way.

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.090
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson:
Yeah, well it just, it has,

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:30.510
it assumes a lot of
authority for me.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:36.730
I think that people live on natural
landscape events more consequential

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:43.440
for them than they
perhaps are actively aware.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.420
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: There's a, there's
a quote that I want to read to you.

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:56.590
You've got, was in the New York
Times and here it is talking really

00:22:56.590 --> 00:23:00.410
about Home, which was the
second novel in the trilogy

00:23:00.410 --> 00:23:04.260
and it is a book on sparring
and its acknowledgement of sin

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.980
and unstinting its belief
in the possibility of grace.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.330
It is at once hard and forgiving,

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:14.120
bitter and joyful,
fanatical and serene.

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:19.460
It is a wild, eccentric, radical
work of literature that grows

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:21.530
out of the broadest, most fertile,

00:23:21.530 --> 00:23:25.940
most familiar native
literary tradition.

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.590
I think what, I believe that
was A L Scott who wrote that

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:39.190
and I believe what was being,
there's a sense of you as a sort

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:47.810 position:56%
of theological scholar and you as a
novelist and you wear these two hats

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:51.410
and you, of course you're
also a professor of literature

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:54.010
at the Iowa Writer's Workshop.

00:23:54.010 --> 00:23:57.810
Very famous workshop as
produced, you have produced a lot

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.750
of wonderful students I must
say, but you wear these hats.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:05.560
So there's the theology
hat and there's the,

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.190
there's the novelist hat and
there is the teacher hat.

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:12.280
These are all very different.

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:14.870
I happen to know a little
bit, something about this

00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:21.270
because you really have to take off
one hat to wear the other one fully

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:26.720
and yet, you know here I am with
my Manichean view again [laughter],

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.560
trying not to be, but, and

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.710
yet are they all merge
in a way in your life?

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:35.130
I think you, the theology,
the spiritualism, the,

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:40.950
the notion of the importance
of faith and you are a Deacon

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.620
in your church I believe --

00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:44.500
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Actually
I was voted off the board.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.800
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: You were --

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.100
[ Laughter ]

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.400
We want to talk about that.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.090
[ Laughter ]

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:52.510
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: My
attendance was too bad.

00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:56.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.010
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Well you see,
so the good and the bad do mix.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:00.400
[ Laughter ]

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.700
After all.

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.000
[ Laughter ]

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:09.720
But so, the business of, on one
hand being somebody who is steeped

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:12.460
in imagination and is pulling
things really out of the air

00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:14.970
because that's what a
novelist does, it hears voices.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:19.180 position:56%
A novelist is a person who hears
voices, pulls things out of the air,

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:24.700
creates a world, and a theologian
in my mind is someone who struggles

00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:28.920
with the world that is
and where one hits in it.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:34.000 position:56%
And then the professor is one who is
trying to lead, you know in a manner

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.410
of a pastor trying to lead
a sheep to some sort of form

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:42.230 position:56%
of understanding themselves, really.

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:44.020
So how do you do this?

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.860
How do you wear the hats and how
do you, if you see them as hats

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.030 position:56%
or do you see them as all one thing?

00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:55.870
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: They're
pretty much one thing for me.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:26:02.590 position:56%
I, teaching at Iowa, I just resigned
at the end of last semester,

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:04.360
high time I might say [laughter],

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.860
but in any case it was a
wonderful place for me.

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.920 position:56%
It was absolutely ideal in the sense

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.010
that I would teach a
literature seminar and we all do,

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:19.010
you know one per semester and we
can teach absolutely anything.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:22.710
So whatever was on
my mind was something

00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:26.730
that I could organize a course
around, you know a lecture course

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:32.910 position:56%
and it was phenomenally rich because
there's really no greater privilege

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:35.710
than talking about your
favorite literature

00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.440
with these very gifted writers.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.440
I mean that's excellent.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.070
I had, I've been very
much influenced

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:46.870
by 19 century American literature.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:51.680
I think that's clear and I
was often teaching Moby Dick

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.840
or Faulkner's novels or
something and they're very,

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.860
very full of religious illusion.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:02.330 position:56%
Moby Dick is just saturated with it.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:07.700
So I started really,
seriously reading theology.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:13.740
Reading specifically what Melville
would have been familiar with,

00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:15.350
which is Calvin, you know?

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:19.700 position:56%
And, so that the theological and the
literary were very much intertwined.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:24.350 position:56%
I think somebody writing in the 19
century would have sat through hours

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.410
and hours and hours
of theology in church.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:34.540
And we basically, too many times
get sort of a minor uplift.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.360
Something that uses a
little sports language,

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:40.890
a little advertising
language, you know?

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:48.090
[Laughter] And so I have to read
theology in order to know where,

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:52.320 position:56%
you know Melville's mind would've
been or [inaudible] for that matter.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:59.880
And so basically I, you know
these things were all one thing

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.040
in that sense.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.500
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: You have
said in your book because,

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.010
of course Marilynne besides
writing these extraordinary,

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:15.240
gem like novels, also writes,
publishes books of essays.

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.270 position:56%
Her most recent one is the
Givenness of Things and what you say

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:21.460
in the Givenness of
Things that struck me is

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.300
that you think we have
gotten to the point

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:31.010
where there is precious
little joy in our lives.

00:28:31.010 --> 00:28:33.640
How did you put, the
spirit of the times is one

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.390
of joyless urgency, you say.

00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:42.000
And that we're all sort
of, I'm struggling for the,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.230
the great God [inaudible]
or something and we're,

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:50.390
we've forgotten was, we
lost our way in a sense.

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:54.520
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: I think
we are distracted from joy.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:59.820 position:56%
I think that we're, we live in this
continuous conversation that implies

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.740
that everything has to be re-geared

00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:06.640
and everybody should really be
studying, you know computer science

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:07.940
and you know what I mean?

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:10.510
And everybody is going to be
unemployed and you're going to have

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:15.400
to make yourself ingratiating and
useful to any theoretical employer

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:16.700
and all that sort of thing.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:21.950
You know it's a terrible thing for
kids to think that they have to,

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:26.720
you know instead of thinking I
love [inaudible] or something,

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.500
they're thinking how am I ever
going to pay off my loans?

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:31.940
Who is going to hire me?

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.210
You know? This is a huge
step down from the way

00:29:36.210 --> 00:29:38.950
that I was educated, for example.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:43.320
I mean I was educated in the
old days before feminism.

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.080
I was educated generously
and elaborately

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.250
and I don't think anybody
had any notion

00:29:49.250 --> 00:29:52.510
that anything would ever
come of it, you know?

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:56.300
[ Laughter ]

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.250
And you know, I mean
it's always have,

00:29:59.250 --> 00:30:03.250
you know the glass is half full and
so on, but it was a great privilege

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:06.030
to be educated simply
in order to be educated.

00:30:06.030 --> 00:30:10.180
I think that's one of the best
things you can experience in life.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:16.500 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: You have, speaking
of education, you have contact with,

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.070
with people who are not
particularly educated.

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:25.030
You, last night at the Author's
Festival Celebratory Gala,

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:27.990
which was a bit of a pep
talk before we all came

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:32.710
out to the Festival today,
you said that you had worked

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.470
with incarcerated people and, and
you had a chance to talk to them.

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:44.760
And one, one quote really
struck me in speaking to a man,

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:50.930 position:56%
I wasn't sure he had, you had given
him the book, but he had read a book

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:55.710
and he had said something
about the fact that --

00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.540
I didn't think the
world would interest me

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.350
as much as this or something --

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:03.650
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Yeah.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:04.950
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Like --

00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:06.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Found out the
world would be interesting to him

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:07.870
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: Yeah.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Marilynne Robinson: Well you know
these are, in Iowa it's not uncommon

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:15.160
for writers to be invited to come
into prisons and talk with people

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.460 position:56%
who have read their books, you know.

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.050
I mean they're in a reading group,
you know bless their hearts.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:25.980
And the, so I've never had any
formal relationship with this,

00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:29.830
it's just when I'm invited I come.

00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:34.250
I find the people in prisons are
extraordinarily good readers,

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:36.210
you know?

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:41.350
They have not nearly enough
distraction to keep them, you know?

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.140
They really, they love books.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:47.160
Books are intensely important
to them and so it's wonderful

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.610
from a writer's point of
view simply to talk to people

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:53.490
for whom they have
such meaning, you know?

00:31:53.490 --> 00:32:00.960
I was very, Branell College
actually gives classes,

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:06.360
this is all donated time on the
part of the professors there,

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:13.570
they give classes at a rate that
end in a degree from Branell.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:20.010
And the, you know a fair number of
inmates actually pass through this

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:23.040
and leave prison with
a college degree.

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.310
I mean, and a good
college, you know?

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.610
Well they're all good.

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:30.680
I don't want to, but [laughter].

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.550
In any case it's a kind
of a part of the culture,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:40.580
I think that I have been drawn in
on and very, feel very privileged

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.920
to have been drawn in on.

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:47.800
I, as it happens the man that
I quoted was a cab driver I,

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.150
who drove me home from the
airport in upstate New York

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:56.540
who had spent 11 years in Attica,
I mean he spent years in Attica,

00:32:56.540 --> 00:33:01.220 position:56%
but 11 years in prison all
together and the other was a little,

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:07.290
God bless her, woman in Pocatello
Idaho in the women's prison there,

00:33:07.290 --> 00:33:13.950 position:56%
but you know the urgency which, with
which they are touched by books.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:18.530
It's uncanny, it's
magic, it's beautiful

00:33:18.530 --> 00:33:25.710
and I do always tell my students,
you know to write a book,

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.150
write your books for
the woman in Pocatello,

00:33:28.150 --> 00:33:30.440
you know give her that good book.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.050
They take it very seriously,
bless their hearts.

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:39.430
&gt;&gt; Marie Arana: You know, there is,
the remarkable thing, of course,

00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:45.640
is that a book is an object
of, static object that sits

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:52.870
on your shelf and, until you
read it, until you engage in it,

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:58.980
and then the, all the work that the
writer does in a solitary fashion,

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:02.810
is done by you as a reader
in a solitary fashion.

00:34:02.810 --> 00:34:06.490
And it's very rare, I think
that we have the chance

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:12.680
to actually hear beyond the
covers of that book, the feelings

00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:17.740
and aspirations and, and
concerns of a writer.

00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:22.920
So it's really wonderful to have
Marilynne present here today

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.700
to have her receive this
marvelous honor, which the Library

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:33.470
of Congress conveys and the Poetry

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:36.520
and Literature Center
is very much a part

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:42.850
of the Library of Congress conveys.

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:49.840 position:56%
And it is, you know human, in fact I
wrote this down because I felt so --

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:59.690
Sort of, a little bit awestruck
by the way we were going to have

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:03.840
to communicate something
about so, such beautiful books

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:09.180
in human language like this,
you know which is so imperfect

00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:14.240
and it reminded me of something
that Flaubert said in Madame Bovary

00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:20.440
and he said something that,
here it is; human speech is

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:28.850 position:56%
like a cracked kettle on which we
tap crude rhythms for bears to dance

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:33.870
to while we long to make
music that melts the stars.

00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:38.260
Well Marilynne Robinson you
make music that melts the stars.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.060
Thank you very much.

00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:47.090
[ Applause ]

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:51.620
