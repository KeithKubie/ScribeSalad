ALBERT MEYER: In
the last lecture,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.900
we spent time talking about
the mean, or expectation,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.260
and its properties, most
important one being linearity.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.660
But let's step back
now and think about,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.220
what is it that the mean means?

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.880
Why we care about it?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.750
We have this intuitive idea that
if you do things long enough,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.090
if you keep experimenting
with the same random variable

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.150
collecting its values,
its long run average will

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.870
be about the same as its mean.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.650
Now, we're going to try
to make that more precise.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.840
So we're going to talk
about the topic of deviation

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.060
from the mean, or
as I like to say,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.290
what does the mean really mean?

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.939
Why do we care about it?

00:00:39.939 --> 00:00:41.480
Well, let's look at
an example that's

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.439
familiar to get a grip
on the specific ideas

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:45.480
that we're interested in.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.170
So suppose I toss a
fair coin 101 times.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.790
Then, I know that the expected
number, since all the values

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.230
from zero through 101 are
possible, and the middle value

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.100
is the expectation,
it's 50 and 1/2 heads.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.850
Now, I'm never going to get
exactly 50 and 1/2 heads.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.740
The probability in 101 flips
of getting 50 and 1/2 heads

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.150
is zero because there's
no way to flip 1/2 a head.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.150
So you don't expect the
expectation in that sense.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.724
No given measurement,
no given experiment

00:01:20.724 --> 00:01:22.140
is going to yield
the expectation.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.000
The expectation is this
thing that we expect

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.520
to come out on the average.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.570
Well, we can ask,
what's the probability

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.300
of getting as close as you could
hope to get to the expectation?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.240
Namely, what's the probability
of getting exactly 50 heads?

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.120
And it's about 1/13.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.310
Or if you ask, what's
the probability

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.420
of getting either
50 or 51 heads,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.000
being within plus or minus
one of the expectation?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.200
It's about 1/7.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.980
OK, let's flip more coins
and see what happens.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.250
This time I'm going
to flip 1001 coins.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.170
And again, the expected number
of heads is 500 and 1/2,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.660
which I'll never get exactly.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.910
The probability of getting
exactly 500 heads is 1/39,

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.610
and the probability of getting
within one of the expectation,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.820
that is either 500 or
501 heads, is about 1/19.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.400
Now, these numbers have gone
down from the previous numbers.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.380
Remember, it was about 1/7
and we've gone down to 1/19.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.380
So it's actually we're
less likely to be

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.510
within a fixed distance, within
one of the expectation when

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.450
we flip more coins.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.650
So as the number of tosses
grows, the number of heads

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.410
gets less likely to be
within any given fixed

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.330
distance of the mean.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.240
But things get better when we
start looking at percentages.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:45.180
So what's the
probability of being

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.740
within 1% of the mean
if I toss 1,001 coins?

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.620
Well, 1% of 1,001 is about
10, so we're talking about 1%

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.270
of the 1,001.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.990
And the probability of
being within 10 of 500.5,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:10.590
that is to say the probability
of being within 510 and 490,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.060
is about 0.49.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.320
It's almost 50-50, which
is not really so bad.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.010
So we have a 50/50
chance of actually

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.460
being within 1% of the expected
number when I flip 1,001 coins.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.920
So what we can start
to say is that when

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.970
we're trying to give
the meaning to the mean,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.714
if I let u be the standard
abbreviation for expectation

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.880
of R-- I'm doing that just
so it'll fit on the slide

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.450
nicely in formulas, so mu
is the expectation of R--

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.660
the basic question we're
asking is two basic questions.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.630
One is, what's the probability
that the random variable is far

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.258
from its mean, mu?

00:03:50.258 --> 00:03:52.530
You could phrase that as,
what's the probability

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.690
that the distance from R to
mu, the absolute value of R

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.490
minus mu is greater
than some amount, x.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.500
And the second question
that we want to ask

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.560
is, what's the
average deviation?

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.410
What's the expectation of the
distance between R minus mu?

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.640
What's the expected
value of r minus mu?

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.400
Now, of course,
we're trying to make

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.070
sense of the meaning
of the expectation,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.926
in terms of the expectation
of the distance between R

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:18.860
and this expectation.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.734
So there's a little bit
of circularity there,

00:04:20.734 --> 00:04:24.480
but let's live with
it and proceed.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.270
Let's look at example to
crystallize the ideas a little.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.450
Let's look at two dice
with the same mean.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:35.330
The green die is going to be
a standard fair die, in which

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.270
each of the numbers
one through six

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.270
has an equal probability
of showing up,

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.390
and its expected
value is exactly

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:49.340
going to be the midpoint between
one and six, or 3 and 1/2.

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.890
Now, suppose I look
at a loaded die,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.140
die two, which only
throws a one or a six,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.820
but with equal probability.

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.220
Then, it's expectation is also 3
and 1/2, by the same reasoning.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.570
So here are these
two different die.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.590
One takes the values one
through six equally likely,

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.910
and the other takes only
the two values one and six,

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.570
but they have the
same expectation.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.880
So how do I capture
the difference?

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.170
Well, if I look at the expected
distance of the fair die

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:25.320
to its mean, I claim
it's one and a half.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.220
But the expected distance
of the loaded die

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.010
from its mean-- same mean
remember, 3 and 1/2--

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.320
is actually 2 and 1/2.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.230
In fact, the second die is
always exactly 2 and 1/2

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:38.870
from its expected value.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.550
Let's look at the PDFs to
get a grip on understanding

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.230
what's going on.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.970
So here's the PDF
for the fair die.

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:50.730
Over one through six
the probability is 1/6,

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:57.740
so each of those green
spikes, columns, is 1/6 high.

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.750
And their total
is the probability

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.150
that the fair die takes one of
those values one through six

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.670
with equal likelihood.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.680
Now, the expected
value is exactly

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.880
in the middle at 3 and 1/2.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.677
And the average distance
of these points--

00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:18.760
well, you can see that a
third of the time, you're

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.300
at distance 1/2, a
third of the time, that

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.090
is when you take
the values 2 and 5,

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.010
you are a distance
exactly 1 and 1/2.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.680
And another third of the time,
you're at distance 2 and 1/2

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.840
when you take one and six.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.870
And that averages out to the
middle value of 1 and 1/2.

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:38.950
So the expected deviation,
the expected distance,

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.537
of the fair die from
its mean is 1 and 1/2.

00:06:41.537 --> 00:06:43.620
On the other hand, for the
loaded die, as we said,

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.380
it's always exactly 2
and 1/2 from its expected

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:51.990
value, which means its expected
value is also 2 and 1/2.

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:56.660
So we can start to see the
difference between these two

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.290
distributions and
these two kinds of die.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.730
Even though they have the
same expectation, one of them

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.820
is more likely and has a
greater expected distance

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.300
from its mean.

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:10.775
And the moral of
this short piece

00:07:10.775 --> 00:07:13.140
is that the mean alone
is not a good predictor

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.940
of a random variable's
behavior, as you might suppose.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:18.350
One parameter, one
number is not going

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.320
to capture the shape of
a PDF, which gives you

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.260
more full information about
the distribution of values

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.900
of a random variable.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.590
And we need some
more information

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.600
than just the expectation.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.750
An especially, valuable
extra piece of information

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.440
that's still well less
than the overall shape

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.460
of the PDF of the
random variable,

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.720
is knowing its probable
deviation from its mean.
