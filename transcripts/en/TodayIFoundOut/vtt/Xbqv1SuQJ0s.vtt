00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.620
Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.750
In the video today, we're looking at why it
is that in some countries people refridgerate

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.810
their eggs, while in others they don't.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.960
Let's get started.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.750
In supermarkets across the United States,
Australia, and Japan, eggs can be found in

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.930
the refrigerated section alongside other cold
items such as milk and cheese.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.760
However in most other countries of the world,
eggs can be found stored at room temperature

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.349
alongside nonperishable food items.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.970
People eat both kinds of eggs every day, usually
without any ill effects.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.820
So why do some people refrigerate eggs and
others don’t?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.590
The answer lies in the bacteria group known
as salmonella and how a particular country

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.920
chooses to make sure their eggs don’t get
contaminated with it.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.660
Salmonella enters eggs through one of two
ways- via contaminating the egg internally

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.300
before the hen lays it (when a hen’s ovaries
have been infected); or via the porous egg

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.490
shell (when an egg comes in contact with contaminated
matter such as chicken manure).

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.469
Egg producers in the United States address
the salmonella problem with eggs by concentrating

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.190
on preventing the bacteria from entering through
the shell.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.790
Towards this end, the United States Department
of Agriculture (mandates that all eggs be

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:11.770
washed with water at a minimum temperature
of 90 degrees Fahrenheit and at least 20 degrees

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.440
warmer than the internal temperature of the
egg at the time of washing.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.610
(If it were colder than the egg, this could
result in a very slight contraction, sucking

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.710
in contaminated water through the shell’s
pores).

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.280
The eggs will also be washed with some form
of detergent and chemical sanitizer like chlorine.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.330
They're then rinsed again and thoroughly dried-
the latter further helping to make sure pathogens

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.390
can’t easily find their way through the
egg’s thousands of pores.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.850
After this, the eggs are often sprayed with
some form of protective coating like mineral

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.850
oil.

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.280
Finally, the eggs are taken into a room where
they are stored at temperatures at or below

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.380
45 degrees Fahrenheit or about 7 degrees celcius.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.190
This effectively deals with the external sources
of salmonella (and helps ensure you won’t

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.890
accidentally contaminate other foods with
salmonella from touching a contaminated egg

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.250
shell then touching other items as you prepare
food).

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.030
However, this does nothing to destroy any
salmonella potentially already present within

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.030
the egg.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.820
This is where the refrigeration comes in.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.670
By keeping the eggs sufficiently cold, it
mostly makes sure any salmonella present will

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.930
not multiply sufficiently to cause problems
given a couple month shelf life, keeping the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.810
eggs safe to eat so long as they are cooked.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.640
Even for those eggs not internally contaminated
with salmonella, it’s still best to keep

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.880
them refrigerated if they have previously
been.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.850
As scientific adviser to the International
Egg Commission Vincent Guyonnet notes, “Once

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.500
you start refrigeration, you have to have
it through the whole value chain, from farm

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.500
to store.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.160
Because if you stop — if the eggs are cold
and you put them in a warm environment — they’re

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.160
going to start sweating.”

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.860
The United Egg Producers Association further
notes that condensation on egg shells “facilitates

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.380
the growth of bacteria that could contaminate
the egg.”

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.750
So why aren’t Europeans and others who don’t
refrigerate their eggs getting food poisoning

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.160
left and right from eating contaminated eggs?

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.840
They rely on other methods to keep the salmonella
problem in check and don’t refrigerate them

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.870
at any point.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.510
For starters, the European Union prohibits
egg producers from washing their eggs.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.660
You see, shells have natural protection from
salmonella and other contaminants via a waxy

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.170
substance known as the cuticle.

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.650
The cuticle coats the shell initially as a
liquid when a hen lays the egg and then dries

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.920
within minutes of being exposed to the air.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.100
Egg washing, when done properly, may eliminate
surface contaminants, but it also washes away

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.800
the cuticle and its natural protection, potentially
allowing bacteria to get into the egg via

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.610
its pores or hairline cracks.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.750
Both methods of eliminating external contaminants
are quite effective, but the washing strategy

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.360
requires that the eggs are processed in a
very precise way to be effective.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.190
If, for instance, eggs are allowed to sit
in dirty washing water too long after losing

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.280
the cuticle, this would be an ideal situation
for microbes to quickly infect the inside

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.280
of the eggs.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.100
Thus, the EU and others deem it safer to cut
out the potentially error-prone middle man

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.959
and simply leave the cuticle on.

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.490
Of course, by not washing the eggs at all,
the occasional egg with feces and other such

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.040
things will pop up (the egg being laid via
the same hole the chicken poops through and

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.740
the laying area potentially not being perfectly
clean).

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.790
But the fact that visibly dirty eggs will
most definitely turn off some customers and

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.380
that European Union egg farmers aren’t allowed
to wash the eggs is actually seen as a net-positive

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.380
by some.

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.490
For instance, Britain’s Egg Industry Council’s
Chief Executive Mark Williams states of this,

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.350
“In Europe, the understanding is that [prohibiting
the washing and cleaning of eggs] actually

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.709
encourages good husbandry on farms.

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.210
It’s in the farmer’s best interests then
to produce the cleanest eggs possible, as

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.900
no one is going to buy their eggs if they’re
dirty.”

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.181
Unfortunately, in this scenario you’ll still
get the occasional egg with fecal matter or

00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:16.181
the like on it.

00:04:16.181 --> 00:04:20.250
This also increases the chances of cross contamination
with handling the potentially contaminated

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.070
egg shells and then perhaps touching other
food items without washing your hands.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.040
But both of these problems are easily solved
by simply washing the eggs (and your hands)

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.400
directly before using them.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.550
So, the cuticle solves the problem of external
sources contaminating the inside of the egg,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.190
but how does the EU and other countries that
don’t refrigerate their eggs deal with eggs

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.800
that were contaminated while being formed
inside the chicken?

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.620
They mandate that their egg laying chickens
must be vaccinated against salmonella, among

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.070
other requirements, if they are to receive
the Lion Quality Code of Practice seal.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.780
The result of this is that approximately 90%
of chicken eggs sold in Britain come from

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.280
vaccinated hens, with the other 10% coming
from small farmers who don’t typically sell

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.880
eggs through major retailers.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.430
So which way of storing eggs produces fewer
cases of salmonella induced food poisoning?

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.180
As the aforementioned Vincent Guyonnet notes:
“They’re different approaches to basically

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.650
achieve the same result…

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.260
We don’t have massive [food safety] issues
on either side of the Atlantic.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.470
Both methods seem to work.”

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.710
But what about the exact numbers?

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.430
There seems to have never been any definitive
studies (at least that I could find), but

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:23.470
from the scant data we do have it would seem
on the surface that the European method is

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.470
the winner.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.280
(Although there are uncontrolled factors that
could potentially be skewing the numbers,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.280
so take this with a very large grain of salt.)

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.900
But On average, there are approximately 142,000
cases of egg-related salmonella poisoning

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.770
in the United States every year according
to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.050
This is approximately 1 in 2,200 people infected
every year (give or take depending on whether

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.530
an individual is a repeat offender in a given
year).

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:50.460
In contrast, in England and Wales in 2009,
there were just 581 cases of egg-related salmonella

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.139
poisoning, or about 1 in 95,000.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.950
Notably, before the British started vaccinating
their chickens in the late 1990s in response

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:04.710
to a major egg-induced salmonella outbreak,
in 1997 there were 14,771 cases of egg related

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:10.139
salmonella poisoning in England and Wales,
or 1 in 3,700, which is much closer to the

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:12.960
current 1 in 2,200 in the United States.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.770
You might then be wondering why it simply
isn’t mandated that United States egg producers

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.510
vaccinate their chickens.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:26.660
This is primarily because 
when the last batch of rules concerning this

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.440
very thing were put together, the limited
number of large sample-size studies available

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.650
indicated vaccination wasn’t an effective
way to stop the internal contamination of

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:36.140
salmonella in eggs.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.970
More recent vaccination methods and studies
have produced entirely different results.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.370
Because of this, and the fact that henhouses
and eggs are now being continually tested

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.990
for salmonella contamination (with a positive
result meaning the egg farmer must break all

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.150
the eggs open from a batch and pasteurize
them, leading to significant profit loss),

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.060
approximately one-third to one-half of all
egg producers in the United States have recently

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.650
voluntarily begun vaccinating their chickens.

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.430
This voluntary adoption of vaccinations was
also spurred on in response to a 2010 egg-related

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:08.770
salmonella poisoning outbreak in the U.S.
resulting in half a billion eggs needing recalled.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:13.080
To avoid such problems, more and more U.S.
egg farmers are jumping on board the hen vaccination

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.210
train every year.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.520
In the end, while there are pros and cons
of each method of keeping eggs contaminate

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:21.370
free, both have proven extremely effective
when properly executed, though seemingly the

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.639
European method has a large edge in terms
of keeping people from getting sick.

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:30.080
However, if you’ve got a refrigerator handy,
it is superior method in one regard- eggs

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:33.430
that are not refrigerated have a shelf life
of about three weeks.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.740
Those stored in a typical consumer’s refrigerator
are generally good for about two months, and

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.949
drastically longer given better regulated
temperatures, something that used to be key

00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:43.520
to keeping eggs on the supermarket shelves
year round.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.020
You see, naturally most chickens will stop
laying eggs in the winter as a response to

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.289
shorter daylight hours.

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:52.550
(There is a photo-receptive gland in a chicken’s
eye that, when exposed to sufficient light,

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:56.650
ultimately triggers the release of the hormone
that in turn spurs egg production when present

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:58.419
in sufficient quantities in the hen.)

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:02.130
This created an egg supply problem that used
to be solved by egg farmers in the United

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:05.919
States via keeping the eggs at the perfect,
constant chilled temperature not found in

00:08:05.919 --> 00:08:09.930
your normal consumer refrigerator which is
regularly being opened and closed.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.960
This allowed egg producers to store eggs for
as much as a year according to United Egg

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.490
Producers’ Vice President of Government
Relations, Howard Magwire.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:19.910
Today, of course, the problem is somewhat
controversially solved with artificial light

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:24.320
and strictly controlled egg production environments
with the egg finding its way from hen to customer

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.870
generally in under a couple weeks, regardless
of what time of year it is.
