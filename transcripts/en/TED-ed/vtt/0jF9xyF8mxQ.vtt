00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:20.977
What if I could fly?

00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:22.883
What if I could live forever?

00:00:22.907 --> 00:00:25.134
What if I could be invisible?

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:26.910
What if I could lift a tank?

00:00:26.934 --> 00:00:29.339
For ages, people have craved for answers

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:30.838
to these questions,

00:00:30.862 --> 00:00:32.824
and what unbelievably gratifying way

00:00:32.848 --> 00:00:34.927
that we have used to express our fantasies

00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:36.889
is through the invention of superheroes

00:00:36.913 --> 00:00:38.910
and their superpowers.

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:41.771
These days a summer doesn't go by

00:00:41.795 --> 00:00:43.605
without a comic book hero transforming

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.654
into a giant to defend a girl next door

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:48.199
or fly across a screen
to protect the human race

00:00:48.223 --> 00:00:50.226
from unspeakable evil.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.851
While an audience's hearts
pump with excitement,

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:54.542
some people have found another path

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:55.822
to make their dreams last

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:57.726
beyond the movie-going experience --

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.486
through science!

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.482
When the first comic
book appeared in 1933,

00:01:02.506 --> 00:01:04.199
flying was a luxury.

00:01:04.223 --> 00:01:07.330
Nowadays, flying
is the safest way to travel.

00:01:07.354 --> 00:01:09.327
The world's life expectancy has increased

00:01:09.351 --> 00:01:11.872
by 15 years since 1960

00:01:11.896 --> 00:01:14.640
due to biology and chemistry advancements.

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:15.833
There's been tremendous progress

00:01:15.857 --> 00:01:17.222
in stealth technology,

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:19.844
trying to make real-life invisible cloaks.

00:01:19.868 --> 00:01:21.297
The fastest speed ever clocked

00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:23.206
by a human being on land

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.475
is 760 miles per hour
in a jet-propelled car.

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.256
And athletes routinely
dead-lift over 1,000 pounds

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.951
in Strongman Competitions.

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:34.753
We're practically breeding
real life superheroes!

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:36.441
From bicycles to jet packs,

00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:37.799
from looking up at the stars

00:01:37.823 --> 00:01:39.956
to entering outer space in the shuttle,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.737
our capacity to acquire
knowledge and imagination

00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:44.421
to achieve impossible goals

00:01:44.445 --> 00:01:46.920
appears to be limitless.

00:01:46.944 --> 00:01:48.611
Exciting developments in the worlds

00:01:48.635 --> 00:01:50.077
of both humans and superheroes

00:01:50.101 --> 00:01:51.875
will always influence each other.

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.233
For as you will see
by clicking on any superpower

00:01:54.257 --> 00:01:55.894
presented in this series,

00:01:55.918 --> 00:01:57.373
the rules of superpowers

00:01:57.397 --> 00:01:58.636
and the laws of science

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.975
don't always agree.
