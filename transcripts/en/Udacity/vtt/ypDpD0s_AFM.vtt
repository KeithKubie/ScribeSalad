00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.650
In exponential form, this would be 2 the fourth power equals 16. Great thinking

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:11.500
if you got this equation. Keep in mind that our base on our logarithm is the

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.801
base for our exponent. And the answer to a logarithm are the result of taking a

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:23.081
logarithm of a number as an exponent, so this 4 is the exponent for 2. And then

00:00:23.081 --> 00:00:29.630
this should make sense, the 16 must go here since 2 to the fourth equals 16.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.718
Now another way to think about it,is going in the reverse direction. So, I'm

00:00:33.718 --> 00:00:39.327
going to right log base 2 of 16 equals 4 down here. We're in logarithmic form,

00:00:39.327 --> 00:00:42.454
so we want to send this base back up to be the base, and we want to send

00:00:42.454 --> 00:00:48.702
exponent back to its position. So, we'll have base of 2, raised to the fourth

00:00:48.702 --> 00:00:54.681
power. So, this is how we get 2 to the fourth equal to 16. We've just reversed

00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:58.804
the directions of the arrows from the first diagram that we saw. Either way you

00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:03.489
do it, you'll still get the correct answer. Just keep in mind your concept of

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.196
which one's the base and then which one's the exponent. The result of a

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:13.590
logarithm is always an exponent.
