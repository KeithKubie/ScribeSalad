[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.039
CHANGDRA RAM: I'm
someone who, I think,

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:11.010
always just grew up
loving two things--

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.040
that was food, and magazines,
and books, so food and writing.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.100
And so I wound up--

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.340
I'm the Editor of "Plate," which
is a food magazine for chefs.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.090
But it seems like a very
well thought-out plan,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.750
but I did study
journalism in undergrad,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.110
and did a lot of
writing in that time.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.780
And then I kind of
said, well, screw it.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.238
I'm going to go to
culinary school.

00:00:35.238 --> 00:00:36.800
And I'm going to
go all in on that.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.020
So I went to New York to the
Culinary Institute of America,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.844
and worked for a caterer there
doing all kinds of events.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.260
And she had a
prepared food store.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.970
And that was exactly
what I wanted to do.

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.010
And thank god I worked for her.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.530
So I learned that that
was exactly what I did not

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.830
want to do.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.040
And so I cooked in restaurants
and did some consulting,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.160
culinary consulting work,
and then found my way back

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.120
into writing, and so was
working as a freelance food

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.370
writer, and kind
of happily being

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.080
able to provide this perspective
of what it's like to cook

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.040
and to work in restaurants.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.860
And then with
"Plates", since we're

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.150
a food magazine for
chefs, it works out,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.070
because I'm able to
better understand

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.890
what chefs are going through,
what they're looking for,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.220
the difference between avocado
toast as a trend for consumers

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.420
as opposed to what they want to
have in the kitchen that works.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.812
And then I get to hang out
with cool people like Bill.

00:01:36.812 --> 00:01:40.143
BILL KIM: And she travels how
many days out of the year?

00:01:40.143 --> 00:01:43.170
Probably like 200.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.500
CHANGDRA RAM: Well, and
actually, the genesis

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.080
of this book took place on a
bus in the middle of nowhere

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.240
in Australia, somewhere
between, I don't know--

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.759
BILL KIM: Brisbane
and Melbourne, right?

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.300
CHANGDRA RAM: Yeah, somewhere
between Brisbane and Melbourne,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.550
Bill and his wife, Yvonne,
joined me on a trip

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.267
to learn all about Australia.

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:09.850
I was asked to bring
some chefs there.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.360
So that's when the-- that was
like the germ of the idea.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.950
So--

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.370
BILL KIM: Here we are.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.536
CHANGDRA RAM: How about you?

00:02:15.536 --> 00:02:16.980
BILL KIM: Me?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.680
So my journey
started from Korea.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.130
I was-- I moved here when
I was seven, not by choice.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.820
My parents wanted to give
us a better quality of life,

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.640
so we moved.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.230
And the thing that I ask my
parents, like, why didn't when

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.355
we, when we had the
layaway in LA and Hawaii,

00:02:39.355 --> 00:02:42.820
why did we not stop at
those places and live there?

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.450
So we ended up here
in 1977, in Chicago,

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.730
with the blizzard in February.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.690
So that was my harsh
reality, that I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.940
was going to live here, and
be here for probably, what,

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.450
30 years, growing up, going
to grade school, high school.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.450
Went to two culinary schools.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.820
I was fortunate enough I
found something I really

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.880
love to do at a very early age.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.060
And I really wanted to learn
the foundation of cooking,

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.430
which was not Korean back then.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.730
It was French cuisine.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.950
So I spent my time learning
about the foundation

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.270
of cooking, then
took me to Atlanta,

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.520
worked for a French
gentleman down there.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.990
Then I came up for Chicago,
because I missed home deeply.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:41.430
I'm a huge sports fan, and
I know today's draft day.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.610
So we have to make sure that
the Bears pick the right person.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.940
I had two people that
I went to go spend

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.170
a day, or trail, or shadow.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.220
And they both kind of
pointed at this restaurant.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.440
It was at a townhouse.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.170
It was 816 West Armitage.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.690
And it was a restaurant
called Charlie Trotter's.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.540
And basically, both of these
chefs had their own restaurant,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.500
but they said if I were you,
I would go to this restaurant.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.960
And I had no clue what this
restaurant's all about.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.630
But when I got there,
my world really

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.660
changed, and really helped
propel me to what I know now.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.570
Because it really-- that was
the focal point of cuisine

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.354
back in the early '90s.

00:04:33.354 --> 00:04:34.770
I was fortunate
enough to be there

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.230
for about three and a half
years the first time around.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.780
And we were voted the number
one restaurant in the country

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.760
back then.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.750
We had a table in the kitchen.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.160
We had a $250,000
Rolls-Royce of a stove

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.820
that was one piece, that
was built in Lyon, France.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.550
You could eat food off
the floor, if it need be.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.300
Every hour within
the hour there's, we

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.470
call it a sweep and a mop.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:11.750
And basically, we would have
the new recruits or new cooks

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.180
that came in, basically, how
you handled the mop and a broom

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.440
would tell you how
that person works.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.400
That was an inside
joke between all of us.

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.560
But that really made me
see outside of Chicago.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.880
So I got to travel.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.880
I got to eat it three-star
Michelin restaurants.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.730
I was 26.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.650
I didn't know.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.000
I had-- I tell
Chandra all the time--

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.940
one sport jacket, not a suit.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.110
I had one sport jacket.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.780
And Charlie said, I think you're
going to need a couple more,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.870
because we're going to go and
do a book signing in France,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.100
meet the French media,
go to Switzerland.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.560
And I've never traveled
outside of Chicago.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.650
And when I came back,
I knew I had to leave.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.960
I had to see different
parts of the world.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.620
So I left for 10 years
on the east coast,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.600
and got to experience it.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:12.800
But same thing happened,
where I missed home again.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.670
This time, for 10
years, I had my watch

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.610
and my clocks set on Midwestern
time-- never changed it.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.940
And I knew I was going
to come back home.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.740
And I came back.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.950
My second tour of
duty at Trotter's, I

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.010
was named the chef de cuisine.

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.330
But it wasn't the same.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:38.510
It wasn't that tunnel-vision
kid 10 years ago working there.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.720
And I'd seen the world.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.660
And I'm just, like, I
have to open my own place.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.480
And when it was time for me
to do that, it wasn't what

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.780
I was trained to do.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.900
I wanted to do something
that was more meaningful,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.270
which meant wanted to
do food that was closer

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.140
to me, who I was as a person.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:01.050
My family owned dry cleaners.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.770
I always say dry cleaners,
but they only owned one.

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:07.460
My parents washed people's
clothes for 35 years.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.010
And I seen how hard they worked.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:15.500
So I always told myself,
if I got educated here,

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.970
did something that
I really wanted

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.180
to do, there's no way in hell
I was not going to succeed,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:23.690
because they did something
they didn't want to do.

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.790
They sacrificed for us.

00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:29.240
So that was a synthesis of us.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.640
We said, we will
build this restaurant,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.420
and we will make it work.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.730
And the irony is, when we
built the first restaurant

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.670
of our own, it was
in a strip mall--

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.000
dry cleaners and a laundry mat.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.020
So we were in 1,000
square-foot place.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.250
And we opened in 2008,
so it's been 10 years.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.160
But the economy was
going like this.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.500
All the people that
I have worked with

00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:00.834
or my friends who have
the higher end restaurant,

00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:02.750
they were suffering,
because it was that time.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.220
And I really thought
the market was missing.

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.260
You had the high
end places, and you

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.500
had the fast-food
restaurants, but there

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:14.582
was nothing in between.

00:08:14.582 --> 00:08:19.280
I'm just, like, why can't food
not be expensive, but still

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.240
be really, really good?

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.960
And that's when we
opened up Urban Belly.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:26.240
It's counter service.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.224
Nothing's over $13.

00:08:28.224 --> 00:08:32.179
And we basically said,
if it's flavorful,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.409
it's accessible, affordable
to everybody, hey,

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.990
if I fail on that, I'm OK.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.850
Because when we first--

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:43.700
when we opened up that
restaurant, I'd lived my dream.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.160
That was everything
that I could wish for.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.890
And I always tell somebody, if
I get hit by a car tomorrow,

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:50.330
I lived my dream.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.950
So then on top of
that, we opened up

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.900
Belly Shack, then bellyQ.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.670
We have our sauce line.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.780
Now we have a book.

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.150
I mean, I pinch
myself every day,

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.590
because it's all the things
I've thought about doing.

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.960
And were actually doing it.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.620
And with her help, I
mean, with my wife's help,

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.790
it's just I surrounded
myself with ladies of power.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.850
And it's just like I just
have to just kind of dream,

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.790
and think, and they
did do the pushing.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:26.252
And they've done very well.

00:09:26.252 --> 00:09:28.460
SPEAKER: So when you talk
a little about the impetus,

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.160
and your background, one
thing I was curious about

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.220
is what inspired you,
even at the beginning

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.480
and as you were growing up,
that gave you that passion

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.580
to go after going
to culinary school,

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.440
just at the starting point?

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.860
BILL KIM: Well,
when you're young,

00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.050
especially when you're
from another country,

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:51.110
you just want to fit in.

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:52.640
I had a Korean name.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.010
It was very hard to pronounce.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:56.150
And I was--

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:59.180
I knew when B came
around in the alphabet,

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:02.099
I'm just, like, oh, I need
to go hide, because they're

00:10:02.099 --> 00:10:03.140
going to make fun of you.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.200
So--

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.700
CHANGDRA RAM: You
have to tell them.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.080
BILL KIM: It's Bum-Suk.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.320
Then my brother's first
name is Yoo-Suk, so Yoo-Suk,

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.890
or you suck--

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:15.740
I mean, that was just--

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:18.650
it was so, like, come on.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.870
CHANGDRA RAM: Bill told
me this the day before we

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.130
had to turn in the manuscript.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.588
And I was, like,
oh, my god, I have

00:10:23.588 --> 00:10:26.090
to go back and rewrite the
entire introduction just

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.200
so we can get this in.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.740
But it's such a
universal experience.

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.840
If you have a name that's
reflective of another country,

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.680
you totally remember being
a little kid in school,

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.874
knowing, OK, yeah, my
name's about to come up,

00:10:39.874 --> 00:10:41.290
and they don't
know how to say it.

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:41.990
BILL KIM: Yeah.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:43.740
CHANGDRA RAM: I don't
know how you did it.

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:49.260
BILL KIM: So the reason
why we did the restaurant

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:53.490
that we were so driven to do,
because for selfish reasons,

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.730
I wanted a restaurant
of both cultures.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:11:00.870
I wanted-- I didn't want to eat
rice three times a day, which

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.370
was what I was
accustomed to doing.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:04.440
And I used to go
every Friday, I would

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.450
go to my friend's,
Joe McDermott's house,

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:10.050
because I knew every Friday
was pizza at their house.

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:11.276
So I loved that.

00:11:11.276 --> 00:11:12.900
And I used to go to
Tony Bruno's house,

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:16.230
because I knew it was Prince
spaghetti day on Wednesday.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.289
And I knew what I
was going to get.

00:11:18.289 --> 00:11:20.580
At my house, you never knew
what you were going to get,

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.670
because we probably ate the
leftovers from the two days

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:24.460
before.

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.040
So you're eating the
same thing all the time.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.060
So as we thought
about what it meant

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:32.100
to open up your
restaurant, I think

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.390
this is something that a lot of
the chefs sometimes miss out.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.530
It's not the concept.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.930
It's who you are as
a person, and how

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.270
you want to express
yourself in the food.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:43.830
That's being genuine.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:44.940
It's not the concept.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.460
It's not how well
you could cook.

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.500
Like, what's from
your heart, and you've

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.660
got to let that show
on the plate of food

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:52.860
that you're cooking.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.130
So what we are cooking when
we opened up the restaurant,

00:11:56.130 --> 00:11:59.280
it's all the things
that I wanted to eat.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.560
It's what we prepared at home.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.620
But I wanted to elevate it.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.520
Like, my mom used
to do fried rice,

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.060
but she made it with Crisco.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.230
And she used 10 pounds of rice.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.610
And we had it for
months in the microwave.

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:14.980
And we would take it out.

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.550
And we used to have a stick,
because there is tons of Crisco

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:19.270
there.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.960
So we said we're going
to do fried rice.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.529
But we also made dumplings
at the house, so we did--

00:12:25.529 --> 00:12:27.070
we're going to
elevate the dumplings.

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:31.320
And the dumplings are going to
be five different skins, five

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.850
different unique flavors.

00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:36.180
Then on top of
that, Urban Belly,

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:39.120
people call it a ramen shop.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.080
But if you really
look at our menu,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:42.960
we only have one damn ramen.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.030
So no, it's not a ramen shop.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:49.410
It's a noodle shop with five
different kinds of noodles.

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:54.030
Because it takes-- to me,
when you go spend the time,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:56.610
and learn some of the
things that I did,

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.210
it's easy to just do ramen.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:07.285
But when you start putting
rice cakes, rice noodles, udon,

00:13:07.285 --> 00:13:11.860
chow fun, it's all these
things that it's there.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:15.420
It's for you to kind of go,
and put some skills in there,

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.980
and make it tasty.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:19.920
So it's for selfish reasons.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:24.160
So we did something
that I love eating.

00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.040
But we wanted to elevate it.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:30.090
So competition-wise,
I didn't want

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.040
people to be able to
do some of the things,

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:34.320
because I have a
different experience

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.410
than a lot of the
other shops in Chicago,

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.320
and wanted to kind
of put our stamp,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.740
and I wanted to bring to
the city something totally

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.590
different that people
are not accustomed to.

00:13:48.338 --> 00:13:50.404
SPEAKER: Knowing you
spent time in fine dining,

00:13:50.404 --> 00:13:52.070
working for Charlie
Trotter, and knowing

00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:53.990
there's lots of alumni
of Charlie Trotter who

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:56.990
have gone on in Chicago
to start restaurants,

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:03.380
how would you say being from the
Midwest, and your wife's Puerto

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:06.446
Rican descent, how
that has influenced?

00:14:06.446 --> 00:14:07.570
Because it is very genuine.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:08.550
We've been to the restaurant.

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:09.841
We've tasted a lot of the food.

00:14:09.841 --> 00:14:13.220
And it feels so natural.

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:14.180
it's truly amazing.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:15.680
But what was that
process like, even

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.260
just starting the
restaurant, and making

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:22.310
that move to Urban Belly?

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:25.820
BILL KIM: Yeah, I think the
thing that we kept on saying,

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:28.490
we want to start taking away.

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:33.140
Less is more, which meant
when you work in fine dining,

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:38.210
there there's a lot of layers
of the hierarchy, who's who,

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.920
and who has
seniority, or we need

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.140
to have this type of service.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.610
We just said, you know what?

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.864
You come, free parking.

00:14:48.864 --> 00:14:50.780
You don't have to pay
for alcohol because it's

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.060
BYOB five years ago.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.800
And you see the menu.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.640
You order.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.440
We just took all the
things out of dining,

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.850
what people understood.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:05.810
And it was basically to
primitive-- here's food.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:06.510
You pay.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.010
You order.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.176
We're bringing you the food.

00:15:08.176 --> 00:15:09.290
And that was it.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:11.210
If you don't like it, too bad.

00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.230
But it was all
about giving it back

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:18.275
to the customers, which meant
you don't have to valet.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.670
You don't have to tip
if you don't want to.

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:24.930
And here it is.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:27.240
Here's the food, and this
what we're going to do.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.656
You're going to
get great service.

00:15:28.656 --> 00:15:32.000
I always said you could do two
things-- you could say thank

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.770
you and hello to a customer.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:36.320
That costs nobody any money.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.990
If we could do that,
that's something

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:40.490
that anybody could do.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:48.470
And going into the
culture of my wife and I,

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.740
it's all natural, because
we always like this--

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:53.270
when we do food,
we like to say we

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:55.620
like to tell the love
story through food,

00:15:55.620 --> 00:16:00.620
which means when I met my
wife, I'd never had plantains.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:03.650
But when I had it,
I'm just, like, wow.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:07.220
How can I put this into my food?

00:16:07.220 --> 00:16:09.770
And I wanted to not
because she's my wife.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:11.420
It's something that
I've never had.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.330
So we do a dish at bellyQ now.

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:15.920
It's called mofongo.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.210
So it's plaintains that is
boiled instead of fried.

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:23.860
So I try to take the dish apart.

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.860
First, the traditional way
is you take pork skins,

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:28.760
chicharrones.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.800
You take garlic,
almost like a mojo.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:36.650
And you just smash
it until you just

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:40.760
get this mashed plantation.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.890
Changdra hates this, but
I use tofu cream cheese.

00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:47.120
That is something
that I like using,

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:52.430
because it adds richness,
without being super heavy.

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:54.080
Then instead of
adding chicharrones,

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.740
we add crispy tortillas.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:59.690
Then we add our version
of chimichurri or mojo.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:03.710
Then we make this, like, mashed
plantation with chimichurri,

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.260
so it has the flavor of mofongo.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:09.500
It's not traditional,
but on top of that,

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.960
we add kimchi salsa
on top of the--

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.680
I call it mashed plantains.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.980
So it kind of gives you a kick.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:17.690
But it all goes well together.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:21.130
Because we don't just say this
is what we're going to do.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.750
We actually taste it, make
sure it goes well together.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.430
Then we serve pork
and plantation chips.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:29.450
So it's a harmonious
way of doing it.

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:33.720
But my wife definitely has
an influence on my cooking,

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:40.070
and I kind of have influence
on her of cleaning.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.430
But she won't let me
clean up the house.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:45.860
She's, like, no, you cannot
use this sponge for this.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.380
I'm just, like, come on.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.420
Just let me clean.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.430
She won't let me do it.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:54.530
I always tell her before
she goes shopping,

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.170
you've got to take an
inventory of cleaning products.

00:17:57.170 --> 00:17:59.650
Because she always buys
double of everything.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.070
Stop.

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.720
It's not going to go bad.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.414
You've got to take
inventory before you go.

00:18:05.414 --> 00:18:07.580
SPEAKER: Cleaning products
are definitely important.

00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.920
I'm thinking about that
in my own home life,

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:15.800
and yeah, the sponge
struggle is real, very real.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.207
So tell us a little bit
more about the book.

00:18:18.207 --> 00:18:20.540
Just in describing the food,
I think a lot of our mouths

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.290
are watering.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.530
And just a quick note for
everyone here, our happy hour,

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.360
our IFFY event
afterwards, we're actually

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.040
going to have some
dishes from the book.

00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:30.449
So save room.

00:18:30.449 --> 00:18:32.240
But that in mind, tell
us a little bit more

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.710
about the book and the process.

00:18:34.735 --> 00:18:36.410
BILL KIM: Changdra.

00:18:36.410 --> 00:18:40.640
CHANGDRA RAM: Well, the
book came together really

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.580
as a reflection of a lot of
what Bill's been talking about,

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:46.790
which is how he
runs his restaurant.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:50.120
And so when we first sat down
and started talking about this,

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.650
he said, look, here's
what I want to do.

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:55.700
Bill trained in French kitchens.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.950
I went to culinary
school when it

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.949
was kind of all French, all
sort of old-school European.

00:19:00.949 --> 00:19:02.990
And so we're both very
used to the idea of mother

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:04.940
sauces, these
sauces that you use,

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.554
and you just create variations.

00:19:06.554 --> 00:19:07.970
And that's how you
make everything

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:09.830
in classical French cooking.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.430
He created the master
sauces for Korean barbecue.

00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:17.600
And so it's seven different
sauces and three spice rubs.

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.840
And you create those.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:24.200
I have tubs of them in my--
small, little tubs of them

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.320
in my freezer.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.236
And I just make them,
throw them in there.

00:19:27.236 --> 00:19:28.860
And then when I want
to make something,

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:30.980
I just pull out, OK, I
need half a cup of this.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.150
I need three tablespoons
of that, mix them up.

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.370
So you take these seven
sauces, three spice rubs,

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:39.680
use them all sorts of
different combinations.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:42.240
And that's how you make
everything in the book.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.610
So it's how he runs
his restaurants.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.820
It's incredibly efficient.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.700
It allows people
who maybe don't have

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.590
a ton of culinary
experience, training,

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.250
it allows them to learn
a skill, because it's

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:56.400
very easy to do that.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.532
But it's also really cool,
because so many people--

00:19:59.532 --> 00:20:01.490
it's only been a week
since the book came out--

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.430
but so many people are,
like, this is so easy.

00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:07.760
I cannot believe on a Tuesday
night I'm actually able to make

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:08.900
this food.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.900
And one thing I really love
about it is all of the things

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:15.290
that Bill was talking about,
like going to hang out with his

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:20.150
Italian friends after school
or having a Puerto Rican wife,

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:23.470
and I think more importantly,
a Puerto Rican mother-in-law--

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.302
BILL KIM: Yes, my
wife doesn't cook.

00:20:25.302 --> 00:20:27.010
CHANGDRA RAM: That's
why she married you.

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.760
BILL KIM: Yeah.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.470
CHANGDRA RAM: But all
of those influences,

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:34.220
time working at Charlie
Trotter's, his time

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:37.520
working for Jean Banchet in
Atlanta, all those things

00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.690
come through in the book.

00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:44.120
So you see there's a sauce
we called a Korican sauce.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:49.790
And it's his Korean/Puerto
Rican master sauce that you use.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.100
And you can mix it up.

00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:55.400
And you can use it on
any kind of protein.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.420
We did that with a
turkey and with the pork,

00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:00.150
I think, in the book.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.990
And so it's really
cool to just see

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.030
all these different
flavors, and see

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:08.670
how Bill's experience traveling
to a different country

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:12.710
would yield a new
sauce that you combine

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:16.310
in a ton of different ways, and
make all these great dishes.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:18.050
And then you combine
everything again,

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:20.815
and you make-- we have an
entire chapter on leftovers.

00:21:20.815 --> 00:21:22.940
Because we're both Asian,
and we do not waste food.

00:21:25.502 --> 00:21:26.960
BILL KIM: How to
Kung Fu it, right?

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.740
CHANGDRA RAM: Yes.

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:30.980
SPEAKER: I might have to ask
you more about that in a minute.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.620
I have to say that
for me personally,

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:35.330
I don't do a lot of
cooking in the home.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.150
I think there are
some people here

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.140
who might be able
to attest to that.

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:41.480
And when looking at the recipes,
they seem very accessible.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:43.997
And being in
Chicago, the weather

00:21:43.997 --> 00:21:45.080
is finally getting better.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:49.190
People are beginning to consider
dusting off their grills, which

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:50.600
is pretty exciting.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.040
And we want to put them to use.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:54.498
Could you maybe tell us a little
about your favorite dishes

00:21:54.498 --> 00:21:58.400
from the cookbook, or just
go-to things when for you

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.620
personally, when
you're in a hurry,

00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:02.740
or when you want to
entertain people, things

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.950
you like to cook?

00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:07.450
BILL KIM: A personal
favorite in the recipe--

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:09.950
it's like, what is
your signature dish?

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:12.320
Well, the story that I love--

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.380
when we were young, we
couldn't afford a grill.

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:19.580
And the public parks, it's
called "forest preserves"

00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.780
in Chicago.

00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.540
So they would have free grills.

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.920
So we would go as a family
on Sundays after church.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.350
And we would go have
one of those grills.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:32.340
And we put charcoal in there.

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:34.910
And as soon as we put
the meat on that's

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:38.710
been marinating overnight,
it's one of the recipes,

00:22:38.710 --> 00:22:41.540
and strangers would
come, because they would

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.000
smell the Korean barbecue.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.770
And that's one of the moments
in my life that I remember.

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.190
Because now, it breaks
down barrier who

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:54.760
you are, what color you are.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:55.880
It's food.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:01.490
And it just opens the gateway
to people trying something new

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.140
in somebody else's culture.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:05.000
So that's, like, wow.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.290
That was the moment.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:15.950
And just doing this kind of
food, it's easy, accessible.

00:23:15.950 --> 00:23:20.350
And I think a lot of times when
people are cooking Asian food,

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.820
they're so intimidated.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:28.880
So we made it very simple for
people to go get ingredients.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:32.690
And the last week,
I've been getting

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.210
videos and Instagrams of
people actually cooking out

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.380
of the book.

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:40.420
So there's moments
where I'm, like, not--

00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:42.320
it's supposed to be
Korean chili flakes,

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.050
not chili flakes that you put.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:49.280
So that's like triple
the spice it needs.

00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.200
But you know what it is?

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.190
We have to all understand
that now more than ever,

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:58.400
there is no border
around what we do.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.610
So we like to say we're
cooking without borders,

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:07.100
which means you don't have to
be an expert, but I studied it.

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:08.700
I wanted to do this.

00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:12.380
But always, when you're in a
category, when we first opened,

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.620
people were, like, what
category do you want to be in?

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.410
Is it Korean?

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:19.896
Is it fusion-- and I hate the
word, "fusion," because, ugh.

00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:24.380
Let it be.

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:25.340
It could be Asian.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:28.220
And it could be
influences from all over.

00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:34.790
Because it really-- when I
look at Mexico, what they have,

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.345
and what's in Asia--

00:24:38.345 --> 00:24:41.270
a water chestnut doesn't
have to be canned.

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:44.150
But what can you find,
something that's here,

00:24:44.150 --> 00:24:45.770
that's similar in texture?

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:51.950
So I look to Latin
cuisine, you have jicama.

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:55.370
And you get that same texture.

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.380
And then you can go either way.

00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:01.370
And we use chili in
both parts of the world.

00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:02.870
Cilantro is called coriander.

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:06.350
So you could do that all over.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:09.500
And that's what draws
the inspiration for me

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.310
to find the commonality
in all the cultures,

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.930
and put it in our food.

00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.940
And hopefully, this
year, me and my wife

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:19.187
will get to go to Greece,
which I've never been to.

00:25:19.187 --> 00:25:21.020
But I know I'm going
to find something there

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.850
that I'm going to
bring back, and it's

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:24.020
going to go into my food.

00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:31.580
Because olive oil, limes,
lemons, things like that,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.750
those are haunting flavors
that I like to use in my food.

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.880
SPEAKER: So we talk
about connectedness

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.200
and how you're creating
food without borders,

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.070
technology is also a big factor
in breaking down barriers.

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:48.650
And would be curious, both from
the perspective of the book

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.890
and also from the perspective
of your business as a chef

00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:55.150
and as a business owner, how
technology has helped you.

00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:57.120
So it's really a
loaded question.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:26:00.456
But maybe we can start with
the book and the collaboration.

00:26:00.456 --> 00:26:03.520
CHANGDRA RAM: Well,
for the book, I think--

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520
we were laughing.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.090
We're like, oh, I don't
even know how we--

00:26:07.090 --> 00:26:08.870
we would still be
working on this book

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:11.720
if we had not been able to
take advantage of technology.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.220
Because as Bill said, I
travel a lot for the magazine,

00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.070
but I'm also someone
who can and absolutely

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.390
loves working on airplanes.

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:23.330
So I needed to be
able to do that.

00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:26.630
But we're two people
who live in Chicago.

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:28.670
We're working on
this in Chicago.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:33.170
Our editors and the whole
production team and design

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.510
team at Ten Speed
Press are based

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.360
in Emeryville, California,
but the creative director

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.250
was based in Santa Barbara.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.065
Johnny Autry, our
amazing photographer,

00:26:42.065 --> 00:26:44.430
is based in North Carolina.

00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:51.530
So we were utterly dependent
on Google Docs and Forms.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:52.580
So thank you.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:56.600
You are overlords, and we
appreciate what you've done.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.630
But that was how we
organized everything.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:03.680
We had two recipe testers
working and testing recipes.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.390
And I could be on an
airplane, looking at the notes

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.120
that they put on after
testing a recipe,

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:15.890
and then I could input
comments, and not lose any time.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:18.980
When we did our photo
shoot, we had a spreadsheet

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:24.650
uploaded so that the editorial
and design team in California

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.630
could see what we were
working on every day.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.310
And then every night,
our photographer

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:32.630
was able to upload the photos
just so they could see.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.610
They could not have to worry
about flying out to Chicago,

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.126
but they could be
there, and see what

00:27:38.126 --> 00:27:40.250
was happening with the
photography, how things were

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:42.770
looking, and even
say, hey, think

00:27:42.770 --> 00:27:45.580
about doing some of these
for backgrounds and that.

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.080
And that could be
the creative director

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:50.810
dropping her daughter off
somewhere and taking a look.

00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:52.410
So that was amazing.

00:27:52.410 --> 00:27:54.620
And then the thing
that other people

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:56.510
who coauthor
cookbooks with chefs

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:59.510
always grit their teeth about,
because they can't believe

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:02.060
it was so easy,
was the fact that I

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:04.370
wrote the book with a
chef who understands

00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:05.840
how to upload to Google Docs.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:10.050
So a friend of mine
coauthored a book with a chef.

00:28:10.050 --> 00:28:13.220
And he had to literally sit
across the table from him,

00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:16.897
and drag every ingredient
out one at a time.

00:28:16.897 --> 00:28:18.480
And he was, like,
yeah, we used to sit

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.720
from 5:00 in the afternoon
until 2:00 in the morning

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.680
every single Monday to do that.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:25.860
And I was like, oh, yeah, Bill
just uploaded all the recipes.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.720
It was fine.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:32.840
So yeah, I mean, I
think that we wrote this

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.470
in a very short amount of time.

00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:38.710
And I think that it was only
possible because of that.

00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:41.650
And then I mentioned to
you before, my husband Jay

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:43.250
is a product manager.

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:45.500
And so he has taken
it even further,

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:49.300
and now creates spreadsheets
that indicate with formulas

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:52.780
in there that indicate
how far along are you

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.760
in the process of
creating each recipe?

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.930
And how many days
behind are you,

00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:00.060
which is really the worst thing
you can ever do to your wife.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.060
Don't ever do that.

00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.220
But then the restaurant,
you've got the place--

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:06.405
I mean, you've got the
place set up for efficiency.

00:29:06.405 --> 00:29:07.030
BILL KIM: Yeah.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:10.210
So we just held a smart
class this morning.

00:29:10.210 --> 00:29:13.510
So it's our second time around.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:16.240
We try to bring technology
into our kitchen,

00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:21.070
so we are Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth connected

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:23.440
in our kitchen, which is crazy.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:27.550
So I could see on my phone if
somebody's using the oven right

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.830
now, at what temperature.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.505
And now--

00:29:30.505 --> 00:29:32.380
CHANGDRA RAM: Now you're
the creepy overlord.

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:33.004
BILL KIM: Yeah.

00:29:33.004 --> 00:29:40.630
And with the phone,
and also, now,

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:46.030
with Wi-Fi built into the
ovens, so basically now,

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.340
we download the picture
of the finished product.

00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:51.640
Let's say you're charring
broccoli in the oven.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:56.140
So now, they have ovens
where you could put dry heat

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:58.070
and humidity at the same time.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:02.980
So you could do
70% dry, 30% steam.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.510
And you could cook in there.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:06.490
And basically, the
finished product comes out.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:10.630
We take a picture,
download that to the oven.

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:16.150
And now a prep cook that just
starts, they just have to say,

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:18.730
"Broccoli," show a picture.

00:30:18.730 --> 00:30:21.250
Now you don't need to remember
temperatures or settings.

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:25.990
Now, you just press the
picture of the broccoli.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:29.830
You could also, if you're taking
something out of the freezer,

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.560
let's say, and you
put it into this--

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.940
it's called the blast chiller.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.530
Take it, set it
on thaw overnight.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:40.900
And you don't have to run water.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.570
You're wasting water,
wasting energy.

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:46.610
And basically, when
you come the next day,

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.340
you take it from
the frozen stage.

00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:50.800
Then it thaws it out,
and you're ready to go.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.950
So you're not wasting time.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:55.570
You could also what's
called "proofing."

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:58.350
You could actually make bread.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:01.520
Then you could shock-freeze
it at negative 40.

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:05.280
So it doesn't kill the
yeast, but it freezes it.

00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.870
Then two days later,
you could take it out

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:13.600
before you go home, let it proof
very slowly, relax the dough.

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.400
So a person coming the next
day could actually take it

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:18.400
as soon as they come in.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.790
They could bake off the bread,
which sometimes could take up

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:25.730
to two or three hours in a
busy kitchen, to take up space.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.960
So there's also a
controlled vapor cooking,

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:34.780
which is basically, if you're
making grits or polenta,

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.180
there's a point where
when you're cooking it,

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.680
it has this like splatter
thing that happens.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:46.460
And it's like almost
getting hit with heat.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:49.540
You almost need a visor,
like a welding helmet,

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:51.940
because the things
just kind of bubble.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:55.030
So this controlled
vapor cooking,

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.680
you just bring it up to a boil.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.580
Then you cover it.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:01.870
Just put it in
basically an oven.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.640
It's controlled
atmosphere of cooking.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.610
Two hours later, it's
completely cooked.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.570
So what it does is first,
it gives the person

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:12.910
that's actually
cooking it complete

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.230
control of the product.

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:19.040
And also, it gives that person
time to do other things.

00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.470
So you don't have to
keep an eye on things.

00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.880
It's like the Instapot,
everybody is going--

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:28.360
so we have an Instapot
kind of thing,

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.410
where if you have a braised
short rib that you want to do,

00:32:32.410 --> 00:32:36.670
we could put it in before we
go home, next morning come,

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:38.560
and hold it at the
same temperature.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.060
It's completely cooked.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:45.070
So there's the efficiency of us
cooking while we're not there.

00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:46.810
And it's not by heat.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:48.840
It's by electricity.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:54.050
And it's controlled
100%, and it's done.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:56.530
And what that does
is I can hire people

00:32:56.530 --> 00:33:01.120
that need a career out of it.

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:02.470
They don't need to be chefs.

00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:04.210
They just need a job.

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:06.520
And we have people
who want a job.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.680
They want to go home
at a certain time.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:09.380
They have kids.

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:10.960
They have other responsibility.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.310
Now we can teach them a skill
that they could provide us.

00:33:15.310 --> 00:33:18.510
Because not everybody
is aspiring to be chefs.

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:21.280
And we could give people
a chance that might not

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.270
have a chance in life.

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:26.590
So these are things
that we put in place

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:29.099
so we could hire more people.

00:33:29.099 --> 00:33:31.390
SPEAKER: Earlier, we were
talking about your experience

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:32.710
working with Charlie Trotter.

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:35.770
And one of the things I think we
mentioned before the interview

00:33:35.770 --> 00:33:38.230
was around how he gave
back to the community.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.429
And what you're describing
here, using technology

00:33:40.429 --> 00:33:42.220
and using these
efficiencies in the kitchen

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.679
to provide
opportunities to folks--

00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:45.844
tell us a little more about
how you've been involved

00:33:45.844 --> 00:33:47.170
in the community in Chicago.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:48.050
BILL KIM: Sure.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:51.140
I think going back, I
think a lot of people

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:55.070
think what I've learned
there at Charlie Trotter,

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.420
it was, yes, about cooking.

00:33:57.420 --> 00:34:00.080
But it was more, I'd
learn taking away,

00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:04.850
the greatest thing
ever is to give back.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:10.040
Charlie used to invite
14 students four times

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:15.949
a week in his test kitchen
from all different parts

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:19.310
of the Chicago land area.

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:23.900
They would get the same meal
as paying guests that night.

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.210
And all of us people
in the kitchen,

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:29.810
we'd have to come and explain
the definition of excellence.

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:33.949
But they would get exactly
what people were eating.

00:34:33.949 --> 00:34:39.080
And now, it opened doors to
kids that maybe would not get

00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.190
a chance to eat and talk to--

00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:44.989
Charlie didn't want
them to be chefs.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:49.489
He just want-- he wanted people
in different neighborhoods,

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:52.050
and usually it was an
underserved neighborhoods,

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:55.500
to get to kind of dream
outside where they live.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:59.040
And now, some of the
charities that we work with

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:01.400
is Greater Food Depository.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:08.120
My wife is just on the
board called "Rock Passage."

00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:12.230
So it's taking kids
who've been in gangs,

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:17.390
and giving them opportunities
to come to the real world,

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:19.880
and be able to function.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:28.190
Common Threads, the after-school
program for kids under 12,

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:32.510
Meals on Wheels, which Changdra
put together every year.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:37.760
And I just like to be
part of a community.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.530
Even when my mom, she
had her dry cleaners,

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.620
she always bought something
from the neighborhood.

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:49.120
It was usually when
the government cheese--

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:53.870
when it was there, we would have
slices of cheese at our house

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:56.840
all the time, even though
I was lactose intolerant.

00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:59.930
We would always have
a thing of cheese.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:02.040
And she would support
the community,

00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.250
even though we
didn't live there.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:07.710
She would always purchase
that every month.

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.520
So for us, obviously,
we're in the West Loop.

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.870
I live in Pilsen.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:13.820
But we do a thing
every year, and we

00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:15.360
don't like to put it out there.

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.650
We call Chefs Giving
in East Garfield Park,

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:22.490
Inspiration Kitchen--
that's really one charity

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:23.460
dear to my heart.

00:36:23.460 --> 00:36:28.190
It's a job training
program for homeless.

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:32.780
And we take people who are
artists, some of my friends,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.900
chefs, authors, writers.

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.200
And two weeks
before Thanksgiving,

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:43.810
we will do this, like, gourmet
spread for homeless people.

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:46.040
And it's not like--

00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.740
it's actually like
truffle mac and cheese,

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.740
where we're doing
coconut gravy, turkey.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:56.060
And we're doing it free.

00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.740
We pay for all of it.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.740
But we want the people
in the neighborhood

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:04.070
to eat something that is not--

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:06.920
and it's from our
restaurant, some of us.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.330
Some people cook at home.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:11.780
And we don't tell everybody.

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.730
We only tell people
in the neighborhood,

00:37:13.730 --> 00:37:17.690
and it's a mile and a half from
where we are in the West Loop

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:19.537
to go to East Garfield Park.

00:37:19.537 --> 00:37:21.120
SPEAKER: So right
now, we're opened up

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.370
to the audience for questions.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.730
There is a microphone back here.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.500
So if you have questions,
please use the mike.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.020
AUDIENCE: Now with social media,
everybody is a food critic.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:32.740
I was just curious about
what the role of social media

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.865
plays in the
decisions you make as

00:37:34.865 --> 00:37:40.820
far as ingredients or new
menus, or even just your mood.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:53.890
BILL KIM: So I think 2008,
when we first opened, we had--

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:55.400
and Alisa, you're
going to cringe--

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.850
we had no PR, no
marketing, no plans of it.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:02.180
Our very first customer,
very first customer, and we

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.900
were told this to Monica when I
saw her last week, Monica Eng.

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.929
She was a "Tribune" food
writer, one of the food writers

00:38:10.929 --> 00:38:11.970
at the "Chicago Tribune."

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:15.260
So she was our very
first one customer.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.900
Our third customer was Steve
Dolinsky, The Hungry Hound.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.060
He does a feed podcast.

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:22.130
He was number three.

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.470
So they're the ones
who kind of blasted off

00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:27.560
through social media.

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:32.150
Then Twitter, then
the food forums,

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:37.300
they blasted it off to eight
or nine months later, we

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:44.150
got voted top 50
restaurants by what was it?

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.530
One of the major magazines.

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.580
I totally forgot.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.240
But--

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.490
CHANGDRA RAM: "Food and Wine?"

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.740
BILL KIM: Not "Food and Wine."

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.190
It was Travel and Leisure.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:54.840
So we're in the
company of those,

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.630
out of those top 50 in
the country, one was us,

00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:00.260
the other one was Publican.

00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:02.150
The other one was [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:06.980
So not knowing the power
of social media back then,

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:11.210
I was very ignorant, and just
wanted to cook good food.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:16.710
But as we move forward,
it's utmost important.

00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:19.830
Every day, I wake up
to what's called Venga.

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.750
And it goes out into space,
the internet or the interweb.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:25.580
And I get alerts on my phone.

00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:30.330
And I wake up to it, and
see what's out there.

00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:34.980
Alisa, who is our marketing
manager for Cornerstone,

00:39:34.980 --> 00:39:35.480
she's here.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:39.060
And I talk to her probably
more than my wife,

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:44.040
and seeing what we
do, how we do it.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:45.230
It's a strategy.

00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:46.040
It really is.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.230
And food is a given.

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:54.380
Now we have to be able
to have people know

00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:55.590
what it is that we're doing.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:40:01.310
But it is right up there,
probably as more important.

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:04.470
Because I believe food
should be a given.

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.650
There should be
that's a standard.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:08.450
Than everything else
we have to work at,

00:40:08.450 --> 00:40:11.601
and social media is right there.

00:40:11.601 --> 00:40:13.100
CHANGDRA RAM: And
we learned so much

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:17.340
about what people wanted in a
cookbook from reading reviews.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:21.527
So I would-- you know when you
wake up at 4:00 in the morning,

00:40:21.527 --> 00:40:23.360
you're a little freaked
out about everything

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.320
you've got going on?

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.460
I would do exactly what
you're not supposed to do,

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:28.280
which is I would grab my phone.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.210
And I started reading Amazon
reader reviews, reviews

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:38.150
on Food52, see what people were
saying about different grilling

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:41.240
books, about Korean books,
about cookbooks in general,

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:45.260
and what kind of
issues they had.

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.660
One of the things I
really love about our book

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:53.120
is the fact that the recipes
for those seven sauces

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:56.870
and the three spice rubs,
which are all very short,

00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:59.480
they were printed on
the inside back cover.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:03.290
And that was a thing
I kept bringing up,

00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:08.330
because on Food52, so many
people commented about how they

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.240
hated having to flip back
and forth in a cookbook

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:13.380
to find, oh, god,
there's a subrecipe.

00:41:13.380 --> 00:41:14.840
And it's on Page 36.

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.730
And now I've got
to find Page 36.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:19.370
And then I've got to
go back to Page 79

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:21.110
to find the original recipe.

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:22.520
So we kept working.

00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:25.770
It was a thing that we
brought up from the get-go

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:27.380
with our editor.

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:32.390
And Kelly, and Lizzie,
and Emma, the design team,

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:35.030
they kept kind of figuring out,
saying, OK, well, maybe we'll

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:35.900
do a big pull-out.

00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.630
And I was, one day, what if we
have different colored ribbons?

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:40.220
And then she just texted
me back, and said,

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.386
who's going to pay for that?

00:41:41.386 --> 00:41:42.540
And I was, like, OK.

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:47.450
So then I came up with this
idea to print these base recipes

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:49.810
on the inside cover, so you
don't have to flip around.

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:50.900
You can find them.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.090
But that's something
I wouldn't have known,

00:41:53.090 --> 00:41:56.180
we wouldn't have known, to
even ask for and really push

00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:00.410
for had we not seen the
complaints on social media.

00:42:00.410 --> 00:42:02.160
So sometimes, it is
for good and not evil.

00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:05.550
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:06.300
Thanks for coming.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:07.740
I have a couple of questions.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.202
The first one is, how do
you choose a recipe tester?

00:42:10.202 --> 00:42:11.660
And how much
influence do they have

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.951
over the direction of the book?

00:42:16.062 --> 00:42:18.020
CHANGDRA RAM: I mean, we
were fortunate to have

00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:20.660
very good friends who were
starting a business where

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:23.480
they were testing recipes.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:27.860
But it's also equally
important to send the recipe

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:32.000
to someone who doesn't know
you, ideally someone who doesn't

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:33.870
really know how to cook.

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:34.390
That's--

00:42:34.390 --> 00:42:35.375
AUDIENCE: I volunteer
as [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:35.375 --> 00:42:35.660
CHANGDRA RAM: OK.

00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:37.850
AUDIENCE: Just in case you
ever need someone in future.

00:42:37.850 --> 00:42:40.016
CHANGDRA RAM: Because you
want to know how someone--

00:42:40.016 --> 00:42:42.790
I mean, if Bill
hands me a recipe,

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:46.980
I have known him and his
food for years, and years,

00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.070
and years.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.460
And I cooked in restaurants.

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.070
And so I will--

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.870
someone who's very
well trained will

00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:57.810
start to automatically
fill in the blanks.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:43:01.030
But you want
someone to say, hey,

00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:04.770
you've got me soaking
rice, and then cooking it.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:07.440
Am I cooking it in the
water I'm soaking it in?

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:10.577
Or am I adding fresh water?

00:43:10.577 --> 00:43:11.910
And someone asked that question.

00:43:11.910 --> 00:43:13.960
I was, like, I would
never have thought,

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:15.890
OK, now we're
adding that back in.

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:18.030
BILL KIM: And it
was important for us

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:22.890
that people were using
a residential stove.

00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:26.130
Because obviously,
our commercial stuff

00:43:26.130 --> 00:43:29.190
is probably three
times as powerful.

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:33.720
So it was very
important that they were

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.430
using that type of equipment.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:39.890
And also, we were
fortunate enough to--

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:44.460
our recipe testers,
one of them had kids,

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:48.510
which I wanted to have,
because I would only

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:50.410
cook for two at the house.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:52.380
And Changdra also.

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.850
So there was going
to be leftovers.

00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:56.046
How they were going to use it?

00:43:56.046 --> 00:43:57.420
And they're, like,
the kids don't

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.640
want to eat that broccoli
anymore, because they've

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.290
been eating it for days.

00:44:01.290 --> 00:44:07.124
But we knew for six people,
this will be this much.

00:44:07.124 --> 00:44:10.860
And the thing that
we also wanted was we

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:15.270
wanted all the ingredients to
be accessible to the grocery

00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:18.180
store, not specialty markets.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.540
Because I think that's
another thing that I read,

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:23.280
that people just didn't want
to go to five different places

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.410
to get things for the recipe.

00:44:25.410 --> 00:44:27.890
So it was very, very
important for us

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:32.640
to be accessible to a
whole realm of people that

00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.487
want to cook this type of food.

00:44:35.487 --> 00:44:38.070
AUDIENCE: Final question-- what
is your favorite, both of you,

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:39.570
what are your favorite
restaurants in Chicago

00:44:39.570 --> 00:44:41.310
that you don't have
major influence,

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:44.050
from a business
perspective, over?

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:47.350
So you can't pick your own.

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.630
CHANGDRA RAM: Can I pick Bill's?

00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:53.880
I mean, I feel like there's
so many places that--

00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:57.570
like, there's the places that
are like the special occasion,

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:58.680
oh, my gosh.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.100
Like our friends John
and Karen Shields

00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:03.840
have a restaurant, Smyth.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.000
They have two restaurants,
Smyth and the Loyalist.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.494
And they're old friends
of Bill's from back

00:45:08.494 --> 00:45:09.660
in the Charlie Trotter days.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.820
You actually found a
good location for them.

00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:15.470
BILL KIM: Yeah, right
down the street, yeah.

00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:17.640
CHANGDRA RAM: But I love Smyth.

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.560
It's such a beautiful
fine dining experience,

00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.630
but it's not stuffy.

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:23.790
It's modern and very cool.

00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:26.100
But then they have the
Dirty Burg cheeseburger

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.690
at the Loyalist downstairs.

00:45:27.690 --> 00:45:30.989
And that is a,
like, oh, my god, I

00:45:30.989 --> 00:45:32.280
need something good in my life.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:34.890
I'm going to go eat
that cheeseburger.

00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:37.390
BILL KIM: So I have
to be very neutral.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:41.910
So I like to go to
neighborhood restaurants.

00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:45.446
And a restaurant that I go
to probably twice a week--

00:45:45.446 --> 00:45:46.570
it's not even a restaurant.

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:47.640
It's actually takeout.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.260
It's called Pollo
Express on 18th street.

00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:56.060
Tuesdays and Thursdays, you
get one and a half chicken

00:45:56.060 --> 00:46:00.390
tortillas, three different kinds
of salsa for, like 19 bucks,

00:46:00.390 --> 00:46:01.500
like that.

00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.580
And it's grilled
chicken on live fire.

00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.780
That, to me, yes.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.240
Pollo Express, and you
have to call ahead,

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.630
because they will sell out.

00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:16.322
Yeah.

00:46:16.322 --> 00:46:17.280
SPEAKER: Pollo Express.

00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:17.650
BILL KIM: Yes.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:18.259
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:46:18.259 --> 00:46:20.550
CHANGDRA RAM: Now I sound
like a total snob [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:20.550 --> 00:46:21.955
BILL KIM: You are.

00:46:21.955 --> 00:46:24.150
[INAUDIBLE] Just kidding.

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:28.125
SPEAKER: I think we have
one more question coming up.

00:46:28.125 --> 00:46:30.855
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:30.855 --> 00:46:33.438
I think one of the things that
you were talking about in terms

00:46:33.438 --> 00:46:39.835
of defining, almost, the type
of food or category of food,

00:46:39.835 --> 00:46:43.932
and you hating the word
"fusion," and then people also

00:46:43.932 --> 00:46:46.668
wanting something
super authentic, what's

00:46:46.668 --> 00:46:49.390
that kind of balance
like, and try and find

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.280
something that's
authentic, not fusion,

00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:56.230
but still something that's
authentic to your restaurant?

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:58.090
BILL KIM: Yeah.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.230
Did I tell you I love
the word, "authentic?"

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:01.730
Not.

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:05.710
No, here's the thing--

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:09.070
I think everybody wants to
find that restaurant that

00:47:09.070 --> 00:47:12.470
is like the paradise.

00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:14.770
There is the grandmother
that's cooking.

00:47:14.770 --> 00:47:19.540
And the rendition of the recipe
is passed on from generation

00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.360
to generation.

00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:24.040
I can't cook like that.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.710
I have to be
authentic to who I am.

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:32.350
My experience in
life is not Korea.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:35.970
I moved when I was seven, so
I know very little about it.

00:47:35.970 --> 00:47:39.284
And as I grew up, my mom
would never tell me recipes.

00:47:39.284 --> 00:47:40.450
I would go into the kitchen.

00:47:40.450 --> 00:47:43.000
I would taste test for
her, but it was never

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.790
like she was, like,
come on, let's go.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:46.840
We're going to cook.

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:47.980
It was never about that.

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:51.700
So I got my authentic
experience from the chefs

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:53.440
that I trained with.

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:59.680
And from there, me finding my
identity again, back to Korea,

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:01.540
because I was proud.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:05.380
After I graduated
culinary school,

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:09.760
my mission was to cook
Asian food the best way

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.110
that I know how--

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.090
not Korean food, but Asian food.

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.810
Because that was missing.

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.410
I knew it was missing,
because after I graduated,

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:26.050
I wanted to find the master, the
sensei, the guy, or the lady,

00:48:26.050 --> 00:48:30.400
that I wanted to learn
everything what they know.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.770
And there was no such person.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:37.000
And so I started finding
these little techniques

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.840
and little skills from
people that I worked for.

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:46.000
My business plan was to open up
that authentic restaurant that

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.050
was authentic to me.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:52.150
So I'm not going to be the
[INAUDIBLE] the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:52.900
I can't.

00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.640
I don't know how.

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:57.100
And that's the thing.

00:48:57.100 --> 00:48:59.140
I make vegan kimchi.

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.670
That's not traditional.

00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:04.240
But I know that's the best
rendition of vegan kimchi

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:08.650
that I know, without using fish
sauce, without using shrimp

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:11.470
paste, because I'm
listening to my customers.

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:13.930
Because they're like, well,
I can't eat shellfish.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.220
I can't eat fish.

00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.790
Why can't you do
a vegetarian one?

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:21.530
Well, we made it
gluten free, vegan,

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:23.930
and we do our best
version of that.

00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:25.480
So is that traditional?

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.530
No, it's not.

00:49:26.530 --> 00:49:29.650
But is it pleasing to
the general public?

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:30.610
Yes, it is.

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:35.020
So I have to listen to
how a business is run.

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:39.880
But I have a
conversation with my mom.

00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:42.010
And she makes her own soy sauce.

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.240
Is that traditional?

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.480
No, she has tons of time,
so she could do that.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.730
We cannot, so we have to buy it.

00:49:47.730 --> 00:49:51.940
But talking to
her takes me back.

00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:59.180
That tradition of maybe son
to father, mother to daughter,

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:00.310
mother to son--

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:03.250
I feel like I'm getting the
authentic version of what

00:50:03.250 --> 00:50:05.710
I'm doing, because I'm
conversing with her.

00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:08.320
I'm getting the history of why.

00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:11.950
And from there, we do it
to the general public,

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:16.570
where we get to take that recipe
that maybe my mom told me,

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:21.600
and times it by 200, plus
by five days, six days,

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.480
seven days.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.560
Now that recipe is 1,400
portions of whatever.

00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:28.360
Is that traditional?

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:28.890
No.

00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:32.140
It has to be commercial
enough for us

00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:34.820
to function as a
restaurant, then go beyond.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:39.730
So there needs to be a
balance of whose tradition,

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:43.030
and how you grew up, and
being authentic to who

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:44.400
you are as a person.

00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:54.040
It hits a spot
with me, because I

00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:57.730
can't be authentic
to my tradition,

00:50:57.730 --> 00:51:00.440
because I was kind
of taken away.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:05.200
So I have to find my own
way to discover where I am,

00:51:05.200 --> 00:51:06.490
and what I'm cooking.

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:08.290
And this is what I study to do.

00:51:08.290 --> 00:51:14.230
So this is our version
of authentic recipes

00:51:14.230 --> 00:51:16.890
of where we are.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:18.430
We do a Thai curry bolognese.

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:20.650
Is that authentic?

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:22.597
It's not, but I know
what a bolognese

00:51:22.597 --> 00:51:23.680
is supposed to taste like.

00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.360
I've made bolognese.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:29.410
But why not take all the
elements of the bolognese,

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:33.660
and instead of using pork,
we use tea-smoked duck.

00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:38.200
Now we have pasta that's
made with [INAUDIBLE] wine

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.320
instead of duck eggs to make it.

00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.100
Is it lighter?

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:42.610
Yes it is.

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:43.600
Is it more flavorful?

00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.870
I think so.

00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:49.380
But it is our rendition
of authentic dishes

00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:53.400
that I get basically
inspired by,

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.690
because I love Italian food.

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:59.140
And we put our spin on it.

00:51:59.140 --> 00:52:02.490
So it's very hard
question to answer.

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:05.120
But that's the answer
that I could give.

00:52:08.024 --> 00:52:10.440
CHANGDRA RAM: You do make the
most authentic Korean/Puerto

00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:15.210
Rican/Italian/Thai/Vietnamese
Chicago mid-Western French food

00:52:15.210 --> 00:52:15.840
I've ever had.

00:52:18.650 --> 00:52:21.435
AUDIENCE: Two questions-- one
is, what's your favorite marked

00:52:21.435 --> 00:52:23.550
if you're shopping
more for yourself,

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:27.420
not for the restaurant?

00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:29.310
BILL KIM: I know
what Changdra's is.

00:52:29.310 --> 00:52:30.190
CHANGDRA RAM: Because I live
across the street from it.

00:52:30.190 --> 00:52:31.552
BILL KIM: Yes, you do.

00:52:31.552 --> 00:52:33.760
CHANGDRA RAM: I live across
the street from a grocery

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.380
store called Harvest
Time, which is

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.294
one of the great
independent grocery stores.

00:52:37.294 --> 00:52:38.210
AUDIENCE: On Lawrence?

00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:39.660
CHANGDRA RAM: On Lawrence, yes.

00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.270
But we both love
Green City Market.

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:45.976
Bill's been working with some of
the farmers there for decades.

00:52:45.976 --> 00:52:46.600
BILL KIM: Yeah.

00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.290
So if you want--

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:50.830
you got to get this experience.

00:52:50.830 --> 00:52:57.820
Sunday about 2:30, go
to Kimball and Lawrence.

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.400
Make sure you wear pants
with bumpers on there,

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.470
because you will go to chaos,
controlled chaos at Joong Boo

00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:06.690
Market.

00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:09.010
It's a Korean market.

00:53:09.010 --> 00:53:12.350
And there is no word in
Korean called, "Excuse me."

00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:14.470
And it's just like
boom, boom, boom.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:16.282
Somebody will bump
into you, and it's--

00:53:16.282 --> 00:53:17.615
you got to have that experience.

00:53:17.615 --> 00:53:18.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.485
BILL KIM: Exactly.

00:53:19.485 --> 00:53:21.100
And the parking,
and the parking,

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.980
the attendant's like this,
and everybody's pulling out.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:26.560
You got to get that experience.

00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.185
AUDIENCE: OK, second question--
just given the spices

00:53:29.185 --> 00:53:33.760
and the richness of the flavors
in Korean food in particular,

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.244
is there a particular
type or style of wine

00:53:36.244 --> 00:53:41.970
that you found that pairs well?
or how do you approach that?

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:44.520
BILL KIM: I am not
a huge drinker,

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:50.160
but when I do different
realms of spices,

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:56.250
it's usually cut by sauvignon
blanc, or I like to have beer.

00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:59.400
Rosé is really good.

00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:03.660
A margarita is also delicious.

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:07.780
It's really-- I spent
20 years of my life--

00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:11.790
we would, at Charlie
Trotter, if somebody came in

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:15.120
to start off their
meal with red wine,

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:18.150
we would stop what we're doing.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:22.530
Then we would have to do
a red wine menu on a dime.

00:54:22.530 --> 00:54:24.810
So I get it.

00:54:24.810 --> 00:54:27.960
But for me, it's
really up to you,

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.760
how you want your food to be.

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:32.300
And the recipe's all about that.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.560
And if you want
to drink Kool-Aid,

00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:38.400
or if you want to drink
Gatorade, or lemonade,

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.280
it's really up to you.

00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.090
And you make that experience,
because we all do it.

00:54:43.090 --> 00:54:46.500
Like my wife, she's very
particular about what

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.190
she drinks.

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.710
I'm just, like,
give me an ice tea.

00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:56.310
I'll drink it with a steak, with
maitre-d' butter, and I'm OK.

00:54:56.310 --> 00:55:02.450
It's really up to the individual
what they want to experience.

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:05.634
And really, it shouldn't
be about the beverage

00:55:05.634 --> 00:55:06.300
you're drinking.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.970
Obviously, you want it
to be, like, so perfect.

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:12.430
And those recommendations
with beer, the white,

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:14.700
and the rosé is awesome.

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.640
But it's really you make
your own experience,

00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:19.590
I think, even with the recipe.

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.520
You make it your own experience.

00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:25.700
CHANGDRA RAM: He does say,
in the recipe for the chicken

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:28.850
drumsticks, that he used
to always drink Tang

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:30.310
with them when he was a kid.

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:30.620
BILL KIM: Tang.

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:31.190
CHANGDRA RAM: So there's Tang.

00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:32.065
BILL KIM: Yeah, Tang.

00:55:32.065 --> 00:55:34.400
I don't know of
Tang's around, but--

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:34.900
yeah

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:36.830
SPEAKER: It's the ideal pairing.

00:55:36.830 --> 00:55:40.247
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] given
your sommelier experience?

00:55:40.247 --> 00:55:41.830
CHANGDRA RAM:
Certainly, my experience

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:44.590
is not like a somm
working on the floor.

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:48.830
I mean, I think what Bill
said is very accurate.

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:50.447
I drink a lot of--

00:55:50.447 --> 00:55:52.280
I did have to drink
while writing this book.

00:55:54.790 --> 00:56:00.950
I really liked, also, a
lot of pinot gris, I think,

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:02.730
works really well
with those flavors.

00:56:02.730 --> 00:56:06.170
Viognier, as well, something
that's very sort of fruit

00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:08.810
forward works really
nicely with the spice.

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:14.510
But also, I think anything
kind of sparkling helps.

00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:18.830
Because it actually cleanses
your palate in between bites.

00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:21.290
So you don't get this
overload from the build-up

00:56:21.290 --> 00:56:25.190
of all of the seasonings kind
of killing your palate there.

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:27.630
So when in doubt, drink a beer.

00:56:27.630 --> 00:56:28.400
BILL KIM: Yeah.

00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.274
SPEAKER: OK, well, I
have one final question.

00:56:30.274 --> 00:56:34.010
It's a Q&amp;A on behalf of Greg
on our Café team for the Food

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:35.140
Talks program.

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:36.950
And just a quick plug--

00:56:36.950 --> 00:56:38.990
today's talk is very
much a collaboration

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:41.839
between the Google Food
Program and Talks at Google.

00:56:41.839 --> 00:56:43.880
And we probably will do
these types of talks just

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:45.770
to get folks engaged.

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:47.960
But one of the things
we're thinking about a lot

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:50.270
on the café side is
about food waste,

00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:54.050
and how we can reduce that,
and how we can be smarter about

00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:57.380
maybe making something new out
of what was cooked on Monday

00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.380
or whatever.

00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.440
And you have an entire
chapter dedicated

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:01.760
to reducing food waste.

00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.350
Tell us a little
bit more about that.

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:04.520
BILL KIM: Yeah.

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:10.880
I got to be very honest--
my wife hates leftovers.

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.530
After two days, she
will not eat it.

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:13.850
She will not touch it.

00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:15.650
So guess what?

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:18.560
I always tell her that I got
this from the restaurant,

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.940
or I bought it someplace.

00:57:19.940 --> 00:57:22.340
But it's actually redone.

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.380
I use the leftovers.

00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:29.930
So I think it's
part of cooking that

00:57:29.930 --> 00:57:33.170
is very underutilized,
because to me,

00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:35.300
that's how I
learned how to cook.

00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:38.750
You take spaghetti sauce, and
if you make more than what you

00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:41.280
have, what do you do with it?

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.730
Do you not make spaghetti
with spaghetti sauce?

00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:47.030
No, you could actually
make tomato soup

00:57:47.030 --> 00:57:48.990
by adding, maybe,
a little cream,

00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:52.100
and blending some
basil in there.

00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.440
So I love cooking like that.

00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:57.590
And the book is entirely
dedicated to that kind

00:57:57.590 --> 00:57:58.770
of cooking.

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:05.690
It's not wasting, and being
able to use everything.

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:07.430
We don't have
bread at the house.

00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:08.240
You know why?

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.520
Because I don't like
bread when it gets stale.

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:12.050
So we have rice cakes.

00:58:12.050 --> 00:58:15.590
I eat rice cakes like
nobody's business,

00:58:15.590 --> 00:58:17.090
because it doesn't go stale.

00:58:17.090 --> 00:58:21.660
So I'm very practical
about how we use the food.

00:58:21.660 --> 00:58:24.650
So when we buy a
whole chicken, yes, I

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:27.960
don't turn on my
stove to cook chicken.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.630
So we buy the
rotisserie chicken.

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:33.950
So that turns into three meals.

00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:36.642
So the second day, my wife
is at work, and I make soup.

00:58:36.642 --> 00:58:37.350
And she's, like--

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:38.600
I'm, like, I bought soup.

00:58:38.600 --> 00:58:39.380
Here it is.

00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:42.710
But she doesn't know it's
from the same chicken.

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:44.690
Then we'll do chicken salad.

00:58:44.690 --> 00:58:46.760
So now we're taking
that chicken so we

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.600
have three recipes out of it.

00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:52.580
So that's how we
like to kind of not

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:54.920
have food waste at the house.

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:57.860
Cilantro is used
many different ways.

00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:59.990
And just has to be so you can--

00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:01.370
my wife doesn't know.

00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:03.200
It's like we make pesto.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:07.460
We use it in soups, and
sometimes I might add oil.

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:10.040
But it's just constant.

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.590
Even sometimes when I have
Parmesan cheese left over

00:59:12.590 --> 00:59:18.080
from takeout, that
will go into something.

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.007
But my wife does not know.

00:59:21.007 --> 00:59:21.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.972
CHANGDRA RAM: But you're right.

00:59:24.972 --> 00:59:26.930
We do have an entire
chapter in the book that's

00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:29.150
all about how to use leftovers.

00:59:29.150 --> 00:59:32.240
And so there are recipes
for if you happen

00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:39.200
to have some extra
leftover chops,

00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.120
or if you have extra
skirt steak, say.

00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:43.220
And the kind of the
worst to approach

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:47.060
leftovers like that is to say,
I grilled this skirt steak

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:47.910
two days ago.

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:51.180
So now I'm going to
eat it the same way,

00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:52.700
and expect that
it's going to taste

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.120
like it did just off the grill.

00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:56.990
But you can thinly slice it.

00:59:56.990 --> 01:00:02.120
You can toss it with some
udon noodles, and maybe

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:06.200
some of the Korean pesto that's
one of the recipes in the book.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.540
And suddenly, you're
making it into something

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.860
that's totally different.

01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:13.340
So we have recipes
that Bill created

01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:17.314
that are all about how to
take different leftovers

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:18.230
from different things.

01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:22.710
Because once you look at
grilled, leftover asparagus

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:25.196
sitting in your fridge, you've
got to do something to it.

01:00:25.196 --> 01:00:27.570
Because you're not going to
just eat it the way you would

01:00:27.570 --> 01:00:30.930
if it just came off the grill,
but mixed up in a salad, mixed

01:00:30.930 --> 01:00:32.370
up in a sandwich, it's great.

01:00:32.370 --> 01:00:35.250
And so we also created all
these different matrices

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:41.040
to help guide readers and
users so if you take a protein,

01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.870
you want to add
a nice veg to it.

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:44.540
You want to have
some kind of starch.

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:47.070
And here all these different
examples, and then mix

01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:51.500
and match whatever you've
got in your kitchen,

01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:54.030
so you don't have to go out,
maybe, and find something

01:00:54.030 --> 01:00:57.450
special-- that you
can pull through,

01:00:57.450 --> 01:00:59.760
pull all of your leftovers
out of the fridge,

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:05.625
and create a really cool noodle
bowl, or a salad, or a grain

01:01:05.625 --> 01:01:07.740
bowl, or something
like that based

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:09.090
on what you've got leftover.

01:01:09.090 --> 01:01:11.025
So don't waste anything.

01:01:11.025 --> 01:01:12.450
SPEAKER: Awesome.

CHANGDRA RAM: Although
Yvonne is going to kill you

01:01:14.533 --> 01:01:15.870
after she hears this.

01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:18.480
BILL KIM: Only Alisa
and Changdra will tell,

01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:21.020
so I know who.

01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.345
SPEAKER: So we should all
say hi to Yvonne right now.

01:01:23.345 --> 01:01:24.240
CHANGDRA RAM: And Google.

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:24.760
SPEAKER: All right.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.550
Well, everyone, thanks
so much for coming out.

01:01:26.550 --> 01:01:28.050
Please give a warm
round of applause

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:30.750
for Bill Kim and Changdra.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.850
Thank you so much.
