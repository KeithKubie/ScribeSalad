00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:08.570
-Good morning.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:20.280
Welcome to Radcliffe Day 2016.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.330
This is a day to celebrate
Radcliffe's past, present

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.810
and future.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.220
I'm Liz Cohen, I'm Dean
of the Radcliffe Institute

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.950
for Advanced Study.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.460
Being here among so many of you
who are celebrating reunions

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.461
has reminded me that I mark
a milestone of my own--

00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:41.570
my fifth year as Radcliffe dean.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.060
And what a whirlwind these
five years have been.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.090
I've enjoyed watching our
three core programs grow.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.000
Our very competitive fellowship
program, our exciting public

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.730
lectures and conferences
through academic ventures,

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.350
and our renowned Schlesinger
Library on the history of women

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.730
in America.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.030
I've also taken great pleasure
in expanding the Radcliffe

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.810
professorship program to
help Harvard schools recruit

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
new diverse faculty talent,
deepening the institute's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.890
integration of the arts
in its programming,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.880
and creating new
opportunities for students

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.440
to partake in advanced study
beyond the standard curriculum.

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.480
A high point of this year, as
other years in the recent past,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.250
is honoring an inspiring woman
with the Radcliffe medal.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.660
We lauded Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg last year,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.890
and Harvard president Drew
Faust in 2014, just to name two.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.100
Today we are delighted
that our Radcliffe medalist

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.770
Janet Yellen, Chair
of the Federal Reserve

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.052
Board of the United States.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.950
It is our tradition to begin
Radcliffe Day with a panel

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.450
discussion on a topic close to
our honoree's head and heart.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.320
At lunch, we will celebrate
Janet Yellen's achievements,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.700
but now we will pay her
the honor of digging

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.240
into the subject she
cares deeply about.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:40.460
That topic is how to build an
American economy for prosperity

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.160
and equality.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.220
How to promote vigorous economic
growth that is broadly shared.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.050
In many ways, this
past century has

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.680
brought remarkable advances.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.490
In 1916, average life expectancy
hovered around age 50,

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.060
for both men and women
in the United States.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.850
Now, it is well above 70.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.550
Today, most citizens'
working lives

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.580
involve shorter hours and
fewer life-threatening

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.230
hazards than our
forebears faced.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.970
Roughly 63% of us
own our own homes,

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.880
compared to less than
half of Americans in 1916,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.700
even if today's rate is slightly
lower than it was a decade ago.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.080
We all enjoy recreational and
entertainment opportunities

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.410
beyond our grandparents'
imaginations.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.180
For many of you sitting
in the audience today,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.750
and the ability to travel
to Cambridge to enjoy

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.150
this panel would have
been far out of reach.

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.440
And watching it online would
have been unfathomable.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.580
While we mark enormous
societal progress,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.740
Americans' equal access to
a better economic standard

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.780
of living is shrinking.

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.620
We live in an era notable for
stunning growth in inequality.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.380
Right now, the world's
wealthiest 62 individuals

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.850
own more wealth than the bottom
50 percent of the entire world

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.710
population.

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.990
Just since 2010, the fortunes
of those 62 individuals

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.080
have increased by more than
half a trillion dollars.

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.750
While the wealth of
the bottom 50% percent

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.850
has fallen by a full
trillion dollars,

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.930
which constitutes a drop of 38%.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.790
The United States is
by no means insulated

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.660
from this global trend.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.970
According to a report by the
Economic Policy Institute,

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.860
since the 1970s real
wages for the top 1%

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.030
have risen 362%, while
real wages for most workers

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.740
have stagnated.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.340
The predictable result has been
increased wealth concentration

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.620
at the top.

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.660
In 2014, the wealthiest 20% of
Americans owned more than 80%

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.600
of all American wealth.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.070
In contrast, the wealth
of the poorest 20%

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.470
was negative, meaning
that they owed

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.300
more money than the value of all
of their assets put together.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.010
Despite the tendency of a
whopping 87% of Americans

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.400
to identify themselves
as middle class,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.490
the Pew Research Center issued
a report at the end of 2015,

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.500
with its main finding
stated clearly in the title.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.800
The report was called,
The American Middle Class

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.380
is Losing Ground-- No Longer
The Majority and Falling Behind

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.980
Financially.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:47.100
Scholars and commentators
of all political persuasions

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.310
have expressed alarm.

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.100
Alan Greenspan, former
chair of the Federal Reserve

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.820
Board-- appointed by
President Ronald Reagan--

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.030
has said publicly that current
levels of inequality are,

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.620
and I quote him, "not
the type of thing

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.200
which a democratic society, a
capitalist democratic society,

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.670
can really accept
without addressing."

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.990
Elsewhere on the
political spectrum,

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.600
economists and public
policy experts--

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.320
like Paul Krugman, Joseph
Stiglitz, and Robert Putnam--

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.880
likewise worried that
the growing chasm

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.100
between haves and have nots
threatens the very foundation

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.650
of American democracy.

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.440
At the beginning of this
year, officials from the World

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.870
Bank at the International
Monetary Fund,

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:36.000
along with former Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.130
all issued statements
within days of each other.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:42.620
Identifying inequality
as a chief impediment

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.540
to sustained economic growth.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.690
It wasn't always this way.

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.850
Even as recently as the three
decades following World War II.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.070
Wearing my other hat as a
20th century US historian,

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.990
I wrote a book entitled
A Consumer's Republic,

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.620
The Politics of Mass
Consumption in Post-war America.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.310
There I showed that
the post-war order,

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:11.090
that I labeled a
consumer's republic,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.600
was built upon an assumption
that was widely shared

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.830
by labor, , business and
government officials.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.020
That broad based
economic prosperity

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.730
would benefit individuals and
the nation at the same time,

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:29.320
as mass consumers protected
the jobs and purchasing

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:32.060
power of their fellow citizens.

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.970
President Harry Truman
made this point often.

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.980
To quote directly from one
of his speeches in 1950,

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.200
Truman said, "raising the
standards of our poorest

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.170
families will not be at the
expense of anybody else.

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.510
We will all benefit
from doing it,

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.460
for the incomes of the rest of
us will rise at the same time."

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.590
End quote.

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.720
Moreover, Truman and
subsequent presidents

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.580
believed that an
economically secure,

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:03.330
more equitable citizenry was
capitalism's best defense

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.270
against communism in
the raging Cold War.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.580
So how did we get
from then to now?

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.500
And what can we do about it?

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.020
These are the questions
that our esteemed panel

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.720
will consider today.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.570
The panel be moderated
by Cecilia Rouse,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.100
the dean of the Woodrow
Wilson School of Public Policy

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:27.230
at Princeton University,
where she is also

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:30.890
the Lawrence and Shirley
Katzman and Lewis and Anna Ernst

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:34.020
Professor in the
Economics of Education,

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:37.539
and a Professor of Economics
and Public Affairs.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:40.470
She served on President Bill
Clinton's National Economic

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:43.150
Council, and as a member
of the White House

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:47.520
Council of Economic Advisers
under President Barack Obama.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.940
She earned her A.B.
in Economics in 1986,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.970
and her PhD in Economics in
1992, both here at Harvard.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:58.460
Dean Rouse will introduce
the other panelists.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:02.180
Please join me in warmly
welcoming Dean Cecilia Rouse.

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.200
-So, good morning.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.170
It's an absolute
pleasure to introduce

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:21.320
this morning's panel, Building
an Economy for Prosperity

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.790
and Equality.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:25.170
It's quite a fitting
topic for a panel convened

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:27.050
in honor of Janet
Yellen's selection

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:29.384
as this year's
Radcliffe medalist.

00:09:29.384 --> 00:09:30.800
As you'll hear
throughout the day,

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.300
Janet's professional
life has been

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:36.120
devoted to studying critical
issues facing the macroeconomy,

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.400
both through her writings
as an academic scholar

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.750
and through her public
service, particularly

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.680
in the Federal Reserve System.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.200
She's been a key player in
maintaining and promoting

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.490
the economic health
of our country,

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.830
primarily by
working to find ways

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.170
to maximize employment,
stabilize prices, and moderate

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:58.050
long term interest rates
through monetary policy.

00:09:58.050 --> 00:09:59.810
However, in recent
years that task

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:02.610
has gotten just a
wee bit trickier.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:05.620
For decades, economists
promoted overall economic growth

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.030
with the belief that a
rising tide lifts all boats.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.690
That is, that the fruits and
gains from economic growth

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.150
would be shared by all.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:16.130
This view is perhaps
not surprising,

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.340
since between about
1910 and 1950,

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.030
wage inequality actually
narrowed, and then remained

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:25.870
relatively stable
until about 1980.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:28.360
It is pretty clear, however,
that today all boats

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.060
are not rising together.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.650
The past 35 years has seen
tremendous economic growth,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:39.250
but also an incredible rise in
income and wealth inequality.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:44.540
From 1973 to 2005, the top
1/5 of real family income

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.850
increased by about
1.6% annually,

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.320
while the bottom
fifth of families

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.740
experienced almost no gains.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:57.800
In 1978, the top 0.1% of
families held 7% of all wealth,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:03.370
while they held three times
that much-- 22%-- in 2012.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.040
In fact, today we have
levels of inequality

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.250
that have not been seen since
the times of the robber barons

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.490
over a century ago, with
rather dire consequences

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:16.380
for our economic, political,
and social fabric.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.370
So the speakers on
today's panel will

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:20.720
help illuminate what
we know and don't

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.670
know about economic growth
over the past century,

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.790
and how it has
been shared or not.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.600
They will also highlight
some of the causes

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:32.620
for the increased inequality,
and perhaps-- just perhaps--

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:35.310
offer a way to address it.

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:36.810
After giving each
of our panelists

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.090
a few minutes to discuss
an important dimension

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:42.080
of this issue, the panel will
have a short conversation

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.680
before we open it up
to your questions.

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:47.320
So let me introduce
our illustrious panel.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.840
First up is David
Autor, a professor

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.700
and associate department
chair at the MIT Department

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.120
of Economics.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.660
David is a faculty research
associate of the National

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.790
Bureau of Economic Research,
and a former Editor-in-Chief

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:02.310
of the Journal of
Economic Perspectives.

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.530
His current fields
of specialization

00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.320
include human capital
and earnings inequality,

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.690
labor market impact of
technological change

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.360
and globalization, disability
insurance, and labor supply,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:17.700
and temporary help and
other intermediated work

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.910
arrangements.

00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:21.080
He received his Bachelor's
Degree in Psychology

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:24.200
from Tufts University,
and a PhD In Public Policy

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.860
from the Harvard Kennedy
School of Government.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:29.880
Next to speak will be Louise
Sheiner, a senior fellow

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:32.910
in Economic Studies, and policy
director for the Hutchins

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:36.240
Center on Fiscal and Monetary
Policy at the Brookings

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.390
Institution.

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:41.390
Prior to joining Brookings,
Louise served as an economist

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:45.060
with the board of governors
at the Federal Reserve System.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.350
Most recently, as
the senior economist

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.740
in the Fiscal Analysis section
for the Research and Statistics

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:52.110
Division.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.040
That said, she's also served
in the Treasury Department,

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.050
and on the White House's
Council of Economic Advisers.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.340
Louise's research focuses
on health spending

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:02.080
and other fiscal issues.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.220
She is Harvard squared,
having received her PhD

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:09.150
in Economics from Harvard, as
well as an undergraduate degree

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.290
in Biology from Harvard.

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.430
Third, we have Claudia Goldin,
the Henry Lee professor

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.950
of Economics at Harvard, and
director of the National Bureau

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:19.550
of Economic Research's
Development of the American

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:21.300
Economy program.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:24.480
Claudia is an economic
historian and a labor economist.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.430
She has received many
honors and awards that

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.550
are just far too
numerous to name here,

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.760
so you can look up on Google.

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.180
Her research has covered
a wide array of topics,

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.470
including slavery, the
economic impact of war,

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:40.090
the female labor force,
immigration, New Deal policies,

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:43.430
income inequality,
technological change, education,

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.640
and the gender gap in pay.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.930
Most of her research
interprets the present

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:50.630
through the lens of the past,
and explores the origins

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:52.860
of current issues of concern.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:54.360
Claudia earned her
Bachelor's Degree

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.360
from Cornell
University, and a PhD

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.440
from the University of Chicago.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.650
Last, but not least, I'm pleased
to introduce Douglas Elmendorf,

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.800
the dean of the school
that I shall name here,

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.890
Harvard Kennedy
School of Government.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:09.830
Where he also serves
as the Don K. Price

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.044
professor of Public Policy.

00:14:12.044 --> 00:14:14.460
Doug served as director of the
Congressional Budget Office

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:18.290
from January 2009
through March 2015.

00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:20.940
Prior to joining CBO, he
served in many positions

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:24.160
in Washington, including at
the Brookings Institution,

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.750
the Council of
Economic Advisers,

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:28.410
the Treasury Department, and
the Federal Reserve Board.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:31.450
He has worked on important
issues, such as budget policy,

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:34.600
health care, the macroeconomic
effects of fiscal policy,

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:38.090
social security income security
programs, financial markets,

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:39.975
and macroeconomic analysis.

00:14:39.975 --> 00:14:41.350
Doug earned his
Bachelor's Degree

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:44.640
from Princeton University,
and his PhD from Harvard.

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.770
So David, I will turn
things over to you.

00:14:57.260 --> 00:14:57.760
-Thank you.

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:58.940
It's an honor to be here.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.370
It's an honor to be
honoring Chair Yellen,

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:04.900
and to be participating in the
Radcliffe Institute events.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.910
I want to just frame
this discussion a bit.

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:10.230
First, I want to talk
about why should we even

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.200
care about inequality.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:13.900
I don't think it's self
evident that we should.

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.350
Then I want to talk about
some of the challenges that

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:21.020
have made shared prosperity
a harder goal to achieve

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.880
in the last 40 years, than
in the three decades that

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.846
proceed it.

00:15:24.846 --> 00:15:26.220
And then the other
panelists will

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.230
fill in a much more
historical detail.

00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:31.029
And also, I set the stage for
how we address these issues.

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:32.570
So first, let me
make the case about,

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.810
why should we care
about inequality at all?

00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:38.500
We should start off by agreeing
that we need some inequality

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.450
in a market economy.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:42.500
If we don't have inequality,
we don't have incentives.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.220
If we want people to go spend
10 years in medical school,

00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:48.510
or two years pursuing a
PhD In computer science,

00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.800
we'd better reward
them when they're done.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.250
And so inequality is
not by itself evil.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.250
In fact, it can be
quite productive.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.670
The question is, can
we have too much of it?

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:06.062
And in the short run, you
could argue no, it just

00:16:06.062 --> 00:16:07.145
makes the economy dynamic.

00:16:07.145 --> 00:16:10.740
But I think in the long run, the
answers is possible to be yes.

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.060
And the reason the
answer might be yes

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.400
is because we have overlapping
generations of parents

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.980
and children and families.

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.730
And dynamism, in the
short run, can give rise

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.390
to dynasticism in the long run.

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:27.280
If we have so much concentration
of income and wealth

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.440
among a small group of adults,
then the next generation

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.260
of kids don't have the same
opportunities to succeed.

00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.650
In other words,
equality of opportunity

00:16:37.650 --> 00:16:39.980
is one of our greatest
shared values in America.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:41.920
Something we deeply
believe that people

00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.310
should have a good start, and
the opportunity to succeed,

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:47.620
on the basis of their
talent and hard work.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:52.150
And if we make the race
too unequal at the outset,

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.020
it's harder and
harder to achieve

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.160
that equality of opportunity
over the long run.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.450
And that's what concerns me,
when I think about inequality,

00:16:59.450 --> 00:17:02.756
that we can reach a point where
the economic rewards of today

00:17:02.756 --> 00:17:07.990
and the incentives are so
great, that the prizes are

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:11.050
so large that pretty
soon inequality

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:13.099
becomes the enemy
of opportunity,

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:17.280
rather than the force
that propels it.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.160
So now let me talk
about, what are

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.579
the forces that have given
rise to so much inequality?

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:25.950
As was mentioned by Ceci, from
the end of the second World War

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:27.650
through the early
1970s, we had a period

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:31.780
of extremely rapid productivity
growth and shared prosperity.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.390
That period is
anomalous in history.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.780
People like to say that's
the way it should always be,

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.238
but they're probably
the only three

00:17:37.238 --> 00:17:39.890
decades in all of human history
that were quite like that.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:44.130
So I'm all in favor for that, if
we can make that happen again.

00:17:44.130 --> 00:17:46.810
But that was a remarkable
postwar period.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.760
We'd had huge technological
advances, huge advances

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.954
in skills and education.

00:17:51.954 --> 00:17:54.370
And, of course, the US had a
leadership role in the world,

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.450
where it was the driver of so
much of what else was going on.

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.690
Since that time, one of the
first challenges we faced

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.050
is actually slowing
productivity growth.

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.780
Productivity growth is the thing
that ultimately creates wealth

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.000
that we can distribute.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.950
When that growth slows,
there's less to go around.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:12.270
And even our huge
rise of inequality

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:15.020
wouldn't seem so awful if
all the boats were rising.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.990
But to have some
people getting so rich,

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:19.290
when productivity
growth is so slow,

00:18:19.290 --> 00:18:23.806
means the other boats
are stagnant or sinking.

00:18:23.806 --> 00:18:25.180
And you can even
see that, if you

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.765
look at the period from
1995 to around 2000,

00:18:27.765 --> 00:18:30.092
during the internet
productivity surge.

00:18:30.092 --> 00:18:32.550
That was actually a period of
shared prosperity in America.

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:34.670
That was a period when
everyone's raise wages were

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.610
rising, when employment to
population rates were growing,

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:38.810
crime rates were falling.

00:18:38.810 --> 00:18:41.160
Many, many good
things come from that.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.660
From rapid productivity growth,
and also tight labor markets

00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:46.850
that pull wages
up at the bottom.

00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:50.870
Harder to accomplish, but
something very much desired.

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.860
A second issue
that we have faced

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:57.180
is actually slowing attainment
of higher education.

00:18:57.180 --> 00:18:58.820
Education has been
one of the keys

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:01.620
to American prosperity
for more than a century.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.100
Professor Goldin will
speak about that.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:08.460
But since the early 1970s,
and up until recently,

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.700
college attainment rates slowed.

00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:12.439
For men, actually fell.

00:19:12.439 --> 00:19:13.980
And not only did
that mean that there

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.235
were fewer people benefiting
from getting a higher

00:19:17.235 --> 00:19:19.360
education-- and the earnings
associated with that--

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.660
but that slowing supply
of higher education

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:23.410
actually led to rising
wage inequality.

00:19:23.410 --> 00:19:26.350
Caused this premium to
education to rise a lot.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.960
So there are actually
three benefits

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.820
to sending people to college.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.030
One is it makes them better off.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:36.220
Two is that it actually
reduces inequality,

00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.070
because as you increase
the supply of more

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.620
educated workers, their wages
actually come down a bit.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.500
Third, it actually
benefits the workers

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.580
who don't go to college,
because it makes them scarcer.

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.880
Employers have to fight harder
to get high school educated

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:52.070
labor to do those jobs.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.490
So investment in education
is one of the areas

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.730
where the US has fallen short.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.782
Maybe not expenditure,
we spend a lot.

00:19:58.782 --> 00:20:00.490
But in actually getting
people to succeed

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:02.900
in going through college.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:06.560
A third important factor is the
forces of technological change

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:07.557
in globalization.

00:20:07.557 --> 00:20:09.140
There's been a lot
written about that.

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.950
me just catch summarize
it in a sentence or two.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.300
What those two forces
collectively have done

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.535
is, on the one hand, amplify
the value of scarce talents.

00:20:17.535 --> 00:20:19.057
People who have
great ideas, people

00:20:19.057 --> 00:20:20.640
who can run large
corporations, people

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.080
who are fantastic
athletes and entertainers.

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.880
They become so
much more valuable

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.405
in a world market
where their skills can

00:20:27.405 --> 00:20:31.570
be delivered electronically,
or through their products

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:32.970
worldwide.

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:35.260
So on the one hand,
it amplifies talent.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:37.710
On the other hand, it
can also commodify labor.

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:39.680
If you're not someone
who has a scarce talent,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.280
if you make shoes or
you sew clothes, well,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.810
you're suddenly in much
fiercer competition with people

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.050
throughout the
rest of the world.

00:20:48.050 --> 00:20:49.690
With whom we can
trade and transport,

00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:53.020
or even with technologies
that are beginning to erode

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.830
or being able to
accomplish that skill set.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:58.400
So those factors really
do amplify and contribute

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:00.180
to the growth of inequality.

00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:02.130
And then I would
say the final factor

00:21:02.130 --> 00:21:04.300
is a certain resignation.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.240
A view that, well,
this is the market.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.090
That's what the market says,
we do what the market says.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.397
Or the view that
actually it's good,

00:21:11.397 --> 00:21:13.730
all that inequality-- the
more the better-- just creates

00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:14.520
incentives.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.380
And I've already made the
argument that, in fact, you

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.290
can have too much inequality.

00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:22.220
It can actually be the enemy
of meritocracy, not always

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.190
the friend.

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:27.170
And the view that we
have no control over it

00:21:27.170 --> 00:21:28.436
is simply incorrect.

00:21:28.436 --> 00:21:30.060
Because we can look
around us, and look

00:21:30.060 --> 00:21:32.690
at many other advanced
economies-- throughout Europe

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:36.700
for example, or
Singapore-- that have

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.940
lower levels of inequality.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.910
Not Singapore in this case.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.516
But have lower
levels of inequality,

00:21:42.516 --> 00:21:45.227
high social cohesion,
and the same productivity

00:21:45.227 --> 00:21:46.060
growth that we have.

00:21:46.060 --> 00:21:48.260
In other words, they have
not suffered terribly

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.410
for their burden of
shared prosperity.

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:52.570
And we may not either.

00:21:52.570 --> 00:21:55.120
So it is within our control.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.620
The economic forces
are fundamental.

00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:57.750
We can't ignore them.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:59.570
Simultaneously, we
actually have a lot

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:01.910
of institutional and social
and public and political

00:22:01.910 --> 00:22:04.050
choice about how we
want to organize,

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:07.130
how we want to share the
benefits of our productivity

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.150
and our ideas and our
creativity and our hard work.

00:22:10.150 --> 00:22:13.390
So there are challenges,
but there's opportunity.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:17.430
And there's, in no sense,
inevitable-- not something

00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:20.376
that is beyond our ability
to address and correct

00:22:20.376 --> 00:22:21.402
and improve.

00:22:21.402 --> 00:22:22.110
Thanks very much.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.270
-Good morning.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.080
First of all, let me
say what an honor it

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.260
is for me to be part of
such an esteemed panel.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.620
And also to celebrate
Janet Yellen,

00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:44.470
who I've long admired as an
extremely dedicated, brilliant,

00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:46.920
and caring academic
and public servant.

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.779
OK, so Cece and David
have talked a lot

00:22:49.779 --> 00:22:51.570
about income inequality,
which is something

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:55.030
that we have known for a
long time is a problem,

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:57.830
and has been an area
of great concern.

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.840
But it's only in
the last few years

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:03.180
that we've begun to recognize
an additional source of growing

00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:07.610
inequality, and that's
inequality in life expectancy.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:11.141
So it's long been the case
here throughout history,

00:23:11.141 --> 00:23:12.640
in the United States
and everywhere,

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:14.870
that people who are
richer live longer.

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:16.290
So that's nothing new.

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:17.400
We've always known that.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.550
But what we used to think
was that as the economy

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:24.930
would grow, then that growth
would help to narrow the gap.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:27.200
So if you had improved
public sanitation,

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.007
and public education,
those things

00:23:29.007 --> 00:23:31.090
would help everybody live
longer, but particularly

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:31.590
the poor.

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:33.750
And you expect the
gap to be narrowing.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.920
But what it turns out
is, in the United States

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.760
at least, that gap has
actually been widening.

00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:41.040
OK so the first study
that looked at this

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:43.317
came from the Social
Security Administration.

00:23:43.317 --> 00:23:45.150
And they took their
Social Security records,

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.200
and they divided the
population of men in two.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.340
And they looked at life
expectancy and changes

00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:51.310
over time.

00:23:51.310 --> 00:23:54.590
So they started with people
who were born in 1912.

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:57.380
In people who were born
in 1912, the top half

00:23:57.380 --> 00:24:00.640
of the income distribution
lived about less than a

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.420
year, almost a year longer
than the bottom half.

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:05.745
So the bottom half of the
income distribution at 65

00:24:05.745 --> 00:24:07.740
could to expect to
live almost until 80,

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:10.360
and the top half
until 80 and 1/2.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.290
Now, fast forward
30 years later.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:16.010
We're talking about the
cohorts who were born in 1940,

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:21.130
and that gap in life expectancy
had widened to over five years.

00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:24.390
So now there was an over five
year difference at age 65

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:27.140
and how long the top half of
the income distribution lived,

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:28.300
relative to the bottom.

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:31.550
And that came because the bottom
half of the income distribution

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:34.505
did have increases in life
expectancy, but only about 1

00:24:34.505 --> 00:24:35.760
and 1/2 years.

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:38.700
Whereas the top half of
the income distribution had

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.960
increases in the life
expectancy of about six years.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.460
Now many other
recent studies-- you

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.959
might have heard about a study
from Raj Chetty and coauthors

00:24:46.959 --> 00:24:49.920
using incredibly rich tax
data-- have found the same thing

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.200
recently, which is that those
in the bottom of the income

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.420
distribution had gained very
little in life expectancy.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.290
While those at the top have
experienced major improvements.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.770
A study that came
out from a panel

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:03.850
that I was on at the
National Academy of Sciences

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.210
said, well, what happens
if these trends continue?

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:09.530
So if these trends
continue, we take the cohort

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.170
born in 1960--
basically my cohort--

00:25:12.170 --> 00:25:13.360
and say, let's now compare.

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:16.740
We used quintiles, so let's
compare 20% of the population.

00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.960
So let's compare the
bottom 20% to the top 20%

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.550
of the population, and see
what changes in life expectancy

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:23.400
will be.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:26.420
And what we found is that
if these trends continue,

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:31.960
we can expect the bottom
20% to live 13 years less,

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:35.000
from age on, than the top 20%.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.130
So an extremely big
difference in how many years

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:40.010
people are living.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.468
So think about it,
not only have we

00:25:41.468 --> 00:25:44.510
had income inequality, wage
stagnation at the bottom,

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:47.386
but also changes
in life expectancy.

00:25:47.386 --> 00:25:49.010
And when we talk
about life expectancy,

00:25:49.010 --> 00:25:50.509
that's because it's
easy to measure.

00:25:50.509 --> 00:25:51.550
We know when people die.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:53.740
But it's not just that
we're all equally healthy

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.080
and just sort of die
at different ages.

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.290
We know that if life expectancy
is so widely different,

00:26:00.290 --> 00:26:01.390
then so is health.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:04.430
In fact, health economists think
the better measure of your age

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:07.786
is not how many years since
your birth, but before you die.

00:26:07.786 --> 00:26:09.660
That's going to tell
you how healthy you are.

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:13.265
So people at the bottom
have had little income,

00:26:13.265 --> 00:26:15.265
little improvement in
health, little improvement

00:26:15.265 --> 00:26:16.900
in life expectancy.

00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:19.240
No wonder there's so
much anger out there.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.830
Very big difference.

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:22.930
You've probably heard
about a recent study

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.180
by Ann Case and Angus
Deaton, who won the Nobel

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.085
Prize in Economics.

00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:27.710
They looked at
something quite similar,

00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:31.050
they looked at death
rates from 2000 to 2014,

00:26:31.050 --> 00:26:33.501
for people 45 to 55.

00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:35.500
And usually, we think
that over time death rates

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.880
decline, life expectancy
increases because we're all

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.700
getting richer, and we
have better medicine

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:40.980
and better technology.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.670
But what they found was
actually an increase

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:46.750
in death rates for
45 to 55-year-Olds,

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:49.280
particularly those white
males without a high school

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.691
education.

00:26:50.691 --> 00:26:52.440
And where did those
death rates come from?

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.740
They could look at the causes.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:58.150
Well, they came from things like
increased suicide, alcoholism,

00:26:58.150 --> 00:26:59.420
and drug addiction.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.390
So it's a very concrete
example of the despair

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:03.780
that's out there.

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:05.950
Now, how does this relate
to income inequality?

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:07.030
The truth is, we're
not really sure.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:07.904
Is it the same thing?

00:27:07.904 --> 00:27:09.324
Is it just another
manifestation?

00:27:09.324 --> 00:27:10.740
So some people
think it's actually

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.640
the income inequality that is
creating the life expectancy

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:14.460
inequality.

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:17.607
That could come because people
at the top of the distribution,

00:27:17.607 --> 00:27:19.190
they're still at the
top 20%, but they

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:20.960
have so much more money
than they used to,

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.780
relative to the bottom.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.446
And maybe they're
able to use that money

00:27:23.446 --> 00:27:25.330
to buy things that
increase their lifespan.

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:28.950
It's possible that just living
in such an unequal society

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.800
creates a lot of stresses and
strains that affect health.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.109
And it's possible that now
income can now buy things

00:27:36.109 --> 00:27:38.400
that it couldn't buy, that
will help increase your life

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:38.899
expectancy.

00:27:38.899 --> 00:27:40.160
So it's possible.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.170
The causality could
also be the reverse.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.982
It could be that we've had
health inequality, maybe coming

00:27:44.982 --> 00:27:46.440
from different
things in childhood.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.649
And the health inequality
leads to income inequality,

00:27:48.649 --> 00:27:50.981
because people who are not
in good health-- particularly

00:27:50.981 --> 00:27:53.440
mental health-- are not going
to end up working and making

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.290
a lot of money.

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.886
So that's a possibility.

00:27:55.886 --> 00:27:57.260
And it's also
possible that's all

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.970
coming from some other factor.

00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:01.510
Something like education,
the quality of education,

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:04.270
or the skills that people are
learning when they're young.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:06.820
There are skills like
perseverance and self control

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:08.840
and discipline that
can help affect both

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.990
your income and your health.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:12.210
So we don't really know.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:15.621
One thing that we do know is
part of the changes is smoking.

00:28:15.621 --> 00:28:17.870
So we know that the high
income people started smoking

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.180
first and quit smoking first.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.080
But researchers say that
could explain maybe 20%-30%

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.170
of the widening gap
in life expectancy.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:28.140
So this is a clearly
huge issue, and we

00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:31.250
need to know more about it,
and understand more about it.

00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:34.170
But in any case, it
seems like any measures

00:28:34.170 --> 00:28:35.770
that we can take
that would likely

00:28:35.770 --> 00:28:40.080
reduce income inequality would
probably have a benefit on life

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:41.740
expectancy inequality as well.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.800
Typically things that
are, like, investment

00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:45.480
in children, improvements
in education,

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.730
because we know that education
and health are actually

00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:48.454
quite correlated.

00:28:48.454 --> 00:28:49.870
And there's evidence
that actually

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:52.220
calls that more educated
people take measures

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.580
that improve their health.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:58.380
So let me just say,
the gap life expectancy

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:00.310
is something that we
need to deal with.

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:04.370
It affects how we think
about society in general,

00:29:04.370 --> 00:29:06.990
and also how we think about
programs like Social Security

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.350
and Medicare.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.010
Because we think
of those programs

00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:14.681
as progressive programs,
because the people at the lower

00:29:14.681 --> 00:29:16.680
end of the income
distribution get a better deal

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.055
from Social Security
and Medicare

00:29:18.055 --> 00:29:19.300
than the people at the top.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:22.510
But these programs are programs
that pay out for every year

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.810
that you're alive.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:27.350
So widening disparity
and life expectancy

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.840
is also meaning there's widening
disparity in the returns

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.495
that people are getting from
programs like Social Security

00:29:31.495 --> 00:29:32.410
and Medicare.

00:29:32.410 --> 00:29:34.186
And so, when we start
to think about how

00:29:34.186 --> 00:29:35.810
to reform those
programs, which we will

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:38.349
be doing over the
next 10 to 15 years,

00:29:38.349 --> 00:29:39.640
it's something to keep in mind.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.500
But I think that's
actually second order.

00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.080
I mean, the way I think about
the increase in life expectancy

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:47.820
is it's a really concrete
example of what's

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.205
happening to our society.

00:29:49.205 --> 00:29:51.580
We can argue about what's
happening to wages, the bottom,

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:53.413
and whether or not we're
measuring it right.

00:29:53.413 --> 00:29:55.360
But we know we're
measuring life expectancy,

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.180
and so I think it should serve
as a clarion call to say,

00:29:58.180 --> 00:29:59.930
we really need to do
something about that.

00:29:59.930 --> 00:30:00.910
Thank you.

00:30:12.101 --> 00:30:12.600
-Greetings.

00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.290
So one of the many
nice things about being

00:30:19.290 --> 00:30:23.250
a historian and an
economist is that I can

00:30:23.250 --> 00:30:24.840
do really great back casting.

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.440
And I get it right
almost every time.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.810
So, I want to tell you a story.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.170
And it's a story about
a bold investment

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:42.170
that the US made in the early
part of the 20th century.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:45.330
And the investment
was made locally

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:49.060
and at the state level, and
not nationally by and large.

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:53.130
And it reflected a commitment
on the part of most Americans

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.360
to provide education
to its youth,

00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:59.090
although the south and African
Americans in many regions

00:30:59.090 --> 00:31:02.000
are sad exceptions to my story.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.900
So it was this
investment that led

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.740
to a great narrowing of
the income distribution,

00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:13.620
and it is the slowing down of
these educational investments--

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:16.390
and David remarked
about that-- that

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:21.140
produce much of the widening
of the income distribution.

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.220
So I'm going to
have a few caveats

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:27.440
at the end of my remarks
about the top 1%,

00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.610
but right now let's say
that my remarks are going

00:31:30.610 --> 00:31:33.830
to be about the bottom 99%.

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.160
that is a pretty big group.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:43.260
So from the end of World War
II to around the late 1970s,

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:46.220
America grew together.

00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:48.810
Economic growth, as
we've heard from others,

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:50.150
was largely shared.

00:31:50.150 --> 00:31:53.380
And it was, moreover,
rather strong

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:56.720
in an exceptional period.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:59.550
The bottom fifth of
families in that period

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.460
experienced income growth that
was actually a bit greater

00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.890
than that of the top
fifth, and the middle group

00:32:06.890 --> 00:32:12.000
had growth in-- believe it or
not-- the 2.5% range average

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.220
annually.

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:15.640
So everyone was doing
better, and they

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.540
were doing better in each
part of the distribution.

00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:21.990
But after the late
1970s, America

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:28.200
began to grow out apart, and
growth was fairly anemic.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:33.190
The top 5% grew, yes, at more
than 2% average annually.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:36.810
But the lowest fifth
hardly grew at all.

00:32:36.810 --> 00:32:39.750
So how did the US
once manage to have

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.790
economic growth with equity?

00:32:42.790 --> 00:32:45.890
And the answer must
be sought, actually,

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.160
in the late 19th
century, when incomes

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.960
had become extremely unequal.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.760
America, in even
earlier times, was

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.540
known by de Tocqueville and
others as the best poor man's

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:01.670
country.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:04.640
If you were poor in
Europe, and you came here,

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.910
you would do much better.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:11.020
But it had become a place of
robber barons in the Gilded

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:15.490
Age, and the land of
rising and high inequality.

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:20.900
Discontent was intense, and it
gave rise to many third party

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.720
movements--
populists, socialists,

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:28.850
and rampant
anti-immigration sentiment.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:31.950
Sound familiar?

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:38.680
The returns to a high school
degree in 1900 were very high.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:42.810
And even an ordinary
clerks and bookkeepers

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.910
made substantial incomes.

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:50.950
Part of rising inequality
came from an increased demand

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:55.410
for skills that could
be provided in schools.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:00.980
That is what we now term
skill-biased technical change.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.290
In community after
community in the US,

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:09.300
it was a groundswell for
publicly funded high schools,

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:14.210
and thus was born what we
historians call the High School

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:15.449
Movement.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:19.060
In 1910, as this movement
began to take off,

00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.190
European visitors scoffed
at the American notion

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:26.820
of educating its masses, and
they maintained an elite--

00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.310
but actually quite
excellent-- education

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.449
that admitted only the
brightest at 11 years old.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:37.860
Americans were far
more egalitarian.

00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:42.409
By the eve of World War II,
the median 18-year-old male

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:44.900
in the US was a
high school graduate

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:47.510
poised to go to college.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:52.980
The US GI Bill in 1944
guaranteed a college education

00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:57.310
to returning GIs, but a
similar bill in Britain

00:34:57.310 --> 00:35:01.800
could guarantee only
schooling to age 15.

00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:10.100
The US had made a bold move,
later copied by most others.

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.750
The US did the right thing
in expanding high schools

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:16.410
at that period,
and then college.

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:19.610
Mistakes were made
along the way that we

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:23.540
live with now, regarding
standards and excellence.

00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.970
But this isn't the
time to discuss those.

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:32.400
The question before us is how we
know when major investments are

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.590
worth undertaking, when many
of the returns accrue much,

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:40.480
much later, if at all.

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.120
In the early years of
the High School Movement,

00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.210
the returns to a year of
school were very high.

00:35:47.210 --> 00:35:48.320
It was palpable.

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.120
It was known, even for
that marginal student.

00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:57.600
Employers were searching
for workers with the skills

00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:01.200
that high school
educated youths had.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.250
Even without any of
the other benefits that

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:08.870
accrue with more education--
such as benefits regarding

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.480
health, for example--
the investment

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:16.880
seemed worth the foregone
income and the direct costs.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:20.780
The same can be said
of college today.

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.410
Well identified
estimates indicate

00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:28.280
that even the
marginal student has

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:33.660
significant gains to most types
of post-secondary education.

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:38.300
When I first wrote that, I said,
to post-secondary education,

00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.190
and then I remembered
my own work

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:42.770
on for-profit higher education.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:48.210
So I said, most types of
post-secondary education.

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:49.960
So, I will conclude.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.670
But before I do, I need to
go back and say something

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:56.200
about that top 1%.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:01.880
Growth for the top 1% has been
enormous in the past 35 years,

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:08.900
increasing their total
income from 10% to 21%

00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.570
in that 35 year period.

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:16.890
But in terms of annual
income, the increased value

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:23.130
of a college education is
about three times larger.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:28.200
And that is a very complicated
calculation that I cannot say,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.770
because I don't have time,
and you don't want to hear it.

00:37:32.770 --> 00:37:38.940
So, in conclusion, can we
have growth with equity again?

00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:42.760
The issue of growth
is the hardest part.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.750
Equity may be easier.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:45.250
Thanks.

00:37:57.690 --> 00:37:58.380
-Thank you.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:01.520
I am delighted to be
here for Radcliffe Day,

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.950
and honored to be included
in this celebration of Janet

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:05.460
Yellen.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:07.980
I will use my few
minutes to draw out

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.220
some implications of the
other panelists' remarks

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.150
for fiscal policy and
monetary policy, two

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:16.060
areas in which Janet
has, of course, played

00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.520
very important roles.

00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:19.750
Also, as it turns out,
two areas in which I have

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:22.250
had the privilege of
working for Janet.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.860
I was a staff economist at
the Federal Reserve Board

00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.650
in the mid 1990s, when
she was the governor.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.380
And then I was on the staff
of the President's Council

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:32.920
of Economic Advisers
in the late 1990s,

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.617
when Janet was the Chair.

00:38:34.617 --> 00:38:36.200
And if I were really
smart, I would've

00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:38.434
kept following her
around after that,

00:38:38.434 --> 00:38:40.350
because I would have
kept learning a lot more.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:43.640
But other jobs intruded.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.400
But what I want to do
now is to highlight

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.325
three areas of fiscal policy.

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:51.560
And I'll focus on federal
fiscal policy, where

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:54.740
I think fiscal policy can play
an important role in helping

00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.000
to generate inclusive
economic growth.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.750
And then I'll highlight
one recommendation

00:38:58.750 --> 00:39:00.810
for monetary policy.

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:03.190
For fiscal policy,
first and foremost,

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:07.600
we should increase investments
in education and training.

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.490
Under the current caps
on annual appropriations,

00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:14.250
federal investments all
sorts-- for infrastructure,

00:39:14.250 --> 00:39:16.570
for research and development,
and for education

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:21.720
and training-- will soon fall
to their smallest share of GDP

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:24.460
in at least 50 years.

00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:27.930
That is not forward-looking,
growth-oriented economic

00:39:27.930 --> 00:39:28.940
policy.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.480
And it is particularly
unfortunate for people who are

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.760
growing up in poor families,
or in areas with low average

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.310
income, because those people
cannot rely on their families,

00:39:41.310 --> 00:39:45.930
or their communities, to
provide high quality education

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:47.160
and training.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.710
Federal support, directed
in the right way,

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.240
can make a substantial
difference.

00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.600
Now, the money is not a panacea.

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.390
As David noted, we don't spend
all of our education dollars

00:39:58.390 --> 00:40:03.110
wisely-- current
location excepted.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:07.020
But studies show that when
additional money is given

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:09.140
to poor school
districts, for example,

00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:11.895
the students in those
districts do better.

00:40:11.895 --> 00:40:14.020
So there are a lot of steps
to making our education

00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.940
and training in this
country more effective.

00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:18.060
But a simple starting
point is to increase

00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:22.640
federal support for those
issues, not to cut it.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:25.920
Increasing federal investment
is especially inappropriate now,

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:30.530
because market interest
rates that the Treasury pays

00:40:30.530 --> 00:40:35.090
are so low, and will probably
stay low for some time.

00:40:35.090 --> 00:40:37.780
And in research that Louise
and I are doing together,

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:40.180
we show that low
interest rates generally

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.000
imply-- as one might expect--
that the federal government

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.110
should, in fact,
issue more debt,

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.600
and undertake more
investment, than it

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:52.150
would under other conditions.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.430
A second way in which
federal fiscal policy

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:57.720
should help to generate
inclusive economic growth

00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:02.470
is to maintain benefits for
lower and middle income people,

00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:05.650
rather than cutting them as
part of some deficit reduction

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:08.290
effort, or for other purposes.

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:11.190
Federal benefits, transfer
benefits in general,

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.320
play two crucial roles.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:16.430
One role is to help
children growing up

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:20.470
in families of modest
means get a stronger start.

00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:22.570
A small but growing
body of evidence

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:25.020
shows that federal
subsidies-- for health

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.410
care, for housing,
for education,

00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:32.130
and for other things-- helps
children earn higher incomes

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.560
later in their lives.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:36.900
So in many respects,
those federal benefits

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:39.530
are a true investment.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.620
But benefits also
matter because they

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.560
protect people, to some extent,
from the vicissitudes of market

00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.700
forces.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.680
As a number of the
panelists have said,

00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:53.620
incomes for people on the
lower and middle parts

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:57.660
of the distribution
have grown very slowly

00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.530
over the past few decades.

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:01.380
But those are market incomes.

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:06.020
If one then incorporates the
effects of transfers and taxes,

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:09.430
incomes in the lower and middle
parts of the distribution

00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:10.610
have done much better.

00:42:10.610 --> 00:42:14.320
Not super well, but much
better than they would have.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.500
So that the tax
and transfer system

00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:21.990
has limited the extent
of widening in standards

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:25.570
of living, in the face of
this very sharp widening

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:29.170
in pre-tax,
pre-transfer incomes.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.270
Moreover, tax and
transfer system pays

00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:34.850
plays a very important role
during economic downturns.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:38.504
In this last downturn,
market incomes

00:42:38.504 --> 00:42:40.170
for people in the
lower and middle parts

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:42.630
of the distribution
fell markedly.

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:47.310
But their incomes after tax
and transfers were incorporated

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.370
were much more stable.

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:52.250
So these benefits play
absolutely crucial roles,

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:56.110
both in laying the groundwork
for future, more equal growth

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:59.510
in market incomes, and
for protecting people

00:42:59.510 --> 00:43:02.930
from a diversion, so marketing
comes in economic downturns

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:05.850
or even over a period
of several decades.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.890
A third way in which
federal fiscal policy

00:43:07.890 --> 00:43:10.930
should be used to help generate
inclusive economic growth

00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:13.550
is to keep the total demand
for goods and services

00:43:13.550 --> 00:43:17.480
high enough that we
achieve full employment.

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.505
Full employment is
tremendously important,

00:43:19.505 --> 00:43:22.870
for both economic
and social reasons.

00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:25.740
Tight labor markets draw
people into the labor force,

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:28.340
and they push up
the growth of wages.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:31.160
And those factors are especially
important for lower income

00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.790
people who are more likely
to lose their jobs when

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:36.290
labor demand is weak, and
who have less resources

00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:39.660
to fall back on when
they do lose their jobs.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.670
So full employment
allows for more income

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.270
for people who need it.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:47.020
It also fulfills our
social commitment

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:51.670
to have an economy in which
willing workers can find work.

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:53.700
Unfortunately, maintaining
full employment

00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.990
is likely to be quite
difficult in the coming years.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:59.950
In each of the past
three recessions,

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:02.270
the Federal Reserve has
cut the federal funds rate

00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:04.940
by more than five
percentage points.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.560
But with market
interest rates so low,

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:09.830
they are very unlikely
to have that much room

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:13.030
to cut when the next
recession arrives.

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:15.810
That means that counter
cyclical fiscal policy--

00:44:15.810 --> 00:44:18.370
cuts in taxes or increases
in federal spending

00:44:18.370 --> 00:44:22.340
when the economy weakens-- will
be more important in the coming

00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:26.740
decades than it was the
1970s and 1980s and 1990s.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:30.660
We should be strengthening our
automatic fiscal stabilizers,

00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.880
and developing a
set of policies,

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:36.870
additionally, that we could
put into place if needed.

00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:42.210
A rush to reduce budget
deficits after 2010

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:45.400
was the biggest error
in economic policy

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:47.110
in this downturn,
in this country,

00:44:47.110 --> 00:44:50.760
and we should not make
that mistake again.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.980
My last and shortest point
is about monetary policy.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.990
To help generate
inclusive economic growth,

00:44:56.990 --> 00:44:59.420
the Federal Reserve
should continue

00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:04.070
to focus on both
maximum employment

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:07.320
and on stable
prices, the two parts

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.200
of its so-called dual mandate.

00:45:10.200 --> 00:45:13.570
To be sure, monetary policy
cannot achieve full employment

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:15.960
on its own in most
cases, because of both

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.650
the longstanding reason-- that
structural problems can be

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:23.060
important in labor markets--
and for the new reason,

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.980
that the Federal Reserve will
have less scope to cut rates

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:27.510
in the future.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:30.610
But saying that the Reserve
cannot achieve full employment

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.730
on its own, or cannot achieve
it just by reducing the federal

00:45:33.730 --> 00:45:36.870
funds rate, does not let the
Federal Reserve off the hook

00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:39.060
in what it needs to do.

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.440
Since the financial crisis,
under the leadership

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.400
of Ben Bernanke
and Janet Yellen,

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.890
the Federal Reserve has
developed creative ways

00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:48.780
to accomplish the
mandates that had

00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.540
been set for it in law of
maximum employment and price

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.570
stability.

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:56.120
We should be very
grateful that they

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.600
had the wisdom and
the analytic skill

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.520
to develop these new tools.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:05.020
And we should expect them
to use those tools again

00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.717
when future conditions warrant.

00:46:06.717 --> 00:46:07.550
Thank you very much.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:24.400
-So, I'm going to ask the
panel a question or two.

00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:27.920
But I believe you have
cards in your folders,

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:31.457
and so you can take this
time to write questions.

00:46:31.457 --> 00:46:32.790
That's what those cards are for.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.373
And I think there
are individuals here

00:46:34.373 --> 00:46:35.950
to whom you can
pass those cards.

00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:37.857
And that's how we'll
be doing the Q&amp;A.

00:46:37.857 --> 00:46:39.940
So I wanted to make sure
I made that announcement.

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:43.210
OK, so one topic
that's been fairly

00:46:43.210 --> 00:46:48.220
hot in the presidential
elections so far, the campaign,

00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:52.870
is international trade, and
its responsibility in possibly

00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:54.132
increasing community quality.

00:46:54.132 --> 00:46:55.840
None of you mentioned
it, I was wondering

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.797
if anybody-- oh, maybe you
did, David-- but I was just

00:46:58.797 --> 00:47:00.630
wondering if you could
say a little bit more

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:01.970
of what has been
the role of trade.

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:03.360
What should be
the role of trade,

00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:06.330
especially as we are becoming
a more globalized economy?

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:10.110
-Sure.

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:12.160
This is something
I've worked on a lot,

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.460
and trade has always been a
contentious economic topic.

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:21.630
And the debate around trade
in the political circle

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:24.490
has always been bipolar.

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:28.070
On the one hand, you have
folks on the left saying,

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:33.340
trade is good if we export more
than we import, because we win.

00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:36.510
And otherwise it's bad, if we
import more than we export,

00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:37.430
we lose.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:42.640
And then on the other side,
promoters say, trade is good.

00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.700
Everyone benefits.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:44.910
It's a win-win.

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:47.080
Neither of those
views is accurate.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.130
Economists have
always understood

00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:52.520
that trade promotes economic
growth, whether you have trade

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.160
deficits or trade surpluses.

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.100
But it's also redistributive.

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.940
In general, it
diffuses beneficiaries

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:02.610
by lowering the prices
of goods and services.

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:04.520
And it creates
concentrated losses

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:08.440
among workers in
import-competing sectors.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:11.350
Historically, we've known that,
but we haven't seen it so much.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:14.775
In the last 20 years, we've
really seen China's rise

00:48:14.775 --> 00:48:18.220
as an extremely
productive, competitive,

00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.970
international
manufacturing superpower

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.620
has been very good
for China, very good

00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:26.160
for most of the world.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.280
And good for the
US in many ways.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:31.630
But it's also been
extremely disruptive

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:35.750
for import-competing sectors--
for manufacturers of shoes,

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:38.280
and textiles, and
leather goods, and toys,

00:48:38.280 --> 00:48:41.040
and electronic assembly--
literally resulting

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:44.440
in the reduction of on the
order of about a million US

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:49.050
manufacturing jobs during the
decade starting around 2001.

00:48:49.050 --> 00:48:50.240
And we can see that.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:51.960
You can look at
places where furniture

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:56.289
was made, where shoes were
made, where assembly was done.

00:48:56.289 --> 00:48:57.830
And you can see
those jobs-- not only

00:48:57.830 --> 00:49:00.580
do you see employment
decline, but you

00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:03.470
see broader economic malaise.

00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:06.290
You don't see workers
costlessly reallocating

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:07.680
into new activities.

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.280
And this has been
economically painful and also

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.760
politically consequential.

00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:14.980
And, in fact, you can see
that in the areas we're

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.350
most impacted by
this trade exposure,

00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:21.350
we see growth of
polarized politics.

00:49:21.350 --> 00:49:28.470
In the more white,
non-Hispanic Republican areas,

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:31.130
it's led to the rise
of the Tea Party.

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:36.160
In actually left leaning and
minority intensive locations,

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:40.115
it's led to more and more
strong left wing politicians.

00:49:40.115 --> 00:49:41.490
I'm sorry, I'm
going on too long.

00:49:41.490 --> 00:49:43.600
Let me just conclude.

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.800
There actually is
an economic origin

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:49.670
for this debate is bubbling
up in the current presidential

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:50.560
election.

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:53.050
But I actually think it's
healthy in the following sense.

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.250
There's now greater
understanding and recognition

00:49:55.250 --> 00:50:00.310
on both sides file that
trade has benefits and costs.

00:50:00.310 --> 00:50:01.440
It's not a win-win.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.550
We've always known
that, as economists.

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:05.970
Now we can recognize
that as politicians,

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:08.790
and hopefully we can
have trade policy

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:12.880
that both recognizes the
benefits of globalization,

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.450
and spreads those benefits, and
compensates the individuals who

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:19.360
bear the brunt of it.

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.760
-I just want to add
to David's points.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.930
A very simple point, which is
that he talked about trades

00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:31.660
and goods, and
immigration is also-- we

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.320
could say the same
things that David

00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:35.880
said in talking about
immigration as well.

00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:42.470
-So, I didn't fully
hear what we should

00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:45.170
do about it, because in
every trade agreement,

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:49.260
there is an attempt to
compensate the losers.

00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:51.110
Because everybody
worries, sure, we

00:50:51.110 --> 00:50:53.270
know the losers are those
who lose their jobs,

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:55.800
but it can't be that all job
losses related to the trade

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.530
agreement.

00:50:56.530 --> 00:50:59.580
So we tend to write the
eligibility rules very tightly,

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.620
so that a small fraction of
people who might ultimately

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.439
have been affected-- So
I'm going to push back

00:51:05.439 --> 00:51:06.480
with you a little, David.

00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:12.190
And ask you, really, how should
we see this polarization?

00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:14.840
It is a challenge for whoever is
going to be in the White House

00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:15.430
next.

00:51:15.430 --> 00:51:17.510
What really should they
be doing differently?

00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:18.580
-Trade is not a bogeyman.

00:51:18.580 --> 00:51:20.600
There are lots of economic
forces that are disruptive.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.520
Immigration is one,
technological changes.

00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.610
If I'm replaced by machine, as
opposed to a foreign worker,

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:27.180
I'm out of a job.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.780
So I actually don't
think we should

00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:32.360
try to make trade adjustment
narrowly tailored.

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.730
You shouldn't have to prove
in a world without trade you

00:51:34.730 --> 00:51:36.725
wouldn't have lost your job,
in a world of technology you

00:51:36.725 --> 00:51:37.307
would've.

00:51:37.307 --> 00:51:38.390
We should have adjustment.

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:42.900
We should facilitate people
whose skills become obsolete,

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.750
or whose industries closed down,
to make investments in skills,

00:51:46.750 --> 00:51:49.780
or to help them ensure
their earnings losses,

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:52.660
at least temporarily, as
they move across sectors.

00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.417
You don't need trade
adjustment for that.

00:51:54.417 --> 00:51:56.250
We could actually make
the Earned Income Tax

00:51:56.250 --> 00:51:59.460
Credit an Earner's Credit, that
wasn't dependent upon having

00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.840
young dependent
children to access that,

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:05.590
and get higher earnings in not
particularly high wage jobs.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.650
So I think there's a
broader answer to that,

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:09.630
that's not trade specific.

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:11.040
-OK, fair enough.

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:12.890
-Well, yes, I just
want to add to that.

00:52:12.890 --> 00:52:14.660
So I think that that's
one of the things

00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:18.260
that we're finding, is that
we've had a policy that

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:19.710
worries more about incentives.

00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:22.210
And we don't want to put bad
incentives in, the people won't

00:52:22.210 --> 00:52:23.020
work, or whatever.

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.565
And so, we don't do things
that would help people.

00:52:25.565 --> 00:52:26.940
And I think what
we're realizing,

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:28.720
it does have social
consequences.

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:31.170
It has consequences for
the children, the families.

00:52:31.170 --> 00:52:33.420
And that maybe just in terms
of the weights that we're

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.700
putting on-- of things
that we typically

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.550
think of pro growth as
low taxes and trade--

00:52:38.550 --> 00:52:41.050
that there are costs, that maybe
we're starting to recognize

00:52:41.050 --> 00:52:43.700
are bigger than we thought.

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.384
-I agree with everything
that other people have said.

00:52:47.384 --> 00:52:48.800
I'll just add that
I think we tend

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:50.633
to talk in this country
about the importance

00:52:50.633 --> 00:52:52.300
of overall economic growth.

00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:55.070
And for many people, they
leave the distributional issues

00:52:55.070 --> 00:52:56.110
aside.

00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:58.090
They're somewhat
uncomfortable to talk about,

00:52:58.090 --> 00:53:02.160
they can have a feel of setting
people against each other.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.930
But that logic, that
focus on overall growth,

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:08.400
worked best during a period
when the rising tide really

00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.930
did lift all boats.

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:12.520
And if the rising tide is
not going to lift all boats--

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:16.700
and it has not lifted all boats
over the past several decades--

00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:18.820
then we just need
to be more explicit

00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:22.400
about our distributional
concerns, if we have them.

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.070
And my view is, those
concerns are crucially

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:35.060
important for sustaining
the social cohesion

00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.820
that the country depends on.

00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:39.700
And that's important for
setting future economic policy,

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.980
it's important for the country's
leadership in the world,

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.780
it's important for
the way we tackle

00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.260
social issues in this country.

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.910
The sense of people that
they're not together,

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:52.830
but they are apart, is a
very big problem for us,

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:56.750
and not what I think many of us
think of as the American way.

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:58.910
But to change that,
we really have

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:02.940
to do significant
things to help people

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:05.450
who are being left behind,
whether because of trade

00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:07.710
or because of technological
change or something else.

00:54:14.540 --> 00:54:18.780
-So, many of you have argued
for increased assessments

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.800
in infrastructure.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.520
I heard infrastructure,
R&amp;D, education.

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:29.100
And how do we ensure that those
investments are effective?

00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.624
We all worry about investments
in the bridge to nowhere.

00:54:31.624 --> 00:54:33.540
I think there might have
been a New York Times

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:36.920
article about an infrastructure
investment that was

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:37.860
[INAUDIBLE].

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:42.560
So if we're going to be
increasing these investments,

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.870
how do we ensure that they're
going to the right people,

00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:48.186
places, things?

00:54:48.186 --> 00:54:49.122
-Want me to take that?

00:54:49.122 --> 00:54:52.090
-Please.

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:54.100
-So, that's obviously
very difficult.

00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:57.400
I think we have had a move
towards evidence-based policy,

00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:00.180
where people are trying to
actually think quite carefully

00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.430
about what investments
do make sense,

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:04.690
what investments
don't make sense.

00:55:04.690 --> 00:55:06.690
People say, oh, we should
have high speed rail,

00:55:06.690 --> 00:55:08.110
but maybe that doesn't
necessarily make sense

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:09.026
for the United States.

00:55:09.026 --> 00:55:12.260
And so, you don't want
to just do investments

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:13.760
without thinking
carefully about it.

00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.560
Now, the political
process gets in the way.

00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.760
And that's where the bridge
to nowhere problem comes.

00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.120
Because if you're going
to spend it in one place,

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:21.217
and it makes sense, well,
everybody needs theirs.

00:55:21.217 --> 00:55:23.300
And so then you end up
spending in lots of places,

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:25.310
and so that's an issue.

00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:28.050
But if you think about Doug's
point about rates of return,

00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:31.080
and interest rates
now, we can afford

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:36.377
to make investments that
have less than ideal returns.

00:55:36.377 --> 00:55:37.710
They're not going to be perfect.

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:39.840
It's going to have to go
through that political process,

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:41.506
and you're going to
end up having things

00:55:41.506 --> 00:55:42.915
that you don't want.

00:55:42.915 --> 00:55:44.290
On the other hand,
interest rates

00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:47.060
are very low, so we don't need
to have huge rates of return

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:48.090
to make it matter.

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:50.190
And to the extent that
these investments now

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:52.576
have greater social return
than we thought before.

00:55:52.576 --> 00:55:54.700
We think these problems
are bigger than we thought,

00:55:54.700 --> 00:55:57.980
we realize that social cohesion
is really, really important.

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:01.109
Then, you're willing
to put the money,

00:56:01.109 --> 00:56:02.900
because we think it
has higher returns when

00:56:02.900 --> 00:56:04.630
it does hit the right places.

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:06.630
And so, some of it may
not hit the right places.

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:09.680
But still, it's the direction
that we want to go in.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.982
And I say, I think we've
had a bias towards thinking

00:56:11.982 --> 00:56:13.440
that we always want
to lower taxes,

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.600
and taxes clearly
raise economic growth,

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:18.219
but the evidence on that
is pretty murky as well.

00:56:18.219 --> 00:56:20.510
And so, I think that if we
think this is a big problem,

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:23.190
we want to try to be smart about
how we make the investments.

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:24.606
But still realize
that we're going

00:56:24.606 --> 00:56:26.415
to have to keep
trying stuff until we

00:56:26.415 --> 00:56:28.540
get to what works, because
we can't just say, well,

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:30.915
nothing works, so we're just
going to ignore the problem.

00:56:33.390 --> 00:56:37.830
-Can I just add that as the
Dean of a School of Government,

00:56:37.830 --> 00:56:40.160
and a long time
public servant, I

00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:44.160
think we need to find ways
to make public service more

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:47.110
attractive, more appealing
to more of the best

00:56:47.110 --> 00:56:48.388
and brightest young people.

00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:56.050
I've worked-- as
Louise has, and Ceci

00:56:56.050 --> 00:56:58.900
has, and others-- with
some terrifically smart,

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:02.370
talented, dedicated people
in the federal government.

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:05.930
But it worries me when I see
the survey of Harvard College

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:09.030
graduates, and 50-some
percent are going in

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:10.340
to finance related things.

00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.960
I've nothing against
that, but 3%, I think,

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:17.740
were going into public service,
and that worries me a lot.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:20.823
-We need more public
service recruiters here.

00:57:20.823 --> 00:57:22.440
I think that's part of it.

00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:27.440
But let me add to this
important conversation

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:31.460
that at least in
higher education,

00:57:31.460 --> 00:57:34.930
it's not so much
increasing the amount,

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:41.210
but doing something to stem the
fact that our public colleges

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:45.110
and universitiess-- community
colleges, in particular--

00:57:45.110 --> 00:57:47.000
have lost so much.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:50.230
So it's not as if we're
adding and building

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:52.750
bridges to nowhere.

00:57:52.750 --> 00:57:55.452
Really important bridges
have been taken down.

00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:03.500
-So I've already got
a set of questions.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.840
So, I think, why don't we
move to some questions.

00:58:06.840 --> 00:58:11.130
So apparently a few
of you have asked,

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:13.940
how does gender
and working women

00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:17.850
affect the income distribution?

00:58:17.850 --> 00:58:19.834
Claudia, I think that
would be for you.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.940
-A pretty complicated question.

00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:30.800
Women are the most
interesting, quote, "minority",

00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:34.000
because we are everywhere.

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:44.380
We are not segregated
by housing, for example.

00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:50.190
So one way that this affects
the income distribution

00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:54.940
is that we've had greater, what
we call positive assortative

00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.970
mating over time.

00:58:56.970 --> 00:59:02.257
Which is a wonderful term
for Harvard graduates,

00:59:02.257 --> 00:59:03.340
married Harvard graduates.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:08.240
That's fun.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:16.020
So what makes that important,
in terms of the income

00:59:16.020 --> 00:59:20.180
distribution, is that it adds
a little bit of a multiplier.

00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:25.640
That we've seen increases,
tremendous increases,

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:28.930
to the returns to college.

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:33.520
And if you have even more
positive assortative mating,

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:38.360
it means that it in fact,
even to some degree,

00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:42.100
widens these gaps, so
we're thinking about it

00:59:42.100 --> 00:59:43.580
in the aggregate.

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.750
That's one way of
thinking about it.

00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:49.110
On the other hand, if
we think about women

00:59:49.110 --> 00:59:52.410
as a separate group, which
I said at the beginning

00:59:52.410 --> 00:59:59.330
is sort of impossible to do, we
have a set of important issues

00:59:59.330 --> 01:00:03.570
that relate to the ones
that have been raised about,

01:00:03.570 --> 01:00:06.210
don't forget the children.

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.130
OK?

01:00:07.130 --> 01:00:09.330
The children are very important.

01:00:09.330 --> 01:00:15.910
And so, having a work
environment which

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:20.710
is highly inflexible
means that women either

01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:25.790
forgo their careers to
give to their children,

01:00:25.790 --> 01:00:30.740
or their children
are left often alone.

01:00:30.740 --> 01:00:36.060
Being let out of school at
2:30, let out of school in June.

01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:40.320
We've inherited institutions
from a very distant past.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.760
So I see two issues here.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.840
One concerning aggregate
income inequalities,

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:49.610
and the other one
wrapped up in issues

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:54.756
concerning the family, and
women's special role in that.

01:00:54.756 --> 01:00:56.160
-Thank you.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.730
David?

01:00:57.730 --> 01:01:01.170
Louise, I want to ping
one to you, because I

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:02.300
think this is important.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.290
How do we approach
disparities in health care

01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:08.930
in the setting of
continued rise in costs?

01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:11.510
-So, that is
clearly a big issue.

01:01:11.510 --> 01:01:16.010
We have, of course, just
passed the Affordable Care Act

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:19.800
a few years ago, which is
going to make major differences

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:20.960
in access to care.

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:21.715
It already is.

01:01:21.715 --> 01:01:23.840
And costs are something
that the federal government

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.200
has to think carefully about.

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:27.550
It's actually not such
an easy question as well.

01:01:27.550 --> 01:01:30.480
I mean, one of the things as
we do get richer as a society,

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.410
we tend to value health care
a lot more than we used to.

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:37.999
And so, although it's a huge
budget buster when health care

01:01:37.999 --> 01:01:39.540
spending keeps going
up, and it makes

01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.000
it hard to do the kind of
redistribution that we'd like,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.700
there's a trade off,
which is something

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:46.750
that people really like.

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:49.149
It used to be, actually,
maybe 10 or 15 years ago, you

01:01:49.149 --> 01:01:51.440
would go to a health care
conference on House spending.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.380
And they'd say, how
many of you would rather

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:56.539
have 1980s health
care at 1980s prices?

01:01:56.539 --> 01:01:58.330
And a lot of people
would raise their hand.

01:01:58.330 --> 01:02:00.510
And I think that
that's no longer true.

01:02:00.510 --> 01:02:03.750
People will say they
recognize that although it's

01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:06.940
too expensive, they really
want today's health care.

01:02:06.940 --> 01:02:10.640
And so then the question for
policy is whether or not when

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.390
we can keep doing that
or want to do that.

01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:14.181
At some point, we're
going to want to spend

01:02:14.181 --> 01:02:15.460
our money on something else.

01:02:15.460 --> 01:02:18.902
Or whether or not-- we don't
need to necessarily slow

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.360
technology, but there's just
tremendous waste in the health

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.210
care system.

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:23.890
So the Affordable
Care Act actually

01:02:23.890 --> 01:02:29.260
had a lot of very innovative
new payment models, that

01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.830
hopefully will at least slow
the growth rate of health

01:02:31.830 --> 01:02:32.870
over time.

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:36.256
But trying to make
it more efficient.

01:02:36.256 --> 01:02:38.130
We don't know exactly
what's going to happen.

01:02:38.130 --> 01:02:41.340
Health care spending has
slowed tremendously, actually,

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.880
in the past few years.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.670
At least six years now.

01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:48.790
And how much of that is
this temporary pause,

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:50.300
versus how much of
that is something

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:54.590
that's still a relic
of the great recession

01:02:54.590 --> 01:02:55.960
is still unclear.

01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:00.490
But the more we spend on
health care, the more important

01:03:00.490 --> 01:03:03.140
it is that we spend our dollars
wisely and don't waste it.

01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:04.723
And so, I think that
will be something

01:03:04.723 --> 01:03:06.520
that public policy
continues to work at.

01:03:10.350 --> 01:03:12.860
-I'm going to combine
two questions.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:18.850
So for labor comps we think of
these as institutional factors

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:21.170
that affect inequality,
which is, what are

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:24.560
the impact of the minimum
wage and unions on the income

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.330
distribution?

01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:28.170
Would anybody like
to talk about that?

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:29.510
-Sure, I'll take that on.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.160
Both unions and the
minimum wage have

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.100
been two of our most
important labor market

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.400
institutions for moderating
inequality and affecting

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:41.510
distribution.

01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:44.290
Both of them have
been in decline.

01:03:44.290 --> 01:03:46.820
Labor unions, at
this point about 7%

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:50.210
of the private sector
workforce belongs to a union.

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:55.220
And that's down from more than
30% on the eve of World War II.

01:03:55.220 --> 01:03:58.470
The minimum wage is also at a
considerably lower real level

01:03:58.470 --> 01:04:00.070
than it has been
in quite some time.

01:04:00.070 --> 01:04:02.410
It's risen recently, but
if we compare to the level,

01:04:02.410 --> 01:04:04.610
for example, it
was in 1977, and we

01:04:04.610 --> 01:04:07.580
index that to inflation, it
would be about $20 an hour

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.220
right now.

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:14.670
I think that we need to
seek new labor market

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:17.210
institutions, actually,
that can address the roles

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:18.660
and formally been played.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:22.820
I do not foresee a
growth of private sector

01:04:22.820 --> 01:04:29.320
unionization that will
reverse that trend enormously.

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.830
But that that's not
intrinsically a bad thing,

01:04:31.830 --> 01:04:34.740
because labor unions had
positives and negatives.

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:36.010
They were exclusive.

01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:40.790
In some cases, they were not
benefiting minority workers,

01:04:40.790 --> 01:04:41.820
not benefiting women.

01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.570
And you had to belong
to a certain company

01:04:43.570 --> 01:04:45.380
in a certain sector.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:46.770
I would like to
see-- and I think

01:04:46.770 --> 01:04:49.550
we're actually moving this
direction-- of a broader

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:52.965
set of institutions that
affect the quality of work.

01:04:52.965 --> 01:04:54.840
They affect the quality
of economic security.

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.465
Whether that's through
providing health

01:04:56.465 --> 01:04:58.435
care, not just
through employment,

01:04:58.435 --> 01:05:02.350
but through a public provision.

01:05:02.350 --> 01:05:03.400
Having labor standards.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.262
For example, the
change in the overtime

01:05:05.262 --> 01:05:06.720
rules that the
Obama administration

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.510
has just enacted,
making provision

01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:17.960
for maternal and paternal leave
for some degree of ability

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.870
to leave work for health
and family reasons.

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:24.160
So I think there's a way we can
make these institutions more

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.600
broadly accessible, and share
their benefits more broadly.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.790
On the minimum wage
specifically, I

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:35.250
think most economists
are divided.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:37.440
Some would say minimum
wage is just fine,

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:40.780
others would say it's
quite destructive of work.

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:42.630
I think all would
agree that it's not

01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:45.300
our favorite way of
raising earnings.

01:05:45.300 --> 01:05:47.640
It's not the best tool we have.

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.270
Better tools include the
Earned Income Tax Credit,

01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:54.120
that actually incentivizes work
without it costing employers.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.580
And other things that raise
productivity, or even affect

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:57.930
the quality of jobs.

01:05:57.930 --> 01:05:59.720
For example, not
allowing employers

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.270
to schedule people for work
two hours before their shift

01:06:02.270 --> 01:06:03.130
begins.

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:05.767
The minimum wage,
in moderation it

01:06:05.767 --> 01:06:07.600
does not appear to have
particularly adverse

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.470
consequences, and clearly
has some benefits as well,

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:13.170
in the range that we've
seen in the last 30 years.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:16.100
If we start raising to $22
an hour, and did so suddenly,

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.580
I think we would see some of
the downside cost as well.

01:06:18.580 --> 01:06:21.530
So it's one of the
arrows in our quiver,

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:25.886
but probably not the best arrow.

01:06:25.886 --> 01:06:28.001
-Would anybody else
like to comment?

01:06:28.001 --> 01:06:28.983
No?

01:06:28.983 --> 01:06:30.460
OK.

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:33.790
So I think many of
you have advocated

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:38.200
for addressing both
increasing growth

01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:40.880
and inequality with--
let's just put it out

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:42.340
there-- more spending.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:45.000
So are you at all concerned
about the budget deficit

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:45.880
long term?

01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.330
If not, why not?

01:06:47.330 --> 01:06:49.230
If so, how would you
reduce the deficit

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:52.741
without further widening the
gap and income inequality?

01:06:52.741 --> 01:06:54.660
-Maybe I should
start with that one.

01:06:54.660 --> 01:06:55.820
-Yes, go ahead, Doug.

01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.170
-So, I do worry about the
federal budget deficit

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:01.130
and debt in the long term.

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:04.100
I worry about it quite a bit.

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.090
Federal budget is on
an unsustainable path,

01:07:07.090 --> 01:07:12.150
because spending
will outpace revenues

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:16.120
by increasing amounts over
time, pushing up federal debt

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.310
relative to the
size our economy,

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:21.210
and that is not
sustainable indefinitely.

01:07:21.210 --> 01:07:23.590
So something must be done.

01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:27.000
The question is what
and how quickly?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:32.290
And my own view about
what we should do

01:07:32.290 --> 01:07:36.220
is informed by the
perspective I offered earlier.

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.060
I think that, given the
patterns of income growth

01:07:39.060 --> 01:07:41.460
in this country over the
past several decades,

01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:44.650
that the primary goal of
our economic policy today

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:49.010
should be to raise incomes for
lower and middle income people.

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:50.780
And if you take
that perspective,

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.120
and take it seriously, than
that guides you to doing and not

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.520
doing certain things
in pursuit of more

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.040
sustainable fiscal policy.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.870
So from my perspective,
given that objective,

01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:04.730
I would not cut
benefits or raise taxes

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:06.420
on people of modest means.

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:09.930
I would at least
focus the changes

01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:14.510
on people who have done better
over the past several decades.

01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:18.729
So I would cut benefits
and Social Security,

01:08:18.729 --> 01:08:22.279
and I would raise income-related
premiums in Medicare,

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:26.600
but I would focus those changes
on the upper part of the income

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.609
distribution.

01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:37.370
And to be clear about
upper-- before you applaud--

01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:38.620
I don't mean just Bill Gates.

01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.120
Right?

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.842
So there's a tendency in
discussions of this to say,

01:08:41.842 --> 01:08:43.050
there's always somebody else.

01:08:43.050 --> 01:08:46.724
So I would say the top
third, or maybe even

01:08:46.724 --> 01:08:48.390
the top half of the
income distribution.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:49.473
I would make some changes.

01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:54.310
Slightly less applause,
but that's OK.

01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:00.460
And on the tax side, I
think there's no doubt

01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:02.250
that the federal
government will end up

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:07.310
collecting significantly
more in tax revenue 10,

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.229
20 years from now, than is
scheduled under current law.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:12.229
Because I think, in
fact, when you get down

01:09:12.229 --> 01:09:14.979
to specific elements
of federal spending

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:17.450
that are of any consequence
relative to the size

01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:19.710
of the federal budget, or
the size of the economy,

01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:21.540
most people like
most parts of them.

01:09:21.540 --> 01:09:24.529
Even if in the abstract, they're
against high federal spending

01:09:24.529 --> 01:09:25.460
and would like less.

01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:26.960
So I think revenue
will go up, and I

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.109
think the trick there
is to tax things

01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:32.779
that we're less worried
about discouraging.

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:34.490
The problem with
higher tax rates

01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:37.689
is it can discourage work,
it can discourage saving.

01:09:37.689 --> 01:09:39.939
One thing we'd like to
discourage is carbon emissions,

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:42.010
so we should put
a price on carbon

01:09:42.010 --> 01:09:47.389
through a carbon tax, or
a cap and trade system.

01:09:47.389 --> 01:09:48.430
I never get this, really.

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:51.430
This is interesting.

01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:56.030
Usually, the budget guy
gets nothing but boos.

01:09:56.030 --> 01:10:00.640
And also, in the individual
and business tax codes,

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.240
I would personally sweep
out a significant portion

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.270
of the deductions and
credits and so on.

01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:08.540
And I would not take all
the extra revenue gained

01:10:08.540 --> 01:10:10.940
and plow it back
into rate reductions.

01:10:10.940 --> 01:10:15.160
I would keep it to increase
overall federal revenues.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:18.240
So I think it is
possible to make changes

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.540
to put the federal budget
on a sustainable trajectory,

01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:27.050
without undermining the goal
of inclusive economic growth.

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:28.590
Last thing I'll say
about timing is,

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:31.480
I think the fact that interest
rates-- the treasury borrowing

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:34.680
rates-- are extraordinarily low
now by historical standards,

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.390
and are very widely
expected to stay low

01:10:37.390 --> 01:10:42.540
for a considerable period of
time, makes this less urgent.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:45.700
But it is important
to start the policies

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:47.600
that we would like
to change soon,

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.340
because almost undoubtedly,
we would like those policies

01:10:50.340 --> 01:10:52.390
to phase in very slowly.

01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:55.249
So it's not crucial to make
next year's deficit smaller,

01:10:55.249 --> 01:10:57.415
or the following year's
deficit smaller, or the year

01:10:57.415 --> 01:10:58.970
after that's deficit smaller.

01:10:58.970 --> 01:11:01.380
But it is important to be
having policies will have

01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.680
real effect 10 years from now.

01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.630
And many of those
are policies that we

01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:08.880
should be legislating and
building in adjustment

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:09.540
paths for now.

01:11:15.663 --> 01:11:18.660
-Does anybody else
want to comment?

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.677
Doug?

01:11:19.677 --> 01:11:21.010
-Three cheers for tax increases.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.486
-Three cheers for tax increases.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.477
So I'm going to
combine two questions.

01:11:27.477 --> 01:11:29.310
They may be related,
maybe not, but I'm just

01:11:29.310 --> 01:11:30.434
going to put them together.

01:11:30.434 --> 01:11:33.030
So one is that it seems
technological gains will

01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:34.280
decrease the need for workers.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:37.850
If that results in fewer jobs
than potential employees,

01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:41.050
how can we, as a society, deal
with large numbers of people

01:11:41.050 --> 01:11:43.200
who do not need to be employed?

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.950
And how would we put
that into a new economy,

01:11:45.950 --> 01:11:48.480
thinking about the gig economy
and other forms of employment

01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:49.063
relationships?

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:54.460
David.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.450
-Let me start with
the gig economy.

01:12:00.450 --> 01:12:03.210
The gig economy, I think,
actually exemplifies, at least

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:05.360
in my thinking, the
point I was making

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:08.910
earlier about commodification
versus amplification.

01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:10.720
And you see both going on.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:17.400
So let's say you're the software
equivalent of a movie star,

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.020
then the gig economy is
a great thing for you,

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:22.690
because rather than
being insulated inside

01:12:22.690 --> 01:12:24.820
of one firm, where you
get a pretty good salary,

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.774
you can sell you your
services to market.

01:12:26.774 --> 01:12:27.690
To the highest bidder.

01:12:27.690 --> 01:12:30.840
And the gig economy makes
that easy, easy for people

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.280
to discover your talent,
to contract with you.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:37.550
And so, it amplifies.

01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:40.010
Your talents are now going
to be more richly rewarded.

01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:42.470
At the same time, if
you're a vehicle driver,

01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:44.300
or you're a plumber, or you're
a person who goes to the grocery

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.110
store to buy groceries
for other people,

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:49.450
you are now a commodity
laborer on tap.

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:51.970
And so, for some
individuals, that

01:12:51.970 --> 01:12:54.200
could actually be
less attractive,

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.820
although not an option.

01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:58.180
So, for example, I was
recently at a conference,

01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:00.690
and I heard people in
the trades complaining

01:13:00.690 --> 01:13:03.190
that rather than them having
their own differentiated firms,

01:13:03.190 --> 01:13:06.560
they were now basically a
service provided by Amazon.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.120
You tell Amazon what you
want, Amazon calls them up,

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:09.860
sends them out.

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:11.510
You never deal with them again.

01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:13.250
They weren't happy
about that model.

01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:15.050
So that's the
commodification side.

01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:20.300
And I think we need to recognize
that there are both costs

01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:20.880
and benefits.

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.574
On the one side,
there's flexibility.

01:13:22.574 --> 01:13:24.490
And if you're a worker,
you're an Uber driver,

01:13:24.490 --> 01:13:26.670
you could turn on your
Uber app when you want to,

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:28.586
and turn it off when you
don't want to use it.

01:13:28.586 --> 01:13:29.670
And that's great.

01:13:29.670 --> 01:13:31.350
On the other hand,
people also have

01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:33.410
a need for economic security.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.880
And flexibility, when I
get to choose, is great.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.840
Flexibility meaning I work
when the market wants me to,

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.070
and I don't work if the
market doesn't want me to,

01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:43.820
that's not the kind of
flexibility I'm looking for.

01:13:43.820 --> 01:13:47.140
So I think this ties
into this point about,

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:50.230
what are the labor
market institutions that

01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:53.717
create economic security, even
when there's rapid change?

01:13:53.717 --> 01:13:55.550
And they are things
having to do with health

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:57.540
care, good education,
and things that

01:13:57.540 --> 01:14:01.920
provide a basic wraparound
set of social services

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:06.940
that allow people to prosper
even in challenging times.

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.980
Talking more broadly--
and briefly-- about

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:11.980
where will the jobs come
from, we don't know.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.830
But we have been worried
about the effect of automation

01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:18.350
on employment for more
than two centuries.

01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:22.580
This did not start with Amazon.

01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:28.510
And any general, we've been
impressed by our ability

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:30.370
to think of new things to do.

01:14:30.370 --> 01:14:33.010
So in the beginning
of the 20th century,

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:36.710
about 38 percent of US workers
were employed on farms.

01:14:36.710 --> 01:14:39.560
If an economist from
the 21st century

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.130
had showed up on the farm and
said, hey, guess what you guys?

01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:44.600
In 100 years, there will
only be 2% of you working

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.680
in agriculture .

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:48.890
So what do you think
the other 36% will do?

01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:51.980
They probably wouldn't
have said, oh, software,

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:54.570
personal services, apps.

01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:56.750
It's all going to be apps.

01:14:56.750 --> 01:15:02.370
And yet, we underestimate our
own creativity and ingenuity,

01:15:02.370 --> 01:15:06.040
and also our ability
to consume new stuff.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.940
People, as we get wealthier, our
demand for consumption rises.

01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:13.350
If people in 2016 want to
have the standard of living

01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:16.290
of people in 1916,
they could do so

01:15:16.290 --> 01:15:19.150
by working about 17
hours a week on average.

01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:20.644
But most people don't choose to.

01:15:20.644 --> 01:15:22.310
They would rather
continue to work hard,

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.260
and then play hard, so to speak.

01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:27.470
So technological change
will be disruptive,

01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:29.400
but remember it's
disruption that comes

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.440
from productivity improvements.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.090
That's a good problem to have.

01:15:33.090 --> 01:15:35.660
Most economic problems
are problems of scarcity,

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:36.840
not problems of abundance.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.400
So if we really are
getting that much more

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.100
productive through
technological change,

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.760
it will create challenges, but
also gives us additional wealth

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.570
to deal with those challenges.

01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:49.510
-Let me add that we have,
in the period that David

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:53.320
was talking about,
worked far fewer hours

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.730
per day and per week.

01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:59.410
So we've taken our gains
on several margins,

01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:01.040
several dimensions.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:07.390
So we have more goods, more
services, longer lifetimes,

01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:10.550
better quality years,
and we also work.

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:18.000
We do work fewer hours per week
then 100 years ago or whatever.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:23.080
I'm reminded as well that
there's a large literature.

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.710
There was a play called
R.U,R. in the 1920s,

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:31.650
so we have lived in fear that
the robots are going to take us

01:16:31.650 --> 01:16:35.140
over, that the androids are
going to be doing everything,

01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:38.670
that you won't know when you
get married whether you married

01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:41.140
to an Android or not.

01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:48.050
But this hasn't happened--

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.890
-That I know of.

01:16:55.900 --> 01:16:58.290
-As David has said,
these have been

01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:03.970
concerns for a very long time.

01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:06.540
-There have been lots of
questions about immigration,

01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:10.560
and how to think about
the impact of immigration

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.925
on both economic growth
and on income inequality.

01:17:13.925 --> 01:17:16.050
And how should we think
about that relative to full

01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:16.550
employment?

01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:19.570
If

01:17:19.570 --> 01:17:20.340
-David?

01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:21.240
-Anybody?

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:21.740
Anybody?

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:31.070
What you said before
about to trade,

01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:32.422
but just put in immigration.

01:17:32.422 --> 01:17:34.680
It's the same.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:38.670
-Immigration is an area where
actually the theory is not

01:17:38.670 --> 01:17:39.990
that dissimilar from trade.

01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:42.550
We understand it should have
distributional consequences.

01:17:42.550 --> 01:17:46.070
It creates growth, and
it expands the size

01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:47.547
of the economy in general.

01:17:47.547 --> 01:17:48.630
It should be a good thing.

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:50.720
It reduces scarcity.

01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:53.470
The evidence is actually
much less conclusive

01:17:53.470 --> 01:17:55.620
than you would expect.

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:59.530
There is realy-- despite
strong popular sentiment,

01:17:59.530 --> 01:18:02.270
and really even firsthand
observation-- economists

01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:06.280
have not found strong evidence
that even rapid expansions

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.310
of low education
immigration has greatly

01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:11.590
depressed wages or employment
of low educated Americans.

01:18:11.590 --> 01:18:15.660
And that's very surprising,
because it would

01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:17.520
be plausible for that to occur.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:21.594
The standard
rationalization of that

01:18:21.594 --> 01:18:23.510
is they complement each
other, they don't just

01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:24.426
substitute each other.

01:18:24.426 --> 01:18:26.584
Typically, immigrants do
slightly different jobs

01:18:26.584 --> 01:18:28.000
from natives, and
you actually see

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:30.125
natives moving across the
occupational distribution

01:18:30.125 --> 01:18:31.160
as that occurs.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:33.660
But you can understand
why it's contentious,

01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.940
because you are introducing
competing groups, especially

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:38.440
in the low skill
labor market, where

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:40.240
labor is much more commodified.

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:44.450
I'm in the high skill labor
market, I think many of us

01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:47.249
would feel very strongly
that we should be increasing

01:18:47.249 --> 01:18:48.290
high skilled immigration.

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:51.190
That one of the US's
greatest strengths

01:18:51.190 --> 01:18:54.350
is that we attract talented
people from all over the world.

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:56.790
They come here to be at
places just like this,

01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:58.190
and they tend to stick around.

01:18:58.190 --> 01:19:01.330
And they produce great ideas,
they enrich our culture,

01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:05.150
and they have been central
to our growth and prosperity.

01:19:05.150 --> 01:19:09.690
And really the fountainhead
of so much of greatness

01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:10.660
has occurred here.

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:16.300
I was hoping I'd
get one of those.

01:19:19.109 --> 01:19:20.650
You can make the
counter, even, well,

01:19:20.650 --> 01:19:22.430
don't they compete with
high skilled workers America

01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:23.200
as well?

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.930
Yes, but high skilled workers
in America are doing great.

01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:28.650
So we can stand the
competition, I think.

01:19:28.650 --> 01:19:31.400
So thank you.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:34.620
-Let me just say one
other point, which

01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:38.740
is that in an economy
with an aging population.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:42.770
And fertility levels that
are not that-- our fertility

01:19:42.770 --> 01:19:46.220
levels are pretty high
by world standards,

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:47.990
for our income
level, but they're

01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:53.920
not that high-- in such
a population, immigration

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.490
is a godsend.

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:57.900
We're getting all
these individuals,

01:19:57.900 --> 01:20:01.670
they've already gone through
those difficult early years.

01:20:01.670 --> 01:20:04.660
It's sort of like
if you gave birth

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:12.890
to a well educated 24-year-old
who could take care of you

01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:18.935
when you're older, and
was healthy and likable.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:28.260
So, in fact, the country that
is in the worst shape because

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:30.500
of all these issues is Japan.

01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:36.060
So, Japan is doing now
a lot of things wrong.

01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:38.570
Well, they have
very low fertility,

01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:41.660
they don't have immigration,
their economy is tanking.

01:20:41.660 --> 01:20:44.870
And, well, they have people
who are living forever.

01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:47.030
Maybe that's good.

01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:49.110
But for an economy
like that, immigration

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:52.570
would actually be real godsend.

01:20:52.570 --> 01:20:56.750
-So I'm cognizant of the time,
and I do have one last question

01:20:56.750 --> 01:20:59.850
that I would like each of
the panelists to respond to.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.830
So, if there were a third
party-- the Prosperity

01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:10.680
and Equality Party--
what would or should

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.060
its political platform be?

01:21:19.410 --> 01:21:20.260
-I'll go last.

01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:25.510
Just, everyone choose one plank.

01:21:29.810 --> 01:21:32.050
-Well, so the plank
that I would pick

01:21:32.050 --> 01:21:36.350
would be government
investment in things, and more

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:39.270
importantly, in people.

01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:40.719
-You have to be more specific.

01:21:40.719 --> 01:21:42.260
I'm sorry, you're
going to have to be

01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:46.700
more specific for our
political platform here.

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:50.450
-You want me to pick something--
you want a skinnier plank.

01:21:50.450 --> 01:21:51.370
Too broad a plank.

01:21:55.710 --> 01:22:03.990
I think that we should increase
our investment in young people,

01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:08.910
particularly lower and
middle income young people,

01:22:08.910 --> 01:22:13.880
by using resources from people
who are higher in the income

01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:16.020
distribution, and
have done especially

01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:18.244
well in the past few decades.

01:22:18.244 --> 01:22:21.046
-OK.

01:22:21.046 --> 01:22:22.450
Claudia?

01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:26.020
-I agree entirely, but as a
historian, I can look back

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:28.970
and I can see enormous
disruption with any third party

01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:31.630
movements.

01:22:31.630 --> 01:22:34.645
So I don't want a third
party, I certainly

01:22:34.645 --> 01:22:37.260
don't want the ones
that have been emerging.

01:22:37.260 --> 01:22:43.170
I would like our
current parties to think

01:22:43.170 --> 01:22:49.530
better, are to be that
party of Doug Elmendorf.

01:22:49.530 --> 01:22:51.050
Both of them.

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:53.270
One could be a little
more to the right of Doug,

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:55.710
and one a little more
to the left of Doug.

01:22:55.710 --> 01:22:58.840
That would be a great world.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:01.210
-The Doug Elmendorf party.

01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:04.090
-Well, I've worked
with Doug, so I am

01:23:04.090 --> 01:23:05.310
going to sign onto his party.

01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:06.851
That's exactly what
I would say, too.

01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:09.620
I think, to me, that would
be the most important thing

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:10.950
that we could do.

01:23:10.950 --> 01:23:16.285
Just investments
in kids who will

01:23:16.285 --> 01:23:18.110
want to make the
country great again.

01:23:18.110 --> 01:23:20.226
I think that's how we do it.

01:23:20.226 --> 01:23:20.725
-Yes.

01:23:20.725 --> 01:23:21.260
I agree.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.930
-There's so much to choose from.

01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:30.720
I'm going to take two.

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:34.930
The first one is, I
would like a party that

01:23:34.930 --> 01:23:39.770
embraced, as Doug said
earlier, an esteemed service,

01:23:39.770 --> 01:23:41.300
both in leadership in education.

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.200
I think we live in an era where
after 35 years of denigrating

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:50.400
public service, we have
managed to actually

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:55.300
make it somewhat more like the
people who initially denigrated

01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:56.492
it believed.

01:23:56.492 --> 01:23:58.200
You go into a post
office, and it doesn't

01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.384
work, why doesn't it work?

01:23:59.384 --> 01:24:01.550
Well, because Congress
doesn't fund it as punishment

01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:03.200
for not working well.

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:04.000
You know?

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.340
Why doesn't the IRS
answer your phone calls?

01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:07.790
Well, we've defunded it.

01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:09.160
So of course you hate the IRS.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.250
So I think there's a
self-fulfilling prophecy

01:24:12.250 --> 01:24:15.084
around the quality of governance
that needs to be reversed.

01:24:21.491 --> 01:24:22.990
The other thing I
would add to that,

01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:24.906
that would actually, I
think, complement this,

01:24:24.906 --> 01:24:26.390
would be tax simplification.

01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:30.470
And this is also
going to Doug's point.

01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:33.170
We have so many tax
expenditures that

01:24:33.170 --> 01:24:35.555
are basically hidden handouts,
and we could cap them.

01:24:35.555 --> 01:24:37.680
There's actually a very
simple way to address them.

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.722
Just limiting the tax
expenditure per individual.

01:24:39.722 --> 01:24:40.929
You could take whatever like.

01:24:40.929 --> 01:24:42.490
You can do it for
charity, you could

01:24:42.490 --> 01:24:44.590
do if a mortgage interest,
you can do it for education.

01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:47.060
But it's only 0.5% percent of
your adjusted gross income.

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:49.599
That would be a
mind-blowing change.

01:24:49.599 --> 01:24:50.099
-Agree.

01:24:54.829 --> 01:24:56.640
All right, except.
for Claudia's comment

01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:59.800
about the wisdom of
having a third party,

01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.400
that was very nice.

01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:04.100
Thank you.

01:25:04.100 --> 01:25:08.900
-Thank you very much Dean
Rouse, and to our panelists.
