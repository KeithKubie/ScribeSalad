00:00:02.377 --> 00:00:03.586
Man, when I found this
crazy little street missile,

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:05.463
my mind just started
racing as fast

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:06.923
as this little car will rock.

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:08.883
Then the guys from
Borla called, and they

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:12.011
said they wanted to do something
extra special for the SEMA show

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.722
here in Las Vegas.
Bam.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.267
I knew in my mind it needed
to be a Manta masterpiece.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:20.019
Now, this Manta
had a safety issue,

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.689
so we built our own custom
firewall in this thing

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.691
to keep the driver safe.

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:27.277
Then we added a 383
stroker, and then we

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:30.280
did a satin black on
this car, with Borla

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.450
inspired graphics all over it.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.576
David, my man.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:35.869
Aw, yeah.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.121
Now, David Borla,
he's here right now

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.416
to check out how this insane
little rocket came out.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.293
David, this whole
project has been awesome.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.962
And the fact that we get to
work together with Borla--

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.505
it's been an honor for us.

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:48.339
Honor for us, too.

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:49.132
We had a lot of fun.

00:00:49.132 --> 00:00:50.550
It was really fun.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.428
And when you said that
Borla wanted to show off

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:56.514
the new induction system
and exhaust system,

00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:58.224
this car is perfect for it.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.560
So I would lay a very
safe bet it's going

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.686
to be the only one at SEMA.

00:01:01.686 --> 00:01:02.979
Yeah, I think so.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.397
I think it's gonna
be the only at SEMA.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:05.648
I think you're definitely
good on that one.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:06.816
- Yeah.
- You ready to see this thing?

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:07.817
I'm ready.
I'm ready.

00:01:07.817 --> 00:01:08.735
I'm excited.
- I love it.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.694
Come on over here.

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.321
Let's check this out, man.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:12.781
Ryan, my man, bring
that Manta out!

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.328
No way.

00:01:18.328 --> 00:01:19.621
Wow.

00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:21.080
Look at that thing.
- I know.

00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:27.545
Oh, yeah.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:28.505
Wow.

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:29.798
- What?
- Yeah.

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.010
Nice.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:35.720
Smooth, yes.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.387
Come on.

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:37.555
All right.

00:01:37.555 --> 00:01:39.641
Oh, man.

00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:41.976
That came out
really, really nice.

00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:42.727
It's perfect.

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:43.978
Excellent.

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:45.730
This car had potential
when we got it.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.525
We've done a ton of work to make
her SEMA ready-- some planned,

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:50.193
some not so much.

00:01:50.193 --> 00:01:52.862
We started on the inside by
upgrading the transmission,

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:55.365
then we added that
custom Borla induction

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.867
system and exhaust
system to make her look

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.494
and sound awesome.

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:01.371
After Ryan did a
little surgery to make

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:04.541
sure it fit like a glove, he
finished off the whole racecar

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:06.668
vibe with a satin
black and red Borla

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.586
inspired color scheme
that we matched

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.588
with an all new red interior.

00:02:10.588 --> 00:02:13.883
This car is ready for SEMA,
and ready to hit the streets.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:16.469
And I just hope the
world is ready for her.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.971
Tell me what you're
thinking, brother.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.848
When you went to cut
this thing, I was nervous.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:21.099
Oh, I know.

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.725
I was like, you
get one shot at this.

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:23.560
Yeah.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.394
And it's gorgeous.

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:25.854
It's perfect.

00:02:25.854 --> 00:02:27.397
Everybody went nuts
making sure that induction

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.649
system just shows off.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.234
It's easy to
take it for granted

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:32.777
because it looks like it's
supposed to be like that.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.153
Right.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:35.071
But making it look
like that is not easy.

00:02:35.071 --> 00:02:36.239
- No.
- No, it's not.

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.115
You guys did a
great job with it.

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:38.449
Not at all.

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:39.993
You know, and doing
a full color change

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:42.078
on the car in the satin
black seemed to make the car

00:02:42.078 --> 00:02:44.664
lower and wider, which I love.
- Right.

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:47.333
We completely
re-did the interior,

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.502
all in that red leather.

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:52.171
It complements the
Borla graphics on it.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:55.842
So we've got a really cool
vibe going with the whole car,

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:58.011
but when this thing is
sitting in your booth,

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.178
she's going to be open.
- Yep.

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:00.138
We're going have it open.

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.348
So let's show this off.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.975
This is how tight everything is.

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.643
We've literally gotta
take the first two

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:09.230
stacks off to get it open.

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.899
She is close.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.942
And ba-ba-ba-bam.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:14.360
Wow.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.987
This is what I'm
talking about, right here.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:16.946
I mean, there it is.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:17.906
It's all just right there.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.407
Absolutely.

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:21.034
This is why I
thought this car would

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.243
be the perfect car to show off.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.995
[inaudible]?

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.204
It's almost like having it on
a stand, and this is the stand.

00:03:25.204 --> 00:03:26.706
Right.
No, exactly.

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:27.790
It's all just right here.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.500
Absolutely.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.628
Your exhaust system here, the
headers, the tubes, whatever

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:35.256
you want to call this-- they're
gorgeous, and so correct,

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.633
it's unbelievable.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.718
This is why people
come to the SEMA show.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.386
For this, right here.
- Amen.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:41.346
I mean, this is it.

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.097
Amen.

00:03:43.097 --> 00:03:44.807
Last time when you saw his car,
it had these pop up headlights.

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:46.434
Headlights.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.853
Which I just hated, so we
completely changed the face

00:03:48.853 --> 00:03:53.316
of it by properly putting
old school Can-Am racecar

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.401
style headlight setup in it.

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:56.903
Looks great.
Fixed headlights.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:58.404
It looks, like, so sexy, too.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:03:59.906
That's the right headlight
setup for this car.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.157
100%.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.700
The shape of this
car is everything.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.118
Yeah.

00:04:04.118 --> 00:04:05.328
Add the Borla logos on
there, and it does look

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:06.621
a little bit like a Batmobile.

00:04:06.621 --> 00:04:07.997
It just made it that
much cooler to me.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:09.707
Right.

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:13.169
The car is so much fun that
it will be a real attraction,

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.463
and attention getter
at the booth at SEMA.

00:04:15.463 --> 00:04:17.799
But man, once the
people enter the booth,

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.094
and they get to see what
you guys have got going on--

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:22.387
Oh, my lord.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.055
It's going to get
a lot of attention.

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:25.348
You gonna be happy to see
this baby sitting in your booth?

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:26.766
So happy.
So proud.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.102
We've been to 30, 40 SEMA shows.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.479
This one's going to
be the best one ever.

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:33.189
I gotta say, man,
this little Manta

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.817
has been nothing but difficult,
but an extremely fulfilling

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.860
build.
She's really wicked.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.445
She came out awesome.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:42.240
She's got my stamp of
approval, and now on top of it,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.701
I've got David Borla's
stamp of approval.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.160
It's time to go to SEMA.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.453
Off to the big show.

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.663
David, I'm glad
you're happy, man.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:50.164
- I'm so happy.
- This thing is sick.

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:51.499
You know, when she's
sitting in the booth, open--

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:52.375
Perfect.
Yeah.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.793
Beautiful.

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:54.794
It's got the name all
over the back, brother.
