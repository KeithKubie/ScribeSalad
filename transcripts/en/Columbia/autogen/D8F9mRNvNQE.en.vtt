just take a minute or so and get into

just take a minute or so and get into

that because that's really a very

true behavioral change is very very
 

00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:43.530
true behavioral change is very very
difficult particularly when it comes in

treatment as prevention and it's really
 

00:25:28.419 --> 00:25:30.749
treatment as prevention and it's really
a beautiful phenomenon because there

00:25:30.749 --> 00:25:30.759
a beautiful phenomenon because there
 

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:32.519
a beautiful phenomenon because there
were and I was joking with you Ray but

were and I was joking with you Ray but
 

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:35.009
were and I was joking with you Ray but
there was attention early on and we all

00:25:35.009 --> 00:25:35.019
there was attention early on and we all
 

00:25:35.019 --> 00:25:36.440
there was attention early on and we all
know that because we were there about

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:36.450
know that because we were there about
 

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.119
know that because we were there about

for treatment now it's one package that
 

00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:44.789
for treatment now it's one package that
really synergizes with itself so that's

00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799
really synergizes with itself so that's
 

00:25:44.799 --> 00:25:47.219
really synergizes with itself so that's
really one of the reasons why we're all

00:25:47.219 --> 00:25:47.229
really one of the reasons why we're all
 

00:25:47.229 --> 00:25:50.369
really one of the reasons why we're all
excited about the fact that we do see

00:25:50.369 --> 00:25:50.379
excited about the fact that we do see
 

00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:51.899
excited about the fact that we do see

and people ask me well how come you you

and people ask me well how come you you
 

00:25:54.879 --> 00:25:56.339
and people ask me well how come you you
all said that and we will all at the

00:25:56.339 --> 00:25:56.349
all said that and we will all at the
 

00:25:56.349 --> 00:25:58.349
all said that and we will all at the
meeting you said that you could possibly

00:25:58.349 --> 00:25:58.359
meeting you said that you could possibly
 

00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:00.749
meeting you said that you could possibly
have an aids-free generation and you

00:26:00.749 --> 00:26:00.759
have an aids-free generation and you

didn't say that ten years ago well
 

00:26:03.639 --> 00:26:06.330
didn't say that ten years ago well
because we didn't have all the tools and

because we didn't have all the tools and

we didn't yet prove that the tools that

we didn't yet prove that the tools that
were efficacious in a clinical trial

00:26:11.539 --> 00:26:11.549
were efficacious in a clinical trial
 

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:14.219
were efficacious in a clinical trial
actually became effective in the field

00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:14.229
actually became effective in the field
 

00:26:14.229 --> 00:26:16.919
actually became effective in the field
and we know that now the only barrier

00:26:16.919 --> 00:26:16.929
and we know that now the only barrier
 

00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:20.099
and we know that now the only barrier
between us and the goal line is that we

00:26:20.099 --> 00:26:20.109
between us and the goal line is that we
 

00:26:20.109 --> 00:26:22.919
between us and the goal line is that we
know we can put an end to AIDS the

00:26:22.919 --> 00:26:22.929
know we can put an end to AIDS the
 

00:26:22.929 --> 00:26:25.830
know we can put an end to AIDS the
question is will we put an end to AIDS

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:25.840
question is will we put an end to AIDS
 

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.299
question is will we put an end to AIDS
and that will be the kinds of

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:27.309
and that will be the kinds of
 

00:26:27.309 --> 00:26:28.979

00:27:22.499 --> 00:27:22.509
take it and apply it and not just
 

00:27:22.509 --> 00:27:24.389
take it and apply it and not just
implemented in one place but scale it up

00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399
implemented in one place but scale it up
 

00:27:24.399 --> 00:27:26.009
implemented in one place but scale it up
for millions of people around the world

00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:26.019
for millions of people around the world
 

00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:27.989
for millions of people around the world
and I think that's quite unique about

00:27:27.989 --> 00:27:27.999
and I think that's quite unique about
 

00:27:27.999 --> 00:27:30.930
and I think that's quite unique about
the HIV epidemic so I'm optimistic not

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:30.940
the HIV epidemic so I'm optimistic not
 

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.969
the HIV epidemic so I'm optimistic not
just by the tools we know already that

00:27:32.969 --> 00:27:32.979
just by the tools we know already that
 

00:27:32.979 --> 00:27:35.010
just by the tools we know already that
we've discovered whether they be

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:35.020
we've discovered whether they be
 

00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:37.590
we've discovered whether they be
preventional male circumcision or prep

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600
preventional male circumcision or prep
 

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.780
preventional male circumcision or prep
which is pre exposure prophylaxis that's

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:39.790
which is pre exposure prophylaxis that's
 

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:41.700
which is pre exposure prophylaxis that's
when people who are negative can take

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:41.710
when people who are negative can take
 

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.550
when people who are negative can take
medicines and stay negative is that the

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:44.560
medicines and stay negative is that the
 

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:46.290
medicines and stay negative is that the
ability to take these discoveries and

00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:46.300
ability to take these discoveries and
 

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.760
ability to take these discoveries and
actually take them to action is very

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:47.770
actually take them to action is very
 

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:49.530
actually take them to action is very
unique to the HIV epidemic which makes

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:49.540
unique to the HIV epidemic which makes
 

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:52.590
unique to the HIV epidemic which makes
us all very optimistic that we can

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600
us all very optimistic that we can
 

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.020
us all very optimistic that we can
package these interventions together to

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.030
package these interventions together to
 

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.690
package these interventions together to
achieve what we want to achieve I think

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:57.700
achieve what we want to achieve I think
 

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.060
achieve what we want to achieve I think
another aspect of the HIV response that

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:00.070
another aspect of the HIV response that
 

00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:02.730
another aspect of the HIV response that
I also think is quite unique is the

00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:02.740
I also think is quite unique is the
 

00:28:02.740 --> 00:28:04.290
I also think is quite unique is the
transformation that has happened as the

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:04.300
transformation that has happened as the
 

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:05.790
transformation that has happened as the
health systems and you can have a

00:28:05.790 --> 00:28:05.800
health systems and you can have a
 

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.770
health systems and you can have a
wonderful vaccine discovered tomorrow

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:07.780
wonderful vaccine discovered tomorrow
 

00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:10.770
wonderful vaccine discovered tomorrow
for HIV for example but if you don't

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:10.780
for HIV for example but if you don't
 

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.020
for HIV for example but if you don't
have a way of bringing that to the

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:13.030
have a way of bringing that to the
 

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.870
have a way of bringing that to the
country and distributing it and giving

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:15.880
country and distributing it and giving
 

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:17.730
country and distributing it and giving
it to people and people accepting and

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:17.740
it to people and people accepting and
 

00:28:17.740 --> 00:28:20.430
it to people and people accepting and
coming to receive it you'll never have

00:28:20.430 --> 00:28:20.440
coming to receive it you'll never have
 

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.200
coming to receive it you'll never have
the outcome you want you never have that

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:22.210
the outcome you want you never have that
 

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.900
the outcome you want you never have that
benefit of a discovery but I think

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:24.910
benefit of a discovery but I think
 

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.910
benefit of a discovery but I think
what's been unique about HIV is because

00:28:26.910 --> 00:28:26.920
what's been unique about HIV is because
 

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.200
what's been unique about HIV is because
of the scale-up of treatment in

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.210
of the scale-up of treatment in
 

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.420
of the scale-up of treatment in
particular and also a prevention if

of these interventions they're people
 

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.840
of these interventions they're people
who are well trained their facilities

provide these combinations of

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:46.300
provide these combinations of
 

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:48.420
provide these combinations of
interventions so the changes in the

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:48.430
interventions so the changes in the
 

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:50.670
interventions so the changes in the
health system the changes in the society

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:50.680
health system the changes in the society
 

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.680
health system the changes in the society
itself people much more engaged in

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:52.690
itself people much more engaged in

trying to control the epidemic in their
 

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:57.090
trying to control the epidemic in their
communities I think in addition to the

00:28:57.090 --> 00:28:57.100
communities I think in addition to the
 

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.210
communities I think in addition to the
scientific discoveries really offer an

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:00.220
scientific discoveries really offer an
 

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.770
scientific discoveries really offer an
opportunity to do something quite

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:01.780
opportunity to do something quite

of you may know who was the architect or
 

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.880
of you may know who was the architect or

one of the architects of the there's the
campaign that led to the eradication of

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:17.410
campaign that led to the eradication of
 

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:21.270
campaign that led to the eradication of
smallpox in the 1970s and what was

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:21.280
smallpox in the 1970s and what was
 

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.100
smallpox in the 1970s and what was
interesting and he wrote this and I'm

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:23.110
interesting and he wrote this and I'm
 

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:26.130
interesting and he wrote this and I'm
paraphrasing this somewhat is he said

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:26.140
paraphrasing this somewhat is he said
 

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:30.120
paraphrasing this somewhat is he said
that the response or the eradication of

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:30.130
that the response or the eradication of
 

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.480
that the response or the eradication of
smallpox was based on us on a strategy

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:33.490
smallpox was based on us on a strategy
 

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.550
smallpox was based on us on a strategy
that was rooted in science it was based

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:35.560
that was rooted in science it was based
 

00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.380
that was rooted in science it was based
on knowing about surveillance knowing

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:37.390
on knowing about surveillance knowing
 

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:38.970
on knowing about surveillance knowing
that we have a vaccine making a vaccine

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:38.980
that we have a vaccine making a vaccine
 

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:40.800
that we have a vaccine making a vaccine
that you didn't need to refrigerate

00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:40.810
that you didn't need to refrigerate
 

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:44.460
that you didn't need to refrigerate
getting the vaccine out there but while

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:44.470
getting the vaccine out there but while
 

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:46.620
getting the vaccine out there but while
it was a strategy based on science

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:46.630
it was a strategy based on science
 

00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:50.010
it was a strategy based on science
was also the tactics of that campaign

00:29:50.010 --> 00:29:50.020
was also the tactics of that campaign
 

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.560
was also the tactics of that campaign
were based in culture and that's very

00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:52.570
were based in culture and that's very
 

00:29:52.570 --> 00:29:54.720
were based in culture and that's very
important to keep in mind that we need

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:54.730
important to keep in mind that we need
 

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:56.580
important to keep in mind that we need
the scientific evidence but we need to

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:56.590
the scientific evidence but we need to
 

00:29:56.590 --> 00:30:00.540
the scientific evidence but we need to
route our tactics in community factors

00:30:00.540 --> 00:30:00.550
route our tactics in community factors
 

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.720
route our tactics in community factors
and these other psychosocial societal

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:03.730
and these other psychosocial societal
 

00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:05.700
and these other psychosocial societal
factors are so critical and unique to

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:05.710
factors are so critical and unique to
 

00:30:05.710 --> 00:30:07.110
factors are so critical and unique to
the HIV epidemic and I think when we

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120
the HIV epidemic and I think when we
 

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:09.780
the HIV epidemic and I think when we
bring the science that strategy the

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:09.790
bring the science that strategy the
 

00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.850
bring the science that strategy the
scientific strategies as well as depth

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:11.860
scientific strategies as well as depth
 

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.580
scientific strategies as well as depth
of knowledge of these tactical ways that

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:14.590
of knowledge of these tactical ways that
 

00:30:14.590 --> 00:30:17.280
of knowledge of these tactical ways that
we need to enable these things to happen

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:17.290
we need to enable these things to happen
 

00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:19.080
we need to enable these things to happen
in partnership with these communities I

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:19.090
in partnership with these communities I
 

00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:20.730
in partnership with these communities I
think then we have a chance to succeed

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:20.740
think then we have a chance to succeed
 

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.700
think then we have a chance to succeed

live a healthy life is a really
 

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:25.310
live a healthy life is a really
important tool for them to get people in

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.320
important tool for them to get people in
 

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.190
important tool for them to get people in
to get them aware of their status and

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200
to get them aware of their status and
 

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.420
to get them aware of their status and
get them on treatment but those same

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:32.430
get them on treatment but those same

medicine ads may not make you scared of

00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:40.070
medicine ads may not make you scared of
 

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:42.830
medicine ads may not make you scared of
contracting HIV or scared enough to make

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:42.840
contracting HIV or scared enough to make
 

00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.700
contracting HIV or scared enough to make
sure you don't contract HIV well that's

00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:46.710
sure you don't contract HIV well that's
 

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:48.200
sure you don't contract HIV well that's
interesting actually when we look at the

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:48.210
interesting actually when we look at the
 

00:40:48.210 --> 00:40:49.180
interesting actually when we look at the
evidence and

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:49.190
evidence and
 

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:51.490
evidence and
you know what does the evidence tell us

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:51.500
you know what does the evidence tell us
 

00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:53.470
you know what does the evidence tell us
over the past five years for example I

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:53.480
over the past five years for example I
 

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:55.240
over the past five years for example I
what's interesting is with the scale-up

00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:55.250
what's interesting is with the scale-up
 

00:40:55.250 --> 00:40:58.089
what's interesting is with the scale-up
of treatment which substantially train

00:40:58.089 --> 00:40:58.099
of treatment which substantially train
 

00:40:58.099 --> 00:41:00.550

communities I mean communities were the
 

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.420
communities I mean communities were the
biggest business as you all know is

making coffins and selling coffins that

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:06.440
making coffins and selling coffins that
 

00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.980
making coffins and selling coffins that
are just that's gone completely so

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:08.990
are just that's gone completely so
 

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.510

there's been this transformation that's

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520
there's been this transformation that's
 

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:12.630
there's been this transformation that's
happened were people living better

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:12.640

00:41:15.069 --> 00:41:15.079
looking healthier and so on at the same
 

00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:17.589
looking healthier and so on at the same
time we're also seeing a decrease in the

time we're also seeing a decrease in the
 

00:41:17.599 --> 00:41:21.280
time we're also seeing a decrease in the
numbers of new infections so I want to

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:21.290
numbers of new infections so I want to
 

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.650

temper the fear that people have that

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:23.660
temper the fear that people have that
 

00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.660

people with us I used to hear this

00:41:27.609 --> 00:41:27.619
people with us I used to hear this
 

00:41:27.619 --> 00:41:29.530
people with us I used to hear this
actually when we started our very first

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:29.540
actually when we started our very first

programs of trying to demonstrate that
 

00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:34.359
programs of trying to demonstrate that
it's feasible to do treatment of people

00:41:34.359 --> 00:41:34.369
it's feasible to do treatment of people
 

00:41:34.369 --> 00:41:35.950
it's feasible to do treatment of people
with HIV in sub-saharan Africa and

00:41:35.950 --> 00:41:35.960
with HIV in sub-saharan Africa and
 

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.510
with HIV in sub-saharan Africa and
people said exactly the same thing is

00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520
people said exactly the same thing is

people said exactly the same thing is
what people are going to take those

what people are going to take those

kind of scenario we're not seeing that

00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680
kind of scenario we're not seeing that
 

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.829
kind of scenario we're not seeing that
what we're seeing is that somehow with

00:41:50.829 --> 00:41:50.839
what we're seeing is that somehow with
 

00:41:50.839 --> 00:41:52.660
what we're seeing is that somehow with
the scale-up of treatment with all the

00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:52.670
the scale-up of treatment with all the
 

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:54.700
the scale-up of treatment with all the
benefits to the individuals themselves

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:54.710
benefits to the individuals themselves
 

00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:56.980
benefits to the individuals themselves
who are HIV infected and to their

00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:56.990
who are HIV infected and to their
 

00:41:56.990 --> 00:41:58.990
who are HIV infected and to their
children in their communities at the

00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000
children in their communities at the
 

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.520
children in their communities at the
same time we're seeing a decrease in

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:00.530
same time we're seeing a decrease in
 

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.130
same time we're seeing a decrease in
numbers of new infections so it tells me

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:03.140
numbers of new infections so it tells me
 

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.530
numbers of new infections so it tells me
that it's much more complex then this

00:42:05.530 --> 00:42:05.540
that it's much more complex then this
 

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.720
that it's much more complex then this
idea of this inhibition that people they

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:07.730
idea of this inhibition that people they
 

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:09.309
idea of this inhibition that people they
don't see people sick in their community

00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319
don't see people sick in their community
 

00:42:09.319 --> 00:42:11.680
don't see people sick in their community
they're not going to behave chevra less

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:11.690
they're not going to behave chevra less
 

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.930
they're not going to behave chevra less
risky behaviors I think there's a

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:13.940
risky behaviors I think there's a
 

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:16.559
risky behaviors I think there's a
massive decrease in their infectiousness

00:42:16.559 --> 00:42:16.569
massive decrease in their infectiousness
 

00:42:16.569 --> 00:42:19.540
massive decrease in their infectiousness
through treatment but also who knows

00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:19.550
through treatment but also who knows
 

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:23.170
through treatment but also who knows
there also are as well potentially

00:42:23.170 --> 00:42:23.180
there also are as well potentially
 

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.089
there also are as well potentially
decreases in risky behaviors as well

00:42:25.089 --> 00:42:25.099
decreases in risky behaviors as well
 

00:42:25.099 --> 00:42:27.010
decreases in risky behaviors as well
there are noted and that's been seen in

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:27.020
there are noted and that's been seen in
 

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.710
there are noted and that's been seen in
several studies when people are on these

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720
several studies when people are on these
 

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:32.380
several studies when people are on these
new intervention you can actually see a

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.390
new intervention you can actually see a
 

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.970
new intervention you can actually see a
decrease in risky behavior rather than

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:33.980
decrease in risky behavior rather than
 

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:36.430
decrease in risky behavior rather than
an increase in risky behaviors so the

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:36.440
an increase in risky behaviors so the
 

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:38.530
an increase in risky behaviors so the
data are mixed but the population level

00:42:38.530 --> 00:42:38.540
data are mixed but the population level
 

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.109
data are mixed but the population level
data are encouraging that with

00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:41.119
data are encouraging that with
 

00:42:41.119 --> 00:42:42.910
data are encouraging that with
increasing treatment we actually seeing

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920
increasing treatment we actually seeing
 

00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.130
increasing treatment we actually seeing
a decrease in new infections and that's

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:45.140
a decrease in new infections and that's
 

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.040
a decrease in new infections and that's
in multiple countries and in sub-saharan

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:48.050
in multiple countries and in sub-saharan
 

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.380
in multiple countries and in sub-saharan
Africa we haven't seen this in the

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:50.390
Africa we haven't seen this in the
 

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.630
Africa we haven't seen this in the
united states yet which is quite

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640
united states yet which is quite
 

00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:54.579
united states yet which is quite
interesting i always try to bring back

00:42:54.579 --> 00:42:54.589
interesting i always try to bring back
 

00:42:54.589 --> 00:42:57.819
interesting i always try to bring back
the u.s. epidemic to the discussion

00:42:57.819 --> 00:42:57.829
the u.s. epidemic to the discussion
 

00:42:57.829 --> 00:43:00.440
the u.s. epidemic to the discussion
where we have it we've had probably

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:00.450
where we have it we've had probably
 

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:02.720
where we have it we've had probably
same number of new infections annually

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:02.730
same number of new infections annually
 

00:43:02.730 --> 00:43:05.750
same number of new infections annually
for the past decade or so and that's

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760
for the past decade or so and that's
 

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:09.500
for the past decade or so and that's
despite at least officially access to

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:09.510
despite at least officially access to
 

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:10.849
despite at least officially access to
treatment pretty much access to

00:43:10.849 --> 00:43:10.859
treatment pretty much access to
 

00:43:10.859 --> 00:43:12.710
treatment pretty much access to
treatment so we do have challenges in

00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720
treatment so we do have challenges in
 

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.510
treatment so we do have challenges in
this country that get at trying to find

00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520
this country that get at trying to find
 

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.280
this country that get at trying to find
everybody who's infected about a quarter

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:16.290
everybody who's infected about a quarter
 

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:18.290
everybody who's infected about a quarter
of people who have HIV don't know it in

00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300
of people who have HIV don't know it in
 

00:43:18.300 --> 00:43:20.960
of people who have HIV don't know it in
the US so those are behaviors that we

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:20.970
the US so those are behaviors that we
 

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.400
the US so those are behaviors that we
need to change people need to know the

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:22.410
need to change people need to know the
 

00:43:22.410 --> 00:43:24.079
need to change people need to know the
status feel comfortable knowing your

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:24.089
status feel comfortable knowing your
 

00:43:24.089 --> 00:43:26.089
status feel comfortable knowing your
status and then the issue of this whole

00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:26.099
status and then the issue of this whole
 

00:43:26.099 --> 00:43:28.220
status and then the issue of this whole
cascade of then getting into care

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:28.230
cascade of then getting into care
 

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:29.690
cascade of then getting into care
getting on treatment staying on

00:43:29.690 --> 00:43:29.700
getting on treatment staying on
 

00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:32.690
getting on treatment staying on
treatment so that we start reaping the

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700
treatment so that we start reaping the
 

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:36.050
treatment so that we start reaping the
benefits of these interventions as well

00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060
benefits of these interventions as well
 

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.970
benefits of these interventions as well
as we have a huge other challenge which

00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:37.980
as we have a huge other challenge which
 

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.800
as we have a huge other challenge which
is of course dealing with some of our

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:39.810
is of course dealing with some of our
 

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:41.990
is of course dealing with some of our
most disenfranchised populations in this

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000
most disenfranchised populations in this
 

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.250
most disenfranchised populations in this
country who feel that they're not cared

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:46.260
country who feel that they're not cared
 

00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:47.839
country who feel that they're not cared
for they don't have access to the

00:43:47.839 --> 00:43:47.849
for they don't have access to the
 

00:43:47.849 --> 00:43:50.300
for they don't have access to the
services the services are not attuned to

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:50.310
services the services are not attuned to
 

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:52.220
services the services are not attuned to
their needs so we have some real

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:52.230
their needs so we have some real
 

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.620

important to keep in mind is that we we

important to keep in mind is that we we

important to keep in mind is that we we
tend to think of risk for HIV and

00:51:13.599 --> 00:51:13.609
tend to think of risk for HIV and

there's substantial evidence from the
 

00:51:22.089 --> 00:51:24.579
there's substantial evidence from the
United States for example that when you

00:51:24.579 --> 00:51:24.589
United States for example that when you
 

00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:27.849
United States for example that when you
look at black MSM for example and you

00:51:27.849 --> 00:51:27.859
look at black MSM for example and you
 

00:51:27.859 --> 00:51:31.150
look at black MSM for example and you
look at they are extremely high risk of

00:51:31.150 --> 00:51:31.160
look at they are extremely high risk of
 

00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.130
look at they are extremely high risk of
getting HIV infected but actually when

00:51:33.130 --> 00:51:33.140
getting HIV infected but actually when
 

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:34.660
getting HIV infected but actually when
you examined their behaviors the risk

00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:34.670
you examined their behaviors the risk
 

00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:36.729
you examined their behaviors the risk
behaviors they tend to have less risky

00:51:36.729 --> 00:51:36.739
behaviors they tend to have less risky
 

00:51:36.739 --> 00:51:39.969
behaviors they tend to have less risky
behaviors than non black MSM so it's

00:51:39.969 --> 00:51:39.979
behaviors than non black MSM so it's
 

00:51:39.979 --> 00:51:42.039
behaviors than non black MSM so it's
it's complicated and we tend to always

to their work we are the guidelines for

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:46.610
to their work we are the guidelines for
 

01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:48.490
to their work we are the guidelines for
early treatment we are the guidelines

01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:48.500
early treatment we are the guidelines
 

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:51.640

but is to all of that is a very good but

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:55.430
but is to all of that is a very good but
 

01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:57.760
but is to all of that is a very good but
the risk you mention is critical 17

01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:57.770
the risk you mention is critical 17

you have a quick brief question in one

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:06.260
you have a quick brief question in one

crotchy it's kind of round about the

01:19:10.450 --> 01:19:10.460
crotchy it's kind of round about the
 

01:19:10.460 --> 01:19:14.110
crotchy it's kind of round about the
research side of a possible HIV vaccine

01:19:14.110 --> 01:19:14.120
research side of a possible HIV vaccine
 

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.690
research side of a possible HIV vaccine
or if it exists already but my question

01:19:16.690 --> 01:19:16.700
or if it exists already but my question
 

01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.760
or if it exists already but my question
is about how close it is to becoming

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:18.770
is about how close it is to becoming
 

01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:20.860
is about how close it is to becoming

vaccine where you give to adolescents
 

01:19:22.610 --> 01:19:24.670

having to have the HIV vaccine or is it

01:19:30.040 --> 01:19:30.050
having to have the HIV vaccine or is it
 

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:32.290
having to have the HIV vaccine or is it
some characteristic of the HIV the virus

some characteristic of the HIV the virus
 

01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:34.720
some characteristic of the HIV the virus
that makes it a challenge to target and

that we had the opportunity to worry

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:48.290
that we had the opportunity to worry
 

01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:50.470
that we had the opportunity to worry
about the policy that we would use if we

01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480
about the policy that we would use if we
 

01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:54.100
about the policy that we would use if we

when you develop a vaccine you tend to

01:20:03.100 --> 01:20:03.110
when you develop a vaccine you tend to
 

01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:06.100
when you develop a vaccine you tend to
try and mimic with the vaccine what the

try and mimic with the vaccine what the
 

01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:08.410
try and mimic with the vaccine what the
natural infection does and the response

01:20:08.410 --> 01:20:08.420
natural infection does and the response
 

01:20:08.420 --> 01:20:10.350
natural infection does and the response
is it elicits because almost all

01:20:10.350 --> 01:20:10.360
is it elicits because almost all
 

01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:13.000
is it elicits because almost all

the reason why there are no spontaneous
cures of HIV so having said that what

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:45.500
cures of HIV so having said that what
 

01:20:45.500 --> 01:20:48.160
cures of HIV so having said that what
I'm saying is that the challenge now is

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:48.170
I'm saying is that the challenge now is
 

01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:51.459
I'm saying is that the challenge now is
really a scientific challenge not an

01:20:51.459 --> 01:20:51.469
really a scientific challenge not an
 

01:20:51.469 --> 01:20:53.860
really a scientific challenge not an
implementation challenge not a policy

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:53.870
implementation challenge not a policy
 

01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:55.840
implementation challenge not a policy
challenge and it's it's good that you

01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:55.850
challenge and it's it's good that you
 

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:57.700
challenge and it's it's good that you
brought that question up in the light of

01:20:57.700 --> 01:20:57.710
brought that question up in the light of
 

01:20:57.710 --> 01:20:59.620
brought that question up in the light of
what we were talking about tools that we

01:20:59.620 --> 01:20:59.630
what we were talking about tools that we
 

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:01.990
what we were talking about tools that we
have that we just need to implement a

01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000
have that we just need to implement a
 

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.720

vaccine is a tool that we don't have yet

01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:04.730
vaccine is a tool that we don't have yet
 

01:21:04.730 --> 01:21:07.630
vaccine is a tool that we don't have yet
I believe we will have it because a

01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:07.640
I believe we will have it because a
 

01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:09.100
I believe we will have it because a
couple of years ago we had a

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:09.110
couple of years ago we had a
 

01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:11.620
couple of years ago we had a
proof-of-concept trial that showed that

01:21:11.620 --> 01:21:11.630
proof-of-concept trial that showed that
 

01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:14.260
proof-of-concept trial that showed that
you can actually protect in a modestly

01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:14.270
you can actually protect in a modestly
 

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:16.360
you can actually protect in a modestly
small number of people but you still

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:16.370
small number of people but you still
 

01:21:16.370 --> 01:21:18.490
small number of people but you still
could protect with a vaccine that we

01:21:18.490 --> 01:21:18.500
could protect with a vaccine that we
 

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:21.070
could protect with a vaccine that we
tried in Thailand several years ago so

01:21:21.070 --> 01:21:21.080
tried in Thailand several years ago so
 

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.169
tried in Thailand several years ago so
it really is a scientific challenge once

01:21:23.169 --> 01:21:23.179
it really is a scientific challenge once
 

01:21:23.179 --> 01:21:26.200
it really is a scientific challenge once
we get it I think we can just vaccinate

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:26.210
we get it I think we can just vaccinate
 

01:21:26.210 --> 01:21:28.450
we get it I think we can just vaccinate
at risk people and I wouldn't be

01:21:28.450 --> 01:21:28.460
at risk people and I wouldn't be
 

01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.000
at risk people and I wouldn't be
surprised by that time that we would be

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:31.010
surprised by that time that we would be
 

01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:32.709
surprised by that time that we would be
vaccinating anybody like we do at

01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719
vaccinating anybody like we do at
 

01:21:32.719 --> 01:21:34.390
vaccinating anybody like we do at
hepatitis B that's what I would like to

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400
hepatitis B that's what I would like to
 

01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.820
hepatitis B that's what I would like to
see if we had it it would be a hepatitis

01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:36.830
see if we had it it would be a hepatitis
 

01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:40.750
see if we had it it would be a hepatitis
B HPV type thing but my timekeeper let

01:21:40.750 --> 01:21:40.760
B HPV type thing but my timekeeper let
 

01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:43.209
B HPV type thing but my timekeeper let
me get facial and I guess I take this

01:21:43.209 --> 01:21:43.219
me get facial and I guess I take this
 

01:21:43.219 --> 01:21:46.330

last one or do I have to wrap it up okay

01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:46.340
last one or do I have to wrap it up okay

make it elegant and brief absolutely

01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440
make it elegant and brief absolutely
 

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.689
make it elegant and brief absolutely
thanks to the panel for this discussion

01:21:52.689 --> 01:21:52.699
thanks to the panel for this discussion
 

01:21:52.699 --> 01:21:54.610
thanks to the panel for this discussion
and my question actually follows up very

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:54.620
and my question actually follows up very
 

01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.740
and my question actually follows up very
much on the last one I really appreciate

01:21:56.740 --> 01:21:56.750
much on the last one I really appreciate
 

01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:59.410
much on the last one I really appreciate
the discussion on a future without HIV

01:21:59.410 --> 01:21:59.420
the discussion on a future without HIV
 

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:01.780
the discussion on a future without HIV
AIDS but for those of us who are living

01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:01.790
AIDS but for those of us who are living
 

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:04.780
AIDS but for those of us who are living
with HIV there won't be a future unless

01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:04.790
with HIV there won't be a future unless
 

01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:07.870
with HIV there won't be a future unless
we have a cure and so I wonder how

01:22:07.870 --> 01:22:07.880
we have a cure and so I wonder how
 

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.939
we have a cure and so I wonder how
important it is that we continue to fund

01:22:09.939 --> 01:22:09.949
important it is that we continue to fund
 

01:22:09.949 --> 01:22:12.280
important it is that we continue to fund
research for a cure recognizing what a

01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:12.290
research for a cure recognizing what a
 

01:22:12.290 --> 01:22:14.950
research for a cure recognizing what a
scientific challenge that is well it's a

01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960
scientific challenge that is well it's a
 

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:18.010
scientific challenge that is well it's a
very short but precise answer is that we

01:22:18.010 --> 01:22:18.020
very short but precise answer is that we
 

01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:19.689
very short but precise answer is that we
are very committed from a research

01:22:19.689 --> 01:22:19.699
are very committed from a research
 

01:22:19.699 --> 01:22:21.970
are very committed from a research
standpoint to find a cure it's a

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:21.980
standpoint to find a cure it's a
 

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.700
standpoint to find a cure it's a
daunting challenge because of the nature

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:24.710
daunting challenge because of the nature
 

01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:28.340
daunting challenge because of the nature
of HIV and how it integrates itself

01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:28.350
of HIV and how it integrates itself
 

01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:30.890
of HIV and how it integrates itself
to the genome of a cell and you want to

01:22:30.890 --> 01:22:30.900
to the genome of a cell and you want to
 

01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:32.210
to the genome of a cell and you want to
be careful that you don't have a cure

01:22:32.210 --> 01:22:32.220
be careful that you don't have a cure
 

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:34.250
be careful that you don't have a cure
that's worse than the treatment that we
