00:00:00.724 --> 00:00:02.849
- [Voiceover] Another form
of an op-amp circuit is

00:00:02.849 --> 00:00:04.615
called the summing op-amp.

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:07.310
We're gonna work through
how this one works.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.017
Let's draw in here now is an inverting

00:00:09.017 --> 00:00:12.103
op-amp circuit with a single input.

00:00:12.103 --> 00:00:13.669
We're gonna call this

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:14.674
this will be V.

00:00:14.674 --> 00:00:16.757
We'll call the VA for now.

00:00:16.757 --> 00:00:18.687
And we have V out.

00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:21.213
And we worked out what
how this worked before

00:00:21.213 --> 00:00:23.630
where V out was a function of

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.029
VA times the ratio of these two resistors.

00:00:29.332 --> 00:00:31.072
And now I'm gonna add
a little twist to this

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:33.070
and we're gonna analyze a
different kind of circuit.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.195
So I'm gonna add another
resistor right here.

00:00:36.195 --> 00:00:37.028
Like this.

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:41.582
And a second input.

00:00:41.582 --> 00:00:43.900
We'll call this VB.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.900
And so I have RB, or sorry, RA here.

00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:49.076
This will be RB.

00:00:49.944 --> 00:00:52.527
And we'll call this R feedback.

00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:56.419
And the question again is now,

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:59.112
what is V out in terms of

00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:00.945
the inputs, VA and VB?

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.515
We're gonna use the idea
of a virtual ground.

00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:11.994
Virtual ground.

00:01:11.994 --> 00:01:13.859
The idea of a virtual
ground applies to most

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:16.031
op-amp circuits, and
it's a really useful way

00:01:16.031 --> 00:01:18.444
to simplify the analysis.

00:01:18.444 --> 00:01:20.187
And when we use a virtual ground

00:01:20.187 --> 00:01:21.846
one of the things I like to do is just

00:01:21.846 --> 00:01:24.406
draw a little symbol here

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:26.425
like that, for my virtual ground.

00:01:26.425 --> 00:01:29.465
The virtual ground, as a review,

00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:31.297
if the voltage coming out of this op-amp

00:01:31.297 --> 00:01:33.906
is in a reasonable range,
sort of a plus or minus

00:01:33.906 --> 00:01:35.918
10 volts, or something like that.

00:01:35.918 --> 00:01:38.815
And because the gain of
this op-amp is so enormous

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:41.898
on the order of 100,000, or a million

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.599
that means that, when
this is working properly

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.430
that these two voltages will
be really close together.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.388
They'll be only microvolts apart, at most.

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:54.433
And, because they're so close

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:56.735
we can just say, let's
just say they're the same

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.241
for the purposes of
analyzing this circuit.

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:02.819
And, since this input is at zero volts

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.312
this is at zero volts.

00:02:04.312 --> 00:02:07.856
That means that this input
is very close to zero volts.

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:09.421
So this node here

00:02:09.421 --> 00:02:11.040
this node here, we say

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.957
is at a virtual ground.

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.851
So let's move ahead,
let's analyze this circuit

00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:18.126
and what we want to
find is we want to find

00:02:18.126 --> 00:02:19.959
V out as a function of

00:02:21.887 --> 00:02:22.720
VA and VB.

00:02:25.414 --> 00:02:27.987
Let's see if we can do that.

00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:29.542
So looking at my circuit the other thing

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:31.528
I know about op-amps
that's really important

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:33.778
always is, that the current

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:36.972
going into an op-amp input

00:02:36.972 --> 00:02:38.864
is zero, or practically zero.

00:02:38.864 --> 00:02:42.003
And for the purposes of
what we're doing here

00:02:42.003 --> 00:02:44.596
we can treat it as zero.

00:02:44.596 --> 00:02:45.516
All right.

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:47.983
So, we have zero volts on this node.

00:02:47.983 --> 00:02:50.001
We have zero current going this way.

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:51.733
So let's go after

00:02:51.733 --> 00:02:53.932
let's go after this current right here.

00:02:53.932 --> 00:02:55.152
Let's figure out what that is.

00:02:55.152 --> 00:02:56.902
So we'll call that I.

00:02:58.433 --> 00:03:01.096
And we can express I in terms of VA

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:03.852
and VB in these two resistor values.

00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:05.269
So we can write I

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.758
equals, now what is it?

00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:09.591
Well, we have IA here.

00:03:11.164 --> 00:03:13.497
And we have IB flowing here.

00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:18.257
That means that I equals

00:03:18.257 --> 00:03:19.174
IA plus IB.

00:03:22.824 --> 00:03:23.657
All right.

00:03:29.526 --> 00:03:32.480
And let me write IA and IB in terms of

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.553
Ohms Law here.

00:03:33.553 --> 00:03:36.136
So we get I equals, what is IA?

00:03:37.064 --> 00:03:38.564
IA is this voltage

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:43.055
divided by RA.

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:45.159
And this voltage is VA

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.576
minus zero volts.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:48.727
So it's VA

00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:51.269
over RA.

00:03:52.906 --> 00:03:54.936
And now let's write down what's IB?

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:55.769
IB

00:03:56.905 --> 00:03:59.322
we look at this voltage here.

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:02.316
This voltage is VB minus

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.459
zero.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.542
Or just plain

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:08.244
VB over RB.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.600
All right, so that's one step.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.150
We've written this current in terms of

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.858
what's going on on the
input side over here.

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:21.604
Now one thing we know,
because this current is zero,

00:04:21.604 --> 00:04:22.477
we know, what?

00:04:22.477 --> 00:04:23.771
We know

00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:25.271
this current is I.

00:04:27.076 --> 00:04:29.832
And, if I's going into RF

00:04:29.832 --> 00:04:33.758
we'll label the voltage on RF like that.

00:04:33.758 --> 00:04:35.710
So now let's write an expression for I

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.793
in terms of RF and this voltage here.

00:04:40.019 --> 00:04:41.200
What is this voltage here?

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.939
Well, let's look at the two ends.

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.494
This is zero volts on this node here.

00:04:45.494 --> 00:04:48.040
And on this side it's

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.562
V out.

00:04:49.562 --> 00:04:51.364
So, the current there, the current

00:04:51.364 --> 00:04:52.364
on that side

00:04:53.461 --> 00:04:54.294
equals

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:57.577
it's zero minus V out.

00:04:58.414 --> 00:04:59.581
So minus V out

00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:02.001
divided by RF.

00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:07.624
That's Ohms Law for this
resistor right here.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.694
Now we know that this
current equals this current.

00:05:12.694 --> 00:05:14.841
So let's just set these
two expressions together.

00:05:14.841 --> 00:05:17.008
So I'll do that over here.

00:05:21.131 --> 00:05:23.683
I can write minus V out

00:05:23.683 --> 00:05:24.516
over RF

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.740
equals this one

00:05:30.503 --> 00:05:31.336
VA over RA

00:05:33.523 --> 00:05:34.856
plus VB over RB.

00:05:39.334 --> 00:05:40.722
Now we can get the final function

00:05:40.722 --> 00:05:43.823
I'm just gonna multiply
through by RF on both sides.

00:05:43.823 --> 00:05:45.186
And we get

00:05:45.186 --> 00:05:46.186
V out equals

00:05:47.312 --> 00:05:48.624
take the minus sign with us

00:05:48.624 --> 00:05:49.457
minus

00:05:51.564 --> 00:05:52.397
RF

00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:54.298
over RA

00:05:56.164 --> 00:05:56.997
times VA

00:05:58.413 --> 00:06:00.069
plus

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:00.902
RF

00:06:02.131 --> 00:06:03.481
over

00:06:03.481 --> 00:06:04.829
RB

00:06:04.829 --> 00:06:06.066
times

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:06.899
VB.

00:06:09.218 --> 00:06:10.338
So that's our answer.

00:06:10.338 --> 00:06:11.433
That's V out

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:12.749
as a function of

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:15.396
VA and VB, the two inputs.

00:06:15.396 --> 00:06:17.034
And you can see that the

00:06:17.034 --> 00:06:19.880
resistor ratio, there's
two resistor ratios here,

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.654
that are participating in the answer.

00:06:22.654 --> 00:06:25.033
So it helps to do a little
special case of this.

00:06:25.033 --> 00:06:27.067
Let's let all the resistors be the same.

00:06:27.067 --> 00:06:28.373
So we'll say that

00:06:28.373 --> 00:06:29.373
RA equals RB

00:06:31.501 --> 00:06:32.334
equals RF.

00:06:33.178 --> 00:06:35.521
And just to pick a real
number we'll just say

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:38.104
they're all equal to 10 K ohms.

00:06:39.076 --> 00:06:40.956
And let's see what this becomes now.

00:06:40.956 --> 00:06:42.373
Now we have V out

00:06:43.625 --> 00:06:46.449
equals, we still have the negative sign.

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.698
So this is some sort of
inversion going on here.

00:06:48.698 --> 00:06:50.996
RF over RA is one.

00:06:50.996 --> 00:06:53.124
So it's just VA.

00:06:53.124 --> 00:06:54.957
And RF over RB is one.

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:57.399
So this says

00:06:58.778 --> 00:06:59.611
VB.

00:07:01.885 --> 00:07:04.157
So this is what gives us the nickname

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:05.189
for this expression

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:06.606
which is called a

00:07:08.331 --> 00:07:09.164
a summing

00:07:12.125 --> 00:07:12.958
op-amp.

00:07:20.258 --> 00:07:22.263
Let's say I want to use my summing op-amp

00:07:22.263 --> 00:07:25.671
in an application where what I want is

00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:27.754
I want V out to equal say

00:07:29.305 --> 00:07:30.805
minus two times VA

00:07:33.332 --> 00:07:34.999
plus three times VB.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.331
Okay, this is what I want.

00:07:39.331 --> 00:07:41.150
How do I do that?

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.336
So, these two coefficients here are

00:07:43.336 --> 00:07:45.674
functions of the resistor values.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:48.565
That was our original expression up here.

00:07:48.565 --> 00:07:50.787
So what I want is

00:07:50.787 --> 00:07:51.620
RF over RA

00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:55.551
to equal two.

00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:56.634
And I want RF

00:07:58.787 --> 00:07:59.620
over RB

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:01.864
to equal three.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:05.173
So I can pick values

00:08:05.173 --> 00:08:06.691
it's the same RF

00:08:06.691 --> 00:08:09.695
and so I get to adjust RA and RB in here.

00:08:09.695 --> 00:08:12.031
So I can pick component values.

00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:13.031
So if I pick

00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:15.563
RF equals 12 K ohms.

00:08:19.919 --> 00:08:21.932
Then I can pick

00:08:21.932 --> 00:08:23.265
RA equals six K.

00:08:26.287 --> 00:08:27.120
And RB

00:08:29.063 --> 00:08:30.230
equals four K.

00:08:33.097 --> 00:08:34.879
And that would give me the ratios I want

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:36.496
and that would implement

00:08:36.496 --> 00:08:37.615
this function here.

00:08:37.615 --> 00:08:39.087
So I'm gonna go fill those out

00:08:39.087 --> 00:08:40.491
on the top schematic.

00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:43.156
We'll just write those in.

00:08:43.156 --> 00:08:44.589
And we'll go fill these in here.

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:47.256
So what we said was RF was 12 K.

00:08:50.104 --> 00:08:51.604
RA was six K ohms.

00:08:53.894 --> 00:08:55.894
RB would be four K ohms.

00:08:58.794 --> 00:09:00.257
And we've designed a circuit

00:09:00.257 --> 00:09:02.785
that implements our summing function.

00:09:02.785 --> 00:09:06.618
So, so this is a pretty
useful op-amp circuit.
