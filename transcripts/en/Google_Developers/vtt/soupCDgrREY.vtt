00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.650
BORIS SMUS: Cool.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.193
So, hey everyone that's
listening.

00:00:04.193 --> 00:00:05.890
We have no idea who is.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.670
This is fantastic.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.360
But welcome.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.020
This is the first official
Chrome developer hangout.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.630
And today's topic is Chrome for
Android Beta, which, as

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.440
you may or may not know,
we launched last week.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.840
So maybe we'll go around
the table.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.510
We have a few guests here.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.130
And we'll do some
introductions.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.590
So Marcos.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:28.840
MARCOS: Hello, I'm Marcos.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.060
I'm working in the Google
London office.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.525
And I'm here for a
couple of weeks.

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:35.360
Nice to see you everybody.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.393
BORIS SMUS: Peter.

00:00:36.393 --> 00:00:37.675
PETER BEVERLOO: My name
is Peter Beverloo.

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:40.230
I'm a software engineer on
the Google Chrome team,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.240
also based in London.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.615
And I'll be here to
answer questions.

00:00:45.615 --> 00:00:47.180
JOHN: I'm John [? Uffenbeck. ?]

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.660
And I'm also here from
the London office.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:01:00.490
I've mainly been working on
various JavaScript APIs with a

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.402
support team.

00:01:02.402 --> 00:01:04.950
BORIS SMUS: And I'm Boris Smus,
an engineer for Chrome

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.780
developer relations, based
here in Mountain View.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.330
My focus has been on
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.460
So I guess we'll start off.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.090
Just as an intro, we
launched last week.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.312
And the current state of affairs
is it's Ice Cream

00:01:21.312 --> 00:01:22.470
Sandwich only.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.770
So you can get into the market
but only if you have an Ice

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.440
Cream Sandwich device.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.520
And it's only launched
in some countries.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.790
And we're working hard
to expand that list.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.610
So I think I'll start off with
just giving you a quick

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.500
overview of some of
the user features.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.770
Hopefully you can see
this phone here.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.980
So I'll unlock it.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.350
And this is the basic interface

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.250
of Chrome for Android.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.530
You can see we've completely
redesigned the UI to suit the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.870
mobile form factor.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.620
But essentially it's the same
Chrome experience on your

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.870
Android device.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.960
One of the key integrations
here is that we have sync

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.750
enabled in Chrome for Android.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.450
And that brings your Chrome
bookmarks, Chrome history, and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.750
tab sync to your
Android device.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.550
Just as a quick illustration
here.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.235
I can see the same recent viewed
page as on the desktop.

00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:25.865
And this is all synchronized.

00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:29.500
I can see my bookmarks, again
also synchronized.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.210
And this is a new feature,
tab sync.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.970
And here this is a list of both
machines that are logged

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.350
into my account.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.080
And I can see all the open tabs
from the last sync that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.780
happened on those machines.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.830
That's sort of the functionality
you get from

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.550
Chrome sync.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.200
One of the most important
features of Chrome though is

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.450
speed, right?

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.450
The engine team has put in a lot
of effort to make this a

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.180
truly fast browsing
experience.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.850
And one of the great things here
is we have pre-rendering.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:16.750
So if I go to start typing a URL
in the Omnibox, set to the

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.510
New York Times, and visit
that, then loading is

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.780
accelerated by pre-caching while
I'm typing, so that when

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.270
we actually load the page,
it's immediately loaded.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.410
And when the page is actually
rendered, you can see

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.840
scrolling is very
performant here.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.900
So as I'm sure these guys will
tell you, the last three or so

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.230
months have been largely
spent on getting this

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.830
to 60 frames a second.

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.990
And they've done a great job.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.330
So this is really
great to see.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.150
Let's see.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.750
Also we have this tab
management UI.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.770
And it supports a
whole bunch of--

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.970
you can have a lot
of tabs open.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.770
I don't even know if
there's a limit.

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.490
Maybe there is.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.510
But the great thing that Chrome
does to make this

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.650
happen is it's very aggressive
about storing inactive tabs,

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.210
essentially saving them to--

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.470
like swapping the amount of
memory and only keeping one or

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.010
two active tabs in
the program.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.150
So this makes the experience
very fast even if you have a

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.400
lot of tabs open.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.630
But I must say, my favorite
feature, as a web developer,

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.510
remote debugging.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.080
So I'll quickly give you a run
through of how this looks.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.160
So I guess I should screen share
at this point, yeah?

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.410
OK, I'll screen share.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.470
And my screen share is
not showing up here.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.470
So the way you can get this
going is you run this command

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:05.640
to forward the port.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.140
First, I have my device
obviously

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.945
plugged in through USB.

00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:10.810
Run the command.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.450
And then this will enable
forwarding.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.070
And you then need to enable the
feature of the switch back

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.490
to the camera here.

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.890
You need to enable
remote debugging

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:27.480
inside Chrome for Android.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.000
And here it's already enabled.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.445
And at this point I can
go back to my browser.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.380
I'll just share my Chrome
Window here.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.490
Whoa.

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.428
Hope you like that one.

00:05:46.428 --> 00:05:47.172
PETER BEVERLOO: And that's
all from the

00:05:47.172 --> 00:05:48.940
developer tools right?

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.912
That's amazing.

00:05:49.912 --> 00:05:52.340
BORIS SMUS: You get this
inception view.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:54.330
PETER BEVERLOO: We need
to go deeper.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.655
BORIS SMUS: So hopefully
people can see this.

00:05:56.655 --> 00:06:00.670
I'll just hit local host on the
port that I forward it to.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:07.640
And here we now have a list of
all the open tabs in Chrome.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.440
At this point I can go
into any of these

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.980
tabs and inspect them.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.890
And here I have full access to
the Chrome developer tools.

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.400
I wish I could show you both
screens at once, but--

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.540
whoa, here we go again.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.380
Anyway, you can see I
can inspect pages.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.580
And when I select this element,
the same hover effect

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.880
happens in Chrome for Android.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.790
So let me just, I'll do an
alert in the JavaScript

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:48.920
console, and switch cameras
and then prove to you that

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.170
this is actually working.

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:54.980
So there's my alert.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.500
And this is great.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.660
So you can pull the instrument,
your Android

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:04.720
browser, and get everything you
need as if you're actually

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:10.300
running a mobile website on
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.120
JOHN: Boris, if you slide
through the elements on the

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:16.330
HTML, you should be able
to see them go blue.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.980
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:18.360
JOHN: I think that's a
really cool feature.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:18.900
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, for sure.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.460
It's a great feature.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:20.880
I would love to show it.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.140
The thing is I can't
figure out a way

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.500
right now to show both.

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:27.750
JOHN: Scroll on down.

00:07:30.164 --> 00:07:32.110
Scroll on.

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.370
Why don't you try scrolling on
the laptop, and we can see as

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.394
things sort of get highlighted
on the Android phone.

00:07:40.394 --> 00:07:42.910
BORIS SMUS: OK, I'll try this.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.390
So you can guys can see, I'm
scrolling now on the laptop.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.190
You can't see me scrolling, but
you can certainly see the

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.670
highlights.

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:55.400
So a very, very handy feature.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.380
OK, so as far as other HTML 5
features go, I've got some

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.790
basic demos here just to give
you a sense of what the

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:06.040
platform is capable of.

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:13.280
First method fixed positioning
and overflow scrolling.

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.790
This is a pretty common pattern
in a lot of mobile web

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.620
user interfaces.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.020
Here you can see a really
simple test page.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.430
I've got a header
and a footer.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.740
And they're fixed, whereas the
middle section is scrolling.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:32.280
So here this is implemented--

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:35.690
the header is implemented
with the position fixed.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:37.500
Same with the footer.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.260
And then the middle section,
this div element, has like an

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.650
overflow scroll or overflow
auto maybe on it.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.780
So this just gives you this
native like experience.

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:53.490
And you'll notice also that if
I scroll and let go, I get

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:57.690
this inertial feel, which is the
same as what you'd expect

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:59.310
in the native application.

00:09:03.054 --> 00:09:03.530
Let's see.

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.880
Flexbox Model.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.660
Maybe you guys can talk a little
bit about Flexbox.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.760
But basically, we have support
for the first version of

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.170
Flexbox, not yet the second.

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.390
But this spec is pretty neat.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.530
PETER BEVERLOO: The Flexbox
Model basically allows you to

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:30.950
do a much more declarative way
of defining the shape of your

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:35.220
layouts, thinking more in terms
of objects which you can

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.290
rearrange using CSS, position
the scale using CSS instead of

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:44.630
fixed width or even
percentage-based widths.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:48.670
And it basically allows you to
create complex layouts, update

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.410
them really easily with much
less effort than before.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.530
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, like, for
example, this one here.

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:01.590
There's a Flexbox indicated in
the top level that says, I

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.450
want a vertical flow
from header to this

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.010
middle section to footer.

00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:06.990
And in the middle section,
there's a new method for the

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.600
horizontal flow saying,
go from nav

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.850
to content to sidebar.

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.140
So instead of doing things
like CSS [? slopes ?]

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:17.000
and then worrying about clear
fixes, you can just implement

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:17.800
things declaratively.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.896
And the markup here
is beautiful.

00:10:20.896 --> 00:10:22.080
It's very simple.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.884
It's clear and very
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.700
OK.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:31.990
Oh yes, my favorite,
so multi-touch.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.390
We've come a long way here.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:42.160
Android Gingerbread
had a lot of--

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.590
MALE SPEAKER: Can you
move it up a little?

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:44.370
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.270
Sorry.

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.580
So Gingerbread had a lot
of multi-touch issues.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:50.430
It supported single-touch
very well.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:54.070
But this is the Android
browser.

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.180
But there were definitely
issues with

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:57.890
tracking multiple fingers.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.600
So this is just an example of
a game here that pretty much

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.230
relies on multi-touch.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:07.260
Because one finger controls
the motion, the

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:08.655
direction of my chip.

00:11:08.655 --> 00:11:16.870
The other finger is like
a shoot button.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:17.925
This is a nice demo.

00:11:17.925 --> 00:11:20.880
It's by a guy named
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.495
from--

00:11:21.495 --> 00:11:22.650
I think he's from
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:11:22.650 --> 00:11:23.904
MALE SPEAKER: I think
he's from Brighton.

00:11:23.904 --> 00:11:24.322
BORIS SMUS: Brighton?

00:11:24.322 --> 00:11:25.160
Yeah.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.290
Anyway he made this cool demo.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.777
So this is what I do know.

00:11:29.777 --> 00:11:33.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.730
We have good multi-touch
support,

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.520
tracking multiple fingers.

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:40.710
I've tried it for, like,
five or six.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:42.826
I'm sure we can do more.

00:11:42.826 --> 00:11:44.076
It's good.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.980
Oh, and we've also made great
leaps in hover acceleration.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:57.880
So Canvas is now a
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.150
And this is partly due to Ice
Cream Sandwich's native

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.930
hardware acceleration support.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:07.200
So now we do very well on
benchmarks like these.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.660
This is a speed-reading
benchmark from the IE team.

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.800
Essentially what this does is it
just flips through a bunch

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.010
of letters.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:21.680
And you can see we're getting,
like, nearly 60 frames here,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.350
which is pretty much on
par for my testing.

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:28.350
It's like
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.950
So we've done huge progress
in the last three

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.740
months of hard work.

00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:37.160
So this is super exciting,
because now you can start

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:43.380
building very rich, dynamic
experiences on your device.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.620
Yeah, so, I don't know.

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.486
Are there any questions
that people have yet?

00:12:50.486 --> 00:12:53.940
Maybe we can talk about
something that they're

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.890
interested in before
we jump into more.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:00.236
PETE: Uh, are there other ways
for people to try Chrome for

00:13:00.236 --> 00:13:03.900
Android if they don't have an
Ice Cream Sandwich device?

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:09.290
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, so I believe
there may be unofficial ways.

00:13:09.290 --> 00:13:12.710
But I don't really know.

00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:14.490
I haven't really tried.

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.928
So you're on your own.

00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:21.970
PETE: Um, and then the other
question is just to confirm

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.380
that you need the Android
emulator installed on your

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.490
machine to use the
debug features.

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:31.176
BORIS SMUS: I don't really think
you need think you need

00:13:31.176 --> 00:13:31.400
the emulator.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:31.810
MARCOS: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.310
You need, basically,
just the [? DB2 ?]

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:36.710
which is the thing
that connects.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.595
And then the important thing
that, I think we just briefly

00:13:39.595 --> 00:13:42.580
passed this up, the
Chrome side of it,

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:43.640
you don't need anything.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.535
It's just the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:13:46.535 --> 00:13:48.080
developer tools in there.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.810
So there's nothing special on
the developer side, so you

00:13:51.810 --> 00:13:54.090
should be able to use all the
tools that you are already

00:13:54.090 --> 00:13:56.410
familiar with.

00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:59.450
PETER BEVERLOO: [? A DB ?] is
part of the Android SDK.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.660
So it should be fairly easy
to find and install.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.000
PETE: So that's the end of the
questions for now, but I'm

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.360
sure we'll get more
as we progress.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:17.250
BORIS SMUS: Cool, sounds good.

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.135
So maybe we can just chat about
more on the engineering

00:14:20.135 --> 00:14:21.450
side of things.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:24.270
Like what were some of
the big challenges?

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:27.040
We talked a bit about GPU.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.290
PETER BEVERLOO: Obviously a
phone, in terms of hardware,

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.810
is completely different from
a desktop machine.

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:37.680
It's much more limited in terms
of available memory.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:40.570
It has a lot less CPU power.

00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:42.590
The memory bandwidth
is different.

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:46.180
And Chrome has this multiple
process architecture,

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.830
separating the browser and the
renderer in several different

00:14:49.830 --> 00:14:53.470
processes for various
reasons, which

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.070
made this a real challenge.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.300
The multiple process model is
something we did implement in

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:00.550
Chrome in Androids.

00:15:04.810 --> 00:15:09.970
It does work fine, but in terms
of resources on the

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.480
mobile phone, that did impose
some really interesting

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:14.620
challenges.

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:18.380
Another thing which we ran into
is the readability of

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.560
text and websites.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:23.535
Obviously the hardware for a
mobile phone and Android

00:15:23.535 --> 00:15:28.210
device is much smaller than
your computer's monitor.

00:15:28.210 --> 00:15:30.930
And in that sense websites
will load in

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.170
the zoomed out way.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:36.400
In order to compensate for that,
we've come up with a

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.600
technique that's called
Font Boosting.

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.700
And Font Boosting basically is
a way to increase a text size

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:48.730
for important parts of a web
page to make sure that you can

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.250
read them regardless
of the zoom level.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.450
We already talked about GPU
acceleration on the phone, and

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:58.700
then the tablet as
well, of course.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:05.360
Part of that allowed
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.410
Chrome GPU team to implement
incredibly well multiple

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:15.110
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], which
separates scrolling from

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:17.820
actual rendering, which is one
of the main things which

00:16:17.820 --> 00:16:21.810
allowed us to achieve 60 frames
per second scrolling

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:26.000
and fixed position elements
on pages in a smooth

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.355
and workable way.

00:16:28.355 --> 00:16:32.210
BORIS SMUS: Is there something
people need to be aware of to

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:34.500
make their sites more
accessible for

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:35.570
Font Boosting purposes?

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:38.070
Or is this just something
that comes free?

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:39.970
PETER BEVERLOO: Font Boosting
comes for free.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:44.440
And there are a number of
heuristics which decide which

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.160
areas of the page need
to be boosted.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.570
There is not really a menu
about it so far.

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.210
But the algorithm is still
under development.

00:16:57.210 --> 00:17:00.650
We're still making many
improvements.

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:04.516
And so there still are a number
of changes underway.

00:17:04.516 --> 00:17:06.408
BORIS SMUS: Cool, good.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:13.119
Yeah, so I guess that's sort
of relates to your talking

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.619
about basically rendering
of sites that aren't

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:17.690
designed for mobile.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.490
PETER BEVERLOO: Uh huh.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:22.319
BORIS SMUS: But what about some
of the strategies for

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:25.500
making your site more responsive
for mobile, is this

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.756
something we support as well?

00:17:26.756 --> 00:17:28.089
PETER BEVERLOO: Yeah.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:31.800
Transit has been quite popular
over the past few years.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:34.440
It's implementing response
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:38.831
for a website, for example
using media queries.

00:17:38.831 --> 00:17:41.380
Media queries are something
Chrome and Android support,

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:44.790
both on Android phones and
on Android tablets.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.270
And it basically allows you to
provide a good, clean way of

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:53.560
targeting a certain subset
of [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.140
to certain devices, allowing
you to optimize the website

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:03.490
more for, say, a tablet or an
Android phone, and making it

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:06.170
more readable without having to
depend on [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.860
BORIS SMUS: So you can do that
with both CSS, with media

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:16.220
queries in [? text, ?]

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.570
or you do it in JavaScript,
right?

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:23.690
PETER BEVERLOO: There is
JavaScript API to actually

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:27.790
listen to media queries, and
actually listen to changes in

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:29.230
media queries as well.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:32.170
And it allows you to have
JavaScript events listening

00:18:32.170 --> 00:18:33.950
to, for example, an orientation
change.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.160
BORIS SMUS: And the
standard-- sorry.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.120
The standard thing is you
would just usually have

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:46.710
division points based on the
size of your device.

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:50.550
Remember we just walked through
the other styles.

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:52.120
PETER BEVERLOO: Generally
that's the case.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.680
Of course, depending on the
browsers you may target, it's

00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.295
also a solution to have a rough
size estimate for phone

00:19:01.295 --> 00:19:04.080
layouts, tablet layouts, and
desktop layouts using

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.350
percentages for widths, which
allows just slightly more

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.980
flexibility over the Android
phones which might be used to

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:12.781
visit your website.

00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:13.252
BORIS SMUS: Mm Hm.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.140
Cool.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:16.060
MARCOS: Sorry.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:19.520
One thing that I was going to
mention is that we are very

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.010
data-driven with the
developer tools.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.730
It's a real game changer,
because now we can actually

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:32.630
see what's going on and optimize
real deep the overall

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:36.570
experience and use the same
tools to get our data and the

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.010
performance data, and
then investigate and

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:42.000
inspect all the page.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.629
The development side of it,
it's a real game changer.

00:19:45.629 --> 00:19:50.097
I think it's a really cool tool
to optimize further using

00:19:50.097 --> 00:19:52.990
all of this technology
we just mentioned.

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:54.400
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:56.750
PETE: A couple of questions
from folks who are reading

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:58.214
questions in the comments.

00:19:58.214 --> 00:20:00.895
Are you going to talk about some
of the new input fields

00:20:00.895 --> 00:20:02.810
and native behaviors
like [? Apex, ?] or

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:03.860
anything like that?

00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:07.115
BORIS SMUS: Oh yeah, sure,
we can talk about that.

00:20:07.115 --> 00:20:12.770
Yeah, this is a pretty often
requested feature.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.950
The back story here is--

00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:19.080
let's see, I have the
forms list here.

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.120
The input tag can have a bunch
of different types.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.790
There's text inputs.

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:31.150
Here is just a regular text
input and various other kinds.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:35.270
In mobile browsers, typically,
at least in IOS and other

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:38.770
platforms, you've had this
customization based on the

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.100
type of input.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.826
So in the password field--

00:20:42.826 --> 00:20:43.505
that's a bad example.

00:20:43.505 --> 00:20:47.850
In the telephone field, your
keyboard now switches to a

00:20:47.850 --> 00:20:52.220
number pad, because telephones
are numeric.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:56.320
But there's also this class of
input fields that are date

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.790
related, date/time related.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:21:00.630
So here there's a date/time
picker.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.610
And you can see when I
click it, we get the

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.200
native Android control.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.750
Similar for months and
weeks and times.

00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:14.600
This is all new in Chrome
for Android.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.180
And we support it.

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.890
You see a whole bunch of
other kinds of inputs.

00:21:19.890 --> 00:21:21.790
Does that answer the
question there?

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.200
PETE: Yeah, I think
that answers the

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:24.215
question quite well.

00:21:24.215 --> 00:21:24.800
BORIS SMUS: Great.

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.581
PETE: One of the other questions
that came up is what

00:21:28.581 --> 00:21:30.400
about the UA string?

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.830
Are there any modifications
to that?

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:34.127
What is the UA string today?

00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:36.929
And what do developers
know about that?

00:21:36.929 --> 00:21:38.730
BORIS SMUS: Anyone
want to get this?

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.450
I can talk about
it too I think.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:41.320
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.290
BORIS SMUS: OK.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.640
Let me just, actually, open up
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE] here.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:57.140
So we have a code site,
code.google.com/chrome/mobile.

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.450
And if you go there, then
there's an FAQ section.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:04.100
And I'm not sharing this
screen, I think.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.350
Let me do that.

00:22:07.532 --> 00:22:10.340
Screen share.

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.560
Whoa.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.930
Inception notice.

00:22:13.930 --> 00:22:18.990
OK, so we have a user agent.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:22.280
So this is all pretty
well documented.

00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.490
Hopefully you can see this.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.060
Basically we support--

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.910
there's a tablet version and
a mobile phone version.

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:37.360
So here is the UA string or
the mobile phone version.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.630
This is pretty much public
information.

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:44.270
And I guess the key feature
here is the CRMO.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.840
So if you're doing UA sniffing
and you want to detect Chrome

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.130
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] specifically,
I guess this is

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:53.150
what you would get.

00:22:53.150 --> 00:22:57.430
I mean, we can talk about best
practices and the pitfalls of

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:58.330
UA sniffing, etc.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.390
JOHN: Of course, future
detection is much better.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:02.360
BORIS SMUS: Correct.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.800
So using things like
Modernizr--

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.700
we'll just open that up--

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.240
is generally the thing
that we at Chrome

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.330
developer relations recommend.

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.110
So this thing, instead of
looking at user agent strings,

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.700
you can detect based on the
actual functionality that your

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:24.070
browser provides and
include or not

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:25.320
include various features.

00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:30.415
PETE: Cool.

00:23:30.415 --> 00:23:34.750
We got a couple others
that came in.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:37.540
What about the web RTC
camera APIs, are they

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.670
accessible right now?

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:42.462
It says they're supported in the
docks, but Mark was saying

00:23:42.462 --> 00:23:45.210
he was having some trouble
accessing them with his code.

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:48.840
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, so web RTC
is not currently supported.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:54.150
The thing we do support
is this Android

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.030
browser style camera.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:59.960
So basically there's
a way to--

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.490
this is a quick demo
of that in action.

00:24:02.490 --> 00:24:06.280
And the thing that's happening
here is there's an input box.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.190
And it's got a--

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.700
I think it's like--

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:10.950
[INTERPOSING  VOICES]

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:14.670
PETER BEVERLOO: It's
actually--

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:20.150
we have implemented
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.560
API.

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.820
A link to that you can find
on chrome.google.co

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:25.070
m/chrome/mobile.

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:33.330
And part of that API allows you
to use an input type file

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:37.840
element, which you get your
attribute which allows you to

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:43.016
toggle between video or steady
image save photo input.

00:24:43.016 --> 00:24:47.820
BORIS SMUS: So if I click
here, this should

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.411
essentially pick the--

00:24:50.411 --> 00:24:53.120
it forces the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.200
to open the camera,
essentially.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.320
And then this particular demo,
I'll quickly take a

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.190
picture of my face.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:04.880
And there's a picture
of my face.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.531
And then I'll OK it.

00:25:07.531 --> 00:25:10.790
And we have demo effect.

00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:12.700
Sorry guys, let's
try that again.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.800
I swear it worked before.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:23.480
So the point of this demo is it
will take my face and put a

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:26.620
panda face on top of
my face instead.

00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:29.675
Hopefully this works.

00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:30.998
So there you go.

00:25:30.998 --> 00:25:31.934
My face is now pandafied.

00:25:31.934 --> 00:25:34.750
And you can check it out.

00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:38.106
Well, this is the URL.

00:25:38.106 --> 00:25:39.600
Oh, it's out of focus.

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.270
But anyway, it's out there.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:44.106
So hope that answers
your question.

00:25:44.106 --> 00:25:46.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:49.730
Anything else there Pete?

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.895
PETE: Why don't you move on to
some of the next things, and

00:25:51.895 --> 00:25:54.330
we'll come back to some of
the next ones shortly.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:56.250
BORIS SMUS: Sure, sounds good.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:57.680
So let's talk about--

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.110
I'll find some [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.720
Maybe you just want to like--

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.890
JOHN: Yeah, sure.

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:07.220
So we support all the off-line

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:11.580
technologies that Chrome supports.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:16.090
And that's file API, the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:26:16.090 --> 00:26:20.230
XTP, web SQL, section storage,
local storage.

00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:23.320
So it's all there.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:29.760
And you can manage that in the
user interface as well and

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.170
clear out the storage as well.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:35.620
BORIS SMUS: So like,
how do you--

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:35.895
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:26:35.895 --> 00:26:37.120
JOHN: You go into
Settings and--

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.822
BORIS SMUS: Oh, OK.

00:26:39.822 --> 00:26:40.780
Cool.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:42.440
JOHN: It's a much more coarsely

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.040
grain than the desktop.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:51.170
But you don't have a lot of
space user interface wise.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.765
But it's possible to create
storage, and see which sites

00:26:54.765 --> 00:26:57.050
are using how much
data and so on.

00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:57.996
BORIS SMUS: Oh, cool.

00:26:57.996 --> 00:26:59.470
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.190
JOHN: Yeah.

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:00.630
BORIS SMUS: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]?

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:01.860
JOHN: Yeah, that's
exactly it, yeah.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:02.770
BORIS SMUS: Oh, sweet.

00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:04.850
JOHN: So there you are.

00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:08.140
That icon on the right,
there, is--

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:11.170
so yeah, you can see it up.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:14.400
Some of those sites are
losing a bit of data.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.540
BORIS SMUS: And this
means geolocation?

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.790
JOHN: Right, right.

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.480
BORIS SMUS: So that means you're
granted access for that

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.340
site to access your
geolocation?

00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:22.550
JOHN: Exactly, exactly.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:24.010
BORIS SMUS: Oh wow, this
is really cool.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.280
I didn't know about this.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.860
JOHN: So, yeah.

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:35.226
All the storage APIs are there,
and are good to go.

00:27:35.226 --> 00:27:37.710
BORIS SMUS: And we also have
app cache support right?

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:38.580
JOHN: Right, right.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.902
App cache also.

00:27:40.902 --> 00:27:42.690
And [UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE]

00:27:46.412 --> 00:27:50.780
Gmail and calendar
applications.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:53.550
BORIS SMUS: Oh, and by the
way, we do have cache--

00:27:53.550 --> 00:27:55.490
I believe we have app
cache internals

00:27:55.490 --> 00:27:57.630
available here as well.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:27:59.522
Like if you want to clear
an app cache.

00:27:59.522 --> 00:28:00.440
Do you know?

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.400
JOHN: Um, we should have
some available.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:02.925
BORIS SMUS: Yeah OK.

00:28:02.925 --> 00:28:05.450
It's kind of unstable.

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:08.130
All right, anyway.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.315
Basically there's two things
you want to do with a

00:28:10.315 --> 00:28:10.650
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], right?

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:12.912
You want to store assets.

00:28:12.912 --> 00:28:15.280
Or you want to store data.

00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:17.000
So there's a whole bunch of--

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.840
we pretty much support
the whole thing?

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.096
JOHN: The whole thing.

00:28:20.096 --> 00:28:20.582
Yeah.

00:28:20.582 --> 00:28:22.210
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:23.450
BORIS SMUS: So, read
and write?

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:23.820
JOHN: Yeah.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.405
MARCOS: Yeah.

00:28:25.405 --> 00:28:26.430
Awesome.

00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:30.040
PETER BEVERLOO: And, of course,
file system API, which

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:33.428
allows you to go even further.

00:28:33.428 --> 00:28:35.420
BORIS SMUS: Cool.

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.930
JOHN: So there is also one
aspect which we'd like to

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:46.490
improve in the future, which
is working pretty well

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.660
already, is to input
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:54.970
file, so you can upload files
from your own device.

00:28:54.970 --> 00:28:58.660
And one of the things I would
like to support in the future

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:03.820
is uploading your own files,
like your Picassa web images

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.780
and things like that.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:06.410
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:29:06.410 --> 00:29:10.690
files, but it's on the
radar at some point.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:12.770
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:13.330
BORIS SMUS: Cool.

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:14.580
Sounds like an awesome
feature.

00:29:17.236 --> 00:29:19.440
Let's see.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.410
Any pressing questions?

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:21.980
Or should we carry on here?

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:24.470
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:28.450
BORIS SMUS: One of the things
that we now include for

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:33.070
game-type applications or
experiences with rich

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.160
interactive elements
is a request

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.320
animation frame, right?

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:39.080
So this is one of the first
mobile browsers to support

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:39.720
this feature.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.730
And do you want to talk
a bit about it?

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:42.060
PETER BEVERLOO: Sure.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:46.930
Request animation frame is
basically a relatively new API

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:53.350
which allows you to instead of
using a JavaScript timer or a

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.250
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.390
to trigger renderings or
change [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:02.200
for, say, CSS animations or
Canvas elements, it allows you

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:06.490
to ask the browser to decide
the best possible moment to

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.860
open a new draw for you.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.150
That has a number of benefits.

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:15.465
For example, it allows the
browser to inform your web

00:30:15.465 --> 00:30:18.220
page that it's currently on the
background, so not usable

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:19.210
to the end user.

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:22.600
And especially on the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] with limited

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:28.650
battery and limited CPU usage,
you don't want to see it on

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:31.810
the website and have another
website on the background

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:37.390
create all these awesome,
3-dimensional effects.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:41.696
I don't know what API, which
is making everything slow.

00:30:41.696 --> 00:30:44.770
And using the request animation
frame can actually

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:48.470
help you in saving battery
power and increasing

00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:50.360
performance.

00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:54.595
For example the GP accelerated
Canvas users.

00:30:54.595 --> 00:30:55.670
BORIS SMUS: Cool.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:56.720
Yeah.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.560
Actually you reminded me
of a thing that I'd

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:00.080
like to show here.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.690
You said 3D stuff,
cool 3D stuff.

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:06.990
So there is a quick demo that
I'd just like to show.

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.763
This is not Canvas.

00:31:07.763 --> 00:31:09.690
This is CSS animation.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.970
But just to give you a
sense of the sorts of

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:14.020
things you can do.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:17.360
This is just using CSS
animations, no JavaScript at

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.810
all, just key frames.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.010
And it's pretty much running
very smooth.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:24.030
I don't know if the stream
is good enough to tell.

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:27.710
But I think it's like 30, 60,
somewhere in between, frames

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.060
per second.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.390
So this is really cool.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:33.890
It opens up a whole world of
possibilities for developers.

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.210
PETER BEVERLOO: And the sites,
the CSS animation, are

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:37.890
actually animating it.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:41.520
The 3D pics can be created using
the CSS 3D transforms

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:42.996
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:31:42.996 --> 00:31:45.272
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, as far as
the transitions, right?

00:31:45.272 --> 00:31:46.224
PETER BEVERLOO: Yeah.

00:31:46.224 --> 00:31:47.430
3D transitions here.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.590
But you could also
use transitions.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:52.760
There are a number of websites
which have, for example, a

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.175
tilted menu in 3D space.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.840
BORIS SMUS: Cool.

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.530
So we had a question
I think about--

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:08.680
PETE: Yeah, so Bernard wanted
to know, which countries and

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:13.800
devices are supported with
Chrome for Android?

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:15.120
BORIS SMUS: Countries,
I think there's a

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.570
list probably on our--

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.400
the Chrome consumer site?

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:25.810
PETER BEVERLOO: Yeah, there is a
list available on the Chrome

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.510
help pages on google.com.

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:30.640
PETE: We'll post that
in the comments

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.650
in a couple of minutes.

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:32.795
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, sounds good.

00:32:32.795 --> 00:32:34.550
PETE: And what about
devices or--

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:39.180
BORIS SMUS: Devices, I think
pretty much all the official

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.310
Ice Cream Sandwich devices
support it.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.610
PETER BEVERLOO: Yeah.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:45.930
BORIS SMUS: Which is Galaxy
Nexus, Nexus S, and the Zoom

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:46.910
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:51.750
PETER BEVERLOO: Yeah, and new
devices which will be updated

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.557
to Ice Cream Sandwich should
also come with the ability to

00:32:55.557 --> 00:32:57.760
install Chrome.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.760
MARCOS: And one thing to
remember is that we literally

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.860
just launched this, this
last week or last week.

00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:06.420
We're going to expand this.

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.840
It's on our radar to expand.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.730
But a little patience
just because

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:12.463
we really just released.

00:33:12.463 --> 00:33:14.640
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, it's
been nine days.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.320
MARCOS: Exciting, very
exciting things.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:20.180
It's a baby.

00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:21.430
It's just born.

00:33:24.090 --> 00:33:25.610
BORIS SMUS: Anything
else there Pete?

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:27.490
PETE: No, that's it for now.

00:33:27.490 --> 00:33:31.170
But keep your questions coming
in the comments on the

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:35.580
pro-developers page, and we'll
keep going from there.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:37.390
BORIS SMUS: Cool.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:38.900
Let's talk about device APIs.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.720
MARCOS: OK.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.600
BORIS SMUS: What sort of sensor
access do we have in

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.565
Chrome for Android?

00:33:44.565 --> 00:33:48.930
MARCOS: Yeah, so we have
basically the same APIs that

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:51.840
we have on our own
Chrome desktop.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.170
Geolocation we already
had on the Chrome

00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:56.040
desktop for a while.

00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:00.050
And then on the device you can
request for a high accuracy.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.510
And that would turn
on the GPS sensor.

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:05.900
Of course that's if you have
that sensor on the device.

00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:08.820
And then you have far
greater accuracy on

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.120
the geolocation position.

00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.010
And then another cool thing
is the device orientation.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:19.230
So we implemented on desktop
first. And it was kind of

00:34:19.230 --> 00:34:22.949
tough to test, because we
tested on notebook.

00:34:22.949 --> 00:34:25.560
And it doesn't make much
sense for you to turn

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.787
your notebook around.

00:34:26.787 --> 00:34:30.350
And by then you probably broke
some hard drives just like

00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:32.260
moving things around
and trying to

00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:34.409
see if it was working.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:38.477
It makes far, far more sense in
a real small device that we

00:34:38.477 --> 00:34:41.880
can literally turn around and
move around, and see where

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:44.550
you're heading to and your
bearings and everything.

00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.330
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:50.199
MARCOS: So all this device APIs
are available for Android

00:34:50.199 --> 00:34:55.560
and exactly the same for
desktop, only more useful.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.110
BORIS SMUS: There's
a cool demo.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.660
MARCOS: Let me show that one.

00:34:58.660 --> 00:34:59.920
Just one second.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:06.360
So this is a cool demo.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:07.580
There you go.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:11.140
So this is like a compass.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:13.210
And using device orientation.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:16.550
I don't think so.

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:20.110
And then, yeah, you can see
where North is just using

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.280
device orientation.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.380
Here, try to move around.

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.230
So this is a great
little demo.

00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:30.580
I just found out like five
minutes before I came in.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.700
But it's really cool.

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:33.220
And it shows all the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:34.540
of the device.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:37.520
And it's so much nicer
to do this on my

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.540
phone than my desktop.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:39.790
BORIS SMUS: Right.

00:35:42.568 --> 00:35:43.464
MARCOS: Oh, sorry.

00:35:43.464 --> 00:35:45.940
BORIS SMUS: No problem.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:48.490
Cool.

00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:52.670
And then we also talked about
already, basic camera access.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:57.250
So that's what we have today.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.150
We'll see about the future.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:02.710
OK.

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.870
Oh yeah, wait.

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:09.500
I was going to show a
demo in a tablet.

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.069
But I forgot that.

00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:12.400
OK.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.490
Can't do that one.

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:16.370
Let's see.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:19.450
What else did we have?

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:19.800
Right.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.200
So maybe just small things for
developers to think about when

00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:27.530
they build mobile web apps,
mobile websites or

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:28.540
experiences.

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.570
So I guess the first thing
that comes to mind is

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:33.250
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:35.440
considerations.

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:41.350
So the basic idea there is you
want to be able to specify

00:36:41.350 --> 00:36:43.180
which part of the screen
to show up on the

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:44.610
smaller display right?

00:36:44.610 --> 00:36:47.200
Maybe you can elaborate
a little.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.000
PETER BEVERLOO: Well, one of
things to keep in mind, there

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.650
is the meta viewport element,
which is also supported by

00:36:53.650 --> 00:36:54.410
Chrome Android.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:58.840
And it allows you to set
the initial zoom level.

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.625
If you really need to, you can
decide the minimum and the

00:37:01.625 --> 00:37:02.580
maximum zoom levels there.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.320
You could even disable
zooming.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:08.370
Of course, you should only do
that if it's really critical

00:37:08.370 --> 00:37:12.110
for your website to only be
available in your zoom of

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:17.040
choice, especially with
different screen sizes or, for

00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.410
example, make comparison
between Android phones,

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.600
Android tablets that
could end up pretty

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.930
nasty for the end user.

00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:30.660
But using that technique you
can also decide the initial

00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:33.320
width of the viewport, whether
it should be equal to the

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:38.205
space width or basically
a width of your choice.

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:45.350
And together with meta viewport
element and, say,

00:37:45.350 --> 00:37:49.600
media queries and using just
general responsive layout

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:54.480
percentage space widths, you
should be able to also use the

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:58.130
developer tools of course to
quickly get up to speed to

00:37:58.130 --> 00:38:02.584
develop for mobile
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] devices.

00:38:02.584 --> 00:38:04.550
BORIS SMUS: Cool.

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.810
Any other things come to mind
as far as mobile specific

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:09.722
considerations?

00:38:09.722 --> 00:38:13.750
PETER BEVERLOO: Um,
not specifically.

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:14.510
MARCOS: I think [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:16.100
users is one thing.

00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:23.150
Try to avoid type loops or use
request. Yeah, I think that's

00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:24.610
an important consideration.

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:29.380
BORIS SMUS: Cool.

00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:33.290
Maybe let's talk about the dev
tools and maybe some of the

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:37.500
coolest features that you guys
think are most interesting or

00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.100
the mobile focus.

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.730
PETER BEVERLOO: I think one of
the main interesting things to

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.640
witness in the mobile phone is
the developer tools network

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.120
panel, because it allows you
to see the latencies and

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:54.880
basically the loading
performance of the resources

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:58.465
available for mobile websites.

00:38:58.465 --> 00:39:02.600
And especially in terms of
optimizing for mobile

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:06.400
connections in which a route
we're trying to the server, so

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.710
to get in this file is much
more expensive than to

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:13.030
actually get a bigger file.

00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:15.750
It's worth spending on the
network which you're on.

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:17.080
BORIS SMUS: Yeah.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:18.240
PETER BEVERLOO: That can get
real [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:21.400
But I think that the network
panel can give some really

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:24.480
valuable insights.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.590
Besides that, there is, of
course, the resource panel,

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.470
which allows you to see
everything which is being

00:39:28.470 --> 00:39:29.860
loaded on the page.

00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:32.300
You can see the
[UNINTELLIGIBLE], all the

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.330
elements on the page, the
scripting panel for the

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.392
scripts, and modify
them in real time.

00:39:36.392 --> 00:39:38.190
As far as [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:41.170
alerts, model dialogue.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:42.615
BORIS SMUS: Right,
so the resources.

00:39:42.615 --> 00:39:44.670
The resources gives
you a full list of

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:46.420
everything that's loaded.

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.880
PETER BEVERLOO: You can also see
the storage APIs, and the

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.474
various web SQL databases and
[UNINTELLIGIBLE PHRASE].

00:39:56.382 --> 00:39:57.861
BORIS SMUS: This is
right [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:01.312 --> 00:40:02.562
Look at that.

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.410
Very cool.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:13.770
Profiling also is a big deal,
right, for mobile?

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:14.900
MARCOS: Yeah.

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:17.590
BORIS SMUS: Before this was
like very different.

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:18.840
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.760
MARCOS: You have the day time,
you can actually make your

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.700
trade-offs and decisions and
optimize for the real thing

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.330
rather than just wishful
thinking.

00:40:28.330 --> 00:40:31.850
You have concrete tools.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:33.810
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, so you can
get a full breakdown of

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.936
exactly what part of
your app is slow.

00:40:35.936 --> 00:40:37.265
So if I start profiling.

00:40:37.265 --> 00:40:39.190
Let's see if this
actually works.

00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:41.330
Scroll around.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:44.150
We're profiling Google
Maps here.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:46.350
Wow.

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.690
We have a full breakdown here.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.220
Whoa.

00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.680
We get the full line
members as well?

00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.170
MARCOS: Yeah.

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:00.250
BORIS SMUS: The code is
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:04.030
MARCOS: Yeah, [UNINTELLIGIBLE],
but you get

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:08.620
a complete picture
of your profile.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:14.290
BORIS SMUS: Whoa.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:15.460
PETER BEVERLOO: And, of course,
the [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:19.370
profiler there is also the
timeline panel, which allows

00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:22.080
you to get a graph of
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] loading times

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:22.610
and [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:41:22.610 --> 00:41:24.995
times of every familiar page.

00:41:24.995 --> 00:41:26.290
And script execute sometimes.

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.120
And they're really quite
insightful as well.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.750
MARCOS: Yeah.

00:41:30.750 --> 00:41:33.262
BORIS SMUS: Actually going back
to the scripts here, and

00:41:33.262 --> 00:41:34.220
see if this works.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.390
Oh no.

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:38.810
Basically there's this-- one of
my favorite features here

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:43.240
is this pretty print thing.

00:41:43.240 --> 00:41:47.080
It may be a bit ambitious to try
to print this little map

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:47.910
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:41:47.910 --> 00:41:50.824
But we'll see what happens
just for fun.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:57.150
So I pressed the pretty
print button.

00:41:57.150 --> 00:41:59.160
This is going to take a while.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.010
Oh.

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.760
So now we have, like--

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.663
now go ahead and debug
Google Maps.

00:42:06.663 --> 00:42:07.590
You're set.

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:09.750
You can just set a breakpoint
online.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:10.135
Wow.

00:42:10.135 --> 00:42:15.440
We have 9,000 or 10,000 there.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.580
MARCOS: This is pretty cool.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:18.550
BORIS SMUS: Anyway, this is
a [? must ?] feature.

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.720
I mean all of these
things are game

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:23.380
changers for mobile devices.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:27.170
MARCOS: Yeah, not just mobile
but right across the board

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:29.040
this is exactly the same
tools that you

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:30.290
would use on the desktop.

00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:33.040
So you're going to have just one
single, very comfortable

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:35.735
environment to target everything
in the world.

00:42:35.735 --> 00:42:38.360
So that is really very cool.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:41.650
BORIS SMUS: Cool.

00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:43.400
PETE: So, there's a question.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:46.770
Again this is Mark, who's been
a great participant today.

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:47.450
Thanks to Mark.

00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:50.860
He wants to know what the
difference is between how

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.732
elements are rendered in Chrome
for Android and the

00:42:53.732 --> 00:42:55.210
stock Android browser.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:43:00.760
For example he says, I
know Chrome supports

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.700
fixed position elements.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.475
How does that all sort
of fit together?

00:43:06.475 --> 00:43:08.930
PETER BEVERLOO: Of course the
Android browser and Chrome in

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:13.190
Android both share the WebKit
rendering engine.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:19.050
But besides sharing, WebKit
basically has two main layers

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:22.320
in its web core, which is the
rendering part and then in its

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:26.530
WebKit, which is an API
browser itself.

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:31.390
And that API is important
because it allows the browser

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.080
to determine how a website
should be displayed.

00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:38.170
For example, how rendering
works, how scrolling works.

00:43:38.170 --> 00:43:43.790
And the Android browser has a
different API implementation

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.270
than Chrome for Android.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:50.570
We actually share that API with
a normal desktop Chrome.

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:54.760
And it definitely can explain
the differences in how we

00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:59.030
handle things, how we implement
APIs, and for

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:02.390
example you can change setting
with [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:06.000
It's one of the reasons why
we're able to provide a

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.110
consistent and nice overview
of everything the

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:12.880
base is able to do.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:14.744
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, that's
this one right?

00:44:14.744 --> 00:44:16.725
PETER BEVERLOO: Yeah, so cool.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.190
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, and I guess
also there may be differences

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:23.480
in the web [? conversions ?]

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:25.650
that the two respective
browsers use.

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:26.570
PETER BEVERLOO: Yeah.

00:44:26.570 --> 00:44:30.545
BORIS SMUS: We may be poised
to be more ahead.

00:44:30.545 --> 00:44:36.420
I think because of Chrome for
Android being bundled.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:38.200
It's available for the market.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.520
Updates are available
from the market.

00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.460
MARCOS: That's an important
point, because

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.190
it comes from Android.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.470
It's [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:50.510
So we'll be getting all the
feature support-- all the

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:54.570
features that make sense on a
mobile device that we get from

00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:57.550
Chrome desktop, because we're
sharing exactly the same web

00:44:57.550 --> 00:44:57.930
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:44:57.930 --> 00:44:59.786
as at home.

00:44:59.786 --> 00:45:03.290
And the other browser shows
a slightly different--

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.640
we share the same web
core, but we might

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.290
get it slightly different.

00:45:07.290 --> 00:45:10.600
But Chrome for Android is
exactly the same as Chrome

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.560
desktop with, of course,
some additions.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:17.710
And this is very important going
forward, that we will be

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:21.130
following Chrome model.

00:45:21.130 --> 00:45:23.430
BORIS SMUS: And I guess it's
important to point out that

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.040
lately the focus of the
engineering team has been to

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:30.030
upstream as much code as
possible to the open source

00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:31.510
Chrome project.

00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:34.050
MARCOS: That's the reason
we're here in sunny

00:45:34.050 --> 00:45:35.740
California.

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:38.970
PETER BEVERLOO: Right now what
we're doing is if you go to

00:45:38.970 --> 00:45:42.540
chrome.google.co
m/chrome/mobile, on the

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:45.450
frequently asked questions
page, there is a link.

00:45:45.450 --> 00:45:49.670
If you want to see the source
code, at least the important

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:54.430
source code right now of Chrome
on Androids, what we're

00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:57.680
doing right now is getting rid
of the differences and adding

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:02.030
all our source codes to Chromium
and [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:05.730
to make sure that we can become

00:46:05.730 --> 00:46:07.080
consistent as soon as possible.

00:46:09.790 --> 00:46:11.360
BORIS SMUS: Whoa.

00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:11.645
Sorry.

00:46:11.645 --> 00:46:15.450
I was just trying to show that
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] page.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:16.700
[UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:20.590
Anyway, [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.320
Sorry.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.570
Anyway--

00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.685
yeah, so there's a question,
right Pete?

00:46:33.685 --> 00:46:39.200
PETE: Yeah, so there was a
question wanting to know--

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:41.400
sorry, I'll try to find it.

00:46:44.510 --> 00:46:47.360
When will it be available
for other countries?

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.040
And then as well, can you say
anything about supporting the

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.100
Chrome web store?

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:54.960
BORIS SMUS: So we're
working hard to

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.390
expand to other countries.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:59.150
But I don't think there's
any concrete plans--

00:46:59.150 --> 00:47:01.490
MARCOS: Anytime soon, I think,
is the real answer.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:02.060
But--

00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:03.000
BORIS SMUS: Sometime
hopefully.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.750
MARCOS: --we'll be everywhere.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.520
It's literally just a baby,
so please bear with us.

00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.740
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, it's
been nine days.

00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:12.950
MARCOS: Read your [? feet, ?]

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:18.690
like babies poems. It won't
be available anytime soon.

00:47:18.690 --> 00:47:19.610
BORIS SMUS: Hey Mark.

00:47:19.610 --> 00:47:20.180
MARK: Hey guys.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.930
Thanks for doing this hangout.

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:24.630
BORIS SMUS: So anyway, I'm
trying to screen share this,

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:25.920
but I can't.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:31.610
The other question was to do
with the Chrome web store and

00:47:31.610 --> 00:47:33.060
support for that.

00:47:33.060 --> 00:47:35.370
So yeah, there's no plans.

00:47:35.370 --> 00:47:42.390
Again, we launched nine days
ago, so no plans for this.

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:46.130
And I would love to share a page
with a bunch of resources

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:51.235
where you can log bugs,
ask questions.

00:47:51.235 --> 00:47:52.890
MARCOS: We can send the
links on anytime.

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:54.930
PETE: Yeah, so we'll go through
the links after.

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:57.333
But Mark had another
question that he

00:47:57.333 --> 00:47:58.255
posted in the comments.

00:47:58.255 --> 00:48:01.610
Mark, how about you ask
it actually in person?

00:48:01.610 --> 00:48:02.680
MARK: OK.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:06.250
So I've been using it out
of Transformer Prime.

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.072
PETE: Mark, I think
you're muted.

00:48:08.072 --> 00:48:09.308
Oh, there we go.

00:48:09.308 --> 00:48:11.340
MARK: Oh, great, OK.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.370
I have a Transformer Prime.

00:48:12.370 --> 00:48:16.210
And I've been using Chrome on
that for the last few days.

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:17.965
It's been working great.

00:48:17.965 --> 00:48:19.665
But I have had a few
times where it's

00:48:19.665 --> 00:48:20.620
had some weird bugs.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:23.170
And I was wondering what is the
best way to report those

00:48:23.170 --> 00:48:24.420
to you guys?

00:48:31.678 --> 00:48:33.080
BORIS SMUS: Mark, could
you repeat?

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.900
We missed the first part.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.600
MARK: Oh, sure.

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.578
So basically I've just been
using Chrome over

00:48:38.578 --> 00:48:38.890
the last few days.

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:39.760
BORIS SMUS: The last,
file bugs.

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:45.790
So the best way to file bugs
is we've made a short link.

00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:51.600
Basically, you go to
new.mcrbug.com, and that will

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:57.290
take you directly to the
Chromium bug tracker with the

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:59.430
correct bug template.

00:48:59.430 --> 00:49:01.230
And then you just fill
that form in.

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:02.560
And you're set.

00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:04.760
On that note, actually what I
was trying to show, and I

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.320
still am failing to
screen share.

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:13.330
If you go to mcrbug.com, it will
give you a list of all

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:16.500
the bugs logged against ASOS
Android, which is the new

00:49:16.500 --> 00:49:21.590
component, in the Chromium bug
track that tracks mobile

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:24.200
issues, or that tracks Chrome
for Android issues.

00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:27.040
And the cool thing there
is you can see

00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.200
the number of stars.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.130
And it's actually by default
ranked in star order.

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:38.200
So you'll see things like web
DL support, which is highly

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.650
ranked, as well as
other things that

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.900
people have been logging.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:48.750
Those are the two bug
logging venues.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:51.770
And if you have developer
questions, we're trying to

00:49:51.770 --> 00:49:55.510
encourage people to ask them on
stack overflow, using both

00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:58.910
the Google-Chrome tag, as
well as the Android tag.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:04.990
So if you log your question
with both tags, then that

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:09.190
automatically goes into
my inbox basically.

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:12.150
And we have other people looking
at that as well.

00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:16.880
So that's the best
way to do that.

00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.110
OK.

00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:20.701
So we're pretty close
to the end actually.

00:50:20.701 --> 00:50:25.910
Oh yeah, so I heard there's an
Easter egg somewhere in the--

00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:26.774
MARCOS: Is there?

00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:30.380
PETER BEVERLOO: We've
heard that too.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.630
BORIS SMUS: OK.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:34.440
All right.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.675
Well, maybe you guys will
find it sometime.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.430
MARCOS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:42.870 --> 00:50:46.210
BORIS SMUS: Anyway, so we
talked about feedback.

00:50:46.210 --> 00:50:49.830
Give feedback to the eng team.

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:51.515
We talked about the
code sites.

00:50:51.515 --> 00:50:55.480
So
code.google.com/chrome/mobile.

00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:57.040
PETER BEVERLOO: And in addition
to that, the Chrome

00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.750
site also has excellent
documentation available on how

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:05.040
to install the Android SDK,
and to start using the

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.130
developer tools.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:06.460
BORIS SMUS: Right.

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:07.510
That's a good guide.

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:14.570
There's also a video, just
walking through, as well as

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:16.970
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] a site for
Chrome developer tools.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:20.460
So there's a whole page about
how to use that stuff.

00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:24.250
And we should include that
as a link in here.

00:51:24.250 --> 00:51:25.270
Other things--

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:26.330
oh yes.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:27.550
HTML5 Rocks.

00:51:27.550 --> 00:51:32.170
So HTML5 Rocks is a great
resource for a lot of the

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:35.240
HTML5 features that we
talked about here.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:38.760
There's actually a specific
mobile page that, again, will

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:40.110
link you to.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:44.890
But there's general web platform
features such as

00:51:44.890 --> 00:51:46.530
index DB and [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
will go to

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:48.220
index DB on that page.

00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:51.825
So if you have questions
related to that kind of

00:51:51.825 --> 00:51:55.810
technology, it's a good
go-to place for you.

00:51:55.810 --> 00:51:58.620
So maybe we'll take any
last-minute questions

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:00.080
if there are any.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.790
PETE: Looks like we've addressed
pretty much all the

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:13.690
questions that everybody's
asked.

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:14.910
BORIS SMUS: Great.

00:52:14.910 --> 00:52:16.840
PETE: Thanks everybody
for participating.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.160
I'll let you--

00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:19.700
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, I don't
know if you guys have

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.040
anything else to add.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.470
PETER BEVERLOO: If you can,
try Chrome for Android.

00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:27.772
It's really good.

00:52:27.772 --> 00:52:30.630
BORIS SMUS: Yeah, I'll
second that.

00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:32.060
MARCOS: And we're here
for a long term.

00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.280
So don't worry.

00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:34.220
Just nine days.

00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.470
We will expand.

00:52:38.330 --> 00:52:39.710
BORIS SMUS: One more thing.

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:42.600
We have a Google+ page.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.330
You can follow the Chrome
developers Google+ page.

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:50.350
And we post a bunch of links,
multiple times a day I think,

00:52:50.350 --> 00:52:53.890
around various things
with Chrome.

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:56.376
There's something else
I wanted to say.

00:52:56.376 --> 00:52:58.991
Oh yeah, we're going to try to
do more of these hangouts in

00:52:58.991 --> 00:52:59.900
the future.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.950
So right, we have a schedule
every Thursday.

00:53:02.950 --> 00:53:07.610
We will talk about things other
than Chrome for Android,

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:12.030
as well as Chrome for Android,
so join us then.

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.390
All right.

00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:15.180
See you guys later.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:16.430
Bye bye.
