00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.110
In the last video on
even and odd functions,

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.830
I talk about how you
shouldn't get confused

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.640
between even functions and
even numbers and odd functions

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.440
and odd numbers.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.900
And I said that there wasn't
any obvious connection

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.490
between the word even function
and our notion of even numbers,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.740
or any connection between odd
functions and odd numbers.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.110
And, I was wrong.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.050
There actually is a
relatively obvious connection,

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.780
and this was pointed out by
the YouTube user Nothias.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.500
And the connection, I
almost explicitly did it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.430
in the last example.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.170
When I showed an even function,
I showed you x squared.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.770
When I showed you
an odd function,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.490
I showed you x to
the third power.

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.680
When I wanted to show
you another odd function,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.400
I showed you y is
equal to x, or f

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.620
of x is equal to x
to the first power.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.160
And so you might start to notice
what Nothias pointed out, is

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.460
that these archetypal
or these good examples

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.000
or these simple examples
of even and odd functions,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.810
when I just have a very
simple x raised to some power,

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.043
whether the power
is even or odd,

00:01:09.043 --> 00:01:12.090
it's going to tell you whether
the function is even or odd.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.860
And you want to be
very careful here.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.370
Not all even or odd functions
even have exponents in them.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.360
They could be
trigonometric functions.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.700
They might be some other
type of wacky functions.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.890
You don't have to
have exponents.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.090
It's just that these
exponents are probably

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.140
where the motivations for
calling these even functions

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.167
and odd functions came from.

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:33.405
And let me just be clear.

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.220
It's not just also
any polynomial--

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.280
and even in the last video, when
we had x to the third plus 1,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.580
this was neither even
or odd-- but if you just

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.170
have the pure x raised to some
power, then all of the sudden,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.320
the motivations for
calling them even

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.470
and odd start to make
sense, because if I

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.980
have f of x is equal to x
to the first power-- that's

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.710
the same thing as y is
equal to x-- this is odd.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.860
And it gels with the
name because we are also

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.090
raising it to an odd power.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.500
If we have f of x is
equal to x squared,

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.200
we saw in the previous
video, this is even.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.240
And it gels with
the idea that we're

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.979
raising it to an even power.

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:18.770
I could keep going.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.360
If it was to the x to
the third, that is odd.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.250
I could keep going.

00:02:25.064 --> 00:02:26.960
Let me write it this way.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.560
In general, if you have f
of x is equal to x to the n,

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:40.840
then this is odd-- odd function
if n is odd, is an odd number.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:48.930
And this is an even
function, if n is even.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.850
And I want to make
it very clear here.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.760
The whole point of
this video is just

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.410
to clarify the motivation
for calling them

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.160
even or odd functions.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.000
Not all even functions are
going to be of this form

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.110
here, where it's x raised
to some even power.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.450
And not all odd functions
are going to be.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.377
And I also don't want
you to be confused

00:03:08.377 --> 00:03:10.210
that if I have something
like x to the third

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.111
and then I have other
stuff past that,

00:03:12.111 --> 00:03:14.360
and you say, oh, x to the
third, that's an odd number.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.310
But this is not an odd function.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.635
Just when it's just
a pure stripped down

00:03:19.635 --> 00:03:21.769
x to the third or
x to the first can

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.060
you really make that statement.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.040
But that really is probably
where the motivation comes

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.600
for naming them even
or odd functions.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.770
And then the other
symmetric functions,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.820
even if they don't
involve an exponent--

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.040
maybe this is some type of
trigonometric function--

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.125
you're calling it
even because you're

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:46.670
saying it has the same type
of symmetry as, say, x squared

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.700
or x to an even power.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.090
So you group them all
together as even functions.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.570
And then all of these, even
though this may or may not

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.730
have an exponent in it,
it has the same type

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.140
of symmetries as x
raised to an odd power.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:01.360
So that's why call
them odd functions.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.060
Well, thank you Nothias
for pointing that out.
