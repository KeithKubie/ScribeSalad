00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.259
let's say that we have three small ponds
so this is pond a this is pond B and

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.080
this is pond C over here and let's say
that this first pond right over here

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.990
it's a privately owned pond it's owned
by it's owned by Al and this pond over

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.500
here is owned by Carol is owned by Carol
but this middle pond pond B I guess we

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.640
called it to start off with this is
common land or I guess this is a common

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.840
pound or this is open to the public open
open to the public open to the public

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520
and let's say that Al and Carol they're
both Fisher I guess Carol would be a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.530
Fisher a fisherwoman they're there they
both like the fish that's how they make

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.770
their living and Al and his in his pond
he has fish in there and he does some

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.899
fishing in his in his pond but he makes
sure not to over fish because he doesn't

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.250
want to deplete the stock of fish yeah
so he fishes just enough that he can he

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.729
can pay his bills and whatever else but
not so much that it depletes the fish

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.049
and essentially makes them extinct in
his pond so he doesn't want to over fish

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.610
and Carol does the same thing
she's got fish in her pond and but and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.630
she uses them to make a living she she
gets them out and sells them and eats

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.830
them and whatever else but she's careful
not to over fish because if you over

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.250
fished then there wouldn't be fish there
wouldn't be a next generation of fish

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.670
but over here in this public pond there
are also fish there are also fish I'll

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.930
draw their fish in orange
there are also fish in this public pond

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.329
over here they're smiling maybe they
won't be smiling for long and what is

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.210
going to happen anyone can go and fish
in this public pond so al might say and

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.390
we're just assume we're in a world of
two people obviously the real world has

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.930
more than two people I will say okay I'm
going to I'm going to be very careful in

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.990
my own pond I'm going to fish just
enough that I don't deplete the fish

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.790
there but I can any extra fish I need I
could go over here to this public pond

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.849
and fish all I want and I might be
concerned about depletion in the public

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.959
pond except for the fact if I'm
concerned about depletion that's still

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.630
not going to help
situation because other people might

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.160
come and still and still not be so
concerned and so I won't even get the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.240
benefit of the depletion if I hold back
and other people come and deplete the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:29.400
pond and so when you have this pond that
is open to the public all of the all of

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.520
the surrounding people whether it's Al
or Carol or I guess you could have other

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.420
people here they would say look I'm
going to fish here I'm going to get some

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.340
benefit and even if I over fish my
benefit the benefit of overfishing I'm

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.700
going to get on in the near term I'm
going to get all of those fish and then

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.390
the cost of that overfishing which is in
the future there won't be as many Fisher

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.950
and no fishes and no fish at all that's
going to be spread out amongst everyone

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.320
else and so you have the situation where
you have because there's no one I guess

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.370
you could say either owning this land or
there's no one protecting this lake or

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.140
however you want to describe it you have
there's a a rationale and I want to be

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.070
clear rationale does not always mean
good they're rational actors might

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:17.220
decide to over fish decide to over fish
and is essentially by doing that

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.940
everyone's going to be worse off they're
going to destroy the productivity of

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.850
this pond they're going to destroy the
productivity productivity of the pond of

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:35.310
the pond right over here and this idea
that if there's this common land or

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.140
common resource in this case it was a
pond and people can spread out the cost

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.950
and they get their benefits directly
you're essentially you have a situation

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.110
where that that shared resource can get
abused and this is called the tragedy of

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:57.690
the Commons so this is the tragedy
tragedy of the Commons we're in this in

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.489
the example we did here the pond is the
common space that's being that's being

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.570
abused and it's a it's especially a
tragedy and I've already hinted at this

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.320
already is that even if al decides that
hey you know what I'm going to hold back

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.650
a little bit I'm not going to fish so
much because I don't want to deplete it

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.130
he'll say but wait if I do that if I do
that other people are going to come and

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.700
deplete it so I have no incentive to
hold back and so other people are also

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.700
going to have the same logic and then
this thing is going to get over fished

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.330
here and the first classic example of
tragedy

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.280
where the example was first given was
common grazing land same exact idea if

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.900
this was private grazing land over here
where I can keep my cows and my sheep

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.099
and this is private grazing land over
here where someone else has their Colin

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:45.629
sheep but this over here is literally a
Commons where anyone can graze their cow

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:50.129
and sheep then just like the fishing
huge incentive for people to let their

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.659
cow and sheep maybe over graze the land
destroy the land make it not sustainable

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:59.430
but the costs of it are going to be
shared by everyone else and the benefit

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.169
of over grazing at least in the near
term you the the the person who's over

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:07.650
grazing is going to get from it and you
might even say I'm not even the one over

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.599
grazing it's all of us collectively over
grazing so you don't blame me now what

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:16.919
is the solution to the tragedy of the
Commons how does a government or

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.479
jurisdiction or a group of people avoid
this type of destruction of a resource

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.460
well one way that you could do is you
could make this somehow into private

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.240
land so if that was owned by the
government it could sell it auction it

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.370
off to private people who could then
sell access to this or if the government

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.960
does retain control of it it could sell
permits to the land so in this situation

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.629
you could sell you could sell permits so
it could figure out hey if someone

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:50.909
fishes responsibly in a given day
they're going to get I don't know $200

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.539
or value by doing this so we're going to
make a permit cost I don't know one

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.779
hundred and fifty dollars so someone
still has an incentive to do it but that

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:01.409
will also limit the amount of fishing
that can be there and you can have some

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.940
you know conservationists that make sure
that the that not too many permits are

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.680
given are given for this space over you
and we see that happening if you wanted

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.259
to go hunting
there are permits you need to have if

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:16.620
you want to if you want to go fishing in
a lot of places there are permanent to

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.589
have if you want to go camping in a lot
of places there are permits because you

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.620
could even over a camping area if too
many people are walking there too much

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.940
trash is there it could ruin the
campgrounds and so this tragedy the

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.009
Commons the best way or the way most
often seen is through this the best way

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.759
of preventing the tragedy of Commons is
through some type of a permitting

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:38.209
process
