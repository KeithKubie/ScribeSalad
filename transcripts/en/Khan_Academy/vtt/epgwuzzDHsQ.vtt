00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.410
I've draw an arbitrary
function here.

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:03.785
And what we're
going to try to do

00:00:03.785 --> 00:00:06.150
is approximate this
arbitrary function--

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.530
we don't know what it
is-- using a polynomial.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.329
We'll keep adding terms
to that polynomial.

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:11.870
But to do this,
we're going to assume

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.510
that we can evaluate
the function at 0,

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.210
that it gives us some
value, and that we

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.420
can keep taking the
derivative of the function

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.900
and evaluating the
first, the second,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.450
and the third derivative, so
on and so forth, at 0 as well.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.940
So we're assuming that
we know what f of 0 is.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.720
We're assuming that we
know what f prime of 0 is.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.450
We're assuming that we know
the second derivative at 0.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.340
We're assuming that we know
the third derivative at 0.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.300
So maybe I'll write
it-- third derivative.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.940
I'll just write f prime prime
at 0, and so forth and so on.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.910
So let's think about how we
can approximate this using

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.770
polynomials of ever
increasing length.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.499
So we could have a
polynomial of just one term.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.040
And it would just
be a constant term.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.050
So this would be a
polynomial of degree 0.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.930
And if we have a constant
term, we at least

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.580
might want to make that constant
polynomial-- it really is just

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.160
a constant function-- equal
the function at f of 0.

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.220
So at first, maybe
we just want p of 0,

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.930
where p is the polynomial
that we're going to construct,

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.060
we want p of 0 to
be equal to f of 0.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.970
So if we want to do that
using a polynomial of only one

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.080
term, of only one
constant term, we

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.250
can just set p of x
is equal to f of 0.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.000
So if I were to graph it,
it would look like this.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.260
It would just be a
horizontal line at f of 0.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.080
And you could say, Sal, that's
a horrible approximation.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.360
It only approximates the
function at this point.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.526
Looks like we got lucky at
a couple of other points,

00:01:44.526 --> 00:01:46.170
but it's really bad
everywhere else.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.628
And now I would
tell you, well, try

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:49.660
to do any better using
a horizontal line.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.520
At least we got it
right at f of 0.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.345
So this is about as good as we
can do with just a constant.

00:01:56.345 --> 00:01:58.220
And even though-- I just
want to remind you--

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.720
this might not look
like a constant,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.080
but we're assuming that
given the function,

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.720
we could evaluate
it at 0 and that

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.020
will just give us a number.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.800
So whatever number that was, we
would put it right over here.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.020
We'd say p of x is
equal to that number.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.080
It would just be a horizontal
line right there at f of 0.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.120
But that obviously
is not so great.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.900
So let's add some
more constraints.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.280
Beyond the fact that we want
p of 0 to be equal to f of 0,

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.730
let's say that we
also want p prime at 0

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.330
to be the same thing
as f prime at 0.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.590
Let me do this in a new color.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.070
So we also want,
in the new color,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.930
we also want-- that's
not a new color.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.360
We also want p prime.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.030
We want the first derivative
of our polynomial,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.880
when evaluated at 0,
to be the same thing

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.650
as the first derivative of the
function when evaluated at 0.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.950
And we don't want to lose
this right over here.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:00.380
So what if we set p of x
as being equal to f of 0?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.270
So we're taking our old
p of x, but now we're

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.000
going to add another term so
that the derivatives match up.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.150
Plus f prime of times x.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.030
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.780
If we use this as our new
polynomial, what happens?

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.290
What is p is 0?

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.690
p of 0 is going to
be equal to-- you're

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.180
going to have f of 0 plus
whatever this f prime of 0

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.850
is times 0.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.210
If you put a 0 in for x, this
term is just going to be 0.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.380
So you're going to be left
with p of 0 is equal to f of 0.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.340
That's cool.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.560
That's just as good
as our first version.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.390
Now what's the
derivative over here?

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.374
So the derivative is p
prime of x is equal to-- you

00:03:45.374 --> 00:03:46.540
take the derivative of this.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.910
This is just a constant,
so its derivative is 0.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.110
The derivative of a
coefficient times x

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:53.950
is just going to
be the coefficient.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.480
So it's going to
be f prime of 0.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.800
So if you evaluate it
at 0-- so p prime of 0.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.972
Or the derivative of
our polynomial evaluated

00:04:04.972 --> 00:04:07.430
at 0-- I know it's a little
weird because we're not using--

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.261
we're doing a p prime of x
of f of 0 and all of this.

00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:12.760
But just remember, what's the
variable, what's the constant,

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.390
and hopefully, it'll make sense.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.500
So this is just obviously
going to be f prime of 0.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.270
Its derivative is
a constant value.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.769
This is a constant
value right here.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.352
We're assuming that we can take
the derivative of our function

00:04:23.352 --> 00:04:27.210
and evaluate that thing at
0 to give a constant value.

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.140
So if p prime of x is equal
to this constant value,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.420
obviously, p prime
of x evaluated at 0

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.160
is going to be that value.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.390
But what's cool about
this right here,

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.650
this polynomial that has a 0
degree term and a first degree

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:48.550
term, is now this polynomial
is equal to our function at x

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:49.730
is equal to 0.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.270
And it also has the
same first derivative.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.640
It also has the same
slope at x is equal to 0.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.824
So this thing will look,
this new polynomial

00:04:59.824 --> 00:05:01.740
with two terms-- getting
a little bit better--

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.400
it will look
something like that.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.560
It will essentially have--
it'll look like a tangent line

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.050
at f of 0, at x is equal to 0.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.860
So we're doing better, but still
not a super good approximation.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.510
It kind of is going in
the same general direction

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.462
as our function around 0.

00:05:22.462 --> 00:05:24.170
But maybe we can do
better by making sure

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.590
that they have the
same second derivative.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.480
And to try to have the same
second derivative while still

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.480
having the same first derivative
and the same value at 0,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.170
let's try to do
something interesting.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.350
Let's define p of x.

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.780
So let's make it clear.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.970
This was our first try.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.990
This is our second
try right over here.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.740
And I'm about to embark
on our third try.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.050
So in our third try, my goal is
that the value of my polynomial

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:55.740
is the same as the value
of the function at 0.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:57.590
They have the same
derivative at 0.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.460
And they also have the same
second derivative at 0.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.280
So let's define my
polynomial to be

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.290
equal to-- so I'm going
to do the first two

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.560
terms of these guys
right over here.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.490
So it's going to be
f of 0 plus f prime

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.280
of 0 times x, so exactly
what we did here.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.040
But now let me add another term.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.930
I'll do the other
term in a new color.

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.560
And I'm going to
put a 1/2 out here.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.210
And hopefully it might make
sense why I'm about to do this.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.150
Plus 1/2 times the
second derivative

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:36.150
of our function
evaluated at 0 x squared.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.090
And when we evaluate
the derivative of this,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.890
I think you'll see
why this 1/2 is there.

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:46.170
Because now let's evaluate
this and its derivatives at 0.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:51.700
So if we evaluate p of 0, p of
0 is going to be equal to what?

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.350
Well, you have
this constant term.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.770
If you evaluate it at 0,
this x and this x squared

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.800
are both going to be 0.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.660
So those terms are
going to go away.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.860
So p of 0 is still
equal to f of 0.

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.900
If you take the derivative
of p of x-- so let

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.770
me take the
derivative right here.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:08.130
I'll do it in yellow.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:10.180
So the derivative
of my new p of x

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.936
is going to be equal to-- so
this term is going to go away.

00:07:12.936 --> 00:07:13.810
It's a constant term.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.320
It's going to be
equal to f prime of 0.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.840
That's the coefficient on this.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.100
Plus-- this is the power
rule right here-- 2 times 1/2

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:30.430
is just 1, plus f prime
prime of 0 times x.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.120
Take the 2, multiply
it times 1/2,

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.620
and decrement that
2 right there.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:39.540
I think you now have a sense
of why we put the 1/2 there.

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.590
It's making it so that we don't
end up with the 2 coefficient

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.990
out front.

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.630
Now what is p prime of 0?

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.770
So let me write it right
here. p prime of 0 is what?

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.020
Well, this term right here
is just going to be 0,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.780
so you're left with this
constant value right over here.

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:58.310
So it's going to
be f prime of 0.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.150
So so far, our third
generation polynomial

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.300
has all the properties
of the first two.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.940
And let's see how it does
on its third derivative,

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.930
or I should say the
second derivative.

00:08:09.930 --> 00:08:13.370
So p prime prime of
x is equal to-- this

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:15.566
is a constant, so
its derivative is 0.

00:08:15.566 --> 00:08:17.690
So you just take the
coefficient on the second term

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.940
is equal to f prime prime of 0.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:24.840
So what's the second
derivative of p evaluated at 0?

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:27.010
Well, it's just going to
be this constant value.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:30.120
It's going to be f
prime prime of 0.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.919
So notice, by adding
this term, now,

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:38.150
not only is our polynomial value
the same thing as our function

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.010
value at 0, its derivative
at 0 is the same thing

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.711
as the derivative of
the function at 0.

00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:44.710
And its second derivative
at 0 is the same thing

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.399
as the second derivative
of the function at 0.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.940
So we're getting
pretty good at this.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.350
And you might guess that
there's a pattern here.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:56.290
Every term we add, it'll allow
us to set up the situation so

00:08:56.290 --> 00:09:01.060
that the n-th derivative
of our approximation at 0

00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.080
will be the same thing
as the n-th derivative

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.120
of our function at 0.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.200
So in general, if we
wanted to keep doing this,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.700
if we had a lot of
time on our hands

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:12.540
and we wanted to just keep
adding terms to our polynomial,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.490
we could-- and let me
do this in a new color.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.330
Maybe I'll do it in a
color I already used.

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.185
We could make our
polynomial approximation.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.830
So the first term, the constant
term, will just be f of 0.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:29.830
Then the next term will
be f prime of 0 times x.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:33.650
Then the next term
will be f prime

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.440
prime of 0 times
1/2 times x squared.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.829
I just rewrote that in a
slightly different order.

00:09:40.829 --> 00:09:43.370
Then the next term, if we want
to make their third derivative

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:49.340
the same at 0, would be
f prime prime prime of 0.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.840
The third derivative
of the function

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:59.280
at 0, times 1/2 times 1/3,
so 1 over 2 times 3 times x

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.490
to the third.

00:10:00.490 --> 00:10:01.640
And we can keep going.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.880
Maybe you you'll start
to see a pattern here.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:06.630
Plus, if we want to make
their fourth derivatives

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.854
at 0 coincide, it would
be the fourth derivative

00:10:10.854 --> 00:10:11.520
of the function.

00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.390
I could put a 4 up
there, but this is really

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:18.320
emphasizing-- it's the fourth
derivative at 0 times 1 over--

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.550
and I'll change the order.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:21.300
Instead of writing it
in increasing order,

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:28.710
I'll write it as 4 times 3
times 2 times x to the fourth.

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.200
And you can verify
it for yourself.

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.620
If we just had this
only, and if you

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:33.420
were to take the fourth
derivative of this,

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.800
evaluate it at 0,
it'll be the same thing

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.630
as the fourth derivative of
the function evaluated at 0.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.150
And in general, you
can keep adding terms

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.210
where the n-th term
will look like this.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:50.890
The n-th derivative of your
function evaluated at 0 times

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:56.180
x to the n over n factorial.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:59.380
Notice this is the same
thing as 4 factorial.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:03.081
4 factorial is equal to 4
times 3 times 2 times 1.

00:11:03.081 --> 00:11:04.580
You don't have to
write the 1 there,

00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:06.300
but you could put it there.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.300
This right here is the same
thing as 3 factorial-- 3 times

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.300
2 times 1.

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.610
I didn't put the 1 there.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.650
This right here is the same
thing as 2 factorial, 2 times

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:17.530
1.

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:18.570
This is the same thing.

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:20.694
We didn't write anything,
but you could divide this

00:11:20.694 --> 00:11:23.840
by 1 factorial, which
is the same thing as 1.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.650
And you can divide
this by 0 factorial,

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.880
which also happens to be 1.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.120
We won't have to study
it too much over here.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.730
But this general series that
I've kind of set up right here

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:34.660
is called the Maclaurin series.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:39.800
And you can approximate
a polynomial.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:42.290
And we'll see it leads to
some pretty powerful results

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:43.280
later on.

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.610
But what happens-- and I
don't have the computing power

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.310
in my brain to draw
the graph properly--

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.720
is that when only
the functions equal,

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.120
you get that horizontal line.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.430
When you make the
function equal 0

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.470
and their first
derivatives equal at 0,

00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:01.940
then you have something that
looks like the tangent line.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.850
When you add another
degree, it might

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.490
approximate the polynomial
something like this.

00:12:06.490 --> 00:12:11.170
When you add another degree, it
might look something like that.

00:12:11.170 --> 00:12:13.860
And as you keep adding
more and more degrees, when

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.360
you keep adding
more and more terms,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.250
it gets closer
and closer around,

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.490
especially as you get
close to x is equal to 0.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:24.130
But in theory, if you add
an infinite number of terms,

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:26.660
you shouldn't be able to do--
I haven't proven this to you,

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.910
so that's why I'm saying that.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:29.590
I haven't proved it yet to you.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:31.600
But if you add an
infinite number of terms,

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.870
all of the derivatives
should be the same.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.900
And then the function
should pretty much

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.600
look like each other.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.880
In the next video, I'll do
this with some actual functions

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.390
just so it makes a
little bit more sense.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.660
And just so you know,
the Maclaurin series

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:48.920
is a special case
of the Taylor series

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.657
because we're centering it at 0.

00:12:50.657 --> 00:12:52.240
And when you're doing
a Taylor series,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.900
you can pick any center point.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.710
We'll focus on the
Maclaurin right now.
