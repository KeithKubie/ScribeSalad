00:00:06.194 --> 00:00:08.360
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to I/O Live.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.290
I'm Timothy Jordan.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:10.840
And I'm standing
here with Jorge.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.090
Jorge has been applying
machine learning

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.880
to diabetic
retinopathy detection.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.450
Hi, Jorge.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.440
Thanks for joining us.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.780
DR. JORGE CUADROS: Hi.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.522
Nice to be here.

00:00:18.522 --> 00:00:20.230
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK,
let's start with what

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.540
is diabetic retinopathy?

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.290
DR. JORGE CUADROS: So
diabetic retinopathy

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.750
is the main cause of blindness
among working-age adults

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.830
in the world.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.960
And the sad thing is
that it's 90% preventable

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.650
if patients would get regular
eye exams and timely treatment.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.980
The problem is that people
don't get regular eye exams,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.710
and so we've been going out and
getting images of the retina

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.250
in order to get a
diagnosis to see who is

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.567
at risk for vision impairment.

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:51.400
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And how
do you apply machine

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:52.930
learning to the problem?

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.300
DR. JORGE CUADROS: So right now
an ophthalmologist or an eye

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.850
doctor optometrist has
to look at the image

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.280
and determine what the
level of retinal disease

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.880
is before a patient
can be referred,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.320
if they need referral
for treatment.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.890
So with AI you can get an
immediate grading of what's

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.570
going on in the retina.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.570
So you don't have to wait
sometimes an hour or two hours

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.290
or two or three days or even
weeks to get a response.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.310
You can act immediately
for people that need care.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.410
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And I imagine
this is a scalable thing

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.720
as well for areas
that don't have access

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.310
to the same medical help.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.351
DR. JORGE CUADROS: Right.

00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:38.920
So vision impairment is expected
to increase by three times

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.850
by the year 2050.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.730
So there's just not
enough manpower.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.980
There's not enough eye
doctors in the world

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.780
to be able to take
care of everyone.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.850
So this is really
the only chance

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.020
to be able to get the people
who need care into treatment.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.290
To be able to identify them
and make sure that they're

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.170
able to get treated.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.086
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I see.

00:01:59.086 --> 00:01:59.530
DR. JORGE CUADROS: Yeah.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What's
next after this?

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.835
What else do you think that you
can apply machine learning to

00:02:03.835 --> 00:02:04.520
for people?

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.050
DR. JORGE CUADROS: Yeah,
so that's really exciting.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:08.770
It looks like AI can see a lot
of things in the retina that

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.880
humans can't.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.220
So we're looking to apply it
to cardiovascular disease,

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.540
neurological disease, and
a host of other problems

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.800
that we're hoping that
the algorithm can find out

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.950
with just a simple
retinal image.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.210
Jorge, thanks for
sharing your story.

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.800
And thank you for the
work that you're doing.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.008
DR. JORGE CUADROS: Thank you.

00:02:28.008 --> 00:02:31.192
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm Timothy
Jordan, and this is I/O Live.
