00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.170
Hey,

2
00:00:02.171 --> 00:00:04.960
It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday,

3
00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.890
February 11th,
2019.

4
00:00:08.891 --> 00:00:12.070
What is going on with you?

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.790
How are you [inaudible] I am actually recording part of this anyways,

6
00:00:17.861 --> 00:00:22.510
I'll rerecording here Saturday night cause I'm out of your tour and doing a

7
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:27.511
little bit of stand up and just when I have to fly on Sunday and then I got a

8
00:00:29.331 --> 00:00:33.170
fucking bunch of Shit I have to do Monday.
I gotta I gotta do this in spurts.

9
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.970
They got to do a couple of rounds here.
You know,
it's weird.

10
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've been walking around today all by myself,
all by my lonesome and uh,

11
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.040
for some reason I don't know why this fucking melody with the wrong lyrics has

12
00:00:49.971 --> 00:00:51.140
been stuck in my head.

13
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.040
I just been walking around going Sherry's berries.

14
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.240
Why your bug and

15
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.490
makes no fucking sense whatsoever.

16
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.250
<v 0>I never had a song.
I always had a song for me undies beyond Ds.</v>

18
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.510
So Sherry's berries

19
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.950
keeps that they might advertise this far.
Can we go?
I have no idea.

20
00:01:13.951 --> 00:01:17.550
I'm doing this so early.
I don't even have the advertising yet.
You understand?

21
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.300
Do you understand how dangerous a podcast this is right now?
Um,

22
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.740
any ways,
any way.

23
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.550
I guess as I've been told I'm supposed to stay and said anyways.
Anyway,

24
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.210
I'm fucking,
uh,
I did my first standup road gig in,

25
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.840
in since I came back from Europe,
uh,

26
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.750
ended the acting Gig and I walked out on stage,

27
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.520
got on the fucking bicycle and it was a,
it was all right.
Everything went great.

28
00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.070
I want to thank everybody came out to the bore,

29
00:01:47.071 --> 00:01:51.360
got up in Atlantic city.
I had a great fucking time.

30
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.800
And uh,
now I'm sort of barnstorming around just doing some like,
you know,

31
00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.020
clubs and local areas in shit.

32
00:01:58.021 --> 00:02:01.080
Just doing the hour and trying to figure out how I'm going to put this fucking

33
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:05.490
thing together.
Uh,
whittled some shit down,
get in,
get out,

34
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.950
take this fucking thing and then move on to my next hour.

35
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:09.450
My favorite fucking thing to do,

36
00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.300
my favorite fucking thing to do is,
is the,

37
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:19.660
is the day after the special when all that material is flushed down the fucking

38
00:02:19.661 --> 00:02:24.610
toilet and I get to start over again.
No fucking pressure.
You know?

39
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.660
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

40
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.500
<v 0>The precious to special.
Once you get the special done,
you know,</v>

41
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.970
if you're like me,
you're going to continue to like fuck up in life.

42
00:02:33.971 --> 00:02:37.600
So the material is going to come,
you know,

43
00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.040
speaking of fucking up,
I was staying in this hotel about a week ago.

44
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.800
I forgot to tell you the story.
What's the fucking,

45
00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.860
I swear to God,
like the level
of like hostile

46
00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.680
that corporations have got to as far as just complete lack of customer.

47
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.790
He can't get anybody on the fucking phone.
Total skeleton crew,

48
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.830
go fuck yourself.
The the,
the way this does shit is now,

49
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.520
you know what I mean?
Like if you have a problem with you fucking iPhone,

50
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:13.720
who the hell are you going to call?

51
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.590
How the fuck you going to get anybody on the phone

52
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.110
or at least somebody from in this fucking atmosphere,
you can't do it.
Right.

53
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.130
So last couple of hotels I stayed in,
right.
I go to call room service.

54
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.790
How long should that take?
Two.
Three fucking rings.
Worst case scenario,

55
00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:35.790
they usually have an outgoing message going like,
hey,
be reaches message.

56
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.910
Just leave your room number and we will,
uh,

57
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.790
we'll call you right back and we'll figure out what,
what,
what,
whatever you want,

58
00:03:41.791 --> 00:03:43.560
right?
So

59
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.650
I'm fucking call this the Goddamn thing rings three times.

60
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.410
Puts me on hold.
I put it on speaker.

61
00:03:52.411 --> 00:03:56.400
I'm sitting there for like 15 fucking minutes.
So I hang up.
I'm like,
all right,

62
00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.120
so I fucking call the front desk.
And I was like,
yeah,
Hey,

63
00:04:00.121 --> 00:04:04.560
I'm trying to order the Reuben
Reuben Sandwich there,
right?

64
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.020
I can't get through and nobody's picking up.

65
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:10.910
So the lady at the front desk is like,
oh,
that's strange.
Here,
let me,

66
00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.490
I'll put you right through.
Puts me through to the same extension.

67
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.100
I'm back on hold again,
listening to the same fucking music.

68
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.640
Sit there again for another 10 minutes now about 25 minutes into trying to order

69
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:21.570
a fucking sandwich.

70
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.473
<v 1>All right?</v>

71
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.280
<v 0>So then I go,
I have,
fuck this.
I go to the next one.</v>

72
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.640
I call customer service is a customer service button.

73
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.960
Sony picks up after three rings.
I tell them what the fucking problem is.
He said,

74
00:04:34.961 --> 00:04:39.010
oh my God,
it's terrible.
I'm so sorry.
Mr [inaudible].
Uh,
you know,
I'll,
I'll,

75
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.790
let me,
let,
let me get you through.
I'll stay on with you,
right?

76
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.470
Same fucking extension.
Same fucking on hold music.

77
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.790
And I'm sitting there for like 15 seconds and I'm like,
wait.
I'm like,
dude,

78
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.130
are you still there?
He wasn't there,

79
00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.820
so I fucking call back customer service again.
Somebody else picks up.

80
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.430
I see.
I tell the whole fucking story.
They just told you,

81
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.350
it's like the ninth time I'm telling this story.
I feel front desk,

82
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.240
the fucking cut.
Third time.
Right.
And as I'm telling him,
she goes,

83
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.470
he didn't stay on with you.
And I'm like,
no,
like,
is that normal behavior?

84
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.500
She goes,
I'm sorry.
All right,
let me get you through.

85
00:05:23.501 --> 00:05:26.650
And she finally gets me through okay.

86
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.870
To Room Service.
It rings in the guy on the other end,

87
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.550
picks up room service and just goes,
hello?

88
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.460
I'm like,
yeah,
a is this room service?

89
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.650
He's like,
yeah,

90
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.323
<v 1>okay.</v>

91
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:51.120
<v 0>I'm like,
ah,
I'd like to order some food to the room.
It's like super awkward.</v>

92
00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:55.200
And he goes,
all right.
I go,
okay,
can I get that Reuben Sandwich?

93
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.790
He's like,
Yep.
I go,
all right,

94
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:02.690
can I get a side salad instead of the fries?

95
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:05.960
Is it all right if I get a salad instead of the fries?
And he goes,
no

96
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.430
flat out says no.
Now what am I going to do?
Complained to him.
He's got my food,

97
00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:17.270
he's got me by the balls.
So I was like,
I,
you know,

98
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:19.830
I guess I'm eating fries.
He's like,
well,
what do you want?

99
00:06:19.831 --> 00:06:23.960
What do you want to drink?
I just go,
let me get a water with ice.
So he goes,

100
00:06:23.961 --> 00:06:27.220
all right,
so you know,

101
00:06:27.221 --> 00:06:29.140
I get in the room number and I fucking hang up.

102
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.680
And then I just sit there and walk around with fucking hotel room,

103
00:06:32.681 --> 00:06:37.450
muttering to myself,
go on.
It literally took me a fucking half hour

104
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:42.740
to get through to somebody that could get me to somebody to order a fucking

105
00:06:42.741 --> 00:06:47.400
sandwich to my room.
And,
and then when I asked,
you know,

106
00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.480
have it your way,
Burger King,
he basically was like,
yeah,
no,
go.
Fuck.
He's like,

107
00:06:51.481 --> 00:06:56.160
I was as kid,
Daddy,
can we get some ice cream now?
All right.

108
00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.100
I guess you're taller than me and you're driving and you're paying for

109
00:06:59.101 --> 00:07:01.470
everything.
So I guess what you say goes,

110
00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:03.210
this guy's fucking talking to me like that.

111
00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.950
So now I'm in another hotel
and uh,

112
00:07:08.951 --> 00:07:10.360
I wanted to find out,
I don't know what,

113
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.080
there was a vending machine on this fucking floor and I'm trying to fuck,

114
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.230
there's no button on the phone that says front desk.

115
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:22.840
And this is feeling like a trend where I've noticed,
you know,

116
00:07:22.841 --> 00:07:26.230
you go into your room,
if there's no menu,
you call him up.

117
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.780
If you can get somebody on the phone,
where's the menu?

118
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.050
They say it's on your TV and then you go on the TV and you got to use,

119
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:38.650
figure out your fucking remote control.
It's all on you.

120
00:07:38.651 --> 00:07:41.260
You have to figure it out,
right?

121
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.320
And you've got to figure this shit out and then order it without talking to

122
00:07:44.321 --> 00:07:46.720
anybody.
Um,

123
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.790
like how far are they going to take this?
I feel like in the future,

124
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:52.930
like you're going to be like,

125
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.540
especially in this country with the fucking healthcare,

126
00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.040
you're going to be like dying or something and it's going to be up to you to

127
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:02.920
figure out like how to get ahold of somebody

128
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.190
and I don't know what you know if,
yeah.
Yeah.
Hey,
uh,

129
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:14.140
I got stabbed in the abdomen.
Okay.
Yeah,

130
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.780
as one.
If I could get some,
uh,
room service.

131
00:08:16.781 --> 00:08:21.250
If you could like drive an ambulance over here.
Maybe like pick me up.
I,

132
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.530
yeah.
Can you,
uh,
you know,
maybe bring like some bandages and stuff?

133
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.050
No.
All right.

134
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.270
Well it was the ambulance going to show up.
Yeah,
that right.

135
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.630
That's going to be like,
like that level of shit.
I Dunno.

136
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.280
My fucking pet peeve though is people that hate their fucking job,

137
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:48.310
you know what I mean?
And then they take it out on you.
It's like,
dude,

138
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:52.180
it's not my fucking fault.
You work here.
Okay.
You don't like the job?
Quit.

139
00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:54.970
I had shit jobs and I fucking,
I destroyed.

140
00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.850
You know the fuck are you doing?
You're going to try,

141
00:09:00.851 --> 00:09:03.970
when you get your dream job,
go fuck yourself.

142
00:09:03.971 --> 00:09:08.470
You're going to suck the whole thing.
Oh Man.
Oh,
I got another good one.

143
00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:12.820
I hope.
I'm assuming you enjoyed that story is another travel story for you.

144
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.400
So I'm on my way to Atlantic city,
right.

145
00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:21.460
And I uh,
I get on the plane and I'm sitting there and I just,

146
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:22.990
as I'm sitting there,
I'm looking down.

147
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:25.540
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing reading a magazine or some shit.

148
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:31.670
And uh,
I was reading rolling stone.
Any of this guy going,

149
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.970
Bill Burr,
bill a bill,
Bill Burr.
Hey Bill.
Bill Burn and look up.

150
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.350
I see it's this comic.
I know my God.
Shit.
Hey,
how you doing?
He's like,

151
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.670
you work in Philly.
I was like,
no,
I'm landed there and I want,

152
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.620
and I'm gonna fucking drive over to Atlantic city.
He goes,
oh cool.
All right,

153
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.650
I'll talk to you when we get off.
Right.
So seen him in awhile.

154
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:54.010
I'm not gonna name any names here cause I don't want to get anybody in fucking

155
00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:56.740
trouble.
Right.
So we get off the fucking,
I get off the plane,
right?

156
00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.070
Take a leak to come out,
he's fucking stand.
Hey what's going on?

157
00:10:00.071 --> 00:10:02.470
So we start shooting the shit and we're walking

158
00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.500
and we get to the uh,
you know the moving sidewalk.

159
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.590
We hadn't seen each other a little bit and we were standing side by side,

160
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.160
which you're not supposed to cause it's walk or stand.

161
00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:19.540
So this guy as he's walking up,
it's going,
excuse me,
excuse me.

162
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:24.400
Like he only had to say it once and we immediately immediately got out of the

163
00:10:24.401 --> 00:10:26.870
way.
He comes huff and buys,

164
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.750
he walks by then he points up at the sign that says walk or stand.

165
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:37.760
So I just was like,
I go,
hey buddy,
relax.
He's walking away.
He goes,

166
00:10:37.761 --> 00:10:42.200
you relax.
I go,
you're the one pointed at the sign.
He started talking more shit.

167
00:10:42.201 --> 00:10:46.730
And I go,
Oh yeah,
I get it.
I get it.
Yeah,
you got your ear buds in your important.

168
00:10:46.731 --> 00:10:50.210
Right.
So he starts giving me shit and I just start saying it,

169
00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.530
turn around every now and then I get a little bit something,
you know,

170
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:59.330
cause he was listening to and I made him so mad.
He gave me the finger

171
00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:03.320
and it was like the highlight of my fucking trip.

172
00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:09.170
I was already in a bad mood because the second we landed some cont like five

173
00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:14.171
rows back immediately turned on the cell phone and had like a conversation at

174
00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:16.010
the top of his lungs.
You know,

175
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.730
and I know there's something weird about this where in that story than the

176
00:11:19.731 --> 00:11:20.570
middle story,

177
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.010
I was the cont cause I was standing where you were supposed to be walking.

178
00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:26.720
But the thing is the second the guy said,
excuse me,

179
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.230
I knew what I was doing wrong and I immediately got out of the fucking way.

180
00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:32.150
I didn't act,
you know,
I immediately got out of the way.

181
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.490
This guy's still shaking his fucking head.

182
00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:37.310
<v 2>Ah,
okay.</v>

183
00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.050
<v 0>I was just looking at the guy like,</v>

184
00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:42.950
who the fuck are you to behave like me in that situation?

185
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.800
You know the nervous some people

186
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:52.260
who you to walk by mad at me that I wasn't aware that you were trying any,

187
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.280
this is the thing.
He really,
even in a fucking

188
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.920
<v 3>hurry,
cause he had the time to argue with me and gave me the finger.</v>

189
00:11:57.470 --> 00:12:01.790
He's just one of those fucking people that just has to walk fast,
um,

190
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.500
until they feel like they get in somewhere.
I don't know.
By the way,

191
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:06.340
I gotta tell you something.

192
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:11.110
Those stupid little fucking little half a straws that people have hanging out of

193
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:14.860
their fucking ears is just,
you know,
that's like the Bluetooth of headphones.

194
00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:19.510
I think I'm very soon people are going to,

195
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:21.010
that's going to become like,
remember,

196
00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:23.650
like Bluetooth was cool for like a week evidently.

197
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.860
And then everybody just made fun of that stupid thing hanging out of your ear.

198
00:12:26.861 --> 00:12:30.610
I really think that those,
whatever those things are called,
I have no idea.

199
00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:31.840
It always looks like you have like a little bit,

200
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:36.580
little straw hanging out of your fucking ear.
Um,
I'm not a fan of those.

201
00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.090
I've always been a fan of headphones.
I don't like,

202
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.410
my ears have fucked from playing drums and I don't like jam and shit into my
ear.

203
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.303
<v 2>MMM.</v>

204
00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.500
<v 3>I Dunno.
Plus,
you know what,</v>

205
00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:51.150
if you ever gotten like bright light tank right there,

206
00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:52.860
what have we gotten to a fight?
Right?

207
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.180
Me and that guy and I fucking threw a hook and I punched him right in the year.

208
00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:00.210
And then that thing goes into his ear,
you know?

209
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.220
And then for the rest of his life,

210
00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:05.370
he's listening to fucking blondie or something in one of his ears.

211
00:13:05.371 --> 00:13:09.870
They can't get it out or punches as ear dramas.
And I get sued,
you know,

212
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:15.510
all because I wanted to say hello to a comic.
Okay.
Do you understand that people,

213
00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:19.620
that's how quick it can happen.
That's how quickly you can lose your hearing.

214
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:22.310
<v 2>MMM.</v>

215
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:26.240
<v 3>By the way,
you know what's really fucking underrated?
A Old Lady Card Games.</v>

216
00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:32.290
I sat down with a relative of mine this past week and it was a deck of cards

217
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.750
there,
right?
They had like a little family union

218
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:38.250
<v 2>thing.
Right.
And,
uh,</v>

219
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.250
<v 3>one of my relatives,
she's a little bit older,
whatever.
I was just like,

221
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:51.050
And she was like,
yeah,
she proceeded to kick my ass for like the next hour,

222
00:13:51.051 --> 00:13:54.260
but we weren't on our smart phones,
weren't watching TV,

223
00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:59.990
weren't doing anything.
We just sit in there,
you know,
talking about the old days,

224
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:03.200
laughing,
having a good time,
giving each other shit,

225
00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.510
trying to remember how to keep score

226
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.350
<v 2>and um,</v>

227
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.680
<v 3>I dunno,
I a guy really got allows sitting there going like,
you know,</v>

228
00:14:11.681 --> 00:14:16.420
that's one of the coolest hangs I've had with this particular relative in a long

229
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:17.254
fucking time.

230
00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.850
<v 2>Um,
I dunno,</v>

231
00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.120
<v 3>it made me Kinda think like,
you know what,
I should,</v>

232
00:14:24.121 --> 00:14:25.830
I need to bring that into my life.

233
00:14:27.630 --> 00:14:28.463
<v 2>You know,</v>

234
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:32.400
<v 3>my kid's going to be hilarious.</v>

235
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:36.710
She's going to be like totally have this time.

236
00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:38.450
And then like know how to drive like,

237
00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:39.933
<v 2>okay,</v>

238
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:45.150
<v 3>a Ford f 103 on the tree.
She's going to know how to play Old Lady Card Games.</v>

239
00:14:45.151 --> 00:14:49.410
I forget.
Like I'll,
all this shit that's fucking good from back in the day.

240
00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.980
At least.
What I considered,
I'm going to teach her

241
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.770
<v 0>how to do,
um,
old school shit,</v>

242
00:14:54.771 --> 00:14:58.670
like knowing how to cook as opposed to just doing the Postmates Shit,

243
00:14:59.970 --> 00:15:02.600
you know,
you know,
whether she wants to do it or whatever,

244
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:05.600
she'll know how to do it,
you know what I mean?
Um,

245
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.760
I dunno
and maybe immediately think like,

246
00:15:11.761 --> 00:15:16.761
what if I just converted my entire garage into like a cigar bar and had friends

247
00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.360
over over.
We played cards,
I had a smoke eaters so we could smoke inside.

248
00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:22.831
Then I'm like,

249
00:15:22.831 --> 00:15:25.950
well I can't fucking do that because then I'll fucking die of throat and mouth

250
00:15:25.951 --> 00:15:29.790
cancer cause it'll just be too God damn fun.
You know what I mean?
It's weird.

251
00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:33.150
It's a really weird thing being an adult,
you know?

252
00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:36.140
And it's also even more weird figuring it out.
It's 50.

253
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.113
<v 2>MMM.</v>

254
00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.700
<v 0>Does he have that thing when all of a sudden,
you know,</v>

255
00:15:41.701 --> 00:15:44.280
I guess you go away to college,
you just move out and you're like,
okay,

256
00:15:44.281 --> 00:15:49.050
my parents aren't here anymore.
Now I can do whatever the fuck I want and

257
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.210
you do whatever the fuck you want for awhile.

258
00:15:53.250 --> 00:15:56.430
And then you just start paying for it.
And uh,

259
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.640
I've kind of been learning this really at my age,

260
00:15:59.641 --> 00:16:04.641
there's nothing better then going to bed sober and having eight hours of

261
00:16:05.011 --> 00:16:09.930
uninterrupted sleep.
If I do that

262
00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.030
and wake up,
stretch and then go to the gym,

263
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:19.890
I feel like,
like 15 years younger than I asked.

264
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.670
I feel like I'm in my thirties like it's fucking ridiculous.

265
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:24.230
Now having said that,

266
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.230
I planned to go back to booze,
you know,
at some point,

267
00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.910
but I just,
uh,

268
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:37.190
I got to get through tape and my special and then there's an outside chance I

269
00:16:37.191 --> 00:16:42.140
have another acting gig coming up and uh,
you know,

270
00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:46.610
cause you never know.
Now Jesus Christ,
you have no fucking idea.

271
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.400
You know,
it used to be back in the day,
if you,

272
00:16:49.401 --> 00:16:53.030
if you were on something this far into where I'm at with this deal,

273
00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.760
you were in there.
But in that,
nowadays,
you know,

274
00:16:55.761 --> 00:17:00.230
one fucking tweet or somebody reads some shit from fucking,
you know,

275
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.680
somebody pulls out a yearbook from the 80s.
I mean,
you know,

276
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:06.560
you don't know what can happen.
You don't know what's in there,
you don't,

277
00:17:06.561 --> 00:17:08.420
you don't know what the fuck other people have done.

278
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:12.680
And all it takes is one principle fucking person.

279
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.050
You know,
there's some fucking,
you know,

280
00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.980
VHS tape of him kicking a pigeon in the fucking beacon and then the whole

281
00:17:18.981 --> 00:17:22.430
fucking thing goes away.
So I dunno.
MMM.

282
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.060
So anyways,
there is a thing that I always like,
you know,

283
00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:29.870
I've always wanted to go an entire calendar year,

284
00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.900
January 1st through December 31st and not drink and just be like,

285
00:17:34.941 --> 00:17:37.760
I didn't drink that year.
So I think,
yeah.
Uh,

286
00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.080
I think this might be the year.
I don't know.
It's already cruising by.

287
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.200
I'm like fucking 11 weeks in already.
You know what's the point is stop.

288
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.250
And by the time I take my special,
that'd be another three weeks.
That's 14 weeks,

289
00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:55.380
52 weeks in a year,
52 minus 1438 weeks to go.

290
00:17:57.490 --> 00:18:02.110
I'm the,
I'm going to,
I can't make it through that.
I think I can do it.
Um,

291
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:06.300
but anyways,
what the fuck else did I want to talk about?

292
00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:11.220
I'm actually sitting here now late night just at a spot.
And,

293
00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:15.240
uh,
um,
I'm watching showtime boxing.

294
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:19.850
You know,
it's weird.
I,
I didn't realize HBO,

295
00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:24.520
like let go with a box box,
oops,
sorry.

296
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.680
Boxing after all of these years.
And then on top of that,

297
00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:33.010
uh,
Jim Lampley,
he's gone.

298
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:37.870
So they still got that Al Bernstein guy or whatever.
I don't know.
But they,

299
00:18:37.871 --> 00:18:42.430
they got all these new announcers and shit.
So it's a weird transition.

300
00:18:42.431 --> 00:18:44.110
You know what I mean?
It's like when you're a kid,

301
00:18:44.111 --> 00:18:49.111
like the voices of it is as big a part as,

302
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.050
as watching it.
So it just takes a while.
Like,
well,
I gotta be honest with you,

303
00:18:53.051 --> 00:18:55.390
like this transition of,
um,

304
00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:00.310
new announcers in the NFL really took me a while.

305
00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:06.730
Um,
and that's why I'm loving Tony Romo cause he's like the greatest,
like,

306
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:10.120
like all my God,
this guy,
like Tony Romo was still in his thirties,
right?

307
00:19:10.121 --> 00:19:14.230
Like this guy could announce for like another 30 fucking years in the level that

308
00:19:14.231 --> 00:19:18.790
he knows the game is.
This is like,
it's a great thing,
you know,
cause Al Michaels,

309
00:19:18.791 --> 00:19:22.780
I mean,
Al Michaels has gotten blabby what,
like in his seventies,
you know,

310
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:27.410
and uh,
just those voices that I grew,
I,

311
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.000
I'm so old.
Like I remember the end of curtain Goudy.

312
00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.500
Um,
there was,
uh,

313
00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.250
pat Summerall and um,

314
00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:43.030
John Madden for the longest time,
dawn crickey,

315
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.550
all of these guys and just,
they have voices.
What?
Just football?

316
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.680
Um,
oh shit.
I should have looked up some more of a,
about what's his face?

317
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:58.690
He just passed recently to see his face.
He's to host a game show.

318
00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:04.600
Oh my God,
I'm the fucking worst.
The fuck did I forget his name?
I Dunno.
Whatever.

319
00:20:04.601 --> 00:20:07.820
These guys were all the voices of it.
So,
anyway,

320
00:20:07.821 --> 00:20:12.760
so now I'm watching a box in here.
I'm like
enjoying the boxing,

321
00:20:12.761 --> 00:20:16.180
but I'm like,
there's voices.
Like,
who the fuck are these people talking?
Man?

322
00:20:16.181 --> 00:20:17.520
It's just,
it's a weird thing.
You know,

323
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.470
it's like when your favorite band gets like a new lead singer or something.

324
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.850
So let's,
let's say CDC,
somehow ACDC was able to do it.

325
00:20:24.851 --> 00:20:26.290
I don't even know what the fuck I'm talking about.

326
00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:28.900
All I know is this red is right around the time

327
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.820
when I would start doing advertising,
but I don't have any advertising yet.

328
00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.140
So let's see,
what else did I want to talk about?
Maybe I'll,
I'll,

329
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.950
I'll record the advertising after.
Maybe I'll do something like that.

330
00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:46.780
Oh,
I got one for you.
Oh,
I'm watching the boxing by the way.
The boxing.

331
00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:47.614
That's old.
I am.

332
00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:50.363
<v 2>MMM.
Okay.</v>

333
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:52.450
<v 0>I want your boxing in the,
uh,</v>

334
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.920
you know what's funny is the UFC is so fucking destroyed.

335
00:20:56.921 --> 00:21:01.780
This sport fucking destroyed this sport while they were destroying themselves

336
00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:07.140
with the corruption and people ducking fights and just bad decisions and all of

337
00:21:08.471 --> 00:21:11.530
that,
basically throughout my whole fucking life.

338
00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.590
But they have so destroyed them.
But you know what's funny,

339
00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:18.080
I shouldn't even bring this up.
It's just funny to me.

340
00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.450
Nobody's really paying attention to it.

341
00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:23.720
So like when the ring girls get in the crowd,

342
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:28.730
there's still all these people going,
whoo,
I'm in fucking whistle in and shit.

343
00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.770
Like a fucking bugs bunny cartoon.
They,

344
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:33.740
all you're do doing is not barking like a dog and stomp on their foot on the

345
00:21:33.741 --> 00:21:38.000
fucking floor.
You know what I mean?
But as I've always maintained,
like when it,

346
00:21:38.001 --> 00:21:40.310
when it comes to this getting offended shit,

347
00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:44.720
that it has to be something big enough that they'll waste their time,

348
00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.300
uh,
attaching their wagon.
Oh my God.
Is that far as,

349
00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.020
is Larry Merchant gone?

350
00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:56.710
Larry merchant.
I mean Jesus Christ that he,

351
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:59.130
that guy is like a constant.

352
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:01.953
<v 2>MMM.</v>

353
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.121
<v 0>Yeah.
He,
he,</v>

354
00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:06.360
there was just certain fighters you could tell he just fucking hated them,

355
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:08.513
you know?

356
00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.510
And he would never say anything positive and then he'd go in the ring and start

357
00:22:12.511 --> 00:22:15.120
talking tough.
Like he was going to fucking do something.

358
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:17.543
<v 2>MMM.</v>

359
00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:21.480
<v 0>But I'll miss that guy.
You know,
he had that get off my lawn vibe.</v>

360
00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.230
<v 2>MMM.</v>

361
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:26.360
<v 0>But anyways,
I was looking at my,
uh,</v>

362
00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:31.540
my travel schedule for that run that I have that starts in Iceland and ends in

363
00:22:33.231 --> 00:22:34.064
Israel.

364
00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:37.053
<v 2>Uh Huh.</v>

365
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:42.200
<v 0>I have a day off between wherever the fuck I end and then flying over to Israel.</v>

366
00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:48.900
And on that day there's a moto GP race in Spain,

367
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:52.860
but I just think it's going to be too much to try and get to.

368
00:22:52.861 --> 00:22:55.250
But I really was going to try to catch a fucking racist shit.

369
00:22:55.251 --> 00:22:58.500
I was going to try to go to Austin but um,

370
00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.300
my schedules not working out,

371
00:23:00.301 --> 00:23:05.250
but I am so fucking ridiculously excited for Formula One in Moto GP to start

372
00:23:05.251 --> 00:23:09.000
back up again.
This is what gets me through.
It's,
you know,

373
00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:12.990
you got the dog days of summer with baseball.
This is like the dog days before.

374
00:23:12.991 --> 00:23:17.070
I guess it's really just February now cause march madness is next month.

375
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.660
You know,
football's fucking over.
So much madness is next month.

376
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.280
But basketball and hockey,
it doesn't really start fucking matter in until like,

377
00:23:26.281 --> 00:23:28.170
you know,
Jesus Christ,
the beginning of April,

378
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.120
you figuring out who's going to be what seed or whatever.
Uh,

379
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.190
speaking in which congratulations to the Lakers in the last second shot.

380
00:23:35.191 --> 00:23:38.790
Beat my fucking Boston Celtics.
Um,

381
00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:45.210
I dunno what's going on with the Celtics.
I got the stupid fucking do,

382
00:23:45.211 --> 00:23:47.780
they call it the hardwood classic package.
And I,

383
00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:52.130
I've watched like three Bruins games this year in like half a Celtics game over

384
00:23:52.131 --> 00:23:54.680
Christmas.
I've just been so goddamn busy,
it's killing me.

385
00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:55.940
I don't know what's going on.

386
00:23:55.941 --> 00:24:00.860
All I know is we have all his talent on the Celtics and I don't know if they're

387
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:04.910
underachieving or what,
but like I said,

388
00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:08.400
I was doing that acting Gig last week and one of the guys on the set today,

389
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.380
what's up with Kyrie?
Is he going to go to la?
Um,

390
00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.510
so just the fact that he was asking that made me,
uh,

391
00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:23.360
made me a little bit nervous.
Um,
hey,

392
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:27.350
by the way,
I'm watching this for this Davis Ruiz fight.
Is that I hope though,

393
00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.450
that's how you say his fucking name.
And uh,

394
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.970
if I half a second,
I thought it was in Los Angeles,
I was like,
Jesus Christ,

395
00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:38.960
I could have fucking gone to that.
But it's in Carson city,
Nevada.

396
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.870
And I was just thinking that's one of the few cities I've never been to.

397
00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.540
You know,
I've been to,
I've been to all the A's,

398
00:24:45.541 --> 00:24:49.230
all the B's in most of the CS c level cities.

399
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.200
Not saying that you city sucks,
it's just,
you know,

400
00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:56.040
there's no professional sports team there.
You know,

401
00:24:56.100 --> 00:25:00.000
there's no traffic is a bit of a math problem.
You know,

402
00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:02.250
you know the characteristics of a city city.

403
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:08.890
You're downtown still.
You can still,
if you squint your eyes,

404
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.570
you're surprised.
Like call younger and Jesse James Aren't walking up the street.

405
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:18.590
It's still has that,
you know,
wild west look about it.

406
00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:19.670
At least it does out here.

407
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:23.360
Carson city actually that is the capital of Nevada and I've never fucking been

408
00:25:23.361 --> 00:25:28.010
there.
A lot of people,
if you were to ask them,
hey man,

409
00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.710
like what's the Capitol in Nevada?
They would be like,
well,

410
00:25:30.711 --> 00:25:34.490
I would have to say that's Las Vegas.
And if you said no,
they'd be like,
okay,

411
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:40.040
a fucking Reno.
And you'd be like,
all right,
there's no reason to swear at me.

412
00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:41.930
But no,
it's not reno.

413
00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.560
Then they might even guess Loughlin before they would get,

414
00:25:46.561 --> 00:25:50.550
I don't even know where the fuck it is with the Carson city.
I was just south,

415
00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:56.070
just south of Reno.
I Love Reno.

416
00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.200
I fucking loved me.
Oh,
there's Lake Tahoe maybe.
I have been in,

417
00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.370
I've been to Lake Tahoe.
Jesus Christ said,

418
00:26:05.371 --> 00:26:08.790
I just like pass right through Carson city.
That even fucking realize it.

419
00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:12.420
How the fuck did Carson city ended up being the capital?

420
00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:17.670
This has gotta be like some sort of gold rush,
cowboy shit.
By the way,

421
00:26:17.671 --> 00:26:22.671
there's a movie out called the man who killed Hitler and then the big foot

422
00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:26.190
starring Sam Elliot.
All right.

423
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.940
If you don't fucking immediately try and find out how you can watch that movie.

424
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.030
You are no friend of mine.
It's about a guy,

425
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:37.370
you know the character.

426
00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:42.380
He's the guy that found Hitler and killed him in World War II and now they're

427
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:45.990
pulling him out retirement because the big foot,

428
00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:49.890
not big foot,
the big foot,
just like I'm watching the boxing.

429
00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:52.133
<v 1>All right.</v>

430
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.720
<v 0>He has to go to Canada and kill the big foot because evidently big foot is</v>

431
00:27:00.691 --> 00:27:05.691
walking around carrying some sort of plague that could wipe out human beings.

432
00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.323
<v 1>So,</v>

433
00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:11.670
<v 0>and evidently,</v>

434
00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:16.670
I guess big foot is the Hitler of like,

435
00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.880
uh,
uh,
uh,
abominable snowman.
How do you say that fucking word?
I Dunno.

436
00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.653
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

437
00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:26.820
<v 0>Like what,
what I dunno of Apes.
What fucking world does,</v>

438
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.100
let me look this up right now.
This is,

439
00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:34.210
this is why the feds will never come and pick me up.

440
00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:35.411
They'll never worry.

441
00:27:35.411 --> 00:27:40.411
No matter how much conspiracy theory I say that I might be right about when they

442
00:27:40.451 --> 00:27:42.340
just checked my Google searches here.

443
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:44.150
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

444
00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:44.990
<v 0>They'll just be like,
all right,</v>

445
00:27:44.991 --> 00:27:49.400
this guy is not a threat because of this Google search right now.

446
00:27:49.401 --> 00:27:52.070
What kind of animal,

447
00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:54.060
<v 1>okay.</v>

448
00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:59.050
<v 0>Is
Somebody said big bird,</v>

449
00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:03.120
big foot.
I wonder if I'm the first one to ever searched that.

450
00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.610
What kind of animal,

451
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.750
big foot or Scotch swatch are said to be Harry Upright walking.

452
00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:15.640
Is it from any sort of family?
You know,

453
00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.390
it's,
um,
it's like an eight fucked bill.
Walton is,

454
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.660
as far as I can tell in North American folklore,

455
00:28:25.661 --> 00:28:30.661
big foot or Sasquatch are said to be Harry Upright walking ape like creatures

456
00:28:30.971 --> 00:28:33.820
that dwell in the wilderness and leave footprints.

457
00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:35.840
That's the funny thing about big foot.

458
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:40.850
What the fuck is that thing ever really done?
Yeah.

459
00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:45.360
It walks around.
Okay.
Is,
you know,
a Sasquatch.

460
00:28:45.361 --> 00:28:47.670
You gotta leave your footprints all over the fucking place.

461
00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:49.493
<v 1>You know,</v>

462
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:53.000
<v 0>it's always running away.
It hasn't really done anything.</v>

463
00:28:53.001 --> 00:28:57.110
That's why I love this movie.
They've somehow found a reason.

464
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

465
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.070
<v 0>For man to finally find big foot and then kill the fucking thing.</v>

466
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:11.620
All right.
If I was writing that screenplay,
okay.

467
00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:16.750
Big Foot,
having that fucking,
you know,
carrying the plague.

468
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.570
Um,
in the end you would find out that it was all bullshit.

469
00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:28.420
You know,
that it wasn't really doing anything.

470
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.880
It's just where it was walking around.

471
00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.890
There was a lot of oil underneath the land where it was walking around.
So

472
00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:42.720
the government then demonize big foot and said that it could take down this

473
00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:48.610
entire first world nation because it's walking around with the fucking,

474
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.750
with scarlet fever.
First of all,
nobody's ever seen big foot.

475
00:29:52.751 --> 00:29:54.580
They don't know where the fuck the thing is.

476
00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:57.760
There's never really been a good picture of the goddamn thing yet.

477
00:29:57.761 --> 00:29:59.770
Somehow they know it has the fucking plague.

478
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:04.840
All I know is Sam Elliot's in it and I'm going to fucking watch that movie.
Um,

479
00:30:06.670 --> 00:30:10.480
is it in theaters?
You know something.
Can you fuck him?

480
00:30:10.481 --> 00:30:14.320
I still can't believe aqua man made all that money,
mate.
I mean,
God,

481
00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:15.400
I mean happy it did.

482
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:19.990
I'm happy some movies making some fucking money made 250 fucking million
dollars.

483
00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:27.020
I,
I can't believe people saw that fucking movie.
Aqua man.

484
00:30:27.021 --> 00:30:31.280
He's a superhero in the ocean.
A fish don't commit crimes.

485
00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.950
I know you want to go see it.
Yeah.

486
00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.230
I didn't see that movie.

487
00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.480
What I would do is if I was right now Aquaman,

488
00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:48.770
Aquaman is fucking pissed off because of that swirl a trash out in the fucking

489
00:30:48.771 --> 00:30:53.720
Pacific Ocean and he's fine because he's not really a person is right.

490
00:30:54.170 --> 00:30:57.320
That should be my next Google search.
What kind of fish is aqua Aquaman?

491
00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:02.150
What did aqua man do you know where he is?
Some pirate fucked a mermaid.

492
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:07.630
Okay.
And that's,
and then the mermaid gave birth to Aquaman.

493
00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.390
Alright.
Aqua man grew up without a dad.

494
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.800
It's probably a viking with his blonde hair.
He used to have blond hair anyways.

495
00:31:15.801 --> 00:31:20.000
I don't know.
When I was a kid he had blonde hair and an orange shirt,
you know,

496
00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.470
and now he looks like the fucking undertaker

497
00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.810
anyways,
undertake his nephew.
So anyways,
I was right in that fucking movie.

498
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.750
Alright.
Some Viking banged in mermaid.
Oh,

499
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:39.590
who's kid knew historically speaking,
probably raped her.
Right?

500
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:43.070
So he's the right baby,
have a Viking in a mermaid.

501
00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:47.780
All right,
so his dad's not around and he's a rapist.

502
00:31:47.781 --> 00:31:51.460
So there's no reason to look that guy up.
Plus he's on land,
any his gills,

503
00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.490
it can fucking breathe underwater and he sorta speaks through like waves.

504
00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.470
So I mean
it's bad enough.
You got to try and fucking,
you know,

505
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:04.730
call up a rapist on father's date now.
I mean,
you don't really speak,

506
00:32:04.731 --> 00:32:08.490
so how can you communicate with them?
And then the mom,
you know,

507
00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.450
sort of shuns him because of obviously how she got pregnant.

508
00:32:11.451 --> 00:32:13.460
So he just sort of fucking,
you know,

509
00:32:15.490 --> 00:32:16.750
he has issues with his mom.

510
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:21.100
Definitely doesn't like his dad and his dad's really the only land dwelling at

511
00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:25.060
any knows.
So he's just like,
you know what?
Fuck this man.
I don't need anybody.

512
00:32:25.061 --> 00:32:28.540
I'm just going to hang in the ocean with my fish friend.
Right.
Cause Fish,

513
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.690
you know,
they don't fucking judge them or anything.
They take them in like the,

514
00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.830
you know,
like the wolf's with the babies that get left out in the woods.

515
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:40.990
All right.
Just,
just bear with me.
I'm going to get somewhere with this.

516
00:32:40.991 --> 00:32:45.790
So then the fucking guy,
you know,
as he gets older and older and older,

517
00:32:45.791 --> 00:32:48.190
right?
They just stay,
just sitting there.
Uh,

518
00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:53.830
all this trash keeps getting dumped in the ocean and finally he can't fucking

519
00:32:53.831 --> 00:32:54.790
take it anymore.

520
00:32:57.090 --> 00:33:01.140
And he just goes on land and he starts fucking taking people out.

521
00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.160
Like Charles Bronson and Deathwish.
All right.

522
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:11.680
You know,
and like death wish it starts with a rape.
All right,
put in this one.

523
00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.293
He is,

524
00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.810
he's doing it for the environment and the first people he kills her hoarders.

525
00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:23.230
Well I guess hoarders he likes cause they don't put it,
throw it in the ocean.

526
00:33:24.010 --> 00:33:28.330
You know what I mean?
He'd go after all those people know,
you know,

527
00:33:28.510 --> 00:33:32.770
it fucking kill.
He killed those people that,
that uh,

528
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:37.660
made that TV show about being minimalists that encourage all these people after

529
00:33:37.661 --> 00:33:40.720
they bought all this shit to just go down and dump it at goodwill and then

530
00:33:40.721 --> 00:33:43.810
goodwill just throws it in the fucking ocean or whatever the fuck it is they do

531
00:33:43.811 --> 00:33:46.210
with it.
You know what I mean?
Um,

532
00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:51.780
man,
all the people I that I thought he was killing,

533
00:33:51.810 --> 00:33:52.790
I really think about it wouldn't kill.

534
00:33:52.791 --> 00:33:55.400
I was thinking about people in storage wars.
He killed them.
He wouldn't,

535
00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:59.180
those people are taken shit that usually get thrown out and they fucking buy it

536
00:33:59.181 --> 00:34:00.980
and they find some stupid fucked up by it.

537
00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.220
I think he just hangs out at a goodwill and just people show up at their garbage

538
00:34:08.221 --> 00:34:12.690
bags of shit.
He just fucking takes them and before the cops can get there,
right.

539
00:34:12.691 --> 00:34:16.260
The cops chase him back to the fucking ocean.
You know,

540
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:22.500
maybe he goes to that swirl of trash and he just find shit and he just goes

541
00:34:22.501 --> 00:34:27.150
through and he finds addresses.
I don't fucking know.
I'll be honest with you.

542
00:34:27.151 --> 00:34:28.680
I didn't even want,
I'm talking about at this point,

543
00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:35.410
I'm just telling you how I would do movies that I never saw.
I don't what,

544
00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:36.900
what the fuck did they do with aqua man?

545
00:34:36.901 --> 00:34:39.900
And then they gave him that chicken of the sea fucking pitchfork.

546
00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.470
I didn't understand it.
Is He mad that we're eating tuna?

547
00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.880
We're killing all his friends.
You know,
if that's the case,

548
00:34:47.881 --> 00:34:50.700
he should start in Japan.
They're the ones that's doing all the Sushi.

549
00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:55.480
They started that shit.
Right.
See,
I'm trying to get it out of my country.
Um,

550
00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:57.690
all right,
so there you go.

551
00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:00.780
Now I don't know where to go from here because now I only have like a fucking

552
00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:04.800
half hour left.
I still have to do advertising and reads.
Okay.

553
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:09.740
Um,
you know,
read your question.
So that's what I'll do on Monday.

554
00:35:09.741 --> 00:35:13.430
I'll just bang out the last 25 minutes of this.
Um,

555
00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:18.290
this has been the first half of the podcast,
the ramblings of a lonely man.

556
00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:20.940
<v 1>Okay.</v>

557
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.760
<v 0>Who was in a hotel room and he wants to call the front desk,</v>

558
00:35:23.761 --> 00:35:27.810
but there's no information on how exactly I'm supposed to fucking do that.

559
00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:32.040
But it's a good thing because I was going to order food and I'm not fucking

560
00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:33.540
hungry anymore.
All right.

561
00:35:33.541 --> 00:35:38.490
I'm going to watch this God damn fight and through the magic of and time.

562
00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.540
<v 3>Uh,
there'll be no delay on your podcast.
Just know the next time I talk,</v>

563
00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.233
<v 2>uh,</v>

564
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:48.270
<v 3>I don't know what it'd be Sunday and Monday.
I know.
Fucking know.</v>

565
00:35:48.271 --> 00:35:51.170
What do you give a shit,
right?
Cause it's going to be a half a second delay field

566
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:58.290
and just like that.
Now I'm in Los Angeles.
Isn't that amazing?

567
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:03.180
Isn't that amazing?
What an edit can do to you.

568
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:06.960
That was one second for me.
That was a fucking,
you know,
it's Monday morning.

569
00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.030
Um,
I almost feel like I have to do the intro.
So much time has gone by,

570
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:16.410
by the way.
I believe the last thing I was talking about Saturday,

571
00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:17.270
Saturday deal.

572
00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:22.290
Why don't you fucking come over on Saturday,

573
00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.200
Saturday,
Saturday,
say,
um,

574
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:31.280
now the card game that I played crazy eights or some people call it dirty

575
00:36:31.591 --> 00:36:34.830
eights,
that's just a great fucking game.

576
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:39.450
And I suddenly realized,

577
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.990
you know,
cause I went over one of my relatives,

578
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:45.480
<v 2>uh,</v>

579
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.540
<v 3>domiciles there and I'm just fucking,</v>

580
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:54.250
I was just walking around all wound up like I usually am brain going a mile a

581
00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:59.690
minute,
can't fucking shut it off.
You know,

582
00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:05.860
the only thing that I've found that can shut it off is copious amounts of

583
00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:10.280
alcohol or sitting down and smoking a cigar.

584
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:14.390
Neither of them are good for you.
But I found with cards,

585
00:37:14.391 --> 00:37:17.960
if I just sit down,
there's something about shuffling the car's handling,

586
00:37:17.961 --> 00:37:22.670
the cards gets rid of that energy and I fucking chill out.

587
00:37:22.671 --> 00:37:27.650
And then amazingly enough,
when I play cards,

588
00:37:27.651 --> 00:37:32.600
I have to learn how to control my emotions or else people know what's in my
hand.

589
00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:37.390
I found it very therapeutic.
You know,

590
00:37:37.391 --> 00:37:41.890
the TV wasn't on the entire time I was there and I didn't look at my smartphone

591
00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:44.800
and my head felt clearer.

592
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.900
So I think I learned.
So I think I'm already a scatterbrain

593
00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:55.270
and,
uh,
all the TV screens and phone screens do not help.

594
00:37:55.271 --> 00:37:58.540
Someone like that doesn't help someone like me is my brain's like,
oh,

595
00:37:58.541 --> 00:38:01.120
what about this?
I thought about this.
Well,
I'll fucking look that up.
Oh,

596
00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:04.340
is that what that is?
Oh,
what does this link to?
Oh,
what,
what,

597
00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:07.660
what does so and so look like now that will surprise me,
you know,

598
00:38:07.661 --> 00:38:08.590
and then I'm just fucking,

599
00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.950
there goes two hours of my life and then I'm laying in bed and I can't fucking

600
00:38:11.951 --> 00:38:13.960
get to sleep.
So

601
00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:17.540
I'm going to try to get my wife into playing cards,

602
00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.320
although I don't think she's going to do it because she's inherently a chill

603
00:38:21.321 --> 00:38:25.370
person.
And I'm worried that if she starts playing cards,

604
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:28.640
she might literally not off and fall backwards out of the chair.

605
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:33.420
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

606
00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.220
<v 3>But anyways,
oh,
Billy freckles.</v>

607
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:41.680
All Billy freckles,
79 days,
no fucking booze.
And I'm,
I've got,
I met,

608
00:38:41.770 --> 00:38:46.030
I am getting shit done.
I did a couple of things that I would never do.

609
00:38:46.031 --> 00:38:50.740
I edited two episodes of,
uh,
efforts or family,

610
00:38:50.741 --> 00:38:52.960
went through the script and through in my punchlines,

611
00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:57.040
did it on the fucking plane and there is no way,

612
00:38:58.540 --> 00:39:02.530
all right.
When it's not the off season,
if I'm playing,

613
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.970
if the season has started,

614
00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.550
there is no fucking way I would have gotten half of that done.

615
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:10.090
I would've sat there on the plane,
I would've watched a movie,

616
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:15.460
I would have had one and I'd be like,
Hey,
I like this failing.
Can we enhance it?

617
00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:19.580
Yeah.
So
I don't know.

618
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:24.160
Do they have like binge drinker Aa meetings?

619
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:29.920
You know,
everybody there is just like board,
like,
yeah.
You know,
I could stop,

620
00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.620
you know,
I don't need the fucking,
you know,
I dunno.

621
00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:38.530
I just named me to a place where they're playing cards or some shit.
Yeah.
Bill.

622
00:39:38.531 --> 00:39:42.220
It's called the casino.
Um,
you don't,
and you don't have to drink.

623
00:39:42.221 --> 00:39:45.820
You can make that choice for yourself.
You can be brave.

624
00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:50.890
You can be a warrior.
He'd be all of these fucking things.

625
00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:56.140
Um,
alright,
hang on a second.
Anyways,

626
00:39:56.141 --> 00:40:00.910
I need to read some of the advertising here for this week here.
Oh,

627
00:40:00.911 --> 00:40:03.280
you know what,
I was coming back from New York City,

628
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:05.500
so I always get the New York Post.
That's my thing,
man.

629
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:07.360
I read the post and the Daily News,

630
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:11.140
but mostly the post cause I like the sports section better.
Um,

631
00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:16.660
I,
uh,
you know,
I was reading this shit,
you know,

632
00:40:16.661 --> 00:40:20.410
the Yankees like spring training started and it's so fucking funny,

633
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:23.860
like the Yankee Mindset,

634
00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:28.260
which is totally George Steinbrenner,
where like we,

635
00:40:28.261 --> 00:40:31.750
we haven't won a world series,
you know,

636
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:35.770
we lost to the red sox to the honeymoon is over and blah,
blah blah,
blah,
blah.

637
00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.970
But there's always a,
there's always this threat,
you know,

638
00:40:39.971 --> 00:40:42.610
with that whatever manager they have a whatever,

639
00:40:42.611 --> 00:40:47.380
there's always this constant pressure that like they have to somehow do the

640
00:40:47.381 --> 00:40:51.370
impossible,
which is to win the way they used to win.
Well,

641
00:40:51.371 --> 00:40:54.430
actually they would accept the way they want in the late nineties,
but um,

642
00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.400
I do respect that out of that franchise.

643
00:40:58.420 --> 00:41:00.850
But it's also funny because it's an empty threat.
Like,

644
00:41:00.851 --> 00:41:02.950
what are you going to stop watching?
You know,

645
00:41:02.951 --> 00:41:06.670
we all know we're not going to abandon our teams.
At least the real fans one.

646
00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.820
Alright.

Oh Man.
You know why they went off the rails,

678
00:43:12.481 --> 00:43:16.650
but I crushed it in the end.
Simply safe.

679
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:23.280
Are you simple and you want to be safe.
We have a solution for you.

680
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:25.890
So here's a timely stat stat for you.

681
00:43:26.790 --> 00:43:31.740
I'm almost half of us make a new year,
new year's resolution every single year.

682
00:43:31.741 --> 00:43:35.190
We've all made them,
and most of us probably broken.
I'm not me,
man.

683
00:43:35.191 --> 00:43:38.220
I said it wasn't drinking this year and I'm still sober.

684
00:43:38.790 --> 00:43:41.430
I'm better than you happens to the best of us,

685
00:43:41.431 --> 00:43:43.860
but one resolution worth sticking to this year,

686
00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.590
keeping your home and family safe.

687
00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:51.120
That's why I recommend simply safe home security.
Evidently,

688
00:43:51.121 --> 00:43:54.090
according to the copy,
I didn't realize that I recommended it.

689
00:43:54.091 --> 00:43:56.550
I thought I'd just read it because they gave me money over there.

690
00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:01.820
Simply safe is a 24 seven home security is 24 seven home security with no

691
00:44:02.281 --> 00:44:04.080
contracts or catch catches.

692
00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.170
They believe the safest place on earth should be your home.

693
00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:11.430
So you feel protected every time you shut your door and leave for work or shut

694
00:44:11.431 --> 00:44:13.170
your eyes at night.

695
00:44:14.730 --> 00:44:17.130
How safe this Ted Nugent feel at home?
You know,

696
00:44:17.131 --> 00:44:21.480
he walks around with like a fucking guns strapped to each leg and a crossbow

697
00:44:21.481 --> 00:44:24.450
around his fucking back.
More than three electric.
See,

698
00:44:24.451 --> 00:44:27.330
somebody shoot me when I take a piss in my own house.

699
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:32.520
More than 3 million people instead of leaves know in his hat,

700
00:44:32.521 --> 00:44:35.640
he probably has like wallpaper,
you know,
so he blends in with his house.

701
00:44:35.970 --> 00:44:38.790

Jerry's berries.
Why are you bugging,
uh,

715
00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:38.440
talk about your plans for Valentine's Day this year.

716
00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:42.340
What would you do if you weren't procrastinating?
I didn't procrastinate.

717
00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:46.630
I had my wife reach out to somebody of influence and they got us a reservation

718
00:45:46.631 --> 00:45:51.040
at a fucking restaurant that we wouldn't be able to get into if I just called

719
00:45:51.041 --> 00:45:53.840
myself.
Do you know who I am?

720
00:45:54.110 --> 00:45:56.900
I did a half hour comedy central once.

721
00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.093
<v 1>Hello.</v>

722
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:03.470
<v 3>Well going to Mcdonald's.
All right.
Um,</v>

723
00:46:03.950 --> 00:46:06.680
share a personal Valentine's Day story.

724
00:46:07.250 --> 00:46:11.240
What are your must gives you gotta get a Ricard.

725
00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.303
<v 6>Okay.</v>

726
00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:19.000
<v 0>Uh,
you got to get her some flowers.
You got it.</v>

727
00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:23.660
You can't just give her the card and have something that some stranger wrote

728
00:46:25.290 --> 00:46:26.790
for whoever bought the card.

729
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:31.780
You have to add a paragraph of your own shit

730
00:46:33.810 --> 00:46:37.980
and you have to write that paragraph out on something else.

731
00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:42.180
So when you inevitably have a spelling error or run out of room or something

732
00:46:42.181 --> 00:46:46.650
like that,
you don't do it on the card and then you painstakingly copy it

733
00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:52.830
over to the,
the new card and then you hand at your wife.

734
00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.500
She reads it in three seconds and goes,

735
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:56.900
<v 1>oh,
okay,</v>

736
00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.753
<v 0>reaches over,</v>

737
00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:03.840
gives you a nice kiss and then looks over your shoulder to see if there's a

738
00:47:03.841 --> 00:47:08.841
package in some sort of heart shape rapping to see if she got some shiny shit so

739
00:47:10.501 --> 00:47:15.501
she can decide at what level she's going to fuck you that night she going to go

740
00:47:16.261 --> 00:47:17.310
through the motions.

741
00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:23.480
Is she going to give you the first three months of your relationship sex or is

742
00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:25.860
she going to take it to another level?

743
00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:33.240
<v 3>It all depends on whether or not there's a tray of Sherry berries over your</v>

744
00:47:34.001 --> 00:47:38.110
shoulder.
When she goes to hug you,
I mean,
come on people,

745
00:47:38.111 --> 00:47:39.970
do I even need to read the copy after this?

746
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:44.950
I'll do it just as an exercise in trying to get better on how to re reading out

747
00:47:44.951 --> 00:47:49.870
loud.
Okay.
Um,
never go wrong with the,
um,

748
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:55.090

749
00:47:55.091 --> 00:47:58.930
dark or white chocolatey goodness for any discerning palate.

750
00:47:59.170 --> 00:48:01.630
She'll fall in love with every bite.

751
00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:08.020
Stop cheating on a talk with decadent toppings,
chocolate chips,

752
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:10.000
heart and glitters sprinkles,
honey,

753
00:48:10.001 --> 00:48:13.720
I have to admit I'm having an emotional affair.

From reddit Los Angeles then and now follow up.

794
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:45.740
I love that someone gave me this here cause I'm going to go back to reading

795
00:50:45.741 --> 00:50:47.270
books now.
Like I read a lot of them,

796
00:50:47.271 --> 00:50:51.440
but like I really think that my brain does not do well.

797
00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:56.160
Watching a bunch of shows and screens and stuff.
I just,

798
00:50:56.161 --> 00:50:59.670
I find I'm going to go,
I'm going to do some old people.
Shit.

799
00:50:59.671 --> 00:51:03.930
I'm going to play cards.
I'm gonna complain to the local,

800
00:51:03.931 --> 00:51:08.100
my local representative about the sidewalk Kevin and cracking it or whatever the

801
00:51:08.101 --> 00:51:11.580
fuck old people do.
Branding or whatever.
I'm going to read some books.
We'll see.

802
00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.310
Um,
there are a lot of,
my,

803
00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:18.540
my favorite things to do those with Reader's digest is to read the awful jokes

804
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:19.981
to my wife.

805
00:51:19.981 --> 00:51:23.340
And I know that that's a Jim Norton bit back from the Opie and Anthony Show.

806
00:51:23.341 --> 00:51:27.210
But I feel like if I do it in my bedroom,
I'm not stealing from him.

807
00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.650
Maybe I'll give them credit next time.

808
00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:32.670
He used to read the comics was one of my favorite bits that he would do.

809
00:51:34.290 --> 00:51:37.500
Um,
then the local news,
the newspaper,
daily comic,
sorry.

810
00:51:37.530 --> 00:51:42.160
There are a lot of books on Los Angeles history.
Ah,
this person writes,

811
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:47.440
I find the whole,
the whole thing fascinating.

812
00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:50.500
Why am I so much?

813
00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:52.053
<v 6>Okay.</v>

814
00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:57.640
<v 3>Uh,
even thought it's history even though it even thought,</v>

815
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:59.860
even though person wrote thought,

816
00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:02.740
even though it's history isn't as long as Boston,
Philly in New York,

817
00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.670
the whole thing is fascinating.
Um,
let me see.

818
00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:10.480
They said I made an album or this go to the page.
I would like to see this.

819
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:16.790
Let's see.
Oh yeah,
look at the old,
oh my goodness.

820
00:52:16.791 --> 00:52:20.700
Look at these old houses.
Holy Shit.

821
00:52:20.701 --> 00:52:22.980
They just knocked all of this shit down,
didn't they?

822
00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:29.590
Oh many times.
Must stay.
Plow it fucking over.
You know,

823
00:52:29.591 --> 00:52:33.520
a lot of old houses.
They just had that creepy fucking look.

824
00:52:33.521 --> 00:52:38.080
But these are credible and you don't want to just realize you guys can't see

825
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:41.800
them.
All right,
let's get back to whatever the fuck it was.
I was reading,
um,

826
00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.360
bad highlights.
Just how,

827
00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.640
<v 6>okay.</v>

828
00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:44.881
<v 3>Okay.</v>

829
00:52:44.881 --> 00:52:49.680
I met an album that highlights just how true bill's bulldoze everything is.

830
00:52:49.681 --> 00:52:54.570
La destroyed an entire historic neighborhood downtown to force the poor from the

831
00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:58.470
city center and build more economically viable skyscrapers.

832
00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:02.580
One of the darkest blemishes in Las history.
And that's not the only,

833
00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:03.510
that's not the,

834
00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:07.980
all the wall on the amount of neighborhoods destroyed and people displaced due

835
00:53:07.981 --> 00:53:12.510
to freeway construction is astronomic and is estimated at 300,000 people were

836
00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.920
displaced between 1940 and 1974.
The freeways,

837
00:53:16.921 --> 00:53:18.870
which pretty much destroyed the history.

838
00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:23.040
This historic city explains why La is more suburban,

839
00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:29.540
uh,
than cities San Francisco.
Yeah.
It's fascinating how they do all that stuff.

840
00:53:29.541 --> 00:53:32.600
You know,
there's eminent domain,
which means while we're building this freeway,

841
00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:36.560
you can take this money for your house or we'll just fucking take it from you.

842
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.570
Um,
I try not to get too sad about it.
I just look at it like,
you know,

843
00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:44.900
when those historic neighborhoods were being built,

844
00:53:44.901 --> 00:53:46.940
there was native Americans crying going,
you know,

845
00:53:46.941 --> 00:53:51.440
we used to fucking sit there and,
uh,
I dunno.
Skin of Buffalo,

846
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:53.630
whatever the fuck it.
I don't,
I don't,
I don't know what the fuck.
You know,

847
00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.340
there's always going to be somebody that you know,

848
00:53:55.341 --> 00:53:58.250
you know what used to be there,
so I don't know.

849
00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:03.250
Get a deck of cards and shut off your fucking TV and maybe you can have a nice

850
00:54:03.251 --> 00:54:07.810
20 minutes to yourself.
All right,
advice from Mormon at Byu.

851
00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:13.120
Um,
hey there ability nickname.
Uh,
last week on your podcast,

852
00:54:13.121 --> 00:54:17.050
you read a letter from a Mormon attending Byu asking for advice about leaving

853
00:54:17.051 --> 00:54:21.750
the church as a former Mormon.
That's a great former Mormon.

854
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:23.743
<v 2>Hi,</v>

855
00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:26.040
<v 3>I'm Mike Mormon.
I'm a former Mormon.</v>

856
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:31.860
Keep it going for the former Mormons who also grew up in Utah.

857
00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:35.100
I thought I could only offer a little advice for them.

858
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:38.300
I thought I could offer a little advice to them.

859
00:54:38.301 --> 00:54:42.290
I also went through something similar when I was 19 I told my parents I wasn't

860
00:54:42.291 --> 00:54:46.250
going to go on a mission,
which is a huge rite of passage in the Mormon religion.

861
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:46.761
Oh my God.

862
00:54:46.761 --> 00:54:50.900
They must've been crushed and then you've got to deal with upsetting the two

863
00:54:50.901 --> 00:54:53.240
people that you want the most approval approval from.

864
00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.180
They were really upset about it and it was hard for me to do,

865
00:54:56.181 --> 00:54:59.300
but I couldn't lie to myself anymore and try to believe in what the church

866
00:54:59.301 --> 00:55:01.010
teaches.
Not long after that,

867
00:55:01.011 --> 00:55:04.460
I moved out of my parents' house and started attending the University of Utah in

868
00:55:04.461 --> 00:55:07.970
Salt Lake City.
It seemed daunting at the time and I didn't know.

869
00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:11.480
I didn't think I would be able to afford it,
but somehow was able to do it.

870
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:12.320
Good for you.

871
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:15.710
The hardest part about leaving the church is that all that the other members

872
00:55:15.711 --> 00:55:19.460
will ask you a million questions about why you're leaving and they're always

873
00:55:19.461 --> 00:55:20.940
trying to convince you to come back.

874
00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:25.090
Obviously you can't shut out your family completely,

875
00:55:25.091 --> 00:55:27.400
but if you don't believe in what the Church teaches,

876
00:55:27.730 --> 00:55:31.720
then you're not doing yourself any favors by staying just because it's routine.

877
00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:35.470
Take it from me.
I left the church a long time ago and I don't regret it.

878
00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:39.130
The people I know who have regrets are the ones I went to high school with,

879
00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:41.350
stay in the church,
went on missions,

880
00:55:41.640 --> 00:55:45.640
gotten married in the temple and ended up leaving Mormonism.
Anyway.
Uh,

881
00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:48.400
they all say that they would do things differently if they had to do it over

882
00:55:48.401 --> 00:55:51.760
again.
The Mormon church isn't going anywhere.
It will always be there.

883
00:55:51.761 --> 00:55:54.610
If you eventually decided to go back,
decided to go back,

884
00:55:54.611 --> 00:55:57.910
but you'll never get your time back if you decide to stay in the church and then

885
00:55:58.060 --> 00:55:58.893
ended up regretting it.

886
00:55:59.170 --> 00:56:02.560
I hope this helps and I'm sure you'll meet people who feel the exact same way

887
00:56:02.561 --> 00:56:07.180
you do.
I've met tons of them and they really helped me out anyways,
as always.

888
00:56:07.181 --> 00:56:10.420
Thanks and go hug yourself.
Wow.
Yeah.
I imagine if you know,

889
00:56:10.421 --> 00:56:13.600
if you looked for some sort of support group online,

890
00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.580
you could probably find a way to do that.
And I like what he said.

891
00:56:18.581 --> 00:56:22.930
The church is always going to be there.
You can always come back,
you know,

892
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.190
or you know,
maybe you enjoy it as much as this guy does and you stay out.

893
00:56:27.191 --> 00:56:31.480
There you go.
It's your life.
You choose.
All right,
advice from Warman.
Here we go.

894
00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:36.520
Here's another one,
dear Billy bow,
B a.
L.
B a.
L.

895
00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:41.020
Look it up.
All right.
Was this Mormon football bag?
Let's see.

896
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:45.920
B,
a L.

897
00:56:45.920 --> 00:56:50.190
Mormon word.
How many times ball.

898
00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:52.390
<v 6>Okay.</v>

899
00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:55.430
<v 3>All right.
What the fuck is this?</v>

900
00:56:56.690 --> 00:57:00.140
This is some deep religious shit here.
Bible dictionary.

901
00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:04.850
B,
a l,
possessor Lord.

902
00:57:04.851 --> 00:57:07.700
The Sun God in the mail or,

903
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:09.583
<v 6>hmm.</v>

904
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:12.130
<v 3>Generative principal in nature.</v>

905
00:57:12.580 --> 00:57:17.440
He was worshiped with different ideas and rights in different places.

906
00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.770
So it's a possessor.
Lord.

907
00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:28.220
The Fuck is a possessor.
Lord.
Is that a landlord for Jesus?
I don't.

908
00:57:28.221 --> 00:57:30.170
I don't even know what that means.
This is why I,

909
00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:34.670
why I just try to keep my life simple.
Cause even if I don't know a word,

910
00:57:34.671 --> 00:57:37.880
if I look it up,
I still don't know the word.
All I'm left with is more questions.

911
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:43.390
Just wanted to chime in on the advice that she gave that kid at Byu.

912
00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:46.580
Okay,
good.
Cause I didn't think I gave him good advice.
I had no idea what I,

913
00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.573
whatever.

914
00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:52.010
I grew up Catholic on the east coast and converted to Mormonism when I was 18

915
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:57.200
then a year later I left my top 20 college to serve a mission in Las Vegas.

916
00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:02.390
You went to Las Vegas to try and convert people.
Jesus Christ.

917
00:58:02.391 --> 00:58:04.040
You dove in with both feet.

918
00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:05.780
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

919
00:58:05.780 --> 00:58:08.360
<v 3>Can I just talk to you for a second about Mormonism?</v>

920
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:10.110
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

921
00:58:10.110 --> 00:58:12.930
<v 3>Some guy sitting at a blackjack table,
he's on a roll or even worse,</v>

922
00:58:12.931 --> 00:58:16.440
he's fucking losing.
When I got back,
my school wouldn't take me.

923
00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.850
I was in a music program for drums and hadn't practiced in two years,

924
00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:25.080
so I'd hope to go to Byu for a year and build my chops back up before I could

925
00:58:25.081 --> 00:58:26.580
get back into my original program.

926
00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:29.083
<v 6>Wait a minute.</v>

927
00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:34.260
<v 3>What do you mean?
In what way would the fuck does your school not take you?</v>

928
00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:36.760
I was a grew up Catholic.
He converted Mormonism.

929
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:40.300
You left your top 20 colleges to serve a mission in Las Vegas?

930
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:43.930
When I got back my school wouldn't take me.
Oh.

931
00:58:43.931 --> 00:58:45.730
So I had to go to Byu,

932
00:58:49.380 --> 00:58:49.440
uh,

933
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:53.030
for a year and build my chops back up before I could get back into my original

934
00:58:53.031 --> 00:58:55.610
program.
Ah,
cause you haven't played drums in two years.
All right.

935
00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.840
I got married in the church and because my parents weren't members they couldn't

936
00:58:59.841 --> 00:59:01.580
go to the ceremony in the temple.

937
00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:07.310
What we did have a separate ring ceremony from my friends and family is the

938
00:59:07.311 --> 00:59:11.990
marriage in the temple is usually small with a little pomp and circumstance.
Um,

939
00:59:11.991 --> 00:59:15.170
I can't think of anything that I've heard that has hurt my parents as much as

940
00:59:15.171 --> 00:59:18.830
the decision that I had made surrounding my beliefs.
The long talks,

941
00:59:18.831 --> 00:59:23.150
the arguments,
the crying,
the pain of not around their sun,
et cetera.

942
00:59:23.330 --> 00:59:26.660
It was very hard on my family.
Through all of that though,

943
00:59:26.661 --> 00:59:29.240
they want me to be happy and want me to be me.

944
00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:33.320
We are closer now than we have ever been having worked through our differences.

945
00:59:33.321 --> 00:59:35.360
Your parents should always love and support you.
Well,

946
00:59:35.361 --> 00:59:40.040
it depends on what you're doing
it all.
If you're going to go rob a liquor store,

947
00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:42.520
shoot some heroin.
I don't think they should love and support well,

948
00:59:42.521 --> 00:59:44.860
they could say no and a loving supporting.

949
00:59:45.310 --> 00:59:47.560
When while I was at Byu,

950
00:59:47.830 --> 00:59:52.210
there was a student in my program that took his life because he didn't like the

951
00:59:52.211 --> 00:59:55.600
lifestyle of the church and was scared of what his parents would think.

952
00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:56.590
Oh my God.

953
00:59:58.770 --> 00:59:59.400
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

954
00:59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.350
<v 3>Haven't spoken to his parents after his death.</v>

955
01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.380
They would rather have their son alive and out of the church than dead and in

956
01:00:04.381 --> 01:00:07.620
the church.
Wow.
It will be hard,

957
01:00:08.010 --> 01:00:13.010
but don't ever feel like there is no way out and no way that and no one that has

958
01:00:13.051 --> 01:00:16.080
your back be why you can make you feel that way.

959
01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:21.360
Begin to talk with your parents about it now and share how you feel about

960
01:00:21.361 --> 01:00:25.290
yourself.
They will be hurt but still love you.
Eat a Dick Bill.

961
01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:30.360
Get some meat on those bones.
You skinny bitch.
I love on it.
You know,

962
01:00:30.361 --> 01:00:33.270
if I'm fat,
I'm fat.
If I'm skinny,
I'm too skinny.

963
01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.170
I just can't make you people happy.

964
01:00:38.490 --> 01:00:40.180
<v 8>Ooh.</v>

965
01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:46.210
<v 3>Um,
all right.
What do we got here from a masculine lesbian lady?
Oh,</v>

966
01:00:46.211 --> 01:00:51.070
I put it out there,
you know,
Valentine's Day was coming up,
you know,

967
01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:51.971
is coming up.

968
01:00:51.971 --> 01:00:55.270
You need all the pressure's always on the guy and we have to show how much we

969
01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:59.320
love them and they really don't have to do shit other than put on something hot

970
01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:03.640
and bang you and they act like they're doing you a favor when sex feels good to

971
01:01:03.641 --> 01:01:06.730
them too.
So I don't really don't understand,
you know?

972
01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:11.440
Can you imagine if I acted like,
you know,
banging my wife was,

973
01:01:11.441 --> 01:01:16.441
was this great pleasure thing for her is I'm on top of her like,

974
01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.060
ah,
Eh,
ah,

975
01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:21.580
like I'm not having a good time and those are the noises I make during sex.

976
01:01:21.610 --> 01:01:23.950
And you could fucking deal with that for the rest of the day.

977
01:01:23.951 --> 01:01:28.060
Have that in your head.
Ah,
eh.
Ah,
that's what I do on a loop,

978
01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:33.070
on a loop,
um,
from a masculine.

979
01:01:33.071 --> 01:01:34.210
So I asked,
you know,

980
01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:39.220
I want to talk to the man in the lesbian them with a more manly woman in the

981
01:01:39.221 --> 01:01:43.860
lesbian relationship.
Does what does she have to do?
You know,

982
01:01:43.861 --> 01:01:47.670
cause it's two ladies there right now.
Do you both demand shit or there's one,

983
01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:51.840
you know the one who has to go up on the fucking roof during the reign to fix

984
01:01:51.841 --> 01:01:55.570
the fucking,
you know,
Goddamn,
uh,
the,
the,

985
01:01:55.571 --> 01:01:59.040
the fucking satellite dish,
right?
So anyways,
hey,
Yo,

986
01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.830
I came Billy bibbet city,

987
01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:09.290
the bass city.
I've got another word I have to look up.
I have no idea.

988
01:02:10.010 --> 01:02:12.200
Where do you guys,
where do you guys hear these fucking words?

989
01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.500
I know I can't spell.
I know I'm fucking stupid

990
01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.400
now,
but bad.
Usually uncountable.
Uh,

991
01:02:23.610 --> 01:02:28.380
the practice or habit of drinking too much alcohol.
Oh my God,

992
01:02:28.381 --> 01:02:33.330
I love this word.
How do you pronounce it?
Pronunciation.

993
01:02:34.110 --> 01:02:38.620
Is it [inaudible]
come on,
let me hear.
Let me hear it.

994
01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.880
<v 1>Okay.
Okay.</v>

995
01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:47.760
<v 3>Then nationally,
how do you say it?</v>

996
01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:53.730
They eventually [inaudible] Sally say bye.

997
01:02:54.290 --> 01:02:57.960
[inaudible] all alright.
Ay.

998
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:02.300
Yo Billy verbosity.
Wow.
Visit this.
This,
this person's a thinker.

999
01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.080
Although I think you are back on the wagon of,
of late.
Yes,
I am.
Um,

1000
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:11.390
I had been a fan of yours.
Wait,
am I going to look that word up again with,

1001
01:03:11.410 --> 01:03:13.420
I already forgot what it means.
It Booze Hound,
right?

1002
01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:15.720
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

1003
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:20.090
<v 3>The [inaudible] the practice or habit of drinking too much alcohol.</v>

1004
01:03:23.350 --> 01:03:26.720
Um,
somebody who Bose is,
that's a great name for a band.

1005
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:31.370
It's a great name for a podcast.
Uh,
Billy verbosity.

1006
01:03:31.371 --> 01:03:34.100
I don't know if he can beat that.
That's a great wrestling character.

1007
01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:39.590
He's drunk.
He can't hear the ref.
Um,

1008
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.710
I have been a fan of yours,
uh,
going on a decade now.

1009
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:45.920
You're literally my favorite comedian all the way back to punching the muffins

1010
01:03:45.921 --> 01:03:50.780
in the,
at the flea market.
My flip and favorite.
Ah,
God bless you.
Uh,

1011
01:03:50.781 --> 01:03:55.781
you put out the call for a masculine lesbian lady to right.

1012
01:03:56.151 --> 01:04:01.130
So here's your ear.
Fall.
First off,
I have no idea what it's like to be a man.

1013
01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.420
All I know is that I can relate to so many of your jokes and rants about the

1014
01:04:05.421 --> 01:04:08.000
dynamics between men and women from the man's side.

1015
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.520
Isn't it refreshing to hear a woman say she actually doesn't know what it's like

1016
01:04:10.521 --> 01:04:14.180
to be a man.
So many of these fucking assholes.
I know exactly what it's like.

1017
01:04:14.181 --> 01:04:18.350
It's easier.
Um,
I've,
you're,
you're a cartoon character.

1018
01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.260
I've been married to my lovely wife for 21 years.

1019
01:04:21.261 --> 01:04:26.090
The first nine illegally until same sex marriage became legal in Massachusetts.

1020
01:04:27.050 --> 01:04:31.280
Uh,
when we legalized our vows.
Congratulations.
Uh,

1021
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:34.130
in our relationship,
I am the bread winner.

1022
01:04:34.970 --> 01:04:39.710
The fixer of all broken things.
The killer of scary bugs for sure.

1023
01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.730
The one who would have to climb on the roof and fix the damn 10 and the rain.

1024
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:48.260
Barring that,
the one that's got to negotiate with the servicemen,

1025
01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:52.160
while she nudges me and says,
just pay him,
I'm missing my show.

1026
01:04:53.360 --> 01:04:58.190
The one who pays for dinner,
even when I'm the,
the celebrated,
the list goes on.

1027
01:04:58.191 --> 01:05:02.930
Oh my God.
Jesus Christ.
Could I have a beer with you further?

1028
01:05:02.931 --> 01:05:07.520
I am expected to ensure my lovely wife is wowed on Valentine's Day,

1029
01:05:07.521 --> 01:05:12.170
our anniversary and her birthday.
I make good money.
Don't get me wrong,

1030
01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:17.040
but my gosh,
I liked that you already said flipping in my,
my,

1031
01:05:18.130 --> 01:05:22.780
are you a card player?
Deeplake old lady cards.
Crazy eights.

1032
01:05:24.310 --> 01:05:27.870
Um,
what the hell am I ended on?
My Gosh,

1033
01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:33.330
I mean,
in fairness she puts up with my material attitude,

1034
01:05:35.990 --> 01:05:40.190
circular debating and occasional raging.
Wait,
is somebody trolling me right now?

1035
01:05:40.191 --> 01:05:44.660
Is this the lesbian version of me still?
I have no,
but I don't say my gosh still,

1036
01:05:44.661 --> 01:05:49.220
I have no doubt that I would be cut in half if we,

1037
01:05:49.350 --> 01:05:52.980
we divorced also,
no doubt she'll outlive me.
Wellbeing,

1038
01:05:53.250 --> 01:05:58.230
such a brave widow,
lol.
Uh,
before I get all Rodney Dangerfield on you,

1039
01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:01.440
no respect.
I'll tell you no respect at all.
Uh,
in truth,

1040
01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:05.160
we are the best of friends all the way back to our first day in high school.

1041
01:06:05.161 --> 01:06:09.990
She understands me more than anyone in my life and it's truly help push me

1042
01:06:09.991 --> 01:06:14.010
forward in my career in ways I never thought possible.
Win-Wins.
See,
now as a man,

1043
01:06:14.011 --> 01:06:17.900
I don't think I could ever admit that about my wife.
Maybe that's the flaw.
Uh,

1044
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:21.330
she's funny without trying and brilliantly smart and honest.

1045
01:06:21.331 --> 01:06:23.850
She helps me be a better person.
Wait,

1046
01:06:23.851 --> 01:06:27.780
did near right this and she's pretending to be a lesbian.
Um,

1047
01:06:28.470 --> 01:06:28.820
<v 2>yeah.</v>

1048
01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.370
<v 3>As a woman of a certain age,
49,</v>

1049
01:06:31.371 --> 01:06:35.600
I came up at a time when dynamics between same sex relationship and had the male

1050
01:06:35.601 --> 01:06:38.960
female polarity IX expectation attached.

1051
01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.390
I don't think it's as much that way now.

1052
01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.600
So much has changed in the Lgbtq culture since we were coming up.

1053
01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:52.580
Lesbian,
gay,
Bi,
Trans Queer.

1054
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:57.020
I don't like fuck,
I can't something else.
I have to look up.

1055
01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.630
I can never remember how that goes.
Lgbtq,
yeah.

1056
01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.650
<v 2>Um,
then back then</v>

1057
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:07.630
<v 3>the old man voice,
back in my day,</v>

1058
01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:12.790
the term butch fem was hugely popular and I am definitely more butch.

1059
01:07:13.390 --> 01:07:18.390
It's also a regional identity associated more with the east coast and the West.

1060
01:07:18.820 --> 01:07:23.740
We've lived out west for over a decade and don't see a whole lot of butch.
Slash.

1061
01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:26.350
Femme,
I dunno,

1062
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:30.370
but for that matter we're not nearly as social as we were back east.

1063
01:07:30.371 --> 01:07:35.050
So who knows?
You should totally do a study on butches.
We are.

1064
01:07:35.110 --> 01:07:36.310
We are a good lot.

1065
01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:40.600
Hope that helps and go fuck yourself to do you realize how fucking hilarious it

1066
01:07:40.601 --> 01:07:44.170
was?
It would be in a perfect world.

1067
01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:47.290
You went into a bar after having a fight with your wife and some

1068
01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:51.150
dude in the lesbian relationships,

1069
01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:54.640
sort of old school chick was sitting there at the bar and you both fucking hit

1070
01:07:54.641 --> 01:07:55.474
it off.

1071
01:07:56.170 --> 01:07:56.350
<v 2>Okay.</v>

1072
01:07:56.350 --> 01:07:57.790
<v 3>Be fucking hilarious.</v>

1073
01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.373
<v 2>MMM,</v>

1074
01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.390
<v 3>I see.
I think that's just how it is.
I just think in maybe all relationships,</v>

1075
01:08:05.391 --> 01:08:06.224
there's just,

1076
01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.980
there's the person that's fucking pulling the wagon and then there's a person

1077
01:08:09.981 --> 01:08:14.000
sitting in the wagon complaining.
Um,
you know,

1078
01:08:14.001 --> 01:08:18.100
but when you stop the,
you know,
they rub your back.
I don't,

1079
01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:21.800
I don't fucking know any dilemma,
dear Billy,

1080
01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.370
for in the road.
Is it supposed to be fork in the road?

1081
01:08:28.371 --> 01:08:32.960
That's for dear Billy.
For in the road.
If you had to choose between,

1082
01:08:33.650 --> 01:08:34.640
I think it's fork in the road.

1083
01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:39.170
If you had to choose between being president of the United States or pope of the

1084
01:08:39.170 --> 01:08:43.040
Catholic Church,
which would you choose and why?
Oh,
president.

1085
01:08:43.041 --> 01:08:48.041
Because I only would have to make evil decisions for most eight years and at the

1086
01:08:48.771 --> 01:08:53.510
least four years,
that's why I would do it.

1087
01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.580
They're both absolutely horrific jobs and the amount of blood on your hands at

1088
01:08:58.581 --> 01:09:00.370
the end of it is,
um,

1089
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:05.410
I don't think it's something you ever get past if you're a truly normal human

1090
01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:07.280
being.
And I don't,

1091
01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:10.580
but that's why I don't think normal human beings go for their job.

1092
01:09:10.610 --> 01:09:14.270
Go for those jobs.
All right.
Um,

1093
01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:18.110
and there's a lot of people,
you know,
especially in politics,

1094
01:09:18.111 --> 01:09:20.930
they put on the fucking white hat and they act like they're there for you.

1095
01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.780
Some of them are,
but they're always,

1096
01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:28.190
they're always now labeled as Socialists and working for,
you know,

1097
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:34.610
isis or the Russians or whatever,
and they just get buried.
Um,

1098
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:41.760
you know,
I dunno,
you watched,
you watched that,
that,

1099
01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:42.650
that young woman there,

1100
01:09:42.651 --> 01:09:46.280
that 29 year old woman who everybody's just flipping out about for whatever

1101
01:09:46.281 --> 01:09:47.960
reason,
because she's young and pretty.

1102
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:50.180
I don't know why everybody's freaking out about her.

1103
01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.930
She has very little experience and everybody is freaking out.

1104
01:09:53.931 --> 01:09:55.170
Like she's fucking amazing.
They,

1105
01:09:55.171 --> 01:10:00.171
one of the things that she wanted to do was tax certain American 70% and it's

1106
01:10:00.291 --> 01:10:05.291
just like it taxing anybody more than 50% is fucking criminal.

1107
01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.070
The fact that you're doing the job,

1108
01:10:10.071 --> 01:10:14.030
you actually get up and do the job and then somebody who didn't do the job gets

1109
01:10:14.031 --> 01:10:17.180
more fucking money than that is fucking criminal.

1110
01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.810
And watching this woman just sitting there,
you know,

1111
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:25.760
talking to these old politicians and acting like she's sitting there with the

1112
01:10:25.761 --> 01:10:29.960
two by four and it's going to start cleaning shit up and she's completely

1113
01:10:29.961 --> 01:10:33.290
ignoring the $800 billion gorilla in the room.

1114
01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:38.660
Completely fucking ignoring it.
Okay.
And she's going to few,

1115
01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:43.580
you watch all her righteousness and all her fucking bullshit.
I guarantee you.

1116
01:10:43.581 --> 01:10:47.300
Guess who's going to be a multimillionaire at the end of her political career,

1117
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:51.560
even if she doesn't advance past the senator or House of representative level

1118
01:10:51.830 --> 01:10:53.630
where she only makes six figures a year,

1119
01:10:54.170 --> 01:10:59.170
guess who's going to be a multimillionaire sign a massive book deal,

1120
01:10:59.301 --> 01:11:04.010
totally fucking sellout and buy a big ass fucking house and maybe doing an arena

1121
01:11:04.011 --> 01:11:08.600
tour like Michelle Obama or go on a speaking tour like every other fucking

1122
01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:12.050
president you watch and go,
they ain't going to talk to you.

1123
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:16.140
They're going to go out and talk to banks and corporations and everyone who

1124
01:11:16.770 --> 01:11:20.430
finance their fucking campaigns.
You fucking watch.

1125
01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:22.980
<v 0>All right.
Okay.</v>

1126
01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:26.570
<v 3>You saw what happened when Trump tried to pull the troops out of Syria.</v>

1127
01:11:26.600 --> 01:11:31.600
Both Democrats and Republicans were 100% against that and they act like we can,

1128
01:11:31.911 --> 01:11:34.510
we can't disbelieve already displaced all these people,
but the,

1129
01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:38.240
but they don't give a fuck.
That's their money.

1130
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:42.110
That money for being in that fucking bullshit over there.

1131
01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:47.960
That fucking shit right there is what makes them fucking millionaires,
multi,

1132
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:49.520
multi fucking millionaires.

1133
01:11:49.521 --> 01:11:54.050
And all they do is sit there and blame each other and every mouth breathe and

1134
01:11:54.051 --> 01:11:57.410
fucking moron fucking just believes it,

1135
01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:02.060
drinks the Koolaid and then goes on Facebook and starts arguing with each other

1136
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:07.390
and then starts advocating to tax a fellow American who didn't get us into those

1137
01:12:08.751 --> 01:12:13.130
wars upwards of 70 fucking percent.
That's the direction we're going to go in.

1138
01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:13.881
And it,
no,

1139
01:12:13.881 --> 01:12:18.470
and at no point are we ever going to examine the banking system or are we going

1140
01:12:18.471 --> 01:12:23.471
to look at corporations and see how they can be reeled back into actually being

1141
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:28.640
less powerful than the United States government or whatever country that they're

1142
01:12:28.641 --> 01:12:29.474
in.

1143
01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.753
<v 0>All right.</v>

1144
01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:36.330
<v 3>That's the world you enter as president or pope.</v>

1145
01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.870
Pope of the Catholic Church,
Catholic fucking church.
I mean,

1146
01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.460
I mean one of the biggest fucking terrorist organizations ever,

1147
01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.320
ever.
The amount of fucking people that they tortured and murdered.

1148
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.090
I mean,
they were in bed with the Nazis.

1149
01:12:54.091 --> 01:12:57.600
They were hiding one in the Nazis in their fucking churches.
One of the guys,

1150
01:12:57.601 --> 01:12:59.360
one of the fucking,
you know,
PR people,

1151
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:03.270
part of the final solution that the we side was hunting down was founded a

1152
01:13:03.271 --> 01:13:06.300
fucking Catholic church in the south of France.

1153
01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:09.860
Dead Jewish people's gold.

1154
01:13:10.670 --> 01:13:13.850
They had some of that in the church and they had to fucking give that back.

1155
01:13:13.851 --> 01:13:17.590
I mean,
it's a fucking shit show.
So if you get there,

1156
01:13:17.591 --> 01:13:20.290
that is a lifetime appointment.

1157
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:25.830
And if you think you're going to go in there and change that when everybody else

1158
01:13:25.961 --> 01:13:28.660
in their previous to you has all that blood on their hands,

1159
01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:30.790
like they're not going to view you as a threat.

1160
01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.760
<v 0>Um,
yeah,</v>

1161
01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:37.880
<v 3>it was,
which was funny when Trump came in,
he's like,</v>

1162
01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.560
I'm going to clean up the swamp.

1163
01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:43.850
Let's just say he actually did have a good heart and he wasn't like the fucking

1164
01:13:43.851 --> 01:13:47.990
Grinch.
Let's just say actually did have a good heart.
Um,

1165
01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:51.530
that whole thing.
I'm going to clean up the swamp.

1166
01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:54.770
Like everybody there who was corrupt was going to be like,
well,

1167
01:13:54.771 --> 01:13:57.320
I guess the party's over.
He's going to clean it up.

1168
01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.820
No one's going to work with you.

1169
01:13:59.330 --> 01:14:03.950
No one's going to help you cut their own fucking head off.
So,
um,

1170
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:08.130
I dunno,
I don't want to end on a depressing note,
but like that is,

1171
01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:12.070
it is a massive,
massive,
massive fucking

1172
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:16.120
<v 0>problem.
Um,
it's the reason why there's global warming.</v>

1173
01:14:16.390 --> 01:14:19.180
It's the reason of overpopulation.

1174
01:14:19.181 --> 01:14:22.630
All of it goes back to corrupt politician and religion.

1175
01:14:22.631 --> 01:14:26.080
And that's as far as I can tell and I'm not as smart guy.

1176
01:14:26.230 --> 01:14:31.050
You might know it better than me,
but there is no fucking reason why we um,

1177
01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:33.340
shouldn't be polluting much less.

1178
01:14:33.341 --> 01:14:38.080
I was just reading something where like the continent of Africa is going to feel

1179
01:14:38.081 --> 01:14:40.810
the effects the first,

1180
01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.570
which is the worst fucking continent for that to happen too,

1181
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.460
because with racism and third,

1182
01:14:46.580 --> 01:14:49.840
the way people view the so called Third World countries and everything,

1183
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.360
nobody's gonna give a fuck until it's in their fucking backyard and it's going

1184
01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:56.260
to be fucking too late.
So there you go.
There's one to grow on.

1185
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:59.620
And that's why I fucking have gone back to reading reader's digest,

1186
01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:04.390
looking at those dumb jokes,
just playing cards and sitting on my back porch,

1187
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:07.690
smoking a cigar,
staring at a fucking tree because

1188
01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:13.540
we're on a runaway fucking train and everybody and everybody who was a passenger

1189
01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:17.620
on the train is blaming everybody else on the other side of the aisle as if

1190
01:15:17.621 --> 01:15:21.700
they're the ones driving the fucking train.
Oh my God,
this is depressing.
Anyways,

1191
01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.410
that's the podcast.

1192
01:15:26.440 --> 01:15:28.630
God bless you.
It's almost baseball season.

1193
01:15:28.631 --> 01:15:31.840
Take me out to the ball game.

1194
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:36.850
I just realized the volume was up super loud because I just took this mix around

1195
01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.480
in my luggage.
I hope this wasn't too distorted.
Uh,
God bless you.

1196
01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.790
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
You cuts.
