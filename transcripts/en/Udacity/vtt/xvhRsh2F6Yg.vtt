00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.230
This question is sort of a big deal, it's where the

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.310
final project begins. And so work you do in this question

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.930
may wind up contributing to what you submit for your final

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.030
project submission at the end of the class. Since your final

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.050
project is the design of an app, the first step is

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.010
to answer the question, what app are you going to build?

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.640
And at this point I should mention it's okay to not

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.590
be thinking of personas and use cases and high level flows here.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.210
This is where you decide on the project that is going

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.080
to excite you and keep you motivated, without that excitement probably

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.110
won't even build anything at all. So it's really important that

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.540
we start with what app do you want to build and here

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.760
we're really just talking about maybe a two to three sentence

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.830
explanation. Any more detail than that and you probably want to have

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.880
an idea of who your users are and what this app

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.650
is going to do at a high level. Keep in mind that

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.640
though you are going to be coming back to

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.100
this final project throughout the class you can always

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.650
change your idea. So don't feel like whatever you

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.400
do here you have to be too committed to.
