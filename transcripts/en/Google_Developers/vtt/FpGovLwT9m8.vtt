KORY JEFFREY:
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.890
We're at Founder World
in San Francisco.

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:05.810
I'm joined in the studio
by Jermaine Dupri.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.980
He is a Grammy Award winning
songwriter, producer, author,

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.690
DJ, CEO of GLOBAL 14.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:14.660
Great to have you.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:15.919
JERMAINE DUPRI: Thank you.

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.710
KORY JEFFREY: So let's
start with maybe one

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.830
of the more obvious question.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.039
Why is Jermaine Dupri at a
tech event in San Francisco?

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.330
JERMAINE DUPRI: I don't know
if that should be obvious.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.990
I mean tech has disrupted
my music business.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.630
It has completely disrupted
almost every business.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.770
So any smart person that's still
making music or in the realms

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.419
of this, you should be here.

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:45.210
You should go to more
things like this just

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.380
to find out what's
going on, if you

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.250
have an idea of where
people should be moving to

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.970
or everything.

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.970
So one of the main reasons
that I've been doing things

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.690
like this is that I've created
my own social network, GLOBAL

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.330
14.

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.730
And I created it basically
as the new version

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.720
of what I would call
the website for myself

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.590
or for a person like myself.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.917
Information that you have
nowadays is a lot more.

00:01:16.917 --> 00:01:19.500
There's a lot more information
now that you can feed your fans

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.910
than what used to be when we
had musical fans sites, or fan

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.590
page, or whatever
you want to call it.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.540
And just letting people see more
of the inside of Jermaine Dupri

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.541
then out, what's
on the media, what

00:01:33.541 --> 00:01:34.790
you don't allow people to get.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.869
So everything that you've--
everything that's true,

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.160
and everything that's real,
and everything that's going

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.800
on in my life is on GLOBAL 14.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.900
What I like is on GLOBAL 14.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.120
What I believe people that
like Jermaine Dupri like

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.180
is on GLOBAL 14.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.740
So it's just-- it's like a
big like button for-- that's

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.830
what I look at it as.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.560
KORY JEFFREY: For
everything in your life.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.167
And so you see a lot of other
artists coming onto GLOBAL 14?

00:01:58.167 --> 00:01:59.000
JERMAINE DUPRI: Huh?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.460
KORY JEFFREY: Is it common
thing for other artists

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:01.320
to come onto GLOBAL 14.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.611
JERMAINE DUPRI: Oh, yeah, 100%.

00:02:02.611 --> 00:02:04.786
If you want to-- It's
an open forum for you

00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:06.887
to post all your music.

00:02:06.887 --> 00:02:07.970
Put you've music up there.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.126
SoundCloud, YouTube, where
ever you want to post it.

00:02:11.126 --> 00:02:13.500
People ask me all the time,
how can they get music to me?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.830
It's the best way, put
your music up on GLOBAL 14

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.070
and I'll see.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.760
I'll see it.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.650
And if you have the wits to
really move round on the site

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.542
and talk to the other
members on the site--

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:27.750
because that's another thing.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.260
I try to push the
community part of it,

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.090
because I think
that we've gotten

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.557
lost in these big-- saying,
oh, you've got all of this,

00:02:35.557 --> 00:02:37.890
you've got all these followers,
dah, dah, dah, dah, dah.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.542
That's cool, but you don't
actually talk to these people.

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:43.000
Nobody's talking
to 500,000 people.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.291
You know what I've been saying.

00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:47.830
So it's like that knit community
of people that you talk to.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.920
That's what I try to build
GLOBAL 14 to make sure

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.225
that the community
talks to each other.

00:02:54.225 --> 00:02:59.720
THE engagement is really,
really my push on GLOBAL 14.

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.410
KORY JEFFREY: So you've
also created an app.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.330
JERMAINE DUPRI:
Yeah, my first app

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.300
came out like about-- I'm
going to say five months ago.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.740
It was called 4 Lanes.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.785
And is basically a take on my
song "Money Ain't A Thang."

00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:16.105
It's a card game for--
it's a two thumb car game.

00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:18.940
And you've got to move the cars
and stay away from the police,

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.670
and get the money.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.630
And the sound track of the
game is "Money Ain't A Thang."

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.070
KORY JEFFREY:
That's really cool.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.140
So I mean you're
obviously an entrepreneur

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.994
in a whole bunch of rights,
music and now with tech.

00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:32.660
Have you found a
difference in any of it

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.160
at all on how you approach it?

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.290
JERMAINE DUPRI: Yeah, I mean the
tech world is a lot more open.

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.720
It's a lot more
sharing going on here.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.260
Like my friend Cory,
who I met one time

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.200
I was speaking in San Francisco,
and he just came out of no

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.450
where, signed up to GLOBAL 14.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.390
He was like, yo, I want
to take you round Frisco,

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:58.870
and show you, let
you meet people.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.615
I'm like what, where's the why?

00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:02.740
Why do you want to do this?

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.970
Right?

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.280
And I'm thinking he
wanted something.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.770
He was like, I
don't want anything.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.070
That's just the life of--
where the tech world is.

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.480
Our mentality is I
want to introduce you

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.230
to one my friends.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.500
If something happens,
happens and dah, dah, dah.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.300
Coming from the business
that's a-- it's not like that.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.175
You know what I mean.

00:04:17.175 --> 00:04:19.430
So it's a big
difference with that.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.570
A lot of the shell things
in the business, and they

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.850
keep a lot of things
to themselves and not

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.345
open to people.

00:04:25.345 --> 00:04:26.720
I don't know if
it's because it's

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.150
more plentiful on this side.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.140
But this is a
different attitude.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.640
The light is different.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.980
I mean it just feels like
someone has opened up

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:38.125
the top of this roof as
opposed to the door when you're

00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:40.084
around this type of situation.

00:04:40.084 --> 00:04:42.250
KORY JEFFREY: So then, we
touched on it a little bit

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.610
before, but what attracted
you to Founder World

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.042
specifically, like this event?

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:48.625
Is there anything
in particular that--

00:04:48.625 --> 00:04:50.041
JERMAINE DUPRI:
Well, I mean, It's

00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:52.620
like I said I've been
on the trail of speaking

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.330
at different events like this.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.370
And I just wanted-- they
told me it's the biggest one.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.250
And I was like, I
got to be there.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.400
And I'm always interested to
see exactly how people interact,

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.660
and if it's the same.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.100
And, like I said, I'm sure
I learned something that.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.589
You can always learn
something at these events.

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:16.630
KORY JEFFREY: So you're
speaking obviously later.

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.347
What's the message you want
to get across to people?

00:05:20.347 --> 00:05:21.930
JERMAINE DUPRI: I'm
really just trying

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.170
to let people know about
how I feel about community.

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:27.410
And the way I feel that people
look at celebrities as opposed

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.390
to how-- and they believe that--
they think that celebrities

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.420
drive the engagement in a
certain type of way that we

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:37.080
don't.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.940
And I think that just
teaching people that.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.740
And letting them
understand that I believe

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.740
that I've created a
place that gives you

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.870
the best of both worlds, of
just like the celebrity side

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.760
as well as-- I don't
know, if you want to say,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.622
regular side of people.

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:57.080
Where they can mess
with each other

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.086
and it not become a blown
out fairytale world I think.

00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:05.460
I get pissed off
when people have

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.410
my fake names on these sites.

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:09.720
You know I'm a person
that people know.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.680
How could you allow someone to
creative a fake Jermaine Dupri

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.560
page.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.917
In these big corporations, that
have like a zillion dollars,

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:20.250
is that it clearly just shows
me that they're not really

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.020
paying attention to
that type of stuff.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.228
And that type of stuff
doesn't really matter to them.

00:06:24.228 --> 00:06:27.260
So I for one wanted
to create a place

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.345
where my peers could come hang
out as well as their fans could

00:06:31.345 --> 00:06:32.120
come hang out.

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:36.290
And the information
wouldn't be just thrown

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.740
to the side that way.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.440
So that's one thing I'm
trying to mention to people.

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.080
And then just entrepreneurship.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.230
I think I started
in this business

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.199
when I was-- I mean I made
my first million dollars when

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:47.760
I was 19.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.600
So if I could be an
inspiration to anybody,

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.490
I mean, I think
that's something too.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.240
KORY JEFFREY: So if
you walk around today,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.573
you're going to see all sorts
of different technologies.

00:06:56.573 --> 00:06:59.218
There's a whole row
here on virtual reality.

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:00.160
There's 3 print.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.660
There's everything
you can think of.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.160
Is there any certain
technology that

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.360
excites you as you kind of
get into the tech space?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:05.470
JERMAINE DUPRI: Yeah.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.062
I want my Google glasses.

00:07:07.062 --> 00:07:07.924
I need them.

00:07:07.924 --> 00:07:09.580
I've been waiting on them.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.251
I need them.

00:07:10.251 --> 00:07:12.250
I can't wait until I can
just look in the glass,

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.520
and check my messages,
and all this.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.210
I need that.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.086
KORY JEFFREY: Nice.

00:07:16.086 --> 00:07:16.962
OK.

00:07:16.962 --> 00:07:18.280
That's cool.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.948
And then, do you have a
favorite Google technology?

00:07:20.948 --> 00:07:22.031
JERMAINE DUPRI: That's it.

00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:23.140
KORY JEFFREY: Glasses.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.420
JERMAINE DUPRI: I answered
the question for you.

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.003
You got to it.

00:07:25.003 --> 00:07:25.950
That's it.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:28.130
I believe-- I mean
I never had a pair.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.174
But I saw them.

00:07:29.174 --> 00:07:31.090
And I was like, I
definitely want to get this.

00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:33.560
But I wanted to wait until
all the kinks are out.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.830
But I definitely-- to me
that's the best thing going.

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.499
KORY JEFFREY: So
what's next for you?

00:07:39.499 --> 00:07:41.540
JERMAINE DUPRI: The next
thing-- well, actually I

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.850
just flew in today coming
from the set of-- I'm

00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.069
actually filming my-- I got two
TV shows coming on next year.

00:07:49.069 --> 00:07:50.860
My first TV show that
I'm filming right now

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.484
is on Lifetime.

00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:54.880
It's called "The Rap Game."

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.630
And it's about these five
kids that move to Atlanta

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:03.130
and go to the Jermaine Dupri
boot camp with the mindset

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:04.770
to become rappers.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:07.160
One of them-- and at the
end of the show, one of them

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.730
I'm going to sign.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:11.640
It's very interesting because it
actually ties into this world.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.760
Because it's like, artists
now, when I find them

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.890
they have followings, and
they have videos on YouTube,

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:22.060
and they have twitter pages,
and all this other stuff.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.740
In the early--
I'll yeah, the '90s

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.150
or going into the
early 2000s, artists

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.624
didn't have this
component with them.

00:08:29.624 --> 00:08:31.540
So you find and artist,
it was just an artist.

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.831
And then you had to build that.

00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:36.780
So these artists have a little
bit of fan base before hand.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.400
They just-- now I have to
help them build the artistry.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.039
So it's an interesting
twist, because they

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.759
come in-- in the internet world
or in the online world you

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:47.050
could say they'll make you
believe that you're somebody

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.210
that you're actually not.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.265
Or you might be on that
platform, but in this platform

00:08:52.265 --> 00:08:52.890
it's different.

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:56.520
So just finding which one of
these guys are actually ready--

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.196
there's three
girls and two guys.

00:08:58.196 --> 00:08:59.070
And they're all kids.

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:01.860
They're like from
12 to 16 years old.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.590
So that's all Lifetime.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.250
And another show
is called "Moguls."

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:09.885
It's with me, Snoop Dogg,
Dam Dash, and Birdman

00:09:09.885 --> 00:09:12.180
from "Cash Money."

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.764
And that shows just
follows us around.

00:09:13.764 --> 00:09:15.638
It actually should be
following me right now,

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.920
so they could see this World.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.025
But it's my-- like
I said, my thing

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:21.970
is to introduce people to things
that they probably won't get

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.520
a chance to see such as this.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.520
KORY JEFFREY: Very cool.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.167
Thank you very much
for joining us.

00:09:26.167 --> 00:09:27.250
JERMAINE DUPRI: All right.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.510
KORY JEFFREY: And thank
you guys for joining us.

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:30.290
We are in San Francisco
at Founder World.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.440
My name is Kory.
