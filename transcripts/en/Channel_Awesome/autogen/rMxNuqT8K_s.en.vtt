not limit your imagination and also I
 

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:46.990 align:start position:0%
not limit your imagination and also I
think<00:11:45.529><c> it's</c><00:11:45.800><c> funny</c><00:11:46.009><c> when</c><00:11:46.250><c> you</c><00:11:46.339><c> see</c><00:11:46.550><c> something</c>

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
think it's funny when you see something
 

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.689 align:start position:0%
think it's funny when you see something
and<00:11:47.149><c> it's</c><00:11:47.269><c> like</c><00:11:47.360><c> on</c><00:11:47.660><c> a</c><00:11:47.689><c> string</c><00:11:48.139><c> or</c><00:11:48.380><c> you</c><00:11:48.500><c> know</c>

00:11:48.689 --> 00:11:48.699 align:start position:0%
and it's like on a string or you know
 

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:51.460 align:start position:0%
and it's like on a string or you know
things<00:11:49.699><c> that</c><00:11:49.759><c> are</c><00:11:49.880><c> like</c><00:11:50.060><c> made</c><00:11:50.630><c> of</c><00:11:50.779><c> plastic</c><00:11:51.290><c> to</c>

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:51.470 align:start position:0%
things that are like made of plastic to
 

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
things that are like made of plastic to
me<00:11:51.560><c> that's</c><00:11:51.709><c> more</c><00:11:51.860><c> tangible</c><00:11:52.550><c> it's</c><00:11:52.759><c> more</c>

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:52.970 align:start position:0%
me that's more tangible it's more
 

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:56.230 align:start position:0%
me that's more tangible it's more
interesting<00:11:53.269><c> than</c><00:11:53.980><c> you</c><00:11:54.980><c> know</c><00:11:55.069><c> these</c><00:11:55.240><c> like</c>

interesting than you know these like
 

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
interesting than you know these like
really<00:11:57.170><c> detailed</c><00:11:57.860><c> CG</c>

00:11:59.040 --> 00:11:59.050 align:start position:0%
really detailed CG
 

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:02.010 align:start position:0%
really detailed CG
animations<00:11:59.830><c> everything</c><00:12:00.399><c> so</c><00:12:01.390><c> I</c><00:12:01.420><c> like</c><00:12:01.720><c> to</c><00:12:01.839><c> see</c>

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.020 align:start position:0%
animations everything so I like to see
 

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
animations everything so I like to see
things<00:12:02.230><c> that</c><00:12:02.410><c> are</c><00:12:02.470><c> real</c><00:12:02.740><c> it</c><00:12:03.580><c> was</c><00:12:03.850><c> so</c><00:12:04.029><c> weird</c><00:12:04.360><c> I</c>

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:04.630 align:start position:0%
things that are real it was so weird I
 

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:07.170 align:start position:0%
things that are real it was so weird I
never<00:12:04.990><c> realized</c><00:12:05.589><c> how</c><00:12:05.770><c> desensitized</c><00:12:06.250><c> I</c><00:12:06.940><c> kind</c>

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:07.180 align:start position:0%
never realized how desensitized I kind
 

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:09.510 align:start position:0%
never realized how desensitized I kind
of<00:12:07.240><c> got</c><00:12:07.450><c> how</c><00:12:08.140><c> my</c><00:12:08.260><c> CG</c><00:12:08.649><c> there</c><00:12:08.830><c> is</c><00:12:08.980><c> I</c><00:12:09.160><c> don't</c><00:12:09.339><c> really</c>

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
of got how my CG there is I don't really
 

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
of got how my CG there is I don't really
have<00:12:09.670><c> too</c><00:12:09.940><c> much</c><00:12:10.089><c> against</c><00:12:10.390><c> CG</c><00:12:10.690><c> I</c><00:12:10.720><c> think</c><00:12:11.020><c> it's</c>

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:11.110 align:start position:0%
have too much against CG I think it's
 

00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
have too much against CG I think it's
overused<00:12:11.620><c> but</c><00:12:11.980><c> uh</c><00:12:12.399><c> you</c><00:12:13.060><c> know</c><00:12:13.180><c> it's</c><00:12:13.510><c> a</c><00:12:13.660><c> fine</c>

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:13.870 align:start position:0%

obviously a guy in a suit it's obviously
 

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:24.420 align:start position:0%
obviously a guy in a suit it's obviously
a<00:12:22.630><c> model</c><00:12:22.959><c> but</c><00:12:23.170><c> when</c><00:12:23.350><c> he</c><00:12:23.470><c> hits</c><00:12:23.770><c> it</c><00:12:23.980><c> it's</c><00:12:24.160><c> like</c><00:12:24.310><c> I</c>

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:24.430 align:start position:0%
a model but when he hits it it's like I
 

00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
a model but when he hits it it's like I
know<00:12:24.490><c> that</c><00:12:25.060><c> the</c><00:12:25.300><c> physical</c><00:12:25.779><c> hit</c><00:12:26.050><c> I'm</c><00:12:26.470><c> actually</c>

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:26.830 align:start position:0%
know that the physical hit I'm actually
 

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
know that the physical hit I'm actually
gonna<00:12:27.190><c> feel</c><00:12:27.490><c> that</c><00:12:27.520><c> when</c><00:12:27.910><c> it</c><00:12:28.029><c> impacts</c><00:12:28.480><c> because</c>

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:28.870 align:start position:0%
gonna feel that when it impacts because
 

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:31.230 align:start position:0%
gonna feel that when it impacts because
it's<00:12:29.080><c> really</c><00:12:29.380><c> there</c><00:12:29.860><c> yeah</c><00:12:30.310><c> where</c><00:12:30.760><c> I</c><00:12:30.790><c> can</c><00:12:31.060><c> see</c>

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.240 align:start position:0%
it's really there yeah where I can see
 

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
it's really there yeah where I can see
like<00:12:31.420><c> a</c><00:12:31.450><c> CG</c><00:12:31.930><c> Godzilla</c><00:12:32.470><c> hitting</c><00:12:33.250><c> a</c><00:12:33.339><c> movie</c><00:12:33.730><c> it</c>

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:33.910 align:start position:0%
like a CG Godzilla hitting a movie it
 

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
like a CG Godzilla hitting a movie it

00:12:37.769 --> 00:12:37.779 align:start position:0%
connection because I know it's it's CG
 

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:41.010 align:start position:0%
connection because I know it's it's CG
I'm<00:12:37.899><c> just</c><00:12:38.230><c> so</c><00:12:38.529><c> used</c><00:12:38.560><c> to</c><00:12:39.100><c> seeing</c><00:12:39.399><c> that</c><00:12:39.760><c> uh</c><00:12:40.120><c> so</c>

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:41.020 align:start position:0%
I'm just so used to seeing that uh so
 

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:42.990 align:start position:0%
I'm just so used to seeing that uh so
was<00:12:41.290><c> very</c><00:12:41.410><c> interesting</c><00:12:42.100><c> to</c><00:12:42.130><c> see</c><00:12:42.250><c> like</c><00:12:42.399><c> actual</c>

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
was very interesting to see like actual
 

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
was very interesting to see like actual
physical<00:12:43.600><c> destruction</c><00:12:44.140><c> again</c><00:12:44.770><c> yeah</c><00:12:45.310><c> that</c><00:12:45.670><c> it</c>

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:45.850 align:start position:0%
physical destruction again yeah that it
 

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:47.699 align:start position:0%
physical destruction again yeah that it
that<00:12:46.060><c> isn't</c><00:12:46.270><c> it's</c><00:12:46.750><c> somehow</c><00:12:47.170><c> it</c><00:12:47.440><c> actually</c>

00:12:47.699 --> 00:12:47.709 align:start position:0%
that isn't it's somehow it actually
 

00:12:47.709 --> 00:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
that isn't it's somehow it actually
feels<00:12:47.920><c> more</c><00:12:48.580><c> real</c><00:12:48.910><c> even</c><00:12:49.149><c> though</c><00:12:49.390><c> it</c><00:12:49.540><c> looks</c>

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:49.810 align:start position:0%
feels more real even though it looks
 

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
feels more real even though it looks
more<00:12:50.050><c> fake</c><00:12:50.380><c> yeah</c><00:12:50.649><c> that's</c><00:12:51.640><c> very</c><00:12:51.880><c> very</c>
