Testing 123. . . . .  
&gt;&gt; Hi, testing. 

00:06:46.214 --> 00:06:49.860
.  Good morning.  Good morning. 
I'm Jane McAuliffe, and I'm the 

00:06:50.793 --> 00:06:52.000
director of national and 
international outreach at the  

00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:54.001
Library of Library of Congress. 

00:06:55.967 --> 00:07:02.748
 It's a pleasure to welcome all 
of you here today for a new 

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:07.805
event here in the library, 
national Digital Initiative and 

00:07:07.806 --> 00:07:11.403
I welcome you to the Jefferson 
building in the Library of 

00:07:11.404 --> 00:07:14.365
Congress and I hope you have a 
chance to walk around this 

00:07:14.366 --> 00:07:19.865
building and enjoy its shear 
beauty.  Thomas Jefferson 

00:07:21.387 --> 00:07:28.021
believed that the unhampered 
pursuit of truth was the key to 

00:07:28.022 --> 00:07:31.695
a successful democracy.  
Jefferson's own library forms 

00:07:32.314 --> 00:07:36.874
the core of this great 
collection and you will find it 

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:41.180
beautifully exhibited on the 
mezzanine floor of this 

00:07:41.308 --> 00:07:45.184
building.  Today the Library of 
 Library of Congress is the 

00:07:45.185 --> 00:07:48.791
largest repository of knowledge 
in the world.  We are surrounded

00:07:49.483 --> 00:07:53.191
 here by more than 36 million 
catalog books and other print 

00:07:53.192 --> 00:07:55.192
materials 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:03.125
in 460 languages.  More than 69 
million manuscripts and the 

00:08:03.423 --> 00:08:07.893
largest book collection in 
America and the largest 

00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:14.397
collection of material material,
 sheet music and sound 

00:08:14.398 --> 00:08:21.896
recordings and a statesman, 
Herbert Sandral once said a 

00:08:21.897 --> 00:08:25.083
library is caught in closed 
doors.  The people must have 

00:08:25.084 --> 00:08:27.763
access to the library's 
collection to put those in 

00:08:27.897 --> 00:08:31.563
action.  It's not enough anymore
 to open up the doors of the 

00:08:32.472 --> 00:08:36.629
building and invite people in.  
We have to open the knowledge 

00:08:36.758 --> 00:08:42.383
itself for people to explore and
 use, that's where NAYO, 

00:08:42.384 --> 00:08:46.428
national and international 
outreach comes in.  A year ago, 

00:08:46.429 --> 00:08:50.628
the library created this new 
division to make this collection

00:08:51.273 --> 00:08:56.414
 to better serve the American 
people and the world.  NAIO was 

00:08:56.415 --> 00:08:58.415
created with high aspirations,
aspirations, toaspirations, to 

00:09:01.964 --> 00:09:06.672
promote scholarships, foster 
creativity, develop 

00:09:07.202 --> 00:09:12.070
collaboration and communities, 
and enable everyone to discover 

00:09:12.614 --> 00:09:16.167
and to learn.  Of course in the 
21st century we can do a lot 

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.682
more than open books.  
Researchers can now analyze more

00:09:20.683 --> 00:09:27.078
 information in an hour than we 
can read in a lifetime.  We can 

00:09:27.406 --> 00:09:33.401
collaborate and share complex 
ideas in an instance and we can 

00:09:33.927 --> 00:09:37.232
empower everyone to participate.
Like all of you, the Library of 

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:42.639
Congress is to enable that 
vision.  With that in mind, we 

00:09:42.928 --> 00:09:47.189
have created a new office in 
NAIO and that office is national

00:09:47.448 --> 00:09:52.316
 office of Digital Initiatives 
and we have given them a big 

00:09:52.317 --> 00:09:55.409
responsibility to lead 
innovation and maximize the 

00:09:55.523 --> 00:09:58.135
impact of digital collection.  
Not just here in the library but

00:09:58.444 --> 00:10:01.946
 across the many communities.  
To lead this team we have chosen

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:11.882
 a dynamic charismatic innovator
 Kate Zwaard.  She knows the 

00:10:12.162 --> 00:10:17.678
library and led the development 
of the library repository.  She 

00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:25.173
is a good communicator and has 
been on several committees.  She

00:10:25.174 --> 00:10:29.574
 expect great things from Kate 
and her team.  Today is a 

00:10:29.887 --> 00:10:36.930
perfect example of what we want 
you to do.  Leveraging the the  

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.110
the library

00:10:33.407 --> 00:10:36.073
 to bring all of you together, 
discussing the best practices 

00:10:36.074 --> 00:10:41.197
and lessons learned from your 
work, taking the next steps and 

00:10:41.198 --> 00:10:45.630
what we can do even better as we
 move forward.  So again, thank 

00:10:45.631 --> 00:10:49.628
you all for joining us today.  I
 am excited about what we can 

00:10:49.629 --> 00:10:51.294
accomplish working  together.  
together.  And now

00:10:51.295 --> 00:10:55.705
 I would like to hand you over 
to the chief of national Digital

00:10:56.792 --> 00:10:58.792
 Initiatives

00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:02.871
 Kate Zwaard who will be

00:11:05.959 --> 00:11:09.090
 here today and for years to 
come.  

00:11:09.091 --> 00:11:15.918
Thank you.  [Applause]. 
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for the 

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:20.012
warm welcome, Jane.  We are 
thrilled that you all can come. 

00:11:20.444 --> 00:11:21.262
Welcome to the people watching 
via live stream from  home.  

00:11:21.263 --> 00:11:23.263
home.  
Please

00:11:26.776 --> 00:11:35.647
 remember to tweet your 
questions with the #asdata.  

00:11:36.206 --> 00:11:39.825
It's possible to see what we can
 discover, we can enhance our 

00:11:40.792 --> 00:11:43.972
ability to search, visualize and
 organize information.  As the 

00:11:45.195 --> 00:11:48.794
capacity grows, so do the 
questions.  How can researchers 

00:11:49.118 --> 00:11:52.667
participate in data scholarship 
and how can the collection work 

00:11:52.668 --> 00:11:56.258
with research?  We put together 
the symposium and among those of

00:11:56.475 --> 00:12:01.526
 you who expressed interest in 
the event, we had interest in 

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.634
NASA, the episcopal school, and 
even the DC public library and 

00:12:09.017 --> 00:12:13.087
this topic has struck a cord 
with many of you.  I would like 

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.660
to start by thanking those of 
you who made this  possible. 

00:12:20.452 --> 00:12:22.452
Initiative teamInitiative team 
that I will introduce you to 

00:12:22.597 --> 00:12:27.360
later.  This is the first of 
many to come.  I would like to 

00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:32.573
thank Jaime Neer who did a lot 
of the heavy lifting to get us 

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:35.706
off.  Thank you to those who 
donated their time and effort 

00:12:35.707 --> 00:12:37.998
and thank you to the office

00:12:41.811 --> 00:12:45.536
 of equal opportunity for 
funding the live captioning and 

00:12:45.537 --> 00:12:51.555
thank you to the volunteers who 
helped put this event on.  

00:12:51.556 --> 00:12:55.999
This event has opening and 
closing and keynotes and four 

00:12:56.128 --> 00:13:01.015
sessions.  If you are watching 
via live stream you can tweet 

00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:01.753
questions using #asdata.  The 
video of this event will be will

00:13:01.754 --> 00:13:03.754
 be made will be made on our 
website

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:09.899
 and archived at the Library of 
Congress.  Don't ask questions 

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:11.900
that you don't want mixed

00:13:16.016 --> 00:13:20.618
 in.  No pressure.  
Our keynote speaker just got 

00:13:20.619 --> 00:13:22.619
back from

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:30.516
 Africa to document the live eco
 system.  This project is making

00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:35.043
 all of the data open for us to 
explore.  

00:13:35.044 --> 00:13:37.978
Participating in this expedition
 and almost getting eaten by a 

00:13:38.602 --> 00:13:42.317
lion, is one of many way

00:13:46.719 --> 00:13:52.727
 Jer Thorp is using data to help
 our lives.  In the 911 

00:13:53.405 --> 00:13:59.810
memorial, placing those deceased
 closest to the ones they knew, 

00:13:59.811 --> 00:14:06.169
using social media and a theater
 performance with 120 projects 

00:14:07.006 --> 00:14:11.501
and collection.  This shows how 
Jer is changing from cold and 

00:14:11.922 --> 00:14:14.639
sterile to interesting and 
vibrant.  Even though many of us

00:14:14.984 --> 00:14:18.438
 have not been able to trek 
through Africa, we have the same

00:14:18.673 --> 00:14:22.143
 mission as Jer in many ways, to
 make information through all of

00:14:22.264 --> 00:14:26.321
 its forms relative to the 
public in the hope that it will 

00:14:26.322 --> 00:14:29.451
improve the earth, cells and 
future.  

00:14:29.452 --> 00:14:34.961
Please introduce the co-founder,
 author of creative research, 

00:14:35.159 --> 00:14:37.159
2013 national 

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:43.916
geographic, and director of the 
international telecommunications

00:14:44.378 --> 00:14:46.378
 program, Jer Thorp.  

00:14:50.915 --> 00:14:52.763
[Applause].  
SPEAKER:  Good morning.  I think

00:14:52.764 --> 00:14:57.699
 it goes without saying that I 
am tremendously honored to be 

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:04.216
here today.  I am a Canadian and
 nonetheless, I really -- I am 

00:15:05.984 --> 00:15:07.984
really honored to be here. 

00:15:13.724 --> 00:15:16.831
[Laughter].  With this entire 
talk this morning, I wanted to 

00:15:16.961 --> 00:15:21.413
talk about the office For 
Creative Research and I put 

00:15:21.538 --> 00:15:24.547
together a talk specifically 
about collections as was just 

00:15:24.973 --> 00:15:31.433
mentioned, we do a lot of very 
different things.  And I was 

00:15:31.889 --> 00:15:34.955
almost in with the talk when I 
read the program for the event, 

00:15:35.292 --> 00:15:39.357
when I found out that the talk I
 was going to give was called 

00:15:39.544 --> 00:15:43.964
Data and Humans, A Love Story 
and it's a title that I did not 

00:15:44.102 --> 00:15:48.190
make up.  And I said okay, I 
will do this talk instead.  

00:15:48.191 --> 00:15:51.762
Obviously this talk is going to 
be about data and humans.  And 

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:55.049
start to talk about data and 
humans, we must begin I think I 

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.050
think with I think with data.  
There is an 

00:16:01.259 --> 00:16:04.937
artifact of our understanding of
 data as you have seen before, 

00:16:04.938 --> 00:16:10.662
the pyramid which describes the 
progression from wisdom.  I 

00:16:11.002 --> 00:16:11.370
think the shape of that pyramid 
defines a lot of data data over 

00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:13.371
data over the

00:16:19.897 --> 00:16:21.897
last five to ten

00:16:25.121 --> 00:16:28.883
 years and it is to collect as 
much of it as possible and get 

00:16:28.884 --> 00:16:31.965
wisdom at scale.  I will mention
 that we are missing something 

00:16:31.966 --> 00:16:34.912
at the bottom of the pyramid and
 I am not going to give it away 

00:16:35.331 --> 00:16:36.942
yet.  
I'm going to start with a little

00:16:36.943 --> 00:16:41.944
 bit of wisdom from one of my 
favorite people Lisa Franklin 

00:16:42.071 --> 00:16:48.982
who just passed away.  She is a 
thinker and writer and in her 

00:16:49.332 --> 00:16:56.216
lectures, she talks about the 
idea that most of the world of 

00:16:56.678 --> 00:17:03.741
technology that we live in was 
not made with our idea in mind. 

00:17:04.591 --> 00:17:04.743
This has never been more true. 
true.  

00:17:04.744 --> 00:17:06.744
Sotrue.  
So the

00:17:07.332 --> 00:17:11.408
 central question that I want to
 bring to us today, what is it 

00:17:11.409 --> 00:17:15.082
like to live in data.  One time 
we might have been satisfied 

00:17:15.083 --> 00:17:17.114
with collecting data and at some
 point we might have been 

00:17:17.115 --> 00:17:18.799
satisfied with visualizing it 
and more and more and more we we

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.800
 are we are actually creating 
systems and

00:17:23.516 --> 00:17:31.533
 worlds that we must provide in.
  This is a diagram by a 

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:36.757
sociologist named Jacob Murano 
and it's called a sociogram and 

00:17:36.978 --> 00:17:41.575
you can think of it as a social 
network.  This diagram is of a 

00:17:42.170 --> 00:17:47.504
7th grade classroom.  Girls on 
the right and boys on the left. 

00:17:48.084 --> 00:17:52.220
Two brave ductors crossing that.
I like this diagram, and I think

00:17:52.668 --> 00:17:55.865
 about how it would have been 
made.  The scientist or the 

00:17:56.074 --> 00:17:58.809
researcher would have had to sit
 in the classroom and watch the 

00:17:58.986 --> 00:17:59.706
students and the students would 
have had to watch them.  They  

00:17:59.707 --> 00:18:01.707
would have had to would have had
 to smell that

00:18:02.785 --> 00:18:06.764
 teenage smell and learn 
people's names and understand 

00:18:06.765 --> 00:18:08.278
that while these objects are 
being drawn as circles circles 

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:10.279
and

00:18:11.454 --> 00:18:14.561
 triangles, they are in fact 
humans, how would we do 

00:18:14.562 --> 00:18:19.458
something like this today?  We 
might do it like a research 

00:18:20.023 --> 00:18:24.130
group in Canebridge, 
Massachusetts did, they used a 

00:18:24.761 --> 00:18:31.867
Twitter API and pulled 600,000 
tweetstweets andtweets and ran 

00:18:21.788 --> 00:18:23.788
them

00:18:28.622 --> 00:18:32.674
 through sentiment analysis and 
attempts to decide which tweets 

00:18:32.675 --> 00:18:34.675
are sad 

00:18:38.836 --> 00:18:42.769
orangeorangery and so on.  They 
found out the saddest place in 

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:47.172
New York City was a high school 
called hunter college high 

00:18:47.301 --> 00:18:57.487
school, which was which was 
above which was above the 

00:18:40.715 --> 00:18:42.715
resiviour and

00:18:50.332 --> 00:18:54.761
 it shows up as a purple dot.  I
 think of what it must have been

00:18:56.686 --> 00:19:01.219
 like to be those students.  
This is a September day and the 

00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.220
day of, you were at

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:09.261
 a school in Manhattan and I 
think about what it's like to be

00:19:09.262 --> 00:19:14.370
 in high school and I can only 
imagine how weird the students 

00:19:14.855 --> 00:19:17.457
must have been to arrive in 
class.  I don't think the 

00:19:18.154 --> 00:19:20.349
students were thinking about 
that.  I don't think they 

00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:23.151
understood the data point as 
humans buthumans but return

00:19:31.045 --> 00:19:38.125
 for API.  I tell this story, 
they made a big mistake.  The 

00:19:38.126 --> 00:19:40.484
system they used to locate the 
tweets was wrong. 

00:19:40.485 --> 00:19:43.319
It wasn't actually this high 
school, but it was somewhere 

00:19:43.532 --> 00:19:45.532
else nearby that they had 
determined to be the saddest 

00:19:45.637 --> 00:19:49.893
point in Manhattan.  And I went 
and visited the vice president 

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:52.212
of the high school and I asked 
her, what was the mood

00:19:55.610 --> 00:20:00.339
 of the students for the first 
day and she said nobody cared.  

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:04.648
Why did nobody care?  Well we 
knew it was wrong because high 

00:20:04.649 --> 00:20:08.093
school students don't use 
Twitter.  And we know that when 

00:20:08.094 --> 00:20:12.263
we are not allowed to use social
 media, we know they are using 

00:20:12.264 --> 00:20:14.264
it but Twitter isTwitter is for
Twitter is for old people and 

00:20:15.109 --> 00:20:18.585
nobody in the high school uses 
it.  It's kind of amazing.  

00:20:18.586 --> 00:20:24.484
Right, these guys have gone in 
public based on a premise which 

00:20:24.485 --> 00:20:29.633
was false from the beginning.  I
 think thisbeginning.  I think 

00:20:23.537 --> 00:20:25.537
this examplebeginning.  I think 
this example highlights a 

00:20:27.531 --> 00:20:32.889
lot of our problems.  This 
amazing ability we have to 

00:20:33.845 --> 00:20:35.601
harvest and collect more data 
has to be balanced with the idea

00:20:35.602 --> 00:20:39.219
 that the mechanisms we need to 
do so are further away from the 

00:20:39.470 --> 00:20:42.144
people that we were engaged with
 in the beginning.  What is it 

00:20:42.645 --> 00:20:48.082
like to live in data?  It sucks.
And I don't mean that only in 

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:58.402
the majority, I mean it's like a
 gigantic vacuum cleaner.  The

00:20:59.107 --> 00:21:02.197
 word collection is in the title
 of today's event, and 

00:21:02.198 --> 00:21:06.415
collection and gathering is a 
neat way, and I think it's a 

00:21:06.416 --> 00:21:09.962
little more violent where 
strengthening and abstracting 

00:21:09.963 --> 00:21:13.753
and mining data from 
individuals, a few years ago -- 

00:21:13.953 --> 00:21:19.745
actually in 2009 I became a 
little bit obsessed with these 

00:21:19.915 --> 00:21:22.144
tweets that people would write 
when they landed at the airport.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:26.631
You were not allowed to do it at
 the time.  People would tweet 

00:21:26.632 --> 00:21:27.150
as soon as they landed.  I 
pulled a few from the few from 

00:21:27.151 --> 00:21:29.151
the feed few from the feed this 
morning. 

00:21:31.692 --> 00:21:36.293
These are statements, there is 
nothing really exciting here 

00:21:36.568 --> 00:21:40.306
they go into someone's life but 
there are also data points.  I 

00:21:40.537 --> 00:21:40.909
know where they just landed and 
I know from their profile 

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.910
profile where profile where they

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:50.192
 live, we can reinstruct a 
system from just those tweets 

00:21:50.646 --> 00:21:53.849
which is a simulation of air 
travel and this actually came 

00:21:54.448 --> 00:21:57.271
out of a discussion with a 
friend of mine who is an 

00:21:59.473 --> 00:22:03.066
epidemiologist who is always 
looking for a way to model human

00:22:03.067 --> 00:22:06.129
 travel and we thought we can 
model it based on the tweets 

00:22:06.342 --> 00:22:10.376
that people were making when 
they landed on the tarnack.  A A

00:22:10.377 --> 00:22:12.377
  A week

00:22:13.635 --> 00:22:17.717
 later, I made this called good 
morning.  This is everybody on 

00:22:17.718 --> 00:22:20.038
Twitter in 2009 saying good 
morning.  And you can see the 

00:22:20.445 --> 00:22:23.099
way they traveled around the 
world.  Green dots are people 

00:22:23.466 --> 00:22:27.623
who get up early.  Red dots are 
people who get up late.  I'll 

00:22:28.065 --> 00:22:32.127
let you see the east coast and 
the west coast to make your 

00:22:32.128 --> 00:22:35.468
decision on which one is lazier.
There is nothing steady 

00:22:36.002 --> 00:22:40.203
happening here.  But there is 
something activating for me to 

00:22:40.422 --> 00:22:42.422
construct something from 
nothing.  And I wasn't the only 

00:22:42.545 --> 00:22:45.053
one.  Advertisers Advertisers 
were very excited about the 

00:22:45.054 --> 00:22:49.226
potential that we can scrape up 
data from people and put it 

00:22:49.227 --> 00:22:52.573
together in stories.  In 2011, a
 couple of researchers 

00:22:52.574 --> 00:22:55.457
discovered that apple was 
storing all of your location 

00:22:55.458 --> 00:23:00.394
data and it was storing it 
unsecurely on your device.  

00:23:00.395 --> 00:23:02.905
What that meant is that anybody 
who knew where to look, can find

00:23:02.906 --> 00:23:07.692
 a file that says exactly where 
you had been since you owned 

00:23:07.890 --> 00:23:10.041
your phone.  I don't have to 
think about that very long to 

00:23:10.175 --> 00:23:15.812
understand the proxy concerns 
here.  But a group of people 

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.225
that I was working with at the 
New York times lab at the time, 

00:23:21.841 --> 00:23:28.266
Jay, Brian House and I said look
 at all of this data, let's get 

00:23:28.917 --> 00:23:34.071
it while we can.  We found data 
at open path, you can find 

00:23:36.356 --> 00:23:42.677
openpath.CC and the app collects
 data from your phone and it's 

00:23:42.843 --> 00:23:45.746
secure and only you have access 
to it.  You can share the data 

00:23:46.483 --> 00:23:51.632
with researchers for whom this 
type of data is gould.  It's 

00:23:51.633 --> 00:23:53.633
really really exciting for

00:23:57.129 --> 00:24:00.670
 epidemiologists and urban 
planners.  It's almost always 

00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.709
held by private entities and can
 we make a collective tool so 

00:24:06.033 --> 00:24:09.930
people can visualize the data 
and understand what is going on 

00:24:10.099 --> 00:24:13.300
in the world and understand the 
researcher.  You can go and look

00:24:13.733 --> 00:24:16.114
 at the data and see where you 
have been and the patterns of 

00:24:16.317 --> 00:24:20.010
your travel and so on and so on.
It's pretty simple.  But for us 

00:24:21.233 --> 00:24:24.343
it was experimenting something. 
It was an experiment in data 

00:24:24.344 --> 00:24:26.622
ownership, what happened when we
 give people ownership of their 

00:24:26.754 --> 00:24:31.452
data?  And in this case they 
really do have ownership.  If I 

00:24:31.876 --> 00:24:33.876
wanted to look up your your  
your data, I did

00:24:35.667 --> 00:24:40.143
 for a while, I couldn't, it's 
encrypted on the server.  

00:24:40.144 --> 00:24:45.562
Only you can find it.  The idea 
was maybe the data ownership was

00:24:45.701 --> 00:24:47.954
 a personal relationship with 
data and I think we are pretty 

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:51.450
far away from right now.  I 
think when I say the phrase to 

00:24:52.154 --> 00:24:56.080
people, they are like what are 
you talking about?  There is a 

00:24:56.195 --> 00:24:57.045
lot of personal information in 
the data.  This is a graphic by 

00:24:57.046 --> 00:24:59.046
by Brian by Brian House

00:25:00.895 --> 00:25:04.892
 and shows what he calls 
meaningful location.  This is 

00:25:04.893 --> 00:25:06.893
derived from the data and the 
the data

00:25:07.089 --> 00:25:10.503
 knows where he lived, where his
 girlfriend lived at the time, 

00:25:10.504 --> 00:25:13.189
where he practiced with this 
band.  The pieces of meaning are

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:18.109
 encoded by the data.
I did something a little little 

00:25:13.284 --> 00:25:18.623
bit different with my data.  
These are little arrows in there

00:25:19.334 --> 00:25:22.786
 and the direction that I was 
traveling in and this reads like

00:25:23.198 --> 00:25:26.557
 a clock on its side so over on 
the left here is the beginning 

00:25:26.686 --> 00:25:28.686
of the day, that is me is me 
going is me going to work. 

00:25:29.066 --> 00:25:33.926
 At the time I went northwest to
 work and then at lunch up at 

00:25:33.927 --> 00:25:35.390
the top and down down at the

00:25:35.391 --> 00:25:39.159
 bottom, I had just moved to New
 York, I had just went home. 

00:25:39.506 --> 00:25:40.923
That is is me is me all over New
 York

00:25:40.924 --> 00:25:41.430
 and there might be some bits 
there in the very late evening. 

00:25:41.431 --> 00:25:43.431
evening.  Butevening.  But the

00:25:44.878 --> 00:25:50.554
 idea of this was could we make 
an artifact that someone can put

00:25:50.768 --> 00:25:56.081
 up on their wall?  I had this 
dream that someone would put 

00:25:56.082 --> 00:26:01.570
this up on their wall at night 
before bed and look up at it and

00:26:01.778 --> 00:26:04.903
 say, good night data.  
It's weird because this is what 

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:08.280
data looks like.  This is one 
data point.  Another data point.

00:26:08.547 --> 00:26:15.663
Another data point.  I moved to 
New York City from after living 

00:26:16.253 --> 00:26:22.045
in Vancouver, Canada my whole 
life, and this is the moment I 

00:26:22.316 --> 00:26:27.720
stepped off the plane at 
LaGuardia airport for the new 

00:26:28.416 --> 00:26:34.321
chapter in my life.  The data 
point was that night when I had 

00:26:34.322 --> 00:26:41.222
a crisp glass of reesling in a 
restaurant in Amsterdam Avenue 

00:26:41.912 --> 00:26:44.798
and I would have for gotten 
about it if it wasn't for this 

00:26:45.174 --> 00:26:48.635
data point.  Five years ago I 
opened the door at the end of my

00:26:48.834 --> 00:26:53.237
 apartment building and bet my 
partner, Nora, who is here and 

00:26:53.588 --> 00:26:57.738
instantly fell in love, and this
 point to me, I had this idea 

00:26:58.049 --> 00:27:02.120
that I will sit my grandchild 
down in my lap and show them 

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:07.545
this data point and say this is 
how this started.  We made some 

00:27:07.546 --> 00:27:12.575
progress there.  This is my 
favorite data point.  Actually 

00:27:13.769 --> 00:27:16.807
when I wrote this out, I 
remember something interesting 

00:27:16.942 --> 00:27:19.816
that we were all born with data.
This is what we share with our 

00:27:19.817 --> 00:27:25.231
family and friends.  We share 
these numbers and statistics to 

00:27:25.359 --> 00:27:31.432
prove something and prove that 
the child was born.  They are 

00:27:31.778 --> 00:27:32.081
evidence ofevidence of our
evidence of our existence

00:27:32.082 --> 00:27:37.252
 and time on the planet.  Any 
way, what is it like to live in 

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:39.450
data?
I think there is the sensation 

00:27:39.646 --> 00:27:43.767
for most people that we are 
being used and we are being used

00:27:43.888 --> 00:27:49.673
 and again, primarily by 
advertisers so most of the 

00:27:49.941 --> 00:27:54.181
machinery around data goes 
towards placing ads in your web 

00:27:56.195 --> 00:27:59.553
browser.  Maybe behind the 
surveillance is slightly 

00:27:59.675 --> 00:28:02.397
sophisticated but maybe not.  
Most of the effort is being done

00:28:02.398 --> 00:28:06.957
 to place ads in your web 
browser.  I teach a class at New

00:28:07.211 --> 00:28:10.155
 York University and one of my 
students had a project called 

00:28:11.057 --> 00:28:13.760
cookie job and she took 
collections from people's 

00:28:14.029 --> 00:28:18.588
advertisements and sent them to 
strangers and had them write 

00:28:18.807 --> 00:28:20.863
stories based only on their ads.
Advertisers are trying to find 

00:28:21.013 --> 00:28:25.130
out about you and give you ads. 
Can we turn that around and take

00:28:25.677 --> 00:28:27.990
 ads and find something out 
about ourselves?  At the time I 

00:28:27.991 --> 00:28:31.318
was working on a project that 
allowed me to collect all of my 

00:28:32.225 --> 00:28:35.801
ads.  This is a month worth of 
web ads that I saw.  I sent it 

00:28:37.927 --> 00:28:38.522
to ten strangers and paid them 
ten dollars andten dollars and 

00:28:38.523 --> 00:28:40.523
askedten dollars and asked them

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:44.714
 to write about me.  It was 
interesting.  

00:28:50.624 --> 00:28:54.070
[Laughter].  I learned some 
things about myself -- I learned

00:28:54.243 --> 00:28:58.801
 nothing about myself but I 
learned some things about what 

00:28:58.802 --> 00:29:03.365
advertisers believe about me.  I
 am in my 30s and I live alone 

00:29:03.366 --> 00:29:06.748
and play video games.
I love this one.  This is my 

00:29:06.952 --> 00:29:11.706
favorite one.  I want to get it 
framed.  [Laughter].  So there 

00:29:12.086 --> 00:29:14.086
is something interesting 
happening here.  Advertisers are

00:29:14.504 --> 00:29:15.661
 collecting data about us us and
 us and they

00:29:15.662 --> 00:29:20.053
 are building these profiles and
 making decisions based on the 

00:29:20.054 --> 00:29:22.806
data and those decisions more 
and more are affecting our 

00:29:23.169 --> 00:29:26.606
lives.  Affecting the level to 
which we can be ensured that is 

00:29:27.273 --> 00:29:31.135
the type of health insurance we 
are being presented and might 

00:29:31.305 --> 00:29:35.081
affect the type of credit card 
that we are being offered.  This

00:29:35.082 --> 00:29:39.544
 tool we built in my studio 
called flood watch allows you to

00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:43.793
 keep track of the type of ads 
and allows you to donate the 

00:29:43.794 --> 00:29:47.239
data to researchers.  
Researchers in particular who 

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:51.637
are interested in discriminatory
 advertising practices.  Places 

00:29:51.638 --> 00:29:53.638
in which advertisers are

00:29:57.083 --> 00:29:59.601
 discriminating against on 
things that you are not allowed 

00:29:59.602 --> 00:30:08.521
to discriminate on, age, gender,
 race and we are investigating 

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:11.296
now and building this tool and 
hoping to get tens and thousands

00:30:11.457 --> 00:30:16.308
 of users so they can collect 
the largest database of 

00:30:16.309 --> 00:30:20.631
advertising data, and just don't
 give it to advertisers, so you 

00:30:20.632 --> 00:30:22.632
can find more about

00:30:24.651 --> 00:30:26.830
 floodwatch.OCR.NYC.  
If you are interested in this, I

00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:31.442
 will say hold off.  Our next 
version is going to be really 

00:30:31.862 --> 00:30:34.592
amazing.  What we have done I 
think in the creation of our 

00:30:35.084 --> 00:30:38.577
data systems is not dissimilar 
to what we started to do or 

00:30:38.944 --> 00:30:41.896
continue to do with our cities 
and Jay 

00:30:45.463 --> 00:30:50.014
Jacobs, the urbanism critic, 
talked about one of the problems

00:30:50.015 --> 00:30:52.219
 at the time and I think one of 
the continued problems in cities

00:30:52.450 --> 00:30:56.889
 was the lack of feedback for 
people who live in cities and 

00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:01.120
tools like open path and flood 
watch are about giving people 

00:31:01.121 --> 00:31:05.613
who live in data, mechanism for 
feedback.  What we want to do, 

00:31:05.614 --> 00:31:11.347
is be able to give them agency 
because one of the other things 

00:31:11.348 --> 00:31:13.348
that it's like to 

00:31:17.551 --> 00:31:23.049
be living in data.  What does it
 mean to give people agency?  In

00:31:23.169 --> 00:31:31.477
 man chester we have been 
studying with Will Dixon and he 

00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:34.879
studies pain and a 
rheumatologist.  What we found 

00:31:35.227 --> 00:31:37.449
over the years is that pain 
symptoms can seem to be 

00:31:39.677 --> 00:31:40.414
correlated with the weather.  
Right.  And this is confusing. 

00:31:40.415 --> 00:31:44.648
confusing.  
Weconfusing.  

00:31:37.915 --> 00:31:39.915
We don't really

00:31:43.693 --> 00:31:48.277
 know why.  We don't know if it 
exists.  There had been no 

00:31:48.278 --> 00:31:51.481
scientific research about this. 
 We started this project called 

00:31:51.482 --> 00:31:57.690
cloudy with a chance to pain.  
We recruited now almost 10 

00:31:57.691 --> 00:31:59.691
thousand chronic US

00:32:01.567 --> 00:32:07.489
 US pain sufferers.  We asked 
them to do a couple of things.  

00:32:08.011 --> 00:32:10.573
See how their pain system 
differs from others in the data 

00:32:10.779 --> 00:32:13.629
set and you can explore your own
 experiences compared to 

00:32:13.759 --> 00:32:17.651
everybody else.  We set up a 
system where we we mailed we 

00:32:13.733 --> 00:32:15.733
mailed people 

00:32:18.621 --> 00:32:21.626
three e-mails, weekly 
visualizations of what the 

00:32:22.053 --> 00:32:24.980
project was doing so they were 
part of the project and not just

00:32:25.848 --> 00:32:27.848
 storing the data data into data
 into a black hole

00:32:28.026 --> 00:32:30.026
 where it might

00:32:32.567 --> 00:32:37.213
 never come out again.  The 
biggest thing that we did in the

00:32:37.357 --> 00:32:42.042
 project which I am proud of, we
 made a tool to allow the 

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:46.468
contributors to the project, 
suppose their own hypothesis.  

00:32:46.469 --> 00:32:52.830
This is called citizens science 
projects and  I'm sure I'm sure 

00:32:44.374 --> 00:32:46.374
you have heard about 

00:32:51.188 --> 00:32:54.892
it.  They fall into two 
categories.  They are either 

00:32:55.063 --> 00:32:58.175
citizen data collection or 
citizen labor that they couldn't

00:32:58.344 --> 00:33:04.232
 find a grad student to do.  Not
 too many of them are actually 

00:33:04.710 --> 00:33:07.640
citizen scientists.  What we are
 doing here is meant to do 

00:33:07.999 --> 00:33:09.999
exactly that,that, lookthat, 
look at their data

00:33:10.069 --> 00:33:15.657
 and make a hypothesis, and what
 we end up with is not only ten 

00:33:16.007 --> 00:33:19.327
thousand people participating in
 the study but end up with 

00:33:19.807 --> 00:33:22.366
thousands of hypothesis and 
tells us what people are 

00:33:22.846 --> 00:33:27.649
thinking about the conditions 
and actually really good to look

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:29.657
 at the hypothesis.  Maybe 
people are finding something 

00:33:29.658 --> 00:33:33.764
that we are not able to find.  
The idea of putting people in 

00:33:33.765 --> 00:33:38.036
the drivers seat and giving them
 agencies, is super super 

00:33:38.037 --> 00:33:40.634
important to us. 
What is it like to live in data?

00:33:40.889 --> 00:33:44.288
I believe one of the primary 
conditions of living in data is 

00:33:44.792 --> 00:33:47.606
to be overwhelmed and feel like 
you are living under water.  We 

00:33:47.975 --> 00:33:54.136
can't really look at our data 
systems, because they are so big

00:33:54.294 --> 00:33:59.433
 and so complicated.  And there 
is this idea -- I do a lot of 

00:33:59.434 --> 00:34:02.361
data visualization and there is 
this idea that visualization is 

00:34:04.403 --> 00:34:07.803
a remedy to this and 
visualization can help us with 

00:34:08.104 --> 00:34:10.688
the complexity.  I can argue 
that visualization does not 

00:34:10.839 --> 00:34:15.401
usually help with complexity.  
What it does it getting riddive 

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:20.159
complexity but getting rid of 
complexity is like sweeping 

00:34:20.344 --> 00:34:23.352
something scary under the rug.  
We don't want to get rid of it. 

00:34:23.529 --> 00:34:25.502
We want to engage in it,it, in

00:34:25.503 --> 00:34:28.682
 a way of understanding.  This 
is what we have always had to do

00:34:28.954 --> 00:34:31.957
 as humans.  We have had to 
engage in complexing

00:34:36.998 --> 00:34:42.381
 things.  They might be right or
 wrong and at the same time, 

00:34:42.382 --> 00:34:46.579
they might be one over the 
other.  Humans have developed 

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.207
millions of years of evolution 
to do this, and I believe that 

00:34:50.208 --> 00:34:53.736
the mechanism we have developed 
is ours.  And we do a lot of 

00:34:53.737 --> 00:35:00.219
projects and trials to encounter
 this very appealing approach to

00:35:00.546 --> 00:35:02.535
 use visualization.  
For example, this is a map.  

00:35:02.536 --> 00:35:05.470
Yeah, it's a map, this is all of
 the hotels in the world.  There

00:35:06.711 --> 00:35:13.809
 is 500 thousand hotels and each
 one of them shows as a data.  

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:17.085
If I wanted to explain to people
 what hotels look like in space,

00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:21.400
 this is useful.  If I want to 
explain to people what hotels 

00:35:21.806 --> 00:35:26.537
are actually like, this is not 
useful at all.  So we were asked

00:35:26.804 --> 00:35:28.804
 by the 

00:35:31.161 --> 00:35:36.442
Vancouver Art Gallery to try to 
develop the complex system of 

00:35:36.666 --> 00:35:40.027
500 thousand hotels.  
Instead of turning to 

00:35:40.261 --> 00:35:43.542
visualization, we turned to 
narrative.  This is an image 

00:35:43.718 --> 00:35:50.398
that jack Purlack drew to help 
understand the journey that the 

00:35:50.605 --> 00:35:54.251
characters are going to take on 
the road.  We thought, this is 

00:35:54.406 --> 00:36:00.419
interesting, what if we did 
this, took hundreds of 

00:36:01.233 --> 00:36:07.750
characters from fictional novels
 and put them in today's world 

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:11.406
and tell them they can travel 
the same places from the 

00:36:12.294 --> 00:36:15.433
fictional novels and stay in 
hotels.  We dropped people in 

00:36:15.835 --> 00:36:19.568
the imaginary world, in real 
time, continually at the art 

00:36:19.989 --> 00:36:22.454
gallery for over three months 
and during the three month 

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.946
period, the imaginary fictional 
characters lived within the 

00:36:27.174 --> 00:36:31.246
database of the hotel.  Here 
we're going to see -- woops, I

00:36:35.969 --> 00:36:40.179
 skipped the video here.  These 
are the characters of Lolita 

00:36:40.551 --> 00:36:42.542
driving alongdriving along the 
eastern seaboard and they are 

00:36:42.543 --> 00:36:44.890
about to stop at the hotel for 
the night.

00:36:44.891 --> 00:36:49.491
They don't have a lot of money 
and going to search for what is 

00:36:44.491 --> 00:36:46.491
is available

00:36:47.903 --> 00:36:50.997
 in the budget.  On this 
particular day, you can see from

00:36:50.998 --> 00:36:56.735
 some of the returns, they don't
 have a lot of luck in finding a

00:36:56.736 --> 00:37:00.184
 beautiful hotel.  We show the 
viewer in the projection, kind 

00:37:00.185 --> 00:37:02.838
of a combination of photo 
documentation from the hotel 

00:37:02.989 --> 00:37:06.504
itself and also from the users. 
We show them the names of the 

00:37:06.667 --> 00:37:09.999
hotels, we look up the price and
 one of the interesting things 

00:37:10.149 --> 00:37:11.370
about this is that is that it's 
is that it's a living

00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:15.419
 system.  On one given night 
they might find these hotels and

00:37:15.572 --> 00:37:19.138
 the next one, there might be a 
football game near the hotel and

00:37:19.433 --> 00:37:28.316
 there are no hotels  available.
  available.  

00:37:13.616 --> 00:37:15.616
So

00:37:21.078 --> 00:37:22.946
 they have to drive to the next 
town and find a place to  to 

00:37:22.947 --> 00:37:28.676
stay there.  This idea of using 
narratives to frame the complex 

00:37:28.677 --> 00:37:31.214
data set is something that we 
have done over and over and over

00:37:31.428 --> 00:37:34.499
 again because it does give us a
 chance to investigate these 

00:37:34.663 --> 00:37:37.975
things that are otherwise really
 difficult to investigate.  I 

00:37:38.433 --> 00:37:40.797
believe that if aliens were to 
touch down today and try to 

00:37:43.475 --> 00:37:47.342
understand the culture, they 
would look towards the giant 

00:37:47.343 --> 00:37:50.627
data sets to see what was going 
on.  How would they do that?  

00:37:51.414 --> 00:37:55.566
Maybe a similar tactic done 
here.  This is a data set 

00:37:55.742 --> 00:37:59.440
mentioned in the introduction.  
The MOMA permanent collection, 

00:37:59.567 --> 00:38:03.749
127 thousand objects and we were
 approached by MOMA to do an 

00:38:04.377 --> 00:38:08.084
artist residency to see how we 
can base art work about this 

00:38:08.085 --> 00:38:10.085
data set to help people 
understand it, and help people 

00:38:10.204 --> 00:38:13.167
understand what is the character
 of this data set and what is 

00:38:13.548 --> 00:38:16.273
some of the possibilities that 
are in trend within it.  So what

00:38:16.711 --> 00:38:22.119
 do we do?  Well what do you do 
with a CSV.  You load it into a 

00:38:22.503 --> 00:38:25.983
database and you start asking it
 questions so some of the first 

00:38:26.165 --> 00:38:30.264
things we did was try to look 
for some pattern and I wrote a 

00:38:31.519 --> 00:38:34.460
little -- this takes a title and
 takes a title that is similar 

00:38:34.575 --> 00:38:41.338
and a little bit longer and we 
do it again and again again and 

00:38:32.012 --> 00:38:34.012
again and again and

00:38:38.434 --> 00:38:45.911
 again and we get these poetic 
instructions about the title of 

00:38:45.912 --> 00:38:52.769
art work.  I like them because 
theybecause they arebecause they

00:38:43.255 --> 00:38:45.255
 are provacative and run

00:38:52.083 --> 00:38:55.916
 to read.  We are mashing things
 together.  I think of it as a 

00:38:55.917 --> 00:38:59.122
cocktail party where the art 
work gets to meet for the first 

00:38:59.851 --> 00:39:05.321
time.  This art work is like oh,
 you're a trapeze girl and I am 

00:39:05.322 --> 00:39:09.359
another girl from another 
planet.  They have never been 

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:12.248
able to meet but in some 
commonalities in the way that 

00:39:12.619 --> 00:39:15.580
the titles are structured, they 
are able to meet and talk with 

00:39:16.444 --> 00:39:20.436
each other.  I meant to give the
 learning in this talk, that 

00:39:21.015 --> 00:39:26.039
there is some obscene language 
in this talk.  It's not in this 

00:39:26.167 --> 00:39:31.307
slide, coming up in the next 
one.  We were particularly 

00:39:32.038 --> 00:39:36.777
interested in the structure of 
the girl because there was this 

00:39:37.597 --> 00:39:39.829
sexualization of art and 
gendering of art in the titles. 

00:39:40.889 --> 00:39:45.841
Here is the obscene titles in 
the MOMA's database.  It was 

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.825
interesting.  It came in a 
period where artists for a long 

00:39:49.285 --> 00:39:52.409
time had been trying to 
challenge expectations of 

00:39:52.581 --> 00:39:56.488
galleries.  Here is a painting, 
it's all just black.  And now 

00:39:57.444 --> 00:40:00.469
they accepted that.  The next 
step was called -- I'm not going

00:40:00.594 --> 00:40:04.887
 to read it -- but it's called 
something like that.  But mark 

00:40:06.047 --> 00:40:11.029
Hanson who is one of my 
collaborators was doing database

00:40:11.733 --> 00:40:13.733
 queries, he asked what is the 
most common first name of of an

00:40:15.501 --> 00:40:19.970
 artist in the MOMA database?  
The most common first name is 

00:40:20.125 --> 00:40:22.125
John, there are over 200 Johns 
who have awho have a piece

00:40:24.057 --> 00:40:30.057
 in the MOMA data collection.  
Here are the top four.  Here are

00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:32.199
 the top forty. forty.  Iforty. 
 I am giving you

00:40:32.799 --> 00:40:33.048
 a second.  So it was this piece
 that really set the tone for  

00:40:33.049 --> 00:40:35.049
what we were what we were going

00:40:36.206 --> 00:40:40.134
 to do.  These are names and 
what is the natural human thing 

00:40:40.135 --> 00:40:44.416
to do with names?  The natural 
human things to do with names is

00:40:44.636 --> 00:40:51.186
 to read them.  They worked in 
the past with the developmental 

00:40:51.187 --> 00:40:56.677
theater group.  We decided that 
we were going to have 40 minute 

00:40:57.095 --> 00:40:59.139
performances and essentially the
 actors would read the database 

00:40:59.379 --> 00:41:05.062
in the gallery and do it in a 
way that was informative, and I 

00:41:05.428 --> 00:41:10.863
will play it, and again, there 
is obscene language.  And I will

00:41:12.085 --> 00:41:20.465
 show you right now.  "No title,
 shut the world, shut the 

00:41:24.854 --> 00:41:31.734

SPEAKER:  And how can we act 

00:45:07.372 --> 00:45:10.922
against people to produce the 
data.  It was one of the ways 

00:45:11.164 --> 00:45:14.119
that I thought was one of the 
most possible ways to have it 

00:45:14.467 --> 00:45:17.969
read and performed.  These 
performances are built for these

00:45:18.149 --> 00:45:20.149
 types of things to be able to 
present complex issues issues to

00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:26.240
 people in ways that don't give 
them a prescribed answer but 

00:45:26.241 --> 00:45:30.453
instead give them a set of 
questions that they might leave 

00:45:30.623 --> 00:45:33.485
with.  
This is Manchester where we did 

00:45:33.825 --> 00:45:37.301
the cloudy with a chance of pain
 project that we did before.  I 

00:45:37.511 --> 00:45:40.148
want to show you another project
 that talks about unusual ways 

00:45:40.149 --> 00:45:44.329
to show data.  We took some of 
the data from that study, 

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:51.054
actually all of the people from 
Manchester and constructed a 50 

00:45:51.272 --> 00:45:56.643
foot long bar graph that people 
can walk under and see the data 

00:45:57.267 --> 00:46:01.214
and help to sort of guess 
whether it's correlated to 

00:46:01.373 --> 00:46:03.980
certain weather conditions.  
What I love about this is how 

00:46:04.134 --> 00:46:05.524
often do you get to to 
experience to experience data

00:46:05.525 --> 00:46:07.525
 as a collective? collective?  
Ascollective?  As a family?  As

00:46:07.683 --> 00:46:14.549
 a class?  As a group?  I think 
that the methods for examining 

00:46:14.550 --> 00:46:18.544
data through a computer or 
phone, the problem that we are 

00:46:18.545 --> 00:46:22.245
dealing with, data is encoded or
 involved in, really do require 

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:24.951
us to deal with those things as 
a group.  

00:46:24.952 --> 00:46:29.340
This gave me a new metric for a 
successful project which is that

00:46:29.492 --> 00:46:32.341
 any successful project we do 
involving data has to be able to

00:46:33.051 --> 00:46:37.129
 fit an entire marching band 
underneath it.  You know we use 

00:46:37.339 --> 00:46:45.242
the word public a lot when we 
talk abouttalk about talk about 

00:46:33.569 --> 00:46:35.569
data, I would argue

00:46:39.889 --> 00:46:45.014
 that most of our engagements 
with data are inherently not 

00:46:45.211 --> 00:46:47.626
public.  They are public in the 
way that the white house is 

00:46:47.627 --> 00:46:50.003
public and not public in the way
 that the library is public.  

00:46:50.355 --> 00:46:53.715
They are public in that we are 
told it's for us but we can't 

00:46:54.103 --> 00:46:55.268
really go in.  We We don't

00:46:55.269 --> 00:46:57.602
 have the tools or access to do 
so.  How do we make public data 

00:46:57.603 --> 00:47:08.403
public data more public data 
more like libraries?  And I 

00:46:50.603 --> 00:46:52.603
would argue

00:47:02.233 --> 00:47:05.564
 that it is about understanding 
this collective experience.  And

00:47:06.111 --> 00:47:08.159
 something very interesting that
 happened to data over the last 

00:47:08.848 --> 00:47:12.154
few years, which is that our 
public understanding of it is 

00:47:12.304 --> 00:47:15.514
changed.  When I give a data 
talk, sometimes people come up 

00:47:15.738 --> 00:47:18.967
to me and say did you know that 
data is collective and it's a 

00:47:20.367 --> 00:47:21.178
plural, it's plural and that you
 should be saying dataman and I 

00:47:21.179 --> 00:47:23.179
I am I am saying I didn't

00:47:24.906 --> 00:47:28.031
 know that actually.  But the 
average person does not know 

00:47:28.527 --> 00:47:31.573
that.  We use it in a different 
way.  In society these days we 

00:47:31.574 --> 00:47:35.512
use it as a mass noun.  These 
are some other mass nouns.  So 

00:47:35.513 --> 00:47:39.531
the way that the average person 
uses data, it's something that 

00:47:39.532 --> 00:47:45.106
is invisible which is very very 
very interesting.  And I had the

00:47:45.107 --> 00:47:50.714
 great opportunity to work with 
the poet and photographer and 

00:47:51.007 --> 00:47:57.668
author, and built a project move
 The Game Together and we asked 

00:47:57.669 --> 00:48:01.968
the Twitter followers, when they
 were watching the world cup, to

00:48:02.518 --> 00:48:11.120
 take a photograph of the 
television and make a hash tag 

00:48:11.554 --> 00:48:14.223
and we automatically centered 
the television so they were on 

00:48:14.378 --> 00:48:18.000
top of each other.  It gives the
 idea that there was some 

00:48:18.461 --> 00:48:24.136
collective experience happening 
around the world cup.  Kaku who 

00:48:25.151 --> 00:48:30.548
is more elegant than I am.  He 
says the time of the game is 

00:48:32.408 --> 00:48:37.915
more of a public time.  I love 
the idea of public time and 

00:48:37.916 --> 00:48:41.814
mechanisms that allow people to 
come together, not necessarily 

00:48:42.054 --> 00:48:45.394
at the same physical space, but 
at the same time be able to 

00:48:45.573 --> 00:48:48.684
engage with what is essentially 
a very large data set.  What I 

00:48:49.463 --> 00:48:54.720
love from this quote, the data 
having us have the ability to 

00:48:54.721 --> 00:48:57.983
testify to each other's 
existence.  At my studio we were

00:48:58.252 --> 00:49:01.844
 working on one last very new 
project and I'm not going to 

00:49:02.017 --> 00:49:03.149
show you much of it it because 
it because there

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:06.624
 is not much that exists.  
What we are doing in St. Louis 

00:49:07.136 --> 00:49:10.632
is building a community space 
where people can come and 

00:49:10.757 --> 00:49:14.361
develop large scale maps 
together about their experience 

00:49:14.567 --> 00:49:18.312
in St. Louis and to use the maps
 to explore instruments of data.

00:49:21.943 --> 00:49:23.925
 neighborhood and project 
traffic information, access to 

00:49:23.926 --> 00:49:28.606
healthcare, so on and so on.  
And the idea here is that how do

00:49:28.796 --> 00:49:34.586
 we balance maps, this is a 
typical map room, a war room 

00:49:34.887 --> 00:49:37.549
with these once.  These hand 
drawn very beautiful maps.  This

00:49:37.683 --> 00:49:41.328
 is a map of somebody's paper 
route when they were a child.  

00:49:41.460 --> 00:49:48.033
How do we balance maps like 
this?  This is the map of St. 

00:49:48.194 --> 00:49:51.327
Louis that shows the incredible 
racial divide that exists in St.

00:49:53.337 --> 00:50:00.227
Louis.  How do we develop maps 
like this one, the blided 

00:50:00.559 --> 00:50:04.087
districts in St. Louis in the 
1800s.  With maps like this one,

00:50:04.088 --> 00:50:09.944
 this is a hand-drawn map of St.

00:50:09.945 --> 00:50:14.082
Louis resident Gene Taylor and 
here I think it lies with, how 

00:50:14.083 --> 00:50:18.527
do we deal with data?  How do we
 present the objective and 

00:50:18.528 --> 00:50:22.705
lining with the objective?  How 
do we present the cold clinical 

00:50:22.924 --> 00:50:25.557
magnitude of data alongside with
 the human story?  I don't think

00:50:25.672 --> 00:50:29.648
 I have an answer for you.  But 
I was doing some research around

00:50:29.773 --> 00:50:36.714
 this project and stumbled upon 
this phrase called geocity.  

00:50:36.932 --> 00:50:41.929
Compared to what geography which
 is what the world actually 

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:46.158
looks like but geocity is 
studying the world in how people

00:50:46.299 --> 00:50:50.260
 can actually see this.  I love 
moving away from using data as a

00:50:50.458 --> 00:50:53.196
 purely objective thing, but 
instead to understand knowledge 

00:50:53.197 --> 00:51:00.490
from any and all points of view.
  JK Write who came up with this

00:51:01.108 --> 00:51:09.911
 idea, talks aboutidea, talks 
about howidea, talks about how 

00:50:56.371 --> 00:50:58.371
geocity

00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:08.631
 is geography or everyone.  I 
want everyone to think about 

00:51:08.632 --> 00:51:13.026
what data would look like if 
data was for everyone.  What is 

00:51:13.027 --> 00:51:18.543
it like to live in data?  It's 
to be used, live without agency,

00:51:18.544 --> 00:51:22.781
 it's to be overwhelmed by 
complexity.

00:51:22.782 --> 00:51:27.359
What if we were to turn that 
around and enter an era of data 

00:51:27.742 --> 00:51:30.664
humanism where we might first 
design data systems for the 

00:51:30.972 --> 00:51:34.111
well-being of the people from 
whom it was taken.  We might, 

00:51:34.279 --> 00:51:38.856
whenever possible, provide 
mechanisms for feedback.  We 

00:51:39.518 --> 00:51:45.946
might honor the complexity of 
individual and reality.  We 

00:51:45.947 --> 00:51:49.087
might create real and 
functioning data public.  

00:51:49.088 --> 00:51:51.889
Everybody in this room I think 
in some case, is a data 

00:51:52.253 --> 00:52:03.799
professional in a weird a weird 
 a weird way.  

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.840
And

00:51:53.509 --> 00:51:56.674
 I think it's up to us to build 
these worlds.  I have been 

00:51:56.675 --> 00:51:59.675
thinking about this mostly 
because I have a 13 month old 

00:51:59.837 --> 00:52:03.971
son who has to live in this new 
world of data that we are all 

00:52:04.951 --> 00:52:09.638
collectively creating and I hope
 if we consider these these 

00:52:04.264 --> 00:52:06.264
things these things and

00:52:07.369 --> 00:52:11.566
 primarily do this, we put 
another layer of wisdom at the 

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.364
bottom before we go about the 
endeavor of collecting data to 

00:52:16.901 --> 00:52:18.901
make sure that the structures 
that we build are livable and if

00:52:19.319 --> 00:52:22.893
 we do that, maybe the answers 
are different.  What is it like 

00:52:23.271 --> 00:52:29.689
to live in data?  To be 
empowered.  To be engaged, to be

00:52:30.258 --> 00:52:37.655
 equal, to be given new ways of 
seeing -- to be given new ways 

00:52:38.162 --> 00:52:40.692
of being, and most importantly 
to be at home.  Thank 

00:52:44.035 --> 00:52:46.035
you.  

00:53:33.033 --> 00:53:35.033
[Applause]. 

00:53:55.033 --> 00:54:40.052
[Applause]. 
SPEAKER:  so much, Jer.  Your 

00:53:12.814 --> 00:53:16.146
work is powerful as well as 
beautiful.  I am a big fan of 

00:53:16.147 --> 00:53:19.670
love stories, especially that 
one.  I love somehow you showed 

00:53:19.671 --> 00:53:23.564
the research and how the studies
 are involved in the studying.  

00:53:23.565 --> 00:53:25.852
I think it's powerful and 
interesting.  This next session 

00:53:25.853 --> 00:53:26.699
is a bit bit of bit of a treat

00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.246
 for me.  It gives me a chance 
to highlight some Library of 

00:53:30.506 --> 00:53:33.132
Congress staff and partners 
whose work I think you about 

00:53:33.133 --> 00:53:40.578
find interesting and relevant.  
I will start us us off us off 

00:53:29.821 --> 00:53:31.821
and then we will

00:53:36.244 --> 00:53:39.208
 have Matthew Weber, an 
assistant professor at the 

00:53:39.209 --> 00:53:44.602
school of communications and 
co-director of Rutgers net-sci. 

00:53:44.716 --> 00:53:54.510
Matt and his colleagues Mulligan
 and Lynne led a data session 

00:53:54.656 --> 00:53:57.377
here at the library.  We're 
going to talk about the impact 

00:53:57.518 --> 00:54:01.101
in the web community and last we
 will have Deborah Thomas, the 

00:54:02.191 --> 00:54:04.790
manager for the national digital
 newspaper program and Leah 

00:54:05.727 --> 00:54:09.318
Weinryb Grohsgal, a senior 
program officer in the office of

00:54:09.319 --> 00:54:12.513
 humanities and the officer of 
the national newspaper program 

00:54:12.514 --> 00:54:17.417
and will talk about the recent 
chronicle data challenge in 

00:54:18.428 --> 00:54:20.050
which members of the public used
 used data used data in a

00:54:20.051 --> 00:54:25.604
 national competition. 
First I will talk about my team,

00:54:25.605 --> 00:54:28.455
 national Digital Initiative 
about who we are and what we 

00:54:28.456 --> 00:54:30.456
have done and what we are

00:54:33.006 --> 00:54:35.006
 going 

00:54:38.735 --> 00:54:45.819
to do in the future.  That's us,
 national Digital Initiative. 

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:55.286
welcome from national digital 
initiative.  Let me introduce 

00:54:55.497 --> 00:55:05.366
you to my team.  There is me, 
Kate, and Jaime Neer, there is

00:55:05.756 --> 00:55:11.385
 Jaime, everybody say high, and 
Mike, do you mind standing up 

00:55:11.741 --> 00:55:17.869
and waving?  And Abby Potter, 
and also, you guys met Jane a 

00:55:18.239 --> 00:55:24.607
little bit earlier and also I 
think in the crowd is Eugene 

00:55:26.388 --> 00:55:31.278
Flanagin and Colleen who provide
 the structure of what we are 

00:55:31.812 --> 00:55:33.812
doing.  If you like what you are

00:55:35.593 --> 00:55:40.233
 seeing, please tell them.  I am
 here to talk about national 

00:55:41.056 --> 00:55:44.929
digital here but I want to tell 
a story about the library's long

00:55:45.712 --> 00:55:51.136
 history of technological 
information from Henry Avram who

00:55:51.428 --> 00:55:53.428
 worked

00:55:54.755 --> 00:55:56.755
 here and replaced an

00:56:00.162 --> 00:56:05.020
analoging with digital records. 
She studied in New York in 1919 

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:13.540
and did pre-med.  She was in her
 30s when she started this 

00:56:13.541 --> 00:56:16.654
program.  I like this story 
because people say if you 

00:56:17.879 --> 00:56:24.010
haven't been codes since 
diapers, you can't do it.  But 

00:56:24.164 --> 00:56:26.164
that's wrong.  She did it it and
 it and 

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:36.373
here to change the world.  We 
created Mark which holds 

00:56:36.501 --> 00:56:39.551
information and digital 
catalogs.  Does anyone remember 

00:56:39.694 --> 00:56:42.614
it?  There are colleagues who 
don't remember it.  I really do 

00:56:42.756 --> 00:56:46.659
miss the beauty of them.  And 
the smell.  Do you remember how 

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:52.057
they used to smell?  That is all
 I missed.  They were kind of 

00:56:52.058 --> 00:56:57.322
hard to use.  Right and what 
Henry and the team gave us, is 

00:56:57.573 --> 00:57:00.679
the power to share that 
information across oceans and 

00:57:00.884 --> 00:57:05.360
search it at a key stroke.  
Right now I can sit at my desk 

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:13.215
and search the British holdings 
at the library.  In the past 

00:57:13.375 --> 00:57:18.072
that would have been possible.  
Searching with a search a search

00:57:12.944 --> 00:57:15.743
 spring 

00:57:18.937 --> 00:57:20.703
is easier than looking up eagle 
and see that was not the way the

00:57:20.704 --> 00:57:22.704
 way that the way that someone

00:57:23.714 --> 00:57:28.331
 intended to catalog it.  It 
gave us sharability.  

00:57:28.332 --> 00:57:31.746
It's the kind of work that made 
it interesting, application of 

00:57:32.211 --> 00:57:37.231
work here made it easier for 
everybody's life.  We can swap 

00:57:37.815 --> 00:57:42.429
catalog records and have joint 
teams where we can copy 

00:57:42.637 --> 00:57:55.114
cataloging and it really really 
improved really improved all of 

00:57:34.426 --> 00:57:36.426
our lives.  I think

00:57:45.525 --> 00:57:52.481
 of Henryiette as a hidden hero 
of computer science.  She is a 

00:57:52.482 --> 00:57:58.265
personal hero of mine.  She came
 from libraries of software like

00:57:58.266 --> 00:57:59.534
 I did, and took this to home 
and heart like I do.  She  She 

00:57:59.535 --> 00:58:01.535
did all She did all of this

00:58:03.009 --> 00:58:05.741
 before computers were networked
 and before relational databases

00:58:06.342 --> 00:58:10.214
 were a thing, before character 
encoding was really mature and I

00:58:10.215 --> 00:58:13.917
 would like to take a moment and
 reflect on what she was able to

00:58:14.079 --> 00:58:19.419
 give us at a time when this 
sharing of information was very 

00:58:19.928 --> 00:58:21.176
limited.  And I think I think 
also I think also about her

00:58:21.177 --> 00:58:23.177
  story, story, it shows me the 
power

00:58:23.645 --> 00:58:27.667
 of combining discipline which 
she did in her own self and many

00:58:27.668 --> 00:58:32.056
 of you, you do too.  You have, 
you know, your data science 

00:58:32.413 --> 00:58:35.653
background and you work in 
libraries or you are a software 

00:58:36.019 --> 00:58:40.135
developer who is a journalist 
and she did that herself.  We do

00:58:40.315 --> 00:58:44.676
 that also by having rooms like 
this where we share our 

00:58:44.828 --> 00:58:48.909
knowledge and get to learn each 
other.  That is where we see key

00:58:49.182 --> 00:58:51.927
 changes and where we can 
provide cross discipline.  Her 

00:58:51.928 --> 00:58:56.347
work really started the digital 
revolution in information 

00:58:56.482 --> 00:59:01.587
science and it is something that
 we carry forward today.  Here 

00:59:01.588 --> 00:59:03.879
at the Library of Congress and 
also broadly in the field.  I 

00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:08.619
think about her as the person 
who really started libraries' 

00:59:08.736 --> 00:59:16.436
commitment to open source.  For 
those of you that that work that

00:59:05.302 --> 00:59:07.302
 work in open

00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:16.048
 software in the library, we are
 avid users and also standard 

00:59:16.458 --> 00:59:19.961
work, we are famous for getting 
committees together and all 

00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.781
working together.  Right and I 
think it really does lift the 

00:59:22.985 --> 00:59:26.338
tie and that is the kind of work
 that I am really excited about.

00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:35.527
innovation can look like a dot 
in the timeline, but it's really

00:59:36.773 --> 00:59:41.467
 not.  People say what was 
released to the public in 1938, 

00:59:41.894 --> 00:59:45.273
but really it was ten years of 
releases but it looks like a dot

00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:49.086
 in a timeline in hind sight and
 it still continues to improve 

00:59:49.573 --> 00:59:55.327
today.  We have teams of people 
working internationally.  

00:59:55.328 --> 00:59:57.428
International standards that now
 contain character support for 

00:59:57.756 --> 01:00:03.474
all currently-used languages.  
It's this thing that continues 

01:00:03.838 --> 01:00:09.581
to blossom.  And I think about 
that in relation to other work 

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:13.899
here at the library like 
lock.gov.  It's another dot in 

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.544
the timeline but actually 
continuous improvement.  We add 

01:00:16.545 --> 01:00:20.125
new collections all of the time,
 my colleagues in OCIO and 

01:00:20.883 --> 01:00:23.076
library services put in an 
enormous amount of work to 

01:00:23.201 --> 01:00:26.240
release the new treasures to the
 public.  Just this year we 

01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:30.500
released a lot of new 
collections including George 

01:00:33.059 --> 01:00:40.060
Patent's diary, the art ethnic 
project and Walt Witman's paper 

01:00:40.198 --> 01:00:44.215
and I want to take a second to 
look at this release.  We can 

01:00:44.584 --> 01:00:48.331
look at any other collection 
like the ball room instruction 

01:00:48.556 --> 01:00:53.397
manuals, you should check them 
out, or the 2014 elective 

01:00:54.310 --> 01:00:56.378
archives and I picked this one 
because it's really special to 

01:00:56.557 --> 01:01:03.364
me and really exciting.  Rosa 
Park's personal papers are in 

01:01:03.483 --> 01:01:10.295
the library for ten years and 
contain 7,500 pieces of paper 

01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:15.506
and 2,500 prints and photographs
 documenting her right for 

01:01:15.507 --> 01:01:18.479
activism and civil rights for 
African Americans.  The 

01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.358
materials came here and assessed
 and stabilized by the LC 

01:01:22.483 --> 01:01:26.668
division and categorized in 
libraries.  Files were moved by 

01:01:26.669 --> 01:01:31.148
people in software, they were 
assessed, validated and assessed

01:01:31.486 --> 01:01:35.978
 for access, met data was 
transformed and rights were 

01:01:36.377 --> 01:01:42.347
assessed.  That is a few years 
worth of work in less than 140 

01:01:42.625 --> 01:01:45.967
characters.  And those of you 
that are librarians in the room,

01:01:45.968 --> 01:01:51.189
 you know this is just a job.  
You know, a bunch of work to 

01:01:51.389 --> 01:01:54.730
make the information signable 
and usable.  I want0 it make a 

01:01:55.265 --> 01:01:58.296
big deal out of it.  We make a 
big splash for cool new websites

01:01:58.529 --> 01:02:02.014
 and exciting visualization but 
the sustained and careful 

01:02:02.444 --> 01:02:05.640
efforts that it takes to get new
 information out is something 

01:02:05.865 --> 01:02:11.302
that I think we should really 
celebrate and I think it also 

01:02:12.184 --> 01:02:14.184
speaks to something that I have 
been talking about which is 

01:02:14.468 --> 01:02:17.722
intention and sustainability and
 I think about this in terms of 

01:02:18.649 --> 01:02:22.003
lock.gov and the sustained 
effort it takes to getting new 

01:02:22.276 --> 01:02:25.479
collections ready and the 
enduring power of mark and other

01:02:28.393 --> 01:02:33.393
 bibliographical standards and I
 think of Henryiette as my 

01:02:33.595 --> 01:02:35.393
shining beacon because she 
believed in the power of  

01:02:35.394 --> 01:02:37.394
infrastructure and 
infrastructure and it's

01:02:38.276 --> 01:02:41.457
 something that I can get really
 excited about.  I think 

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:46.210
infrastructure is really cool.  
It's the road we all drive to 

01:02:46.767 --> 01:02:52.726
get to interesting places.  And 
national Digital Initiative can 

01:02:52.931 --> 01:02:55.882
become the cool new group.  But 
I don't want to do that.  I want

01:02:56.303 --> 01:02:59.140
 things that lift the tide and 
have a beautiful future.  With 

01:02:59.532 --> 01:03:03.332
that all in mind, as we were 
doing our planning for national 

01:03:03.852 --> 01:03:06.738
Digital Initiatives I would like
 to share the goal that we came 

01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:11.587
up with today.  First is to 
maximize the benefit of the 

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:13.987
digital collection to the 
American public and to the 

01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:17.154
world. We have a lot of stuff 
here at LC.  We have a lot of it

01:03:17.599 --> 01:03:18.092
 and a lot of and a lot of it 
and a lot of it is

01:03:18.093 --> 01:03:22.465
 publicly available in digital. 
 We have 10 million historical 

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:26.833
digital newspapers.  We have 1.2
 million prints and photographs,

01:03:27.299 --> 01:03:33.104
 we have the personal papers of 
George Washington, Lincoln, 

01:03:33.105 --> 01:03:39.162
Regan, Jackie Robinson.  We have
 this really awesome team here 

01:03:39.163 --> 01:03:46.020
called Educational Outreach and 
they spoke on K through 12 

01:03:46.021 --> 01:03:50.009
resources and they prepare 
resources and help teachers get 

01:03:50.010 --> 01:03:52.738
material out to their students 
from the library.  And I like to

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:58.771
 think about how we can extend 
the benefit that they give to 

01:03:58.946 --> 01:04:01.199
advanced scholars and to the 
public and the curious and how 

01:04:01.358 --> 01:04:06.143
do we teach a new generation of 
journalists to come to the 

01:04:06.299 --> 01:04:06.801
library forlibrary for reference
library for reference help

01:04:06.802 --> 01:04:10.178
 and resources.  I think that 
would be the kind of thing 

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:15.158
exciting to work on.  We would 
like to create reuse of the 

01:04:15.313 --> 01:04:20.084
collection, the great mustache 
of LOC.  I tried to grow one 

01:04:20.085 --> 01:04:23.259
today for example, it didn't 
really work out.  People use 

01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.260
these for mugs and T-shirts and 
and it's and it's really neat

01:04:26.954 --> 01:04:29.708
 to see that kind of economic 
benefit for things that are in 

01:04:29.709 --> 01:04:32.939
the public collection.  
And it's also fun and exciting 

01:04:33.266 --> 01:04:36.715
and it brings people to the 
collection too, which is great. 

01:04:37.703 --> 01:04:41.605
But it also serves as an 
important scholarly purpose too.

01:04:41.606 --> 01:04:43.606
Back to the Rosa

01:04:46.698 --> 01:04:51.601
 parks collection in which this 
has this powerful note, I felt I

01:04:51.602 --> 01:04:54.754
 have been pushed around my 
entire life and at that moment I

01:04:55.061 --> 01:05:01.334
 couldn't take it anymore.  This
 note gives incite as to Park's 

01:05:01.335 --> 01:05:07.442
 heroism in heroism in America. 
 Other pictures show more as a 

01:05:08.358 --> 01:05:12.015
human.  
And I love what was picked up 

01:05:12.276 --> 01:05:17.261
from the press and food bloggers
 and I hear it makes great 

01:05:18.317 --> 01:05:20.317
pancakes.  How is it?  Anybody  
tried it? 

01:05:21.822 --> 01:05:26.324
 Peanut butter I think is the 
secret ingredient.  But the 

01:05:27.203 --> 01:05:31.324
pancake paints the better 
picture for us, that she was she

01:05:26.948 --> 01:05:28.948
 was a

01:05:30.061 --> 01:05:33.322
 person with family and friends 
and was a real person and really

01:05:33.847 --> 01:05:36.700
 inspires us to think about the 
power that we have, just being 

01:05:37.215 --> 01:05:41.966
ourselves and thinking about, 
about, you know,about, you know,

01:05:36.597 --> 01:05:43.206
 what we can do and I think also
 it brings people into the 

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:49.843
collection.  So people read on 
their favorite food blogs, this 

01:05:49.844 --> 01:05:56.068
thing.  And I hope it inspires 
them to learn about Rosa Parks 

01:05:56.069 --> 01:05:59.267
and can bring them into the 
collection.  The second goal we 

01:05:59.268 --> 01:06:02.303
have is to incubate, 

01:06:05.522 --> 01:06:10.545
encourage and promote, and we 
have a really small staff.  I 

01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:20.082
like, it helps us focus and be 
agile and do new things.  And I 

01:06:20.314 --> 01:06:25.571
think of it as an interface to 
the outside world.  I used to 

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:26.973
call it a membrane but I got 
weird looks for that one. one.  

01:06:26.974 --> 01:06:28.974
People

01:06:30.181 --> 01:06:34.402
 told me to stop.  stop.  It's 
the standard, thinking about 

01:06:34.827 --> 01:06:37.006
projects that are relevant to 
the library and also being 

01:06:37.855 --> 01:06:39.567
involved very closely to the 
library colleagues and what they

01:06:39.568 --> 01:06:43.848
 are working on and what they 
are interested in and helping 

01:06:43.849 --> 01:06:46.841
the communication between those 
two.two.

01:06:43.523 --> 01:06:45.523
How manytwo.
How many of you

01:06:47.344 --> 01:06:51.552
 remember chemistry class?  This
 is one of my favorite energy 

01:06:55.076 --> 01:07:00.139
diagrams, reactions, as you know
 thermic reaction happens 

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:03.130
sometimes and they need energy. 
 That is true with many of the 

01:07:03.131 --> 01:07:05.131
projects here. 
We have great ideas, we have got

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:10.163
 tools but we need a little bit 
of help getting over the hurdle 

01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:17.898
and we can be the catalyst and 
we are not the enzyme but what 

01:07:17.899 --> 01:07:21.308
we do have the power of, is 
knowing people, knowing 

01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:25.248
technology and being able to 
connect folks.  Sometimes a 

01:07:25.525 --> 01:07:27.862
little bit of application of 
effort from an outside team at 

01:07:28.302 --> 01:07:30.880
the right time can get the ball 
rolling and I think we can help 

01:07:31.664 --> 01:07:34.518
provide that.  I would like to 
say that libraries are poor.  

01:07:34.693 --> 01:07:40.215
Right.  We are not Silicon 
Valley but we are scrappy and we

01:07:40.417 --> 01:07:43.575
 like each other.  And that's 
our power, right?  We are like a

01:07:43.792 --> 01:07:47.233
 stream over a bolder.  Our 
problems may be moveable, but we

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:50.265
 are many, we are focused and we
 have a

01:07:57.728 --> 01:08:03.184
 very long memory.  Most of our 
folks are building relationships

01:08:03.185 --> 01:08:06.936
 that lead to partnerships and 
we hosted an 

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:11.705
exciting event that brought many
 librarians from all over.  And 

01:08:11.706 --> 01:08:13.706
 we also we also hosted 
unleashed

01:08:15.706 --> 01:08:20.245
 a few months ago.  In the 
interest of no spoilers, I won't

01:08:20.398 --> 01:08:23.894
 talk about that because Matt is
 up next.  I hope that I can 

01:08:23.895 --> 01:08:26.487
tell you a quick story about 
that.  The teams were made up of

01:08:26.776 --> 01:08:29.997
 scholars, programmers and 
librarians which is kind of 

01:08:30.178 --> 01:08:34.740
unusual, a difference from a 
classic hackathon which is 

01:08:34.741 --> 01:08:37.864
mostly programmers and that 
collaboration ended up being 

01:08:38.323 --> 01:08:38.407
really exciting to watch.  And 
we had one team looking at some 

01:08:38.408 --> 01:08:40.408
some of

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.884
 the Supreme Court web

01:08:47.402 --> 01:08:49.402
 archive data and were getting 
result 

01:08:53.343 --> 01:08:57.608
froms a text analysis.  There 
was a librarian on the team and 

01:08:57.609 --> 01:08:59.911
said I know a little about the 
contours of the data and the 

01:09:00.099 --> 01:09:03.834
reason you are getting this is 
blah blah blah.  There were 

01:09:04.012 --> 01:09:09.626
weird artifacts and he helped us
 instruct a query for the 

01:09:09.627 --> 01:09:12.393
results to play out the way we 
expected.

01:09:12.394 --> 01:09:14.818
And I think that is the power 
that the library really has in 

01:09:14.995 --> 01:09:18.588
data science.  Where else can 
you go to get the data?  But 

01:09:19.006 --> 01:09:21.376
also to talk to someone that 
really understands it intimately

01:09:21.635 --> 01:09:23.635
 and helps you understand your  
research.  research.  We

01:09:27.993 --> 01:09:35.948
 are also working on a concept 
for a digital scholars lab.  At 

01:09:35.949 --> 01:09:39.690
the Library of Congress we have 
the John W. 

01:09:39.691 --> 01:09:42.291
Center which hosts colleagues 
around the world to work on 

01:09:42.424 --> 01:09:44.488
collections and create a 
community together and share the

01:09:44.728 --> 01:09:47.914
 results of their work with the 
policy makers and the public.  

01:09:48.147 --> 01:09:52.227
And we are thinking about how we
 can help support them with 

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.600
advanced digital scholarship 
research with the partnership of

01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:58.469
 the staff.  To that end we have
 engaged with two outside 

01:09:58.735 --> 01:10:05.189
experts, Dan Shedonoc and 
Michelle Gallagher.  Thinking 

01:10:05.368 --> 01:10:09.598
about something lightly that we 
can reiterate over time and we 

01:10:09.970 --> 01:10:12.154
hope to have that report out 
once it's completed and hope to 

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.981
have something to share with you
 soon.  I would like to 

01:10:14.982 --> 01:10:20.961
introduce you to Tom Wong and 
Chris Adams, our inaugural 

01:10:20.962 --> 01:10:26.708
digital innovation fellows.  
They are doing a fellowship that

01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:29.691
 is focused on demonstrating the
 use of digital collection and 

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:34.593
we hope to broaden the applicant
 pool in future years.  Keep a 

01:10:34.594 --> 01:10:40.906
look out for this.  Biking will 
not be a requirement.  That is 

01:10:40.907 --> 01:10:44.516
just a coincidence.  If you 
don't like biking, don't worry. 

01:10:44.711 --> 01:10:48.993
 And lastly this meeting today, 
as you can probably tell the 

01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:53.765
theme for the year was 
collections as data and this is 

01:10:53.766 --> 01:10:55.766
the cap stone of the of the  of 
the event

01:10:55.912 --> 01:11:00.256
 where we invite you to chat all
 together.  This is a particular

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:05.263
 love of mine and I am excited 
about it.  We are also exploring

01:11:05.264 --> 01:11:08.439
 more opens about creating open 
source and share tooling.  How 

01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:15.557
do we evaluate and help with 
technical skill building and 

01:11:15.558 --> 01:11:20.456
help with shared infrastructure 
where we can have an effort to 

01:11:20.457 --> 01:11:22.837
get a large result. result.
So contact us.  We are small.  

01:11:23.377 --> 01:11:27.635
We are new.  But I am proud of 
what we have been able to 

01:11:27.877 --> 01:11:30.447
accomplish already.  I hope 
today that you will enjoy this 

01:11:30.811 --> 01:11:34.966
reflection of speakers that we 
will put together.  I hope you 

01:11:35.588 --> 01:11:38.412
are excited to hear from them 
and get the opportunity to make 

01:11:38.575 --> 01:11:41.698
friends with each other and get 
to know them.  And think about 

01:11:43.939 --> 01:11:48.052
Henryitte AvramAvram andAvram 
and see the power we can have 

01:11:48.053 --> 01:11:52.057
over the events.  I look out in 
the room and see hundreds of you

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:58.605
 and importantly see a network 
of people that can help make new

01:11:59.414 --> 01:12:04.356
 ideas.  Thank you.  [Applause]

01:12:50.382 --> 01:12:52.382
. 

01:13:09.413 --> 01:13:11.413
. 
SPEAKER: 

01:13:28.569 --> 01:14:29.876
. 
SPEAKER:  Good morning.  I'm 

01:12:29.328 --> 01:12:33.878
Matthew Weber, assistant 
director in Rutgers University 

01:12:34.114 --> 01:12:39.704
and I am assistant director in 
the Department of Communication.

01:12:40.434 --> 01:12:45.214
Thank you for inviting me back 
after the chaos that we created 

01:12:45.449 --> 01:12:48.833
in June.  I had the privilege of
 being here in June with my 

01:12:49.559 --> 01:12:54.728
colleagues Ian Mulligan and 
Jaime Lynne who are at the 

01:12:54.937 --> 01:13:00.974
university of Waterlou in Canada
 Canada to Canada to host the 

01:13:00.975 --> 01:13:14.976
archives unleashed event. event.
  It'sevent.  It's the second 

01:12:51.107 --> 01:12:53.107
generation.  I

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:08.751
 want to tell you about archives
 unleashed and what we want to 

01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:12.159
accomplish and why this is such 
an important movement and 

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.284
initiative for 

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:23.930
engaging with collections in 
data.  So archives unleashed is 

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:29.057
an agenda and Jimmy and I put 
together to assess the essential

01:13:29.311 --> 01:13:35.467
 problem of web archives being a
 tremendous untacked resource to

01:13:35.884 --> 01:13:43.386
 scholars and something that has
 tremendous potential for 

01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:47.111
research and we are well aware 
of what we can do with them.  We

01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.934
 came up with this idea a little
 more than a year ago when Jimmy

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:57.028
 and I were at a reception, and 
as we do, afterwards at the 

01:13:57.296 --> 01:14:00.030
reception we were standing 
around a bar table and drinking 

01:14:00.183 --> 01:14:04.885
a few beers and talking about 
the data sets that we have and 

01:14:05.252 --> 01:14:09.518
talking about how under utilized
 the data sets are.  We said we 

01:14:09.668 --> 01:14:12.176
have to do something about this 
and better educate people and 

01:14:12.799 --> 01:14:16.039
undo the power that the data 
archives have -- we have to 

01:14:16.659 --> 01:14:17.822
unleash the archives.  Come on 
guys, we have to do this.  And I

01:14:17.823 --> 01:14:24.203
 I should have run away 
screaming at that point because 

01:14:24.204 --> 01:14:29.356
low and be hold, we came up with
 a way to show people how to 

01:14:29.357 --> 01:14:33.613
utilize archives as a tool.  We 
saw this opportunity to develop 

01:14:33.614 --> 01:14:36.397
a form for researchers to engage
 with archives and learn about 

01:14:36.398 --> 01:14:39.991
the ways in which this can be 
utilized in the research 

01:14:40.255 --> 01:14:46.752
agendas.  Web archives are an 
amazing resource and access and 

01:14:47.812 --> 01:14:51.589
tools for utilization are often 
a problem.  We are seeking to 

01:14:51.801 --> 01:14:59.329
address that.  We are seeking to
 keep calm and engage in data.  

01:14:59.330 --> 01:15:02.471
Our vision behind is this 
interdisciplinary and the goal 

01:15:02.596 --> 01:15:06.364
in this is highlighted, to bring
 together different researchers 

01:15:06.516 --> 01:15:10.078
from different backgrounds 
because in part, we realized 

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:14.057
that in order to create and 
bring researchers into the fold 

01:15:15.179 --> 01:15:18.129
to work with web archive data we
 need to put together different 

01:15:18.302 --> 01:15:20.302
disciplines.  Point in case, I'm

01:15:23.321 --> 01:15:26.435
 a communications scholar and 
historian and Jimmy is a 

01:15:26.725 --> 01:15:29.440
computer scientist and we come 
from entirely different 

01:15:29.688 --> 01:15:32.534
background and we speak entirely
 different languages as 

01:15:32.535 --> 01:15:35.803
academics and yet together in 
the same room, we are able to 

01:15:35.804 --> 01:15:40.193
work with data and create 
meaning out of that data as we 

01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:45.824
collaborate.  I am going to 
borrow a story that Ian likes to

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:49.342
 tell because I think it's part 
of the conversation that we are 

01:15:49.561 --> 01:15:51.803
starting to have here today.  
Ian comes from the world of 

01:15:52.253 --> 01:15:54.597
history, and I come from the 
world of communication research 

01:15:54.776 --> 01:15:58.502
and we often, in the discipline,
 look at data and look at the 

01:15:58.503 --> 01:16:03.775
data that we're given as a black
 box.  Look at the way the data 

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:08.455
is collected in the black box.  
It sits in the box,

01:16:04.045 --> 01:16:06.045
It sits in the box, we

01:16:07.256 --> 01:16:11.142
 go to it and say look, I need 
some data on newspapers in the 

01:16:11.143 --> 01:16:13.883
United States.  Give me what you
 have got.  And the data spat 

01:16:13.884 --> 01:16:17.251
out to me and I use it and I 
create research and I never 

01:16:17.252 --> 01:16:20.535
really asked how that data came 
to be. 

01:16:20.536 --> 01:16:22.016
What we started to realize is is
  is that

01:16:22.017 --> 01:16:25.665
 we need to open that black box 
and why it's so important to 

01:16:25.666 --> 01:16:29.983
have the different disciplines 
represented engaging with one 

01:16:30.097 --> 01:16:33.501
another is by opening up that 
black box, we can start to ask 

01:16:33.696 --> 01:16:37.231
important questions about what 
the data are, how the data came 

01:16:37.232 --> 01:16:41.319
to be, and what some of the 
under lying assumptions are and 

01:16:41.955 --> 01:16:44.695
how the data can better be 
utilized in research.  I was 

01:16:45.350 --> 01:16:51.039
very excited to see Jerry's 
slide on the Napa hotels in the 

01:16:51.446 --> 01:16:52.295
world, because I think it it 
under it under 

01:16:52.296 --> 01:16:55.900
scores the problem of needing to
 better understand what actually

01:16:56.315 --> 01:17:00.274
 the data are and how they came 
to be and what they mean and how

01:17:00.275 --> 01:17:06.217
 we can better utilize them in 
research.  Let's put this into 

01:17:06.408 --> 01:17:10.515
action.  We came up with this 
idea that in order to better 

01:17:11.515 --> 01:17:13.762
educate researchers and better 
educate scholars about the ways 

01:17:14.742 --> 01:17:17.978
that web archives can be 
utilized in research, we need to

01:17:17.979 --> 01:17:24.272
 create a venue or scholars to 
come together and exchange ideas

01:17:24.447 --> 01:17:27.544
 and educate about the tools 
that are available.  We quickly 

01:17:28.290 --> 01:17:30.600
realized it takes an army.  We 
have been fortunate to have a 

01:17:31.477 --> 01:17:34.359
lot of collaborators in the 
initiatives.  We have support 

01:17:34.556 --> 01:17:39.008
from our university and Rutgers 
university and from the 

01:17:39.203 --> 01:17:43.135
university of Waterlou and

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:51.128
 the Library of Congress and 
University of

01:17:54.144 --> 01:17:58.751
  Toronto and I can go on with 
this.  I am amazed for the 

01:17:58.752 --> 01:18:03.047
people willing to support us in 
the endeavor.  We came up with a

01:18:04.023 --> 01:18:06.023
 two to three day event where we
 invite

01:18:08.356 --> 01:18:11.163
 academics, largely graduate 
students, faculty, librarians 

01:18:11.164 --> 01:18:15.207
and we start with introductions 
and start by getting people 

01:18:15.208 --> 01:18:20.170
networked and engaged with one 
another and break people out 

01:18:20.171 --> 01:18:23.010
into teams and have people come 
up with presentations about what

01:18:23.211 --> 01:18:26.788
 people did.  Let me show you a 
little more about what that is 

01:18:26.789 --> 01:18:30.727
and what that looked like.  I 
will highlight the last two 

01:18:30.728 --> 01:18:32.656
events we posted and the first 
two events we posted. posted.  

01:18:32.657 --> 01:18:34.657
Theposted.  The first

01:18:36.286 --> 01:18:42.827
 was archives unleashed one in 
March and the second was 

01:18:42.828 --> 01:18:44.828
archives

01:18:46.314 --> 01:18:52.948
 unleashed two, which was in 
June.  This is academics in the 

01:18:52.949 --> 01:18:56.479
room together and starting to 
engage with one another and 

01:18:56.749 --> 01:19:00.311
mingle.  What we do is bring the
 40 or 50 scholars into the room

01:19:00.688 --> 01:19:05.782
 and assemble the archives 
unleashed event, the data sets. 

01:19:06.048 --> 01:19:08.740
In the case of the event we 
hosted at the Library of 

01:19:08.741 --> 01:19:14.958
Congress, we had a data set of 
Supreme Court hearings.  Web 

01:19:15.554 --> 01:19:17.554
archives pages about Supreme 
Court Supreme Courts and we had

01:19:22.752 --> 01:19:27.064
 archives about the elections.  
We had Twitter accounts.  We had

01:19:28.208 --> 01:19:30.735
 donated collections from 
Canadian government.  We put 

01:19:31.161 --> 01:19:33.333
these collections out there.  We
 put the team -- the individuals

01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:42.935
 together in the room.  We asked
 people about what people are 

01:19:43.067 --> 01:19:46.362
interested in.  Jimmy and I took
 on this role to try to assemble

01:19:46.758 --> 01:19:46.922
 individuals as a team to focus 
on particular on particular 

01:19:46.923 --> 01:19:48.923
questions on particular 
questions whether that

01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:53.715
 be sentiment analysis, event 
detection.  We were able, at 

01:19:53.716 --> 01:20:01.809
both of these events, formulate 
the groups of of four of four to

01:19:49.889 --> 01:19:51.889
 five

01:19:59.389 --> 01:20:02.081
 individuals that would then 
spend the next few days together

01:20:02.851 --> 01:20:04.671
 working on a research question.

01:20:04.672 --> 01:20:07.938
In order to help lubricate the 
process, we believe in the 

01:20:08.524 --> 01:20:10.757
importance of socialization and 
it's critical for the event that

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:12.108
 it's not just everyone in a 
room and we are getting getting 

01:20:12.109 --> 01:20:14.109
everyone

01:20:15.337 --> 01:20:19.207
 out and engaged socializing 
with each other.  We get 

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:22.870
everyone out to a bar and 
engaged socializing with one 

01:20:23.482 --> 01:20:25.482
another.  We do the

01:20:28.654 --> 01:20:35.472
 fun getting-to-know-you games 
and then we come back, day day  

01:20:26.036 --> 01:20:28.036
day two, day

01:20:31.934 --> 01:20:35.907
 three and we put everyone to 
work.  We spin up virtual 

01:20:36.617 --> 01:20:40.014
machines using donated computing
 resources.  We allow the teams 

01:20:40.406 --> 01:20:43.837
to have access to high 
performance computing needs that

01:20:45.059 --> 01:20:48.695
 they need to quickly analyze 
and crunch the data.  We also 

01:20:48.696 --> 01:20:51.767
bring social scientists.  We 
bring communication scholars and

01:20:52.689 --> 01:20:55.195
 historians to the table so we 
can also be asking critical 

01:20:57.098 --> 01:21:00.882
questions about what the data 
means.  We have a lot of 

01:21:01.636 --> 01:21:04.154
applicants who will come to us 
when we put the calls out to the

01:21:04.771 --> 01:21:08.884
 event.  They say I don't have 
any technical skills but I have 

01:21:09.014 --> 01:21:11.014
interesting questions that I 
want to ask about the archives. 

01:21:11.109 --> 01:21:13.816
We want to be asking the 
critical question of the data 

01:21:14.025 --> 01:21:17.596
that are be abstracted from the 
web archives.  We have lightning

01:21:18.518 --> 01:21:20.579
 talks where we offer scholars 
an opportunity to share the work

01:21:20.941 --> 01:21:26.251
 that we are doing.  Again, to 
build the community and to help 

01:21:27.559 --> 01:21:31.954
each other engage with one other
 and then ultimately at the end 

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:34.849
we share the work that we have 
been doing.  We come back 

01:21:34.992 --> 01:21:39.606
together at the end and present 
on the research that we were 

01:21:39.722 --> 01:21:42.948
able to generate over two to 
three days.  This is the photo 

01:21:43.228 --> 01:21:45.550
of the group that came together 
for Library of Congress and in 

01:21:45.757 --> 01:21:48.764
just a couple of months since we
 hosted the event, we have been 

01:21:48.897 --> 01:21:52.654
following up with everyone who 
participated and it has been 

01:21:53.118 --> 01:21:56.733
amazing to see how teams have 
continued to stay in touch with 

01:21:56.993 --> 01:21:59.786
each other and carry on the 
event.  The research agendas 

01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:07.807
that we started in the student's
 three-day workshop.  We share 

01:22:08.359 --> 01:22:13.356
and engage and ask questions to 
each other based on the research

01:22:07.628 --> 01:22:09.628
 research we research we 
generated. 

01:22:11.591 --> 01:22:17.073
 We formed connections.  I am an
 academic and researcher and I 

01:22:17.074 --> 01:22:20.820
can't help but study the 
research that people bring to 

01:22:20.821 --> 01:22:24.199
each other.  And I study the way
 people bring in collaborations 

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:30.256
and mapped out socio grams, 
metrics, the way that people 

01:22:30.257 --> 01:22:35.132
archive at the event.  This is 
the Toronto event.  Think back 

01:22:35.133 --> 01:22:39.960
to Jer's image of the 7th grade 
classroom.  This is the scholars

01:22:40.209 --> 01:22:42.907
 engaging with each other and 
forming connection over two to 

01:22:43.184 --> 01:22:46.664
three days and something people 
who you would talk to and 

01:22:46.938 --> 01:22:49.978
exchange ideas with before the 
event and who you had exchanged 

01:22:50.385 --> 01:22:53.573
ideas with after the event and 
we formed very close knit groups

01:22:54.492 --> 01:22:59.717
 out of this and close knit of 
clusters of researchers.  And 

01:22:59.718 --> 01:23:02.439
also we pulled individuals to 
see if they were satisfied with 

01:23:02.591 --> 01:23:09.926
the experience, satisfied with 
the engagement and we we are we 

01:22:59.456 --> 01:23:01.456
are patting

01:23:05.765 --> 01:23:07.355
 ourselves on the back  back 
here.  back here.  People

01:23:07.356 --> 01:23:11.581
 walked away generally happy and
 feeling that they have walked 

01:23:11.582 --> 01:23:15.941
away across barriers.  We also 
saw some really cool research 

01:23:15.942 --> 01:23:22.094
coming out of this.  It's only 
two to three days but we are 

01:23:22.095 --> 01:23:25.602
able to generate incite since 
the data we have gained access 

01:23:25.603 --> 01:23:30.562
to.  Kate mentioned the Supreme 
Court data and this is a word 

01:23:30.563 --> 01:23:33.098
cloud visualization of the URLs 
that were in the Supreme Court 

01:23:33.099 --> 01:23:39.666
data and you start to have some 
interesting head scratching 

01:23:39.879 --> 01:23:45.635
moments, for instance, you see 
doubleclick.net and this is 

01:23:45.893 --> 01:23:49.239
where you have the head scratch 
moment where you say I am 

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:51.992
looking at Supreme Court data 
and this is where it's helpful 

01:23:52.353 --> 01:23:56.932
to not only have the computer 
scientists and then you have the

01:23:57.128 --> 01:23:59.582
 collection to start to realize 
that there is quirks in the data

01:23:59.788 --> 01:24:02.945
 and clean this out and pull out
 double click which is an 

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:07.822
advertising hub and advertising 
website and able to abstract 

01:24:08.224 --> 01:24:12.977
more valuable meaning on the way
 the websites are connected.  We

01:24:12.978 --> 01:24:17.265
 are able to generate world 
clouds around the confirmation 

01:24:17.662 --> 01:24:20.938
boat.  To see a little bit as to
 how people were voting,voting, 

01:24:20.939 --> 01:24:22.939
whether

01:24:24.096 --> 01:24:27.085
 the confirmation candidate was 
being supported, not supported. 

01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:31.316
Also to see some of the key 
words that were emerging and the

01:24:31.317 --> 01:24:35.488
 themes emerging around the 
candidates based on the text in 

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:38.809
the archive web pages.  Only two
 to three days.  This is an 

01:24:39.182 --> 01:24:42.834
initial snapshot here.  We are 
also able to move a little bit 

01:24:43.214 --> 01:24:47.320
further.  I mentioned team 
looking at terrorist networks 

01:24:48.445 --> 01:24:51.646
and ISIS Twitter data and they 
were actually able to take this 

01:24:51.885 --> 01:24:53.912
a little bit further and found 
that there were particular types

01:24:54.396 --> 01:25:01.889
 of Twitter accounts served as 
amplifies on Twitter to amplify 

01:25:03.345 --> 01:25:05.263
certain messages and themes in 
the conversation and able to 

01:25:05.264 --> 01:25:08.424
identify the characteristics of 
the Twitter accounts based on 

01:25:12.233 --> 01:25:15.242
the data that they had 
available.  We are moving 

01:25:17.334 --> 01:25:22.818
forward now, we have an event 
planned in San Francisco, and we

01:25:23.126 --> 01:25:30.239
 have a 4th event planned at the
 British library in June of 2017

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:34.056
 and we are working on building 
a sustainable model for this.  

01:25:34.057 --> 01:25:39.106
The work has been driven by 
myself, and Ian and Jimmy and 

01:25:39.107 --> 01:25:42.009
the collaborators that I 
mentioned at the beginning.  

01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:46.555
Moving forward, we need to 
create a broader educational 

01:25:46.556 --> 01:25:50.736
model and educating researchers 
and librarians about ways to 

01:25:50.737 --> 01:25:58.494
open up access to the data saids
 and so Kate referenced archives

01:25:59.423 --> 01:26:06.243
 unleashed LLC and we are 
working to create a nonprofit 

01:26:06.515 --> 01:26:09.997
organization around archives 
unleashed, to build a more 

01:26:10.603 --> 01:26:14.915
sustainable model to bring in in
 interdisciplinary teams to 

01:26:15.094 --> 01:26:19.463
engage with the web archives and
 create the necessary skills out

01:26:19.464 --> 01:26:22.760
 of the data sets.  We have the 
models that will move us beyond 

01:26:23.036 --> 01:26:27.680
the archive unleashed event and 
build us under the momentum that

01:26:27.681 --> 01:26:31.070
 has been created so far.  If 
you have questions about the 

01:26:31.071 --> 01:26:36.376
event or would like to learn 
more, I would be happy to be the

01:26:36.377 --> 01:26:41.450
 point of contact, shoot me an 
e-mail. 

01:26:41.451 --> 01:26:43.451
If you replace the

01:26:46.931 --> 01:26:51.825
 .com with.CA, you can see the 
2.0 projects that it up as  

01:26:51.826 --> 01:26:53.826
well,

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:59.627
 and also linked on 
archivesunleashed.com.

01:26:59.628 --> 01:27:03.455
Thank you for having me here and
 thank you for listening.  I 

01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:06.001
really appreciate your time.  
[Applause]

01:27:58.624 --> 01:28:00.624
. 

01:28:24.233 --> 01:29:10.068
. 
SPEAKER:  slides for us? 

01:27:40.198 --> 01:27:44.153
 Oh, cool.  Thank you.  
Thank you.  Good morning.  A 

01:27:44.281 --> 01:27:47.692
round of applause.  Yes.  Good 
morning, I'm Leah Weinryb 

01:27:48.225 --> 01:27:53.329
Grohsgal and I am senior program
 officer in the division of 

01:27:56.824 --> 01:27:59.868
access at the national 
endowment.  This is Deborah 

01:28:01.077 --> 01:28:05.082
Thomas who is a program manager 
for the national digital 

01:28:06.333 --> 01:28:11.394
newspaper program at the Library
 of Congress.  MPNP represents a

01:28:11.592 --> 01:28:16.804
 long-term effort between the 
two agencies between chronicling

01:28:16.974 --> 01:28:20.684
 America which is a historic 
database newspaper.  We talked 

01:28:20.797 --> 01:28:28.015
about the efforts.  This is the 
culmination of sustained 

01:28:28.197 --> 01:28:30.864
efforts.  This builds on the 
U.S. newspaper program which is 

01:28:31.116 --> 01:28:37.224
the effort to micro film the 
newspapers before we awaited 

01:28:37.497 --> 01:28:42.060
that.  At this point we have 
millions of digitized newspapers

01:28:42.321 --> 01:28:46.201
 and contributed by territories 
across the country.  One of the 

01:28:46.763 --> 01:28:49.780
best things is that the Library 
of Congress has made all of the 

01:28:49.978 --> 01:28:53.062
data open and created a 
well-documented API to explore 

01:28:53.279 --> 01:28:58.850
it in a number of ways.  It's an
 incredible collection of data 

01:28:58.851 --> 01:29:01.857
waiting to be used for 
scholarship, research and 

01:29:02.088 --> 01:29:07.156
education and public 
programming.  I am here to to 

01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:02.420
tell to tell you

01:29:04.808 --> 01:29:11.109
 about a successful contest that
 I ran at NEH to help

01:29:14.816 --> 01:29:21.858
 chronicling in America.  Deb 
will talkwill talk aboutwill 

01:29:11.707 --> 01:29:13.707
talk about what is

01:29:17.742 --> 01:29:22.589
 available and after that, I 
will explain the challenges.  

01:29:25.535 --> 01:29:28.811
Deb?  
SPEAKER:  Thank you.  I

01:29:34.937 --> 01:29:38.824
 made the magic happen.  All 
right.  So well this is 

01:29:39.044 --> 01:29:41.240
newspapers, historic newspapers 
in particular and I am just 

01:29:41.241 --> 01:29:43.241
going to showto show youto show 
you a

01:29:44.621 --> 01:29:46.621
 few -- I am going 

01:29:51.593 --> 01:29:54.122
to show you a few examples of 
newspapers.  It may or may not 

01:29:54.281 --> 01:29:57.419
show up on the screen.  At any 
rate, newspapers have something 

01:29:57.627 --> 01:30:02.412
in them for any kind of 
discipline or humanities study 

01:30:02.597 --> 01:30:05.265
or social sciences.  As you can 
see from the images in the 

01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:11.364
background, there are  
advertisements, advertisements, 

01:30:03.262 --> 01:30:05.262
there are news articles

01:30:08.779 --> 01:30:11.822
 on scientific events.  
There is economic articles.  

01:30:12.021 --> 01:30:15.731
There is geniology and 
literature.  Any kind of thing 

01:30:15.861 --> 01:30:17.861
that you want to study can be 

01:30:24.168 --> 01:30:29.065
found in historic newspapers.  
The growth of the national 

01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:31.338
digital newspaper program in 
particular was to enhance access

01:30:32.657 --> 01:30:35.632
 to American newspapers.  Our 
whole goal with the program was 

01:30:35.633 --> 01:30:39.145
to create a national level 
collection of what is currently 

01:30:40.482 --> 01:30:43.354
today a distributed collection 
across the United States.  The 

01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:48.038
Library of Congress has a large 
connection of American historic 

01:30:48.414 --> 01:30:53.750
newspaper but it is not the 
collection of American historic 

01:30:54.253 --> 01:30:56.408
newspapers.  The American 
historic newspapers is actually 

01:30:56.801 --> 01:30:58.855
archived in state libraries 
around the country so using 

01:30:59.626 --> 01:31:01.645
digital technologies we are able
 to bring this material back 

01:31:01.808 --> 01:31:03.808
together again through

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.360
 the 

01:31:09.902 --> 01:31:12.909
partnerships with the national 
down with humanities.  We have 

01:31:14.389 --> 01:31:17.886
created digital resources and 
collective content through 

01:31:18.033 --> 01:31:21.416
states.  Eventually we have to 
cover all 50 states and 

01:31:21.591 --> 01:31:23.761
territories as they are able to 
participate.  The structure of 

01:31:23.762 --> 01:31:29.857
the program is focused around 
shared resources.  We share the 

01:31:29.971 --> 01:31:34.790
cost of programs along with the 
national economics and 

01:31:34.931 --> 01:31:40.217
humanities who provides funding 
from each state to digitize 

01:31:40.426 --> 01:31:45.169
materials from their state-based
 newspaper collections and they 

01:31:45.802 --> 01:31:47.802
digitize the collections 
establishment by the Library of 

01:31:47.937 --> 01:31:51.733
Congress and the Library of 
Congress receives the data and 

01:31:54.138 --> 01:31:57.438
aggregates it for the long time 
and makes it available to the 

01:31:57.439 --> 01:32:03.881
public.  One of the key focuses 
is focusing on pace scaleability

01:32:04.104 --> 01:32:08.858
 so the national library can 
make this last into the long 

01:32:08.859 --> 01:32:12.096
term and to ensure the data we 
get at the end of the program is

01:32:12.495 --> 01:32:14.297
 usable with the data that that 
we that we get at the beginning

01:32:14.298 --> 01:32:17.079
 of the program.  So we have 
gradually increased the size of 

01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:22.077
the program.  We started in

01:32:27.017 --> 01:32:31.263
 2005 and now we have 40 states 
and ter

01:32:37.879 --> 01:32:40.536
ritories.  We focus the 
structure and the resources for 

01:32:40.537 --> 01:32:41.152
planning planning ahead

01:32:41.153 --> 01:32:44.004
 for technical change and 
sustainability in the fact that 

01:32:45.606 --> 01:32:48.573
we have ensured that, through 
various mechanisms, the data 

01:32:48.907 --> 01:32:53.520
that we receive is all fairly 
consistent.  We have a very 

01:32:55.093 --> 01:32:57.296
detailed specification, which 
has been has been described as 

01:32:57.297 --> 01:33:01.657
richly detailed.  And we have a 
fair level of confidence that 

01:33:01.658 --> 01:33:04.873
this material is in fact going 
to last into the future and 

01:33:05.511 --> 01:33:08.010
whatever the next form that 
digital data needs to take to be

01:33:08.503 --> 01:33:12.647
 usable in a system of the 
future, we can move it in that 

01:33:13.061 --> 01:33:18.159
direction as a whole data set 
and we won't be dealing with 

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.582
every individual piece from 50 
producers.  So this was out of 

01:33:23.192 --> 01:33:28.852
the chronicling America website,
 LLC.GOV -- no, it's chronicling

01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:36.539
chroniclingAmerica.LOC.GOV or 
from the Library of Congress 

01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:39.870
home page.  It provides access 
to searching the newspapers and 

01:33:40.002 --> 01:33:42.002
browsing them as well. well.  
Thiswell.  This is the

01:33:46.069 --> 01:33:51.726
 user interface available.  
This is a map of the states 

01:33:51.727 --> 01:33:53.044
participating in the program so 
so 

01:33:53.045 --> 01:33:58.344
far.  As you can see, it's 
happily very green.  We are 

01:33:58.345 --> 01:34:01.947
still working on filling in all 
of the other little spots.  But 

01:34:02.504 --> 01:34:03.828
this year NEHNEH just

01:34:03.829 --> 01:34:07.016
 announced grants to Alaska, 
Colorado, Maine and New Jersey. 

01:34:07.553 --> 01:34:12.071
 We are very happy to have them 
join the program and joined the 

01:34:12.072 --> 01:34:17.666
other 40 states and territories 
including Puerto Rico and the 

01:34:17.667 --> 01:34:18.421
district of Colombia which the 
Library of Congress represents

01:34:18.422 --> 01:34:20.422
Congress represents which

01:34:21.525 --> 01:34:24.942
 is all available on the 
chronicling America website.  

01:34:24.943 --> 01:34:29.338
Currently the status of the 
website, today we have 11.3 

01:34:29.339 --> 01:34:32.766
million pages online. 
That is approximately 75 

01:34:36.596 --> 01:34:40.236
terabytes of live storage and we
 have archives kept off line.  

01:34:40.237 --> 01:34:43.186
We have 44 states and 
territories participating in the

01:34:43.187 --> 01:34:46.086
 program.  
We have representation content 

01:34:46.255 --> 01:34:48.890
from 40 states and territories. 
We also have, in addition to the

01:34:49.288 --> 01:34:52.199
 actual digitized newspaper 
pages, one of the tasks of the 

01:34:53.412 --> 01:34:56.320
awardees when they select the 
digitized newspapers, that they 

01:34:56.988 --> 01:35:01.111
want digitized, is to create a 
500 word essay about the 

01:35:01.796 --> 01:35:04.915
significant historical context 
of that newspaper.  Why was this

01:35:04.916 --> 01:35:07.957
 one particularly important 
enough to make available to 

01:35:07.958 --> 01:35:14.205
digitize what is available.  We 
have 1,100 of the essays that 

01:35:14.206 --> 01:35:14.636
have been written by scholars 
and knowledgeable researchers 

01:35:14.637 --> 01:35:16.637
researchers  researchers and

01:35:17.841 --> 01:35:20.842
 librarians around the country 
that really put the newspapers 

01:35:20.843 --> 01:35:25.175
in their place and time and 
explained why these were 

01:35:25.176 --> 01:35:31.994
significantly important content.
 content.  In content.  In 

01:35:22.291 --> 01:35:24.291
addition, just

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:33.568
 the 11 million pages represent 
2,100 different titles.  But 

01:35:33.569 --> 01:35:35.569
that -- I talked a little bit  
about,

01:35:35.970 --> 01:35:40.600
 one of the goals of the program
 is create the amount of content

01:35:40.967 --> 01:35:42.967
 available through the program 
and through the Library of 

01:35:43.641 --> 01:35:46.533
Congress website that the 
selected amount of content, we 

01:35:46.899 --> 01:35:52.794
are only working with 2,100 
titles so far.  Out of the 153 

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.185
thousand titles published in the
 United States.  That gives you 

01:35:56.186 --> 01:35:59.386
a sense of the scales of the 
newspapers in the United States.

01:35:59.387 --> 01:36:02.529
This is going to be a slice off 
the top and hopefully it's a 

01:36:02.670 --> 01:36:09.515
very research and valuable slice
 to research and scholars.  And 

01:36:10.182 --> 01:36:12.182
in addition, for reasons of 
sustainability and

01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:19.844
 archiving, we have digitals 
that were created during the 

01:36:19.845 --> 01:36:22.009
archiving process.  
Just a sense into what this 

01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:27.257
allows you to do, the site has 
two main features.  One is 

01:36:27.419 --> 01:36:29.419
digitizing newspapers which are 
full text searchable at the page

01:36:29.959 --> 01:36:30.423
 level.  You can search by 
place, time and key word which 

01:36:30.424 --> 01:36:32.424
which is which is really

01:36:33.639 --> 01:36:35.900
 the important thing when 
looking at newspapers.  You have

01:36:36.114 --> 01:36:39.793
 a certain amount of information
 about every issue and page and 

01:36:40.603 --> 01:36:43.356
can navigate within them.  You 
have visual search highlights 

01:36:43.525 --> 01:36:45.924
that are in red.  I don't know 
if you can see it on the screen 

01:36:46.900 --> 01:36:50.217
or not, that indicate where your
 key words are in the page and 

01:36:51.039 --> 01:36:54.678
gives you the chance to zero in 
individually to see where your 

01:36:54.878 --> 01:36:59.662
articles interest and where your
 results may be -- you -- you 

01:36:54.227 --> 01:36:56.227
may -- you may be willing

01:36:57.821 --> 01:37:01.671
 to spend the time zooming and 
panning into the material.  In 

01:37:01.903 --> 01:37:05.684
addition, there is the ability 
to manipulate the image on the 

01:37:05.685 --> 01:37:12.839
screen and make it full screen. 
 The other kind other kind of 

01:37:02.664 --> 01:37:04.664
other kind of 

01:37:08.086 --> 01:37:12.443
data which is part of the 
chronicling America website is 

01:37:12.444 --> 01:37:20.323
the U.S. newspaper directory. 
directory.  directory.  

01:37:08.165 --> 01:37:10.165
This sort of

01:37:14.242 --> 01:37:18.213
 forms the backbone of all of 
the newspapers that we might 

01:37:18.214 --> 01:37:23.533
want to digitize and represent 
the program that Leah mentioned,

01:37:23.731 --> 01:37:29.668
 the USMP program, the United 
States newspaper program, which 

01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:35.047
is to identify catalog and micro
 film the nation's newspapers.  

01:37:35.048 --> 01:37:40.510
All of the records cal logged  
in the program, were identified 

01:37:40.511 --> 01:37:45.170
and cataloged and stored in 
world cast which is part of the 

01:37:45.805 --> 01:37:53.413
OCLC data set.  OCLC makes that 
data openly harvestable and we 

01:37:53.414 --> 01:37:55.651
have put it on a 
newspaper-specific interface for

01:37:56.336 --> 01:37:59.811
 users to find out about 
newspapers that have been 

01:38:00.011 --> 01:38:02.723
published in the United States, 
even if we don't have the 

01:38:03.045 --> 01:38:07.712
digital copies available.  The 
records have information about 

01:38:07.989 --> 01:38:09.791
who held them,  elsewhere, 
elsewhere, it's

01:38:09.792 --> 01:38:14.805
 in the records.  And provides 
more information for resources 

01:38:14.938 --> 01:38:19.317
than -- more information for 
researchers than enhancive 

01:38:19.824 --> 01:38:22.756
access to newspapers across the 
country.  So the U.S. newspaper 

01:38:23.019 --> 01:38:27.613
directory is also searchable by 
place, time and key word and it 

01:38:29.857 --> 01:38:33.381
includes website links to 
individual locations where the 

01:38:37.566 --> 01:38:42.811
materials may be found.  
Finally, well not quite finally,

01:38:42.981 --> 01:38:46.214
 what is available and how is it
 available?  Leah mentioned open

01:38:46.464 --> 01:38:49.195
 access to the data.  What that 
means is that the data is 

01:38:49.196 --> 01:38:53.382
available for harvesting or 
reuse outside of the individual 

01:38:53.729 --> 01:38:56.062
interfaces that we provide 
through the website.  So we have

01:38:56.497 --> 01:39:01.199
 digitized page images.  We have
 optical character recognition 

01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:06.325
which is machine-readable text. 
We have meta-data which 

01:39:06.533 --> 01:39:08.073
surrounds every page and and 
issue

01:39:08.074 --> 01:39:14.604
 in a standardized Mets format 
for mod description 

01:39:14.923 --> 01:39:18.111
characteristics, which describes
 the place and time of that 

01:39:18.228 --> 01:39:21.517
particular issue, as well as the
 newspaper directives.  All of 

01:39:21.929 --> 01:39:25.401
this information can be taken 
out of the site and analyzed in 

01:39:25.635 --> 01:39:30.271
different ways for researchers 
that don't involve the actual 

01:39:30.499 --> 01:39:35.047
website.  So the ways that we 
make the data available is 

01:39:36.605 --> 01:39:40.408
through open API as well as 
through the public website.  We 

01:39:40.768 --> 01:39:44.602
provide stable URL that are 
helpful for many reasons.  In 

01:39:44.838 --> 01:39:48.424
particular, they are human 
readable so you can project and 

01:39:48.813 --> 01:39:52.314
predict what the next URL you 
are accessing could be.  There 

01:39:52.531 --> 01:39:57.068
are machine-readable views like 
JSON which makes it a bit easier

01:39:57.203 --> 01:40:00.811
 to play with this stuff.  And 
there are preset data sets that 

01:40:00.812 --> 01:40:02.812
that we have that we have 
created specifically on the

01:40:04.676 --> 01:40:08.070
 request of researchers who 
really just wanted to access the

01:40:08.767 --> 01:40:12.766
 OCR for example so we have 
created the batch downloads that

01:40:12.767 --> 01:40:16.868
 people can access and take away
 for use and manipulation.  And 

01:40:16.869 --> 01:40:20.959
now I will turn it over it Leah 
to tell you about the specific 

01:40:25.098 --> 01:40:28.020
uses that can be made.  
SPEAKER:  Thanks Deb.  So you 

01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:31.366
just heard about the incredible 
amount of data that we have 

01:40:31.647 --> 01:40:34.492
available.  And the number of 
ways that researchers can access

01:40:35.436 --> 01:40:37.436
 it.  Chronicing

01:40:40.434 --> 01:40:45.183
  America is one of the best 
known resources that have been 

01:40:45.184 --> 01:40:48.303
used by NEH and the Library of 
Congress.  As a historian 

01:40:48.551 --> 01:40:52.558
myself, I used the site well 
before I came to NEH for my own 

01:40:53.086 --> 01:40:55.869
research.  The site is used 
heavily through the user 

01:40:55.870 --> 01:41:00.350
interface and there has been a 
few large scale digital  

01:41:00.351 --> 01:41:05.563
humanities that are cool to look
 at.  We want more people to use

01:41:05.737 --> 01:41:10.018
 the data and at NEH we decided 
to host a context to get people 

01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:13.593
thinking and creating about 
different projects.  We used 

01:41:14.408 --> 01:41:18.242
challenge.gov which is a 
platform by the federal 

01:41:18.428 --> 01:41:22.289
government to host competitions.
It's around since 2010 and it's 

01:41:22.686 --> 01:41:27.604
part of the government agencies 
to promote innovations using 

01:41:28.548 --> 01:41:31.036
prizes and challenges.  This 
asks the public the question, 

01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:35.266
how can you use data to explore 
history?  We left the parameters

01:41:35.398 --> 01:41:39.994
 broad and we encouraged 
participants to be creative and 

01:41:40.169 --> 01:41:42.734
see what would interest them and
 see what they can get through 

01:41:42.735 --> 01:41:46.976
the open data.  Projects that 
create map, visualization tools 

01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:51.199
and were able to mash up 
chronicling America in order to 

01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:56.212
get the results.  Because the 
chronicling America database 

01:41:56.380 --> 01:42:00.755
covered so much in the pages 
from north to south, east to 

01:42:01.433 --> 01:42:04.890
west across the country from 
various cultural standpoints, we

01:42:04.891 --> 01:42:09.569
 think the sky is the limit.  We
 have got many interesting 

01:42:09.826 --> 01:42:19.107
entries.  I don't have too much 
time to go go deep go deep into 

01:42:04.811 --> 01:42:06.811
each

01:42:12.757 --> 01:42:16.540
 of them but a short look at the
 six winners will give you a 

01:42:16.541 --> 01:42:19.399
brief variety of what we got.  
You can find more information 

01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.422
about the winners of the project
 on the NEH website if you are 

01:42:23.876 --> 01:42:25.876
interested.  The first prize 
winner was Lincoln

01:42:28.220 --> 01:42:33.883
 Mullin, American bible 
quotations in U.S. newspaper.  

01:42:33.884 --> 01:42:39.259
It quotes biblical newspapers to
 see how the bible was used for 

01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:48.870
religious and political purposes
 and how how it was how it was a

01:42:33.916 --> 01:42:35.916
 text where you

01:42:42.826 --> 01:42:47.503
 will find sermons in Sunday 
school lessons that are 

01:42:47.504 --> 01:42:50.786
distributed across the country 
but you find the bible used in 

01:42:50.787 --> 01:42:55.806
every side of issue including 
slavery, womens suffrage and 

01:42:56.015 --> 01:42:59.800
capitalism.  Next we had a tie 
for second place.  

01:42:59.801 --> 01:43:08.007
One second prize winner Andrew 
Bale, American lynching.  This 

01:43:09.019 --> 01:43:11.705
uncovers America's long and dark
 history with lynching, 

01:43:11.876 --> 01:43:21.473
America's catalyst for public 
killing and platform for reform.

01:43:21.474 --> 01:43:28.857
  There was information from 
Lynchiing from Kuskegan 

01:43:28.858 --> 01:43:33.720
University and used to give 
information from America through

01:43:33.721 --> 01:43:36.566
 visualization and also wants to
 connect that data through the 

01:43:36.567 --> 01:43:41.833
stories of the victims.  Sorry, 
I didn't distance the slide.  

01:43:41.834 --> 01:43:47.299
That is a quick look.  The other
 second price went to Amy drew 

01:43:47.300 --> 01:43:50.952
and Jason Drew for the 
historical agricultural news.  

01:43:50.953 --> 01:43:55.259
This is a search tool for 
exploring information on the 

01:43:55.260 --> 01:43:58.507
farming technologies and 
America's practices of the past.

01:43:58.508 --> 01:44:01.875
  The group sees farming as a 
look into America's history 

01:44:01.876 --> 01:44:05.474
including social, economic, 
political and cultural.  

01:44:05.475 --> 01:44:11.715
Additionally see their project 
by focusing on big data.  By 

01:44:11.716 --> 01:44:15.043
narrowing down into one subject 
area, have created a useful data

01:44:15.044 --> 01:44:18.435
 set that can be kind of 
abstracted from the massive data

01:44:18.436 --> 01:44:21.196
 in case people don't know what 
to do with it, because there is 

01:44:21.197 --> 01:44:26.482
so much of it.  So the 
challenges third prize went to 

01:44:26.634 --> 01:44:36.593
another team, Christi palmer, 
Caitlin Poly.  And this passes 

01:44:36.594 --> 01:44:39.995
the geographic distribution and 
the positive and negative 

01:44:43.368 --> 01:44:47.220
connotaiton overtime and all 
have chronicling America and 

01:44:47.402 --> 01:44:51.096
show the work that you might not
 expect.  And they left it all 

01:44:51.305 --> 01:44:54.956
open so anyone inclined to do so
 can put another word that they 

01:44:56.017 --> 01:45:03.080
are interested in.  Other prize 
went to Claudia and Sont.  They 

01:45:03.081 --> 01:45:07.372
made a really good point when 
explaining the origins of the 

01:45:07.905 --> 01:45:13.461
program.  Many use Google Emgram
 viewer to track books across 

01:45:13.462 --> 01:45:16.855
the United States and many times
 books are published and come 

01:45:16.856 --> 01:45:21.248
out in multiple editions, 
potentially screwing the results

01:45:21.884 --> 01:45:24.353
 depends on what people were 
talking about at a particular 

01:45:24.511 --> 01:45:28.127
time.  The newspapers capture 
the public discourse almost 

01:45:28.337 --> 01:45:36.751
better than anything else.  This
 site is is build is build on 

01:45:24.056 --> 01:45:26.056
the chronicling America data and
 allows

01:45:33.902 --> 01:45:38.025
 users to discover patterns and 
watch news go viral, so to 

01:45:38.491 --> 01:45:40.583
speak.  For example you can 
track terms like

01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:46.429
 scallowag which gained current

01:45:50.073 --> 01:45:56.134
s in the 60s.  And also ray 
Palin and 

01:46:00.638 --> 01:46:03.396
Sentaped high school in New 
Hampshire for chronicling 

01:46:04.104 --> 01:46:07.528
America.  These students used 
word frequency analysis for 

01:46:08.351 --> 01:46:11.929
patterns and news coverage.  
They broke into teams and news 

01:46:12.296 --> 01:46:13.581
that caught their interest,
interest, for example

01:46:13.582 --> 01:46:21.155
 Ferguson, uncle Tom's Cabin, 
the KKK and the labor union.  

01:46:21.156 --> 01:46:25.108
According to Palin, it was 
similar to writing a paper in 

01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:29.755
that students had to identify an
 important historical question 

01:46:29.756 --> 01:46:32.855
and research the answer.  Using 
data however, allowed them to 

01:46:33.636 --> 01:46:38.142
learn a whole different set of 
skills than writing a research 

01:46:38.615 --> 01:46:41.638
paper.  I realize I didn't have 
much time to go in depth in the 

01:46:41.881 --> 01:46:46.497
projects, but only provide 
teasers, the vast array of 

01:46:46.904 --> 01:46:49.745
context represented.  I think 
these hold several collections 

01:46:50.044 --> 01:46:53.360
for those of us who hold data.  
I have been interested in the 

01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:56.009
type of projects that come out 
of chronicling America before 

01:46:56.167 --> 01:47:01.338
working at NEH and as a 
historian I used the site for 

01:47:02.729 --> 01:47:06.013
civil liberties, union groups 
and free speech.  It's one of 

01:47:06.380 --> 01:47:10.670
the only free accessible sources
 for the community.  This 

01:47:10.828 --> 01:47:13.410
collection holds so many 
possibilities as a data set and 

01:47:13.641 --> 01:47:15.834
it was good to see this 
challenge.  Many of the winners 

01:47:16.104 --> 01:47:20.119
officially told us that they 
were happy about the contest 

01:47:20.271 --> 01:47:23.793
because it gave them a deadline 
to do a project that they wanted

01:47:23.958 --> 01:47:28.433
 to do for a long time.  It may 
not be possible to always host a

01:47:28.434 --> 01:47:32.099
 contest like this but it might 
be a good thing if you want to 

01:47:32.417 --> 01:47:37.975
gather a group and stir up 
excitement about it.  I want to 

01:47:38.916 --> 01:47:43.770
call attention to how many teams
 we had as well.  Also it's 

01:47:43.895 --> 01:47:46.764
important people are working 
outside of the lines and I think

01:47:47.694 --> 01:47:53.469
 it's important that we can.  
Mr. Palin pointed out -- what he

01:47:53.767 --> 01:47:57.192
 pointed out extends well beyond
 the lessons in secondary school

01:47:57.425 --> 01:48:01.302
 that he is teaching.  This 
intellectual work involves as he

01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:04.811
 pointed out, similar 
questioning and identifying to 

01:48:04.812 --> 01:48:07.902
any research and should be 
valued in the academic community

01:48:08.128 --> 01:48:10.741
 no matter what you are doing.  
Finally I think the contest 

01:48:10.742 --> 01:48:11.758
points to the the 

01:48:11.759 --> 01:48:13.759
importance of any collection 
with maintaining contact with 

01:48:13.862 --> 01:48:17.536
the communities processing the 
process.  Not just putting the 

01:48:17.694 --> 01:48:19.923
data out there but trying to 
understand how people are 

01:48:20.182 --> 01:48:22.775
inclined to use the collection 
and learning from there at the 

01:48:23.108 --> 01:48:27.638
same time that they learn from 
the collection.  Thank you very 

01:48:28.123 --> 01:48:30.807
much.  And we are happy to 
answer any questions, you know, 

01:48:31.369 --> 01:48:33.369
during the course of the 
reading.  [Applause]

01:49:57.017 --> 01:50:53.401
.  Hello.  Thanks everybody.  
We're going going to going to 

01:49:04.633 --> 01:49:06.633
take a

01:49:10.021 --> 01:49:18.644
 quick 15-minute break.  Let's 
be back at 111 o'clock.  We are 

01:49:19.278 --> 01:49:22.012
live streaming so we need to 
stay on schedule.  We will be 

01:49:23.014 --> 01:49:30.177
back at 11 o'clock to talk about
 collections as data. 

02:03:30.705 --> 02:03:32.705
. .  
SPEAKER:  We are

02:03:39.254 --> 02:03:41.254
 getting ready to start. 

02:04:24.779 --> 02:04:48.986
 Welcome back everybody.  This 
is a reminder we are live 

02:04:04.372 --> 02:04:08.821
streaming and if you want to 
participate online, use the 

02:04:10.352 --> 02:04:14.836
#asdata.  Additionally, some of 
you have the handouts today that

02:04:14.837 --> 02:04:17.099
 were kindly prepared by our 
colleagues in collections and 

02:04:17.375 --> 02:04:20.593
services about possible 
resources that researchers are 

02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:26.467
interested in using collection 
as data might use. Can we pull 

02:04:26.696 --> 02:04:31.668
up the blog post please?  So if 
you go to our blog which I had 

02:04:31.959 --> 02:04:34.335
on my slide earlier, 

02:04:44.308 --> 02:04:47.609
blogs.LLC.gov/thesignal.  Those 
of you watching remotely, you 

02:04:48.455 --> 02:04:53.801
can access from the blog site.  
The next part is developing 

02:04:53.936 --> 02:04:57.723
methods for development tools.  
Elizabeth Lorang has been 

02:04:58.553 --> 02:05:03.215
working with the chronicling 
American data sets to hold not 

02:05:04.035 --> 02:05:09.048
just answers but message return 
research for all.  An associate 

02:05:10.171 --> 02:05:13.734
professor and humanities 
librarian at the university of 

02:05:14.040 --> 02:05:16.040
Nebraska-Lincoln

02:05:18.918 --> 02:05:27.106
 and also doing research at UNL,
 her experience includes 

02:05:27.107 --> 02:05:33.547
immunity and research and used 
the NEH funded project that 

02:05:33.548 --> 02:05:37.939
seeks the potential for 
discovery and digitized 

02:05:38.071 --> 02:05:47.594
collections.  Next we will hear 
from Ricky Punzalan from the 

02:05:47.802 --> 02:05:52.113
college of human studies at the 
University of Maryland and 

02:05:53.043 --> 02:05:55.601
includes dynamics of utilization

02:06:00.644 --> 02:06:08.301
 and digitizeing in settings and
 he also provides reunification 

02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:13.160
of dispersed archival 
photographs online which he will

02:06:13.294 --> 02:06:19.005
 speak about.  Also closing the 
session is Mark Bouslog who uses

02:06:19.611 --> 02:06:25.155
 the largest platform for 
people-powered research and 

02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:27.353
discovers research that was 
previously considered 

02:06:27.706 --> 02:06:29.851
impossible.  His research works 

02:06:34.749 --> 02:06:36.840
includes the relaunch ofs and

02:06:41.047 --> 02:06:46.263
 let's get to work and let's 

02:06:50.631 --> 02:06:53.258
introduce Elizabeth Lorang.  
SPEAKER:  Good morning everyone.

02:06:53.643 --> 02:06:55.643
I would like to thank our 
organizers and our

02:06:58.923 --> 02:07:01.016
 hosts for the opportunity to 
share work with you and also the

02:07:01.472 --> 02:07:04.936
 opportunity to hear about the 
projects that you are all 

02:07:04.937 --> 02:07:07.483
working on and the conversation 
that all of us can have over the

02:07:07.832 --> 02:07:10.145
 course of the day.
The project that I will be 

02:07:10.458 --> 02:07:14.235
talking about today has been 
possible only because of the 

02:07:15.008 --> 02:07:17.255
contributions of the research 
teams past and present.  As we 

02:07:17.615 --> 02:07:22.175
are talking about the work 
today, I want to acknowledge 

02:07:22.306 --> 02:07:27.956
that team.  I would like to 
acknowledge professor Lee Katz 

02:07:28.279 --> 02:07:33.607
as well as my former under 
graduate student Grace Thomas 

02:07:34.075 --> 02:07:37.023
who delivered to this project in
 key ways.  I couldn't be more 

02:07:37.273 --> 02:07:39.886
excited that grace is now on the
 staff of Library of Congress 

02:07:39.887 --> 02:07:43.014
and has been here for about a 
month now and also able to be 

02:07:43.015 --> 02:07:46.865
here today.  So my presentation 
today is in three parts.  First 

02:07:46.866 --> 02:07:51.750
the statement of a problem or 
challenge that I think we face 

02:07:51.869 --> 02:07:53.869
working with digital collections
 and working

02:07:59.244 --> 02:08:02.281
 and developing digital 
collections and also something 

02:08:02.282 --> 02:08:05.067
that me and my teammates are 
working on to address that 

02:08:05.068 --> 02:08:08.318
challenge in a different way and
 also the long term of where we 

02:08:08.319 --> 02:08:12.908
are headed next.  The first part
 then is the challenge, and the 

02:08:13.053 --> 02:08:17.071
fundamental challenge that we 
are working to address is that 

02:08:17.197 --> 02:08:20.577
all of the wealth of the  
digitized information available,

02:08:20.951 --> 02:08:24.446
 finding the information 
relevant remains difficult for 

02:08:24.447 --> 02:08:29.167
most cases.  The challenge 
documented most recently by 

02:08:29.168 --> 02:08:36.330
Green and Courtney and 2016 and 
scholars working with digital 

02:08:36.331 --> 02:08:39.781
collections of materials, the 
authors found that one of the 

02:08:39.782 --> 02:08:42.800
most prominent challenges in the
 collections was the inability 

02:08:42.801 --> 02:08:48.139
to search effectively through 
the collective material and the 

02:08:48.544 --> 02:08:51.396
findings align with other 
studies over the past couple of 

02:08:52.016 --> 02:08:55.045
years that show the difficulty 
of finding items in digital 

02:08:55.448 --> 02:08:59.310
collection and also the degree 
to which more fine-grained level

02:08:59.429 --> 02:09:03.655
 of significant detail can be 
significant for successfully 

02:09:04.025 --> 02:09:06.025
analyzing for us.  The 
difficulty of finding material 

02:09:06.304 --> 02:09:10.656
and relevance arises in part 
from one reason, the level and 

02:09:10.793 --> 02:09:14.600
degree of description of items 
and collections.  But the 

02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:18.498
difficulty of finding materials 
and relevance is also due to the

02:09:19.316 --> 02:09:24.060
 ways in which platforms and 
interfaces engages with and 

02:09:24.428 --> 02:09:27.970
describes access to materials 
including text-based searching 

02:09:28.177 --> 02:09:31.727
and even when there is an API 
for most people, that is still 

02:09:32.136 --> 02:09:35.306
going to be a barrier to access 
of some sort.  Addressing this 

02:09:35.702 --> 02:09:38.679
challenge of connecting people 
with items of interest is going 

02:09:39.043 --> 02:09:42.683
to require efforts on multiple 
and creative fronts.  In 

02:09:42.819 --> 02:09:48.399
response to this challenge, my 
team, the image analysis for 

02:09:49.062 --> 02:09:53.309
archival discovery team is 
focusing on the digital images 

02:09:54.214 --> 02:09:57.004
and collections rather than the 
machine-readable text.  Our work

02:09:57.315 --> 02:10:02.166
 is based on two beliefs.  The 
first belief is that locating 

02:10:02.285 --> 02:10:05.959
relevant material and digital 
collections is often a difficult

02:10:06.102 --> 02:10:11.129
 endeavor and will be 
increasingly difficult and 

02:10:11.273 --> 02:10:15.254
second, we leverage potential 
for the millions of images that 

02:10:17.264 --> 02:10:21.261
we are creating as we digitize 
the records.  The question is 

02:10:21.384 --> 02:10:26.956
what more can we do with the 
digitizing records and what 

02:10:28.147 --> 02:10:32.271
intents might the digitizing 
yield?  Both aspects are 

02:10:32.829 --> 02:10:35.375
increasingly interesting in 
image-based methods for 

02:10:35.499 --> 02:10:38.151
identification and discovery.  
One significant area of 

02:10:38.282 --> 02:10:42.332
development is an area of image 
recognition and image searching 

02:10:42.797 --> 02:10:46.731
of primarily visual work 
including art work and mass 

02:10:47.135 --> 02:10:50.565
photography, such as photos 
posted to online platforms.  

02:10:50.922 --> 02:10:54.655
There is increasing array for 
computer signs for application 

02:10:54.782 --> 02:10:59.634
in the industry.  The emphasis 
however, is very much on images 

02:10:59.635 --> 02:11:04.609
of art work and contemporary 
photography and items that we 

02:11:04.912 --> 02:11:07.871
understand first and foremost to
 be visual work.  As my team 

02:11:08.147 --> 02:11:10.966
engages with these questions, we
 are interested in what, in 

02:11:11.133 --> 02:11:16.848
turning the focus to image 
analysis of textual materials 

02:11:17.674 --> 02:11:21.012
and looking at the digital 
images of textual materials.  In

02:11:22.219 --> 02:11:24.322
 returning to the title of my 
presentation, we are interested 

02:11:24.590 --> 02:11:30.876
in what happened when we look at
 text from images.  The slide is

02:11:31.077 --> 02:11:35.421
 in an unsophisticated fashion 
to show where we are with 

02:11:35.422 --> 02:11:42.086
computer vision versus 
contemporary photography and the

02:11:42.738 --> 02:11:47.891
 archive and discovery.  The 
first image is an image of a 

02:11:50.039 --> 02:11:53.201
slaw through Google search 
images to not only see the 

02:11:53.202 --> 02:12:02.501
results that I can get, but 
Google knew what it was not 

02:12:04.176 --> 02:12:08.445
just sloth.  I got right to the 
key.  So if we contrast that 

02:12:08.717 --> 02:12:14.650
with an image of a 19th century 
letter that went through a 

02:12:14.916 --> 02:12:19.198
similar process and the results 
I think are a little more 

02:12:19.321 --> 02:12:23.241
varied.  The images look kind of
 like the image that I 

02:12:23.375 --> 02:12:26.848
presented, but the sense of what
 I am interested in at this 

02:12:26.849 --> 02:12:30.904
point is being tweeted as items 
that are handwritten.  We can 

02:12:30.905 --> 02:12:35.086
see the real potential for that 
to be able to pull out the 

02:12:35.087 --> 02:12:37.881
collections that are 
handwritten.  But if what I am 

02:12:37.882 --> 02:12:40.298
interested in certain types of 
handwritten items that have not 

02:12:40.299 --> 02:12:43.638
been described?  Here is an 
example quickly of a newspaper. 

02:12:44.024 --> 02:12:47.986
 And again, the recognition was 
pretty good.  I think enlarged 

02:12:48.214 --> 02:12:52.510
part, these are the fact that we
 have so many digitized 

02:12:52.511 --> 02:12:56.923
newspapers and digitized from 
microfilm.  But I want to look 

02:12:56.924 --> 02:13:03.384
at the fourth exam which is a 
poem that I cropped from a 

02:13:03.385 --> 02:13:07.348
newspaper image.  I was not 
expecting to crop newspaper 

02:13:07.583 --> 02:13:11.622
images from poems.  I am one of 
the few people that does that.  

02:13:11.842 --> 02:13:13.842
There is not a huge part of them
 at this 

02:13:17.231 --> 02:13:20.760
point.  But there is a goal here
 between what I think is 

02:13:20.761 --> 02:13:24.779
interest of what would be the 
possible results.  First and 

02:13:25.636 --> 02:13:30.608
foremost, this is recognized by 
the Google search at this point 

02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:33.397
as me being interested in 
handwriting and it's not the 

02:13:33.564 --> 02:13:37.813
case here.  Also as I was not 
expecting to find newspapers as 

02:13:38.492 --> 02:13:41.658
a result.  I was thinking that 
maybe there would be some 

02:13:42.121 --> 02:13:45.346
printed poems, the range in the 
Gulf of that effectiveness of 

02:13:46.059 --> 02:13:49.632
these sorts of searches thus far
 from something like 

02:13:49.633 --> 02:13:53.080
contemporary photography to 
wanting to find specific types 

02:13:53.081 --> 02:13:56.135
of items within digitized 
collection.  There is an 

02:13:56.136 --> 02:13:59.656
emerging body of work in the 
arts and humanities interested 

02:13:59.798 --> 02:14:07.622
in the visual signal or  
analytics in the text material. 

02:14:08.476 --> 02:14:17.371
Recently had analyzed image 
poetry and images and also the 

02:14:17.815 --> 02:14:22.105
archives allows the users to 
explore the archives by drawing 

02:14:22.746 --> 02:14:27.415
the shape of a poem and search 
poems in similar shape.  It has 

02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:32.108
the potential for thinking about
 textual materials and 

02:14:32.337 --> 02:14:36.211
particularly the visual is the 
meaning maker of the text.  Both

02:14:36.808 --> 02:14:40.157
 of the projects however, begin 
with known preselective items 

02:14:40.289 --> 02:14:44.227
from a purpora and they are 
starting when we know what we 

02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:49.428
have here an item of interest.  
My team and I are extended 

02:14:50.386 --> 02:14:52.611
analysis approaches for 
extending discovery and this 

02:14:53.704 --> 02:14:56.127
takes us to part two of my 
presentation.  Sort of the 

02:14:56.312 --> 02:14:59.961
experiment that we are currently
 working on.  So our work now 

02:15:00.674 --> 02:15:07.209
looks at whether we can identify
 poetic content based on 

02:15:07.210 --> 02:15:13.758
historic signals.  We are using 
the collection of chronicling 

02:15:14.530 --> 02:15:17.466
America newspapers as a source 
and we want to see whether or 

02:15:17.736 --> 02:15:22.023
not the newspaper features any 
poetic content and where it is 

02:15:22.312 --> 02:15:27.983
on the page.  We have been 
ambitious in our goal to 

02:15:28.105 --> 02:15:32.964
digitize as little poems and 
finding articles that have 

02:15:34.333 --> 02:15:38.287
multiple-linked poems.  To see 
if this works, we have created a

02:15:39.218 --> 02:15:44.980
 classifier from newspapers that
 feature poetic content and not.

02:15:48.326 --> 02:15:52.251
qualities that we believe are 
important, translating them into

02:15:54.114 --> 02:15:57.061
 development features and 
setting a set of sample images 

02:15:57.062 --> 02:16:02.139
where we knew the ground truth, 
whether or not the image 

02:16:02.140 --> 02:16:08.086
contained poetic content or not,
 compiling the features for both

02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:15.060
 set of content and making them 
into an artificial network and 

02:16:15.061 --> 02:16:19.211
finally testing the classifier 
on unlabeled images.  We 

02:16:19.212 --> 02:16:25.162
published earlier results in the
 work last summer and at the 

02:16:25.163 --> 02:16:28.774
classifying training stage, we 
received provision and recall 

02:16:28.775 --> 02:16:30.775
under 95

02:16:33.327 --> 02:16:38.255
 percent and precision showed 
how many times we were correct 

02:16:38.256 --> 02:16:42.738
with poetic comment and recall 
showing how many times we 

02:16:43.034 --> 02:16:46.599
correctly identified poem images
 out of poetic images.  The 

02:16:46.751 --> 02:16:51.787
numbers dropped when we tested 
the classifer under 75 percent 

02:16:51.916 --> 02:16:55.611
and 62 percent.  But we decided 
to under take a larger case 

02:16:55.846 --> 02:16:59.313
study.  We did not want to 
overfit our approach for such a 

02:16:59.314 --> 02:17:02.777
small set of images that we used
 for the initial test.  So at 

02:17:02.896 --> 02:17:05.968
this point we know we have more 
work to do but we didn't want 

02:17:06.094 --> 02:17:10.472
that work to reflect only the 
very small sample.  We have 

02:17:10.645 --> 02:17:14.690
recently under taken work to 
look at a much larger set of 

02:17:14.848 --> 02:17:20.979
images.  Specifically we moved 
to a case study of chronicling 

02:17:21.311 --> 02:17:24.821
America newspaper for 1836 to 
1840.  We have two goals.  One 

02:17:25.083 --> 02:17:29.662
is to scale the system and the 
second is to test the accuracy 

02:17:29.788 --> 02:17:33.612
of the classifier on the set of 
data.  We focused on the 

02:17:34.637 --> 02:17:39.291
five-year period 1836 to 1840 
because at the time it 

02:17:39.413 --> 02:17:42.039
represented the first 
chronicling in America work and 

02:17:42.305 --> 02:17:46.998
we now that we can find a 
specific amount of poetic 

02:17:47.139 --> 02:17:50.915
content from this period.  The 
first step in the process was to

02:17:51.517 --> 02:17:55.672
 develop the script from 
batch-retrieving images and now 

02:17:55.798 --> 02:18:01.322
we have a script that allows us 
to perceive the images, we were 

02:18:01.576 --> 02:18:04.438
working with parameters at this 
point but in the future we will 

02:18:05.976 --> 02:18:07.349
add parameters as well through 
through 

02:18:07.350 --> 02:18:10.883
the city or the state.  We 
received nearly 22 thousand 

02:18:11.016 --> 02:18:20.543
images, all images from 1836 to 
1840 but chronicling America is 

02:18:21.128 --> 02:18:23.208
rapidly growing and we are 
working with a subset of five 

02:18:24.326 --> 02:18:28.095
years.  Getting the page images 
was the most straightforward 

02:18:28.229 --> 02:18:30.329
part and it was not without 
complication.  The system that 

02:18:30.724 --> 02:18:33.012
we developed for evaluating 
features does not actually 

02:18:34.050 --> 02:18:38.644
process the entire page at once.
Instead we process a full page 

02:18:38.808 --> 02:18:43.971
image as an overlapping image 
snippet to see whether those 

02:18:46.234 --> 02:18:49.042
snippets feature poetic content 
and in the earlier stage we 

02:18:49.877 --> 02:18:54.866
created the images manually and 
now we needed an automatic 

02:18:55.036 --> 02:18:57.227
approach to the process.  We 
needed to make sure that the 

02:18:58.299 --> 02:19:00.690
images themselves are good in 
order to increase the chance 

02:19:01.878 --> 02:19:04.804
that we will have accurate 
classification.  We developed a 

02:19:05.938 --> 02:19:08.784
process for evaluating all of 
the page images to see if they 

02:19:09.810 --> 02:19:13.612
can be effectively segmented and
 against several set of rules, 

02:19:14.109 --> 02:19:17.334
something that we did 
automatically and then broke 

02:19:17.617 --> 02:19:22.815
each of the pages that past into
 the subsequence of it.  

02:19:22.816 --> 02:19:28.477
Approximately 8,800 page images 
passed the presentation process 

02:19:28.478 --> 02:19:33.552
and yielded 500 thousand 
snippets and the images go 

02:19:33.692 --> 02:19:37.111
through a series and process 
from the images on the screen 

02:19:37.292 --> 02:19:41.055
and we capture the images and 
that is what we use to measure 

02:19:41.485 --> 02:19:44.871
the features and do the feature 
extraction.  The work is still 

02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:47.576
very much in process.
And while we don't have big 

02:19:47.724 --> 02:19:51.916
results just yet, hopefully we 
will by the end of October.  We 

02:19:52.553 --> 02:19:55.948
do know a few things at this 
point. First we learned about 

02:19:57.290 --> 02:20:00.541
the historic pages as well as 
the duplicative process that 

02:20:00.814 --> 02:20:06.150
bought us to chronicling 
America.  A variety of factors 

02:20:06.269 --> 02:20:10.679
about whether a page can be 
segmented, the videos, the 

02:20:10.933 --> 02:20:15.661
number of illustrations and 
number of text expanding in the 

02:20:15.967 --> 02:20:20.442
columns and the micro digitized 
image.  We know that we want to 

02:20:20.650 --> 02:20:24.896
know at a high level of accuracy
 how good our classifier is.  We

02:20:25.257 --> 02:20:29.830
 need to know the ground troop 
of the pages and the snippet.  

02:20:29.831 --> 02:20:34.298
We could have done some sampling
 but at this page, it's a 

02:20:34.463 --> 02:20:37.486
research project and we want to 
know at an accurate level how 

02:20:37.610 --> 02:20:42.959
accurate the classifier is.  
This meant that I manually 

02:20:43.103 --> 02:20:48.747
classified the 8800 pages so we 
can classify.  According to the 

02:20:48.868 --> 02:20:58.576
work that I did.  Of the 8,800 
page, 1678 of them contained

02:20:59.034 --> 02:21:04.295
 the poetic content and 1,000 of
 them did not.  Again, the 

02:21:04.296 --> 02:21:06.296
machine

02:21:07.326 --> 02:21:11.912
 learning pages that are at the 
snippet level and the machine 

02:21:12.719 --> 02:21:19.101
learning suggests that there are
 4,440 pages creating poetic 

02:21:19.292 --> 02:21:21.914
content which is much higher 
than my poetic

02:21:24.969 --> 02:21:29.701
classification and we overlapped
 on 785 pages.  We know that we 

02:21:29.702 --> 02:21:34.309
have work to do here and where 
we are headed next is to do, 

02:21:34.310 --> 02:21:37.562
first we need to then be able to
 look at the snippet level which

02:21:37.762 --> 02:21:41.831
 means that I am evaluating the 
90 thousand snippets to 

02:21:41.832 --> 02:21:47.011
determine the classifications 
and we can do a detailed 

02:21:47.012 --> 02:21:50.086
analysis on where my 
classification and the machine 

02:21:50.829 --> 02:21:53.104
classification agree and where 
they differ and start pulling 

02:21:53.235 --> 02:21:56.719
some things out from that.  So 
this is why it slowed down a 

02:21:57.528 --> 02:22:01.040
little bit at this stage.  Once 
we have the manual 

02:22:01.172 --> 02:22:03.647
classification and the machine 
classification we will begin the

02:22:03.948 --> 02:22:06.753
 work of deriving detailed 
statistics and thinking about 

02:22:07.356 --> 02:22:10.918
the ways in which we can further
 improve the classifier, that 

02:22:11.031 --> 02:22:14.004
might be techniques to make sure
 that we are not quite as 

02:22:14.835 --> 02:22:19.597
aggressive in returning snippets
 as truth.  We can look for the 

02:22:19.812 --> 02:22:22.530
only concurrent snippet that is 
classified as true, for example.

02:22:22.766 --> 02:22:27.692
And then we will have to see how
 accurate the features that we 

02:22:27.915 --> 02:22:31.160
think are important for 
signaling poetic content turn 

02:22:31.353 --> 02:22:34.609
out to be.  We will be turning 
to an understanding of what we 

02:22:34.938 --> 02:22:39.136
get from our classifier results.
We will be analyzing the data 

02:22:39.377 --> 02:22:42.724
set, and doing some written 
analysis and doing an 

02:22:43.386 --> 02:22:48.458
early-stage look at how our 
classification for newspaper 

02:22:48.599 --> 02:22:51.939
content and languages other than
 English compare with our 

02:22:52.093 --> 02:22:56.869
classifications of newspapers in
 English since 1836 to 1840 and 

02:22:57.179 --> 02:23:00.404
that includes some newspapers in
 Spanish.  We can start testing 

02:23:00.825 --> 02:23:06.523
this idea that the image-based 
approach for textual material 

02:23:06.976 --> 02:23:12.079
should be language diagnostic.  
So in the longer term then, and 

02:23:12.287 --> 02:23:15.775
I will hear both -- when I 
created the slides last week, I 

02:23:16.591 --> 02:23:19.064
felt compelled to talk in 
fairly-broad terms and only 

02:23:19.446 --> 02:23:23.904
yesterday I learned that the 
research team received IMLS 

02:23:24.059 --> 02:23:26.059
funding to continue the work and
 we have a short course for that

02:23:26.190 --> 02:23:30.391
 work.  We are embarking on a 
new partnership with the 

02:23:30.392 --> 02:23:33.522
colleagues at the University of 
Virginia where we seek to 

02:23:33.523 --> 02:23:38.180
broaden the software among 
digitized newspapers and reforms

02:23:38.417 --> 02:23:43.501
 and make the broader sense of 
image analysis for 

02:23:43.502 --> 02:23:47.499
classification, identification 
and discovery and retrieval in 

02:23:47.500 --> 02:23:52.465
distinctive libraries.  Given 
the potential for scholarly 

02:23:52.583 --> 02:23:57.066
impact, we seek to have the 
poetic confidence and cross a 

02:23:57.067 --> 02:24:03.870
number of boundaries including 
graphic, temporal and 

02:24:04.031 --> 02:24:04.519
linguistic. linguistic.  I

02:24:04.520 --> 02:24:07.474
 can talk more about the work 
that we are doing in the grant 

02:24:07.475 --> 02:24:12.457
but ultimately, hopefully the 
work will help develop the 

02:24:12.809 --> 02:24:17.272
collection, prerelease and post 
release of the collection.  We 

02:24:17.273 --> 02:24:21.398
seek to work with librarians to 
help and classify materials and 

02:24:21.399 --> 02:24:25.308
have the researchers' ability to
 impose new questions of 

02:24:27.372 --> 02:24:32.098
digitizing.  We hope that this 
works and creates more 

02:24:32.099 --> 02:24:36.460
interfaces that allows users to 
use query collections beyond the

02:24:36.461 --> 02:24:41.099
 text-based search and themes 
such as publications.  

02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:44.632
Before we can get to the 
interfaces however, we need to 

02:24:44.923 --> 02:24:47.922
create the under lying data as 
well as broaden the sense with 

02:24:48.058 --> 02:24:50.536
what is possible with what we 
can build and this will require 

02:24:50.656 --> 02:24:54.525
us to work with text and image 
as well as to see text as image.

02:24:54.681 --> 02:24:56.681
Thank you.  [Applause]

02:26:20.731 --> 02:27:12.171
  Okay.  Hello everybody.  I 
really appreciate being here.  

02:25:33.291 --> 02:25:41.733
You know, I am one of those 
people who is basically a 

02:25:41.734 --> 02:25:46.635
librarian through and through.
I have a bachelor of science.  

02:25:46.894 --> 02:25:53.754
And at 18 years old I decided to
 become a librarian.  At the 

02:25:54.974 --> 02:25:58.262
Library of Congress -- I am from
 the Philippine so it's a 

02:25:58.684 --> 02:26:01.749
pleasure to be here of the so if
 anyone is watching, I am here 

02:26:01.987 --> 02:26:08.542
it's awesome.  [Cheers and 
applause].  Okay.  Enough about 

02:26:09.024 --> 02:26:12.673
me.  Let's talk about 
reunification which is one of my

02:26:13.409 --> 02:26:16.480
 passions.  First I would like 
to preface this conversation by 

02:26:16.849 --> 02:26:22.421
talking about, you know, the 
digitization has become a 

02:26:22.543 --> 02:26:26.205
fundamental responsibility.  
When I say this occasionally I 

02:26:26.356 --> 02:26:28.845
will get nasty looks from other 
people because they don't 

02:26:29.016 --> 02:26:33.908
appreciate the idea.  You know, 
we have to wake up.  

02:26:33.909 --> 02:26:36.836
Institutions are expected to be 
doing digitization, I know that 

02:26:37.686 --> 02:26:39.784
there are resource disparities 
but I teach introduction to 

02:26:41.187 --> 02:26:45.700
archives and I am now expected 
to teach my students, putting 

02:26:46.112 --> 02:26:49.943
digitization as part of archival
 practice.  So this is part of 

02:26:50.789 --> 02:26:55.387
our realities right now.  As 
cultural heritage institutions. 

02:26:55.737 --> 02:27:02.368
With digitization we facilitate 
the discovery, impact.  There 

02:27:03.225 --> 02:27:05.225
are studies that indicate

02:27:08.495 --> 02:27:16.858
 that having a digital, will 
help people discover and use 

02:27:16.969 --> 02:27:21.532
resources more broadly.  We are 
providing digital product.  We 

02:27:22.488 --> 02:27:27.285
are rethinking our work as 
heritage institutions and it's 

02:27:28.205 --> 02:27:34.652
also redefining what it means to
 perform library archives and 

02:27:34.859 --> 02:27:39.295
museum work.  It's also -- this 
conversation of conversions and 

02:27:39.435 --> 02:27:43.813
collaboration has been happening
 even before digitization and I 

02:27:44.133 --> 02:27:49.519
think digitization is one way to
 ensure that institutions are 

02:27:50.031 --> 02:27:55.375
truly collaborating by sharing 
resources and expertise.  So the

02:27:55.697 --> 02:27:59.479
 way we handle the disperse 
collections into the archival 

02:27:59.712 --> 02:28:02.724
community in the past is that 
first we acknowledge them in our

02:28:02.983 --> 02:28:07.268
 finding ways, saying this 
collection is also found in five

02:28:07.817 --> 02:28:12.279
 other institutions and 
sometimes we are comprehensive, 

02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:17.198
sometimes we are not.  Another 
thing at the theoretical level, 

02:28:17.199 --> 02:28:19.199
we try to

02:28:20.603 --> 02:28:24.422
 expand notions of ownership and
 what it means to have records 

02:28:24.423 --> 02:28:28.897
in our custody and finally, we 
are using technical standards 

02:28:28.898 --> 02:28:33.667
and tools in reconnecting and 
linking collections together.  

02:28:34.145 --> 02:28:42.249
Here is one quote from 2001 by 
Janette Bash and she says 

02:28:42.546 --> 02:28:46.272
standards such is the DAD have 
the fragmented collections in 

02:28:46.609 --> 02:28:49.340
creating distributed collections
 through the online linking of 

02:28:49.646 --> 02:28:56.000
finding aids and she is talking 
about this in context of the 

02:28:56.413 --> 02:29:02.930
records of U.S. Virgin islands 
and to move to move contemporary

02:29:03.323 --> 02:29:08.900
 times, we hear the term virtual
 reunification which is a very 

02:29:09.121 --> 02:29:12.284
short definition would be 
allowing the dispersed 

02:29:12.462 --> 02:29:14.849
collections to be brought 
together.  It's a highly 

02:29:16.053 --> 02:29:19.732
collaborative endeavor and will 
allow multiple institutions and 

02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:23.076
multiple scholars in various 
disciplines and multiple 

02:29:23.655 --> 02:29:29.852
expertise within cultural 
heritage work.  It has the 

02:29:30.144 --> 02:29:33.961
digital.  The problem with many 
dispersed collections is that 

02:29:34.187 --> 02:29:38.759
it's almost entirely impossible 
to reunite them in the physical 

02:29:38.983 --> 02:29:43.738
format because one, you 
encounter geographic 

02:29:44.060 --> 02:29:48.735
limitations.  Things are in far 
places.  Physically, sometimes 

02:29:49.205 --> 02:29:53.974
materials are, you know, in 
different formats and quite 

02:29:57.823 --> 02:30:03.379
challenge to be brought together
 in the digital form and also 

02:30:03.582 --> 02:30:11.375
have the diplomacy.  In some 
virtual digitization projects in

02:30:11.774 --> 02:30:18.223
 Europe, it involves multiple 
institutions or national 

02:30:18.852 --> 02:30:22.467
institutions.  Here is some 
examples of virtual 

02:30:23.408 --> 02:30:26.805
reunification projects.  There 
is many out there.  These are 

02:30:27.357 --> 02:30:32.695
some.  My favorite is the Walt 
Whitman archive and I am sure 

02:30:32.974 --> 02:30:36.600
it's familiar to many.  It 
brings the work of one person 

02:30:37.037 --> 02:30:42.664
and also, you know, from various
 institutions and trying to do 

02:30:43.042 --> 02:30:50.555
multiple ways of engaging with 
the material.  Reunification is 

02:30:51.737 --> 02:30:54.496
bringing together the whole 
collection, it has its deep 

02:30:54.634 --> 02:30:58.984
roots in the analog world, 
specifically in the humanities. 

02:30:59.133 --> 02:31:05.057
You know, in art history there 
is such a thing as catalog 

02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:11.444
reasonates or in music, complete
 works and in literature you 

02:31:11.445 --> 02:31:15.508
have scholarly conditions and in
 history, we have what is more 

02:31:15.862 --> 02:31:23.320
related to archival work, 
historical conditions.  We have 

02:31:23.450 --> 02:31:30.324
going to different authorities 
trying to collect all writings 

02:31:30.834 --> 02:31:33.521
of Thomas Jefferson, for 
instance.  So there is

02:31:37.200 --> 02:31:43.917
 a long scholarly trajectory of 
bringing together projections.  

02:31:43.918 --> 02:31:46.924
There is lack of attention to 
photographic materials and there

02:31:47.120 --> 02:31:53.875
 are projects out there looking 
at image processing and battle 

02:31:54.213 --> 02:31:57.579
recognition.  There are projects
 that, you know, would exhibit 

02:31:57.777 --> 02:32:02.436
photographs, for instance, but 
they are not at the particular 

02:32:02.766 --> 02:32:06.152
scale where you have them from 
all over the place, different 

02:32:06.274 --> 02:32:09.899
institutions and multiple stake 
holders and truly, you know, 

02:32:10.227 --> 02:32:15.860
bringing them and doing 
scholarly work with those 

02:32:15.987 --> 02:32:22.226
materials.  It's also a way to 
do the 

02:32:29.070 --> 02:32:33.963
repatriotion, making it through 
digital needs.  But there is no 

02:32:33.964 --> 02:32:37.264
returning to what it truly means
 of something that digital.  

02:32:37.265 --> 02:32:41.409
More through success and less in
 barriers.  When I read the 

02:32:41.410 --> 02:32:44.081
literature on this subject 
people are saying yay, we did 

02:32:44.501 --> 02:32:46.360
it.  It's difficult.  
Congratulations to us because we

02:32:46.361 --> 02:32:50.926
 have done it.  But actually, we
 learn from barriers, from 

02:32:51.111 --> 02:32:54.212
projects that tell us that these
 are the problems that we 

02:32:54.530 --> 02:33:00.890
encountered.  So that when we do
 it again, we know things to 

02:33:01.100 --> 02:33:04.455
expect.  And also it's unclear 
about institutional 

02:33:05.659 --> 02:33:08.863
collaboration.  When ten 
institutions are involved and 

02:33:09.090 --> 02:33:14.594
one of them is let's say a 
historical society in one county

02:33:15.277 --> 02:33:19.189
 versus the Smithsonian, there 
is imbalance between the 

02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:22.531
resources and prestige in that 
project.  

02:33:22.532 --> 02:33:28.731
So there is a lot to, you know, 
be done and discuss in the 

02:33:28.859 --> 02:33:31.837
barriers.  And in the world of 
digital 

02:33:36.407 --> 02:33:38.407
repatrization,

02:33:43.706 --> 02:33:45.970
anthropologists studied that 
there is a problem with the 

02:33:46.084 --> 02:33:51.318
notion of returning copies of 
artifacts to native American 

02:33:51.499 --> 02:33:53.499
communities.  Is it really 

02:33:57.913 --> 02:33:59.932
returned?  Is it really 

02:34:06.421 --> 02:34:10.703
repatration.  Not all 
communities want it to be 

02:34:12.934 --> 02:34:19.190
returns to them.  Many are happy
 with the digitals that they can

02:34:19.506 --> 02:34:23.247
 use in the classroom.  There is
 really not one solution to the 

02:34:23.555 --> 02:34:30.352
issue.  Where does the  return 
happen?  Is it for the community

02:34:30.483 --> 02:34:34.448
 or the scholar community that 
they are referring to?  So my 

02:34:37.095 --> 02:34:39.669
project looked at the photograph
 taken in the Philippine in the 

02:34:40.698 --> 02:34:48.321
early 1900s by colonial 
administrator that was assigned 

02:34:49.111 --> 02:34:52.979
in the Philippine Muster.  He 
was a 

02:34:56.120 --> 02:34:59.881
zoologist and because of his 
interest, he started to document

02:34:59.882 --> 02:35:05.910
 the different groups in the 
country and in the process, 

02:35:06.232 --> 02:35:09.892
managed to amount the cache of 
photographic materials.  Here 

02:35:10.079 --> 02:35:16.243
are some examples of the photos.
And here is more.  So the 

02:35:16.746 --> 02:35:20.866
rational is that for us to be 
able to manage this new 

02:35:21.173 --> 02:35:24.311
territory called the Philippine,
 we need to understand its 

02:35:24.312 --> 02:35:27.265
people and more importantly we 
need to understand their 

02:35:27.266 --> 02:35:34.335
resources so we can trade.  So 
that was the whole premise 

02:35:34.336 --> 02:35:39.577
around the surveys that he did 
in the early 1900s. 

02:35:39.578 --> 02:35:41.578
So the photographs of 

02:35:46.062 --> 02:35:49.048
Muster are currently in more 
than ten institutions but I 

02:35:49.049 --> 02:35:51.950
looked at ten institutions for 
this study.  

02:35:51.951 --> 02:35:55.183
There is an effort to 
consolidate them in the 1970s by

02:35:55.843 --> 02:36:00.223
 doing, you know, like a union 
catalog of some sort where they 

02:36:00.575 --> 02:36:06.147
are located.  There is a 
research demand on these 

02:36:06.647 --> 02:36:09.280
photographs and it's in various 
stages of digitization and there

02:36:09.504 --> 02:36:13.627
 is some funding available for 
this.  And yes, reunification is

02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:18.735
 not happening.  So I said this 
is probably an ideal case to 

02:36:19.277 --> 02:36:26.375
study and examine, you know, in 
a context where something is 

02:36:26.606 --> 02:36:29.590
likely to happen and yet it's 
not happening.  What is stopping

02:36:29.922 --> 02:36:32.326
 it from happening?  That is my 
particular question at that 

02:36:32.730 --> 02:36:37.973
time.  So I went to ten 
institutions that collected 

02:36:38.086 --> 02:36:43.242
these photographs.  Two of those
 are -- I would classify as 

02:36:43.375 --> 02:36:50.406
natural history museum.  Four 
are anthropology and museums, 

02:36:51.094 --> 02:36:55.164
two are archival institutions 
and archives who are special 

02:36:55.300 --> 02:36:59.431
collection.  You will see, and I
 will get back to this, that in 

02:36:59.888 --> 02:37:04.692
these multiple institutions, you
 know, the photos are different 

02:37:07.795 --> 02:37:15.860
formats, and different types of 
state or states in terms of 

02:37:18.397 --> 02:37:20.774
digitization.  You know, you go 
back to the idea of, you know, 

02:37:21.564 --> 02:37:24.152
if you want to bring something 
together that is dispersed.  Who

02:37:24.753 --> 02:37:29.256
 decides on behalf of the 
communities when only 

02:37:29.387 --> 02:37:33.741
institutions are talking?  How 
do you display the images when, 

02:37:33.995 --> 02:37:39.402
you know, if you want to produce
 something scholarly, another 

02:37:39.717 --> 02:37:44.690
problem that I have seen is, you
 know, there are many 

02:37:44.820 --> 02:37:47.229
dimensions.
When you say, I am really 

02:37:47.359 --> 02:37:51.460
finding something that is 
disperse.  Are you referring to 

02:37:51.661 --> 02:37:56.153
the physical distance that they 
are scattered.  Are you talking 

02:37:56.309 --> 02:37:59.677
about temporal sort of 
discussions because they were 

02:38:00.129 --> 02:38:02.129
dispersed at different

02:38:03.604 --> 02:38:12.008
 moments in time.  Providence 
and I am using different 

02:38:12.009 --> 02:38:14.097
providences from the ownership 
and material.  And there is also

02:38:14.312 --> 02:38:17.806
 the challenge of material.  
Here is one digitization, the 

02:38:17.807 --> 02:38:23.393
elementary one that I created 
for myself to show you some 

02:38:23.394 --> 02:38:29.258
notion of dispersesdispersing of
 geographics in different 

02:38:30.672 --> 02:38:32.672
places.  It can be 

02:38:35.578 --> 02:38:39.627
providential.  In one 
institution, it's 

02:38:43.769 --> 02:38:52.076
done through the pathagrapher by
 the museum of natural history 

02:38:52.077 --> 02:38:59.764
and the museum of anthropology. 

02:38:59.765 --> 02:39:02.894
Sometimes it's dispersed and 
does not go in one direction.  

02:39:03.093 --> 02:39:05.093
It's also 

02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:09.882
temporal.  It was given to 
different institutions.

02:39:09.883 --> 02:39:16.474
And the earliest collection as I
 found was at the national 

02:39:16.597 --> 02:39:20.119
archives.  And also materials, 
sometimes the photograph would 

02:39:20.825 --> 02:39:28.708
be in a scrapbook.  Sometimes 
it's a lantern slide.  Even if 

02:39:28.854 --> 02:39:36.016
you compare two scrapbook 
images, are put in different 

02:39:36.359 --> 02:39:38.359
chronological order or two 
different scrap books.  There is

02:39:38.498 --> 02:39:40.521
 a lot of researchers that are 
interested in the meaning around

02:39:40.651 --> 02:39:46.818
 the changing of this, you know,
 chronological representation of

02:39:47.121 --> 02:39:51.855
 the photograph.  And also among
 institutions that I have 

02:39:52.196 --> 02:39:59.278
interviewed, they seem to have 
this notion of you know, we 

02:39:59.407 --> 02:40:02.853
can't show these photographs to 
everybody, so we have to make 

02:40:03.055 --> 02:40:07.104
sure that not, you know, we are 
more responsible around, you 

02:40:07.291 --> 02:40:11.447
know, who gets to see the image.
So as far as these institutions 

02:40:11.770 --> 02:40:15.512
are concerned, you have to see 
it first because they need to 

02:40:17.656 --> 02:40:21.705
work on the collection and the 
source communities of course, 

02:40:22.608 --> 02:40:25.945
the different groups that take 
ownership of the images and 

02:40:26.450 --> 02:40:31.491
researchers and scholars and 
maybe the Phillipene immigrant 

02:40:31.706 --> 02:40:36.725
communities are living in the 
U.S. so it's a different notion 

02:40:36.934 --> 02:40:39.874
of access.  I know that many 
information professionals are 

02:40:40.302 --> 02:40:44.392
very much in love with universal
 and hindered access.  But it's 

02:40:44.599 --> 02:40:49.533
just not the case for 
ethnographic collections within 

02:40:49.534 --> 02:40:55.175
the community.  So finally, I am
 leaving you with three 

02:40:55.390 --> 02:41:01.523
questions.  The question is, 
what does it mean to assemble 

02:41:02.335 --> 02:41:04.335
the whole?  There are many

02:41:05.575 --> 02:41:10.489
 dimensions to dispersspersing. 

02:41:10.490 --> 02:41:14.372
Getting all of the dimensions 
together within the project.  

02:41:14.647 --> 02:41:19.076
What is the object of 
reunification.  Sometimes we 

02:41:19.208 --> 02:41:21.305
actively care about fixing 
relationships, fixing 

02:41:21.441 --> 02:41:24.656
relationships with communities. 
Is that what we want?  The 

02:41:24.782 --> 02:41:29.513
outcome is that we have good 
relationships in communities 

02:41:29.634 --> 02:41:33.113
that the material recombination 
or assembly of these things are 

02:41:34.824 --> 02:41:40.923
a way towards that.  Another is 
the solution, what really is the

02:41:41.825 --> 02:41:48.352
 problem.  Is this sometimes, 
you know, I hear of available 

02:41:48.590 --> 02:41:50.590
technology that will solve 
things and do a lot of things 

02:41:51.091 --> 02:41:53.872
for us.  Is this a solution in 
search of a problem?  So thank 

02:41:54.028 --> 02:41:56.230
you very much.  [Applause]

02:42:45.107 --> 02:42:47.107
. 
SPEAKER:  Can you duplicate or 

02:42:47.213 --> 02:42:49.213
split the

02:42:52.272 --> 02:42:54.648
 screen by chance?  I think the 
web

02:42:58.271 --> 02:43:00.271
 developer would 

02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:07.720
know how to -- thank you.  All 
right.  Perfect.  Well on a 

02:43:07.833 --> 02:43:11.906
personal level, I may be the 
most surprising and unlikely 

02:43:12.112 --> 02:43:14.112
person today as

02:43:15.311 --> 02:43:19.525
 not long ago, I went to the 
library to escape the chaos from

02:43:20.003 --> 02:43:23.133
 my 1-year-old daughter of 
combing but programming books, 

02:43:23.134 --> 02:43:27.553
to build an app of my own.  I 
had recently resigned from a 10 

02:43:27.554 --> 02:43:32.076
year career as an accountant and
 auditor to pursue a passion for

02:43:32.520 --> 02:43:36.511
 web development.  Shortly 
thereafter I started my current 

02:43:36.512 --> 02:43:41.494
dream job as a web developer for
 Zooniverse.org and it's a 

02:43:41.621 --> 02:43:44.587
surprising tool that will unlock
 the data of your collections, 

02:43:44.588 --> 02:43:47.323
in one likely ways that you will
 not imagine likely for the

02:43:51.551 --> 02:43:57.385
 Zooniverse.  It's one of the 
largest platform and Zooniverse 

02:43:58.617 --> 02:44:02.467
team members have orthodox 
backgrounds and PHDs in if 

02:44:02.608 --> 02:44:10.853
economies, humanities, 
philosophy, there is data and 

02:44:11.568 --> 02:44:14.430
research through the 
ambassadors.  Today I want to 

02:44:14.548 --> 02:44:17.968
introduce you to the diverse 
projects that focus on 

02:44:18.935 --> 02:44:21.441
transcription projects and give 
you a brief overview of the 

02:44:22.211 --> 02:44:29.230
project builder.  It all started
 with galaxy zoo in 2007.  Like 

02:44:29.364 --> 02:44:31.364
many 

02:44:33.414 --> 02:44:37.656
astronomists, there was more 
data that they can classify 

02:44:37.657 --> 02:44:39.899
before they can ask the 
interesting question about the

02:44:44.809 --> 02:44:51.560
 universe.  One of the 
classified, going insane, or 

02:44:52.814 --> 02:44:56.433
spend the rest of their life 
identifying.  The pattern 

02:44:56.579 --> 02:44:59.495
recognition for the initial 
classifying that humans excel 

02:44:59.662 --> 02:45:09.252
at, while computers yet do not. 
The solution was to harvest the 

02:45:10.767 --> 02:45:16.224
resourcing.  It has the 
information classified as 

02:45:16.643 --> 02:45:20.498
historical or realistical.  The 
results were incredible.  There 

02:45:20.980 --> 02:45:26.105
were over 150 thousand people 
contributing and it was 

02:45:26.793 --> 02:45:30.778
eventually determined that the 
crowd source consensus was as 

02:45:30.909 --> 02:45:33.997
good as classifications shown by
 professional 

02:45:38.798 --> 02:45:40.760
astromomers showing that we have
 gotten it right.  

02:45:40.761 --> 02:45:45.485
Some of the volunteers are 
listed as co-authors, regular 

02:45:46.570 --> 02:45:52.673
everyday volunteers.  Galaxy zoo
 otherwise thought was 

02:45:52.797 --> 02:46:00.475
impossible.  It gets more 
exciting.  We had a legendary 

02:46:00.657 --> 02:46:05.018
guitarist, Brian May who is a 
PHD 

02:46:13.093 --> 02:46:20.405
astronomer and we have a PHD 
teacher from the Netherlands.  

02:46:21.269 --> 02:46:23.711
The researchers looked into her 
question and turned out it's a 

02:46:26.267 --> 02:46:30.030
galaxy sized glass cloud in the 
neighboring galaxy that recently

02:46:30.465 --> 02:46:35.229
 shifted from active to quiet.  
Scientists knew of it and never 

02:46:35.619 --> 02:46:40.065
captured the phenomenon.  Was 
the first person in history to 

02:46:40.677 --> 02:46:43.381
witness it and was named after 
her.  It illustrates that the 

02:46:43.625 --> 02:46:47.605
more people you engaged in your 
project, the more likely someone

02:46:47.915 --> 02:46:49.915
 will make an amazing 

02:46:52.555 --> 02:46:57.236
serendipitious discovery.  Each 
project has a perform where we 

02:46:57.686 --> 02:47:00.628
can talk with each other as well
 as volunteers and experts.  In 

02:47:00.834 --> 02:47:03.424
the project, the first 
discussion is for specific 

02:47:03.797 --> 02:47:06.068
images and the next is general 
questions and there is specific 

02:47:06.602 --> 02:47:11.966
discussions that are unique to 
this project.  Now, we often see

02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:16.978
 the serendipitious discoveries,
 and a key to a successful 

02:47:17.212 --> 02:47:21.468
project is that the research 
team engages with the volunteers

02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:24.949
 through talk.  This is the 
current landing page of projects

02:47:25.081 --> 02:47:30.112
 and since 2007, there is over 
45 active projects with several 

02:47:30.750 --> 02:47:35.469
hundred researchers that have 
led to over 100 peer review 

02:47:35.823 --> 02:47:40.150
publications.  The galaxy zoo 
papers have had thousands 

02:47:41.951 --> 02:47:45.947
citations and reuse of the data.
The galaxy zoo story encapsulate

02:47:46.282 --> 02:47:53.056
 three stories that I want to 
emphasize.  The volunteers will 

02:47:53.721 --> 02:47:59.355
conclude to the success of a 
project and crowd sourcing is 

02:47:59.619 --> 02:48:03.506
more about serendipitious 
discovery and reduces accurate 

02:48:06.740 --> 02:48:12.741
and reliable results.  Science 
galaxy is a transcription 

02:48:13.061 --> 02:48:16.714
process that relates the 
historian scientists and the 

02:48:16.864 --> 02:48:19.565
scientists of today.  With a 
camera, they had to draw what 

02:48:19.761 --> 02:48:25.202
they saw.  The drawings have 
been locked away in the pages of

02:48:25.634 --> 02:48:30.141
 the Victorian articles, and 
today through science gossip, 

02:48:30.306 --> 02:48:35.385
they can unlock the origins of 
the citizen science.  What may 

02:48:37.860 --> 02:48:41.938
have taken a diligent historian 
over ten years, it's 

02:48:42.448 --> 02:48:45.748
accomplishing news that we 
thought was otherwise practical.

02:48:46.076 --> 02:48:52.338
One volunteer found the image by
 Maple Roads and asked in talk, 

02:48:52.513 --> 02:48:54.513
if it was the first female 
contributor and her question

02:48:59.939 --> 02:49:04.997
 inspired the community.  They 
discovered numerous illustrated,

02:49:05.326 --> 02:49:08.467
 included many uncredited.  One 
volunteer's question brought the

02:49:08.978 --> 02:49:11.596
 collection to life in an 
amazing and

02:49:15.314 --> 02:49:18.373
 unexpected way.  One of my 
personal favorites where you get

02:49:18.542 --> 02:49:26.850
 to rely on penguins for science
 and you tag 

02:49:28.894 --> 02:49:30.894
penguins in

02:49:34.850 --> 02:49:39.907
 regions and you can see the 
winner of the context in the 

02:49:39.908 --> 02:49:41.934
lower right. 
I'm not sure that all of them 

02:49:42.501 --> 02:49:48.850
are volunteers that shared that 
level of enthusiasm.  But the 

02:49:49.056 --> 02:49:52.283
number one reason that the 
volunteers do participate is to 

02:49:52.574 --> 02:49:55.667
participate in the scientific 
projects.  They are fascinated 

02:49:56.193 --> 02:50:04.063
in a project or it's just plain 
fun.  We have more than 1.5 

02:50:05.669 --> 02:50:09.436
million volunteers in over 237 
countries ranging from age to 5 

02:50:09.812 --> 02:50:13.407
to 95 years old.  It's an 

02:50:16.549 --> 02:50:19.853
endeavorous group making real 
contributions to science.  My 

02:50:21.147 --> 02:50:24.269
personal favorite is volunteers 
capturing hundreds of images 

02:50:24.745 --> 02:50:29.791
from national parks providing a 
powerful new window into 

02:50:29.925 --> 02:50:35.676
Africa's most elusive wildlife 
species.  It was incredibly 

02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:39.069
successful.  In the first three 
days alone, and projects the 

02:50:39.437 --> 02:50:43.085
back laws of images and there is
 a creative publication that 

02:50:43.396 --> 02:50:50.405
shows that the crowd is as good 
as experts in the consensus 

02:50:51.470 --> 02:50:54.754
scenarios compared to the 98 
percent accuracy in other 

02:50:54.952 --> 02:50:57.914
scenarios.  Again the crowd gets
 it right and personally, I know

02:50:59.311 --> 02:51:07.152
 the difference between the 
harder beast and the wilder 

02:51:07.845 --> 02:51:14.562
beast.  To collaborate what I 
mean by consensus, Snapchat has 

02:51:16.509 --> 02:51:21.564
the 25 images and ten agree, 
thereby reaching a consent 

02:51:22.482 --> 02:51:24.482
issues. 

02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:32.155
  The volunteers are on the 
right.  And those can agree so 

02:51:32.156 --> 02:51:36.485
far there is one drafting the 
images.  While this image is 

02:51:36.610 --> 02:51:39.889
challenging, one volunteer 
thinks there are four 

02:51:42.011 --> 02:51:47.537
wilderbeast, and the other a 
buffalo.  The certain image is 

02:51:48.245 --> 02:51:53.548
just not possible to get 
consensus and 25 people will 

02:51:53.817 --> 02:51:56.932
classify.  Experts can't agree 
on these images and though these

02:51:57.063 --> 02:52:01.578
 images are the minority, most 
or over 70 percent of the images

02:52:01.579 --> 02:52:05.047
 are retired with the consensus 
before getting to the 25

02:52:09.667 --> 02:52:13.228
 classification maximum.  Now we
 will focus on some 

02:52:13.229 --> 02:52:15.229
transcription

02:52:16.394 --> 02:52:21.435
 projects starting on data, 
museums of the web top prize 

02:52:21.587 --> 02:52:24.845
winner.  In addition to creating
 art, many artists wrote diaries

02:52:25.253 --> 02:52:29.059
 and letters that contain sketch
 books that contain details 

02:52:29.060 --> 02:52:32.840
about their lives and processes.

02:52:32.841 --> 02:52:35.073
Volunteers transcribed these 
processes from the data 

02:52:35.290 --> 02:52:39.631
collection and revealed the 
secret lives of artists.  I like

02:52:39.963 --> 02:52:43.350
 to have the artist work open in
 one window and classify in 

02:52:43.351 --> 02:52:46.380
other window and gives 
appreciation for the art and the

02:52:46.703 --> 02:52:51.614
 artist themselves.  For 
documents such as this, OCR 

02:52:51.615 --> 02:52:55.551
doesn't work.  
Which is why we need to 

02:52:55.835 --> 02:52:58.104
transcribe them.  Transcription 
can be quite challenging.  It's 

02:52:58.229 --> 02:53:02.234
not as straightforward as 
clicking on a penguin but we try

02:53:02.592 --> 02:53:06.904
 to make it as straightforward 
and simple as possible.  We 

02:53:07.133 --> 02:53:09.668
utilize the transcription 
method.  I am going to refer to 

02:53:09.895 --> 02:53:14.992
it line by line.  And we don't 
ask volunteers to transcribe an 

02:53:15.158 --> 02:53:20.624
entire page or even transcribe 
the entire sentence.  You simply

02:53:20.965 --> 02:53:23.885
 ask them to transcribe one 
visual line at a time, that they

02:53:24.223 --> 02:53:25.966
 feel they can do in confidence.

02:53:25.967 --> 02:53:30.818
This creates a quality and 
collective effort.  Each line's 

02:53:31.721 --> 02:53:39.336
XY coordinates transcription is 
paired with an algorithm 

02:53:41.778 --> 02:53:47.730
creating consensus and reducing 
the need for experts.  Today's 

02:53:47.998 --> 02:53:54.655
rate of accuracy is 95 percent 
which is in line with OCR 

02:53:55.419 --> 02:53:57.419
accuracy which is 94 percent

02:54:01.691 --> 02:54:06.430
 for gray scale and 93 percent 
for bitonal.  Again, showing the

02:54:06.730 --> 02:54:12.876
 rates.  In collaboration with 
the library here in Washington, 

02:54:14.276 --> 02:54:21.708
D.C. and under transcription 
project that we love called 

02:54:23.279 --> 02:54:25.892
shakespear's world and helps us 
understand his life.  With the 

02:54:26.062 --> 02:54:29.782
line by line process, there is 
added complexity for the type of

02:54:31.264 --> 02:54:33.927
 historical document.  What we 
have learned with this project 

02:54:34.078 --> 02:54:38.367
as well as others is that if you
 have a great UI for volunteers,

02:54:39.004 --> 02:54:43.057
 they can accomplish complex and
 difficult transcription.  Again

02:54:43.058 --> 02:54:45.612
 it helps to break the 
transcription process down to an

02:54:46.163 --> 02:54:49.344
 approachable level.  Documents 
are provided between recipes and

02:54:50.671 --> 02:54:56.639
 letters and for those 
interested in delicious dishes 

02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:02.718
or juicy gaps, I prefer that 
it's fascinatefascinat 

02:55:02.719 --> 02:55:07.719
fascinating.  And there is a 
wonderful blog that updates and 

02:55:07.720 --> 02:55:10.827
shares great stories from the 
project.  Next transcription 

02:55:10.925 --> 02:55:14.327
project is decoding the civil 
war.  You can witness the United

02:55:14.539 --> 02:55:17.595
 States civil war by 
transcribing and discipling the 

02:55:17.596 --> 02:55:23.209
method and codes by the United 
States military telegraph 

02:55:23.210 --> 02:55:27.802
including one from Abraham 
Lincoln, two weeks before the 

02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:32.018
death.  It's incredibly 
interesting and it's other 

02:55:32.019 --> 02:55:36.649
telegraphs requesting whiskey or
 clean under wear.  It beguns 

02:55:36.650 --> 02:55:38.650
the 

02:55:41.310 --> 02:55:46.736
gamut and it's a remarkable time
 for the team in history.  And 

02:55:46.737 --> 02:55:52.008
hopefully you can see in the 
variation, this is a method from

02:55:53.163 --> 02:55:58.498
 the previous transcription.  
Volunteers we had asked to do 

02:55:58.499 --> 02:56:02.265
telegraphs before proceeding.  
An additional method that we 

02:56:02.266 --> 02:56:05.055
worked on years ago in 
collaboration with the public 

02:56:05.056 --> 02:56:12.260
library is scribe.  The method 
of scribe is that one marks the 

02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:18.197
structure and a different 
volunteer does transcribe.  

02:56:18.198 --> 02:56:22.455
Scribe is open source like 
everything we do.  I encourage 

02:56:22.732 --> 02:56:27.304
you, if you want to do a 
transcription work, check out 

02:56:27.555 --> 02:56:30.867
scribe.  It will be helpful for 
you.  There is also what the 

02:56:32.769 --> 02:56:37.114
Smithsonian uses where one 
volunteer transcribes and an 

02:56:38.909 --> 02:56:41.458
expert reviews it, and there is 
feedback on that cycle.  There 

02:56:41.634 --> 02:56:46.156
is no right or wrong method.  
The method depends on the 

02:56:46.747 --> 02:56:49.529
project.  Going back to decoding
 the civil war, this was 

02:56:49.530 --> 02:56:52.093
recently launched within the 
project builder.  A little over 

02:56:52.094 --> 02:56:57.083
a year ago, we launched the 
project builder to create a 

02:56:57.084 --> 02:57:00.277
project and it's incredible.  We
 are really proud of it.  Right 

02:57:00.278 --> 02:57:07.217
now anyone can build their own 
project for free in hours.  Go

02:57:10.365 --> 02:57:14.698
 to Zooniverse.org and you're on
 your way.  It's a detailed 

02:57:16.904 --> 02:57:18.951
tutorial and message boards 
online, if you would like to try

02:57:19.373 --> 02:57:23.986
 it yourself.  This is a screen 
shot.  Don't worry about the 

02:57:24.134 --> 02:57:28.457
details shown.  My intent is to 
give you a general deal for the 

02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:33.492
interface.  In the menu from top
 to bottom, we have the project 

02:57:33.619 --> 02:57:38.012
section, the work close section 
and the subject set section.  

02:57:38.820 --> 02:57:43.676
Likely your collection, 
typically in our case, images.  

02:57:44.054 --> 02:57:48.248
So we are in this video.  You 
can upload subjects into the 

02:57:48.944 --> 02:57:53.277
project builder and we support 
hosted images.  It can include 

02:57:53.678 --> 02:57:57.985
meta data and other IDs that can
 either be shown or hidden from 

02:57:58.306 --> 02:58:00.335
volunteers and once you have 
your subject set into the 

02:58:00.812 --> 02:58:04.488
project builder, you can then 
create what we refer to as a 

02:58:04.615 --> 02:58:09.179
workflow.  It's the sequence and
 task that you ask volunteers to

02:58:09.307 --> 02:58:13.440
 do and we have many types of 
task including text tasks 

02:58:13.793 --> 02:58:18.272
especially for the transcription
 projects, drawing tasks, drop 

02:58:18.974 --> 02:58:24.478
down tasks.  Some are behind in 
experimental flag.  So ask and 

02:58:24.669 --> 02:58:30.072
we will enable you.  Also the 
workflow editor, you set the 

02:58:30.348 --> 02:58:33.134
subject for how many times it's 
classified before it's no longer

02:58:33.135 --> 02:58:37.103
 shown to volunteers.  So once 
you have the subject set, you 

02:58:37.670 --> 02:58:40.197
have completed the core of the 
project.  Here we see what a 

02:58:40.475 --> 02:58:44.042
volunteer sees while classifying
 within the notes for the nature

02:58:44.717 --> 02:58:47.668
 project where volunteers 
transcribe the labels that we 

02:58:48.203 --> 02:58:50.521
recently relaunched after 
rebuilding within the project 

02:58:51.096 --> 02:58:55.348
builder.  I worked closely with 
this project.  It has been a 

02:58:55.482 --> 02:58:58.828
wonderful experience and has an 
incredible research team and you

02:59:00.267 --> 02:59:04.022
 can see two text tasks to where
 a volunteer can collect the 

02:59:04.023 --> 02:59:08.391
name and number, and then three 
drop-down tasks to enter the 

02:59:08.614 --> 02:59:13.901
month, day and year, all that we
 referred to as a combo task and

02:59:14.208 --> 02:59:18.524
 this is an example of what you 
can build and what a volunteer 

02:59:18.874 --> 02:59:23.333
can then see.  With the project 
builder you can also add other 

02:59:23.509 --> 02:59:26.167
collaborators or people to help 
you.  You can add content for 

02:59:26.500 --> 02:59:29.812
the learning page or create the 
team page or research page to 

02:59:30.541 --> 02:59:33.149
give details about what you are 
looking to accomplish.  You can 

02:59:33.327 --> 02:59:38.458
create tutorials and field 
guides to help volunteers 

02:59:38.615 --> 02:59:41.875
classify.  You can set up the 
incredible talk that I mentioned

02:59:42.185 --> 02:59:46.582
 earlier happened.  And you can 
export aspects of your project 

02:59:47.134 --> 02:59:51.242
that happened such as volunteer 
classifications such as on day 

02:59:52.014 --> 02:59:55.859
one or whenever.  The review 
process can be featured on the 

02:59:55.984 --> 03:00:00.161
main page and you can share a 
link with it to anyone.  A 

03:00:01.098 --> 03:00:06.883
successful project articulates 
the purpose well as 

03:00:07.055 --> 03:00:10.157
straightforward and simple as 
possible, detailed help for 

03:00:10.489 --> 03:00:14.732
volunteers and an active 
research team that helps 

03:00:15.087 --> 03:00:20.692
significantly.  So the 
Zooniverse is expanding at a 

03:00:20.954 --> 03:00:23.887
speedy rate especially with 
transcription projects that we 

03:00:25.393 --> 03:00:28.828
love to collaborate with you on.
We are working with experts to 

03:00:29.099 --> 03:00:33.000
further our research to make 
sure that we are not wasting our

03:00:33.642 --> 03:00:37.233
 volunteers' precious time and 
we are open on mobile.  We are 

03:00:37.234 --> 03:00:43.784
open source.  Check us out on 
git hub.  We want you to help 

03:00:43.785 --> 03:00:46.831
you join us and find science 
that you thought was otherwise 

03:00:46.940 --> 03:00:52.024
impossible and won't make you 
jump in the antartic seas but 

03:00:52.387 --> 03:00:57.949
you may end up in there.  And on
 a final note, we are also 

03:00:58.242 --> 03:01:01.426
thrilled to announce two 
upcoming open calls for partners

03:01:01.750 --> 03:01:05.386
 with text or audio 
transcription projects, custom 

03:01:05.387 --> 03:01:09.343
tools or interfaces.  It's hard 
to express how excited we are 

03:01:09.344 --> 03:01:15.028
about this.  The open calls are 
made possible by the three-year 

03:01:15.158 --> 03:01:18.158
efforts to better support this 
community.  As part of this 

03:01:18.354 --> 03:01:21.430
effort, we will take the lessons
 learned through the new 

03:01:21.900 --> 03:01:25.241
custom-built projects to include
 the tools that we offer to all 

03:01:25.927 --> 03:01:28.410
through the project builder.  So
 thank you for your time today. 

03:01:43.297 --> 03:01:45.497
SPEAKER:  So we're going to have
 time for questions.  Liz and 

03:01:46.517 --> 03:01:49.831
Ricky, if you want to join us up
 here.  During this, we have 

03:01:50.203 --> 03:01:52.759
about 15 minutes or questions 
and if you have a question and 

03:01:52.760 --> 03:01:56.333
you're in the audience, raise 
your hand and we will have 

03:01:56.679 --> 03:01:58.679
volunteers with 

03:02:00.182 --> 03:02:03.582
mics that will find you.  I see 
we have one hand raised in the 

03:02:03.583 --> 03:02:05.608
back already.
Also on Twitter if you are 

03:02:06.883 --> 03:02:13.336
following along, you can tweet 
your questions using 

03:02:16.745 --> 03:02:20.715
##asdata.  
I'm going to mention this 

03:02:20.864 --> 03:02:23.910
quickly because we're going to 
for lunch right after.  

03:02:23.911 --> 03:02:26.524
We're going to break until 1:30 
after the question round and 

03:02:26.646 --> 03:02:30.429
just a reminder, if you leave 
the building, you have to pass 

03:02:30.558 --> 03:02:33.900
through security to get back in.
So come back.  Plan for that if 

03:02:34.154 --> 03:02:36.631
you leave the building.  If you 
don't want to leave the 

03:02:37.064 --> 03:02:41.696
building, you can go to our main
 cafeteria in the madison 

03:02:42.495 --> 03:02:46.753
building.  And if you meet by 
the information desk, a library 

03:02:47.106 --> 03:02:49.921
Congress staff will help you go 
through the tunnel, so just that

03:02:50.508 --> 03:02:53.634
 quick piece before we start.  
Do we have somebody with a 

03:02:54.096 --> 03:02:56.096
microphone in the back here? 

03:03:03.742 --> 03:03:05.742
 Do you want to start back here?

03:03:12.722 --> 03:03:17.099
Smithsonian library, the 
Smithsonian transcription center

03:03:17.272 --> 03:03:20.813
 and the national museum of 
African American history and 

03:03:20.994 --> 03:03:24.589
culture.  We launched recently a
 transcription project 

03:03:25.066 --> 03:03:28.332
transcribing the freeman's 
bureau records, the era of 

03:03:28.671 --> 03:03:32.520
federal documents and we 
launched it just a little over a

03:03:33.264 --> 03:03:36.535
 month ago and my question to 
the last speaker is what kind of

03:03:36.536 --> 03:03:41.175
 incentives do you offer to your
 volunteers to continue with the

03:03:41.328 --> 03:03:43.206
 process?  How do you deal with 
 with some of with some of the

03:03:43.207 --> 03:03:49.748
 difficulties or the challenges 
with the transcription?  What 

03:03:49.749 --> 03:03:55.893
kind of system do you have to 
keep them going?  

03:03:55.894 --> 03:04:00.292
SPEAKER:  So yeah, the 
transcription is challenging.  

03:04:00.459 --> 03:04:05.590
It's difficult to keep 
volunteers engaged.  We have 

03:04:05.926 --> 03:04:08.643
found that talk in the community
 that builds around these 

03:04:09.681 --> 03:04:12.103
projects is really the strongest
 way to keep people

03:04:17.743 --> 03:04:22.111
 engaged.  And not only helps 
people ask questions or get 

03:04:22.112 --> 03:04:25.391
through the difficult challenges
 that might be related to that 

03:04:25.392 --> 03:04:29.564
specific transcription project, 
but it also helps people explore

03:04:29.953 --> 03:04:33.120
 interesting ideas that they may
 have.  Usually people who are 

03:04:33.944 --> 03:04:36.112
getting involved in the 
transcription projects have the 

03:04:36.113 --> 03:04:38.113
interest in the material

03:04:39.745 --> 03:04:46.590
 of course and they may have, 
you know, they come to to it to 

03:04:37.033 --> 03:04:39.033
it with

03:04:42.619 --> 03:04:49.102
 interesting ideas or ways, 
perspectives and when you have 

03:04:49.782 --> 03:04:53.308
people sharing this together 
through our forum talk, it just 

03:04:53.672 --> 03:04:55.672
builds on

03:04:57.054 --> 03:05:01.222
 itself.  And that is what keeps
 people engaged I think to the 

03:05:01.223 --> 03:05:08.093
highest degree.  We don't have 
any other -- like occasionally 

03:05:08.094 --> 03:05:11.148
our research team might have 
like prizes or you know, give 

03:05:11.149 --> 03:05:16.934
aways and whatnot.  
But that is not really the core 

03:05:16.935 --> 03:05:18.935
of it.  I mean, in all

03:05:22.527 --> 03:05:26.405
 honesty, one of the things, 
people participate and continue 

03:05:26.406 --> 03:05:29.992
to participate because they want
 to further the purpose of the 

03:05:30.295 --> 03:05:35.352
project.  So our volunteers are 
primarily motivated.  And they 

03:05:35.353 --> 03:05:36.476
get kind get kind of get kind of
 hooked into

03:05:36.477 --> 03:05:41.303
 it.  And once they get a little
 practice transcribing,

03:05:44.410 --> 03:05:45.891
 they often continue to.  
SPEAKER:  

03:05:45.892 --> 03:05:47.892
SPEAKER:  Great,

03:05:49.311 --> 03:05:53.176
 we have another question here. 
 Yup.  Go ahead. 

03:05:53.177 --> 03:05:59.880
SPEAKER:  Hi, this question is 
question is also question is 

03:05:50.474 --> 03:05:52.474
also for the

03:05:55.467 --> 03:05:59.903
 last speaker.  For the tool 
that you mentioned and I am 

03:05:59.904 --> 03:06:05.064
actually really interested in 
your audio tool.  Are you 

03:06:05.601 --> 03:06:12.746
limited to what language you can
 apply this to?  Like if I have 

03:06:12.747 --> 03:06:16.275
a collection on straight check, 
would that work on that?  

03:06:20.861 --> 03:06:24.189
SPEAKER:  Well so, I have to 
check -- so I am kind of just 

03:06:24.665 --> 03:06:29.708
thinking out loud here.  We can 
 can build like a UI that can 

03:06:32.185 --> 03:06:35.056
subscript.  That would be a 
custom -- I'm not sure if we 

03:06:35.559 --> 03:06:41.503
currently have that capability 
but that is a potential project 

03:06:41.962 --> 03:06:46.659
that could be feasible and we 
have lots of plans including 

03:06:47.862 --> 03:06:51.376
internalization so if we were to
 incorporate that on like a 

03:06:51.659 --> 03:06:57.301
global site level, it might also
 complement a specific project 

03:06:57.302 --> 03:07:04.991
or collection and keep that in 
check.  Yeah.  So you know, I 

03:07:05.265 --> 03:07:07.265
don't think we --

03:07:08.753 --> 03:07:15.719
 well, support that today but 
the technological barriers don't

03:07:16.013 --> 03:07:18.948
 seem too large.  
It's the wonderful thing about 

03:07:19.174 --> 03:07:23.824
the recent funding, we can 
explore these types of 

03:07:24.223 --> 03:07:26.907
challenges much more easily now 
going forward.  So I have to 

03:07:27.941 --> 03:07:31.399
check to give you a specific 
direct answer of what we can do 

03:07:31.698 --> 03:07:38.593
today.  If we can't, we hope to 
in the future.  

03:07:38.594 --> 03:07:44.557
SPEAKER:  We have a couple of 
questions from you. you.  you.  

03:07:36.764 --> 03:07:38.764
SPEAKER: 

03:07:43.069 --> 03:07:48.291
 Hi.  I also am interested in 
the project of the last speaker 

03:07:48.292 --> 03:07:57.892
and I am coming at it from a 
peculiar angle, I 

03:07:58.676 --> 03:08:05.479
spent time as a volunteer as a 
senior living residence and 

03:08:05.734 --> 03:08:08.932
everybody is limited in what 
they can do.  And everything 

03:08:09.148 --> 03:08:10.796
successful in that environment 
until now, has been seniors 

03:08:10.797 --> 03:08:12.797
seniors  seniors doing

03:08:13.081 --> 03:08:17.076
 English language teaching using
 Skype with students from around

03:08:17.077 --> 03:08:19.077
 the world.  And that is super 
successful and and I

03:08:19.735 --> 03:08:22.457
 can imagine some version of 
this can apply in that 

03:08:22.458 --> 03:08:26.510
environment as well.  I am just 
thinking, is there a possibility

03:08:26.831 --> 03:08:28.415
 that there  would be

03:08:28.416 --> 03:08:35.261
 let's say a simpler interface 
overlaid on what you have now, 

03:08:35.262 --> 03:08:40.225
so that people have a lot of 
time on their hands but limited 

03:08:40.226 --> 03:08:44.639
abilities could be effective and
 useful and have some productive

03:08:45.167 --> 03:08:49.484
 activity in their own life. 
SPEAKER:  Yeah.  Absolutely.  

03:08:51.227 --> 03:08:54.705
The projects really run, there 
is a wide range of difficulty in

03:08:55.152 --> 03:08:57.852
 the projects.  Some are out 
there right now and I guess I 

03:08:58.491 --> 03:09:06.563
should be embarrassedshould be 
embarrassed toshould be 

03:08:54.085 --> 03:08:56.085
embarrassed to admit this

03:08:59.331 --> 03:09:05.878
 but I am not.  My favorite is 
the penguin lodge and Snapchat 

03:09:05.879 --> 03:09:13.184
which are very approachable and 
while some certainly are more 

03:09:13.185 --> 03:09:18.878
complicated like some of the 
astronomy and transcription 

03:09:19.274 --> 03:09:23.510
projects, there are some that I 
think wouldn't be very 

03:09:23.511 --> 03:09:25.511
accessible to like the people 
that you are

03:09:29.367 --> 03:09:33.510
 working with.  And sometimes we
 will, you know, we do a lot of 

03:09:33.759 --> 03:09:36.189
educational outreach too, so we

03:09:39.636 --> 03:09:44.503
 do try to consider making the 
project successful to as many 

03:09:44.504 --> 03:09:53.145
people as we can.  That is an 
interesting area.  I'm not sure 

03:09:53.146 --> 03:09:57.122
if we fully considered it.  But 
I think right now, there would 

03:09:57.249 --> 03:09:59.249
actually be some projects

03:10:01.982 --> 03:10:04.380
 that might apply.  
SPEAKER:  You have a question 

03:10:04.782 --> 03:10:11.222
here?  Here we go.  
SPEAKER:  Hi.  I work for data 

03:10:11.587 --> 03:10:24.519
storage company, and often we we
  we think about how you're 

03:10:02.655 --> 03:10:04.655
going

03:10:16.058 --> 03:10:19.761
 to store all of this stuff.  So
 all of you store mountains of 

03:10:20.148 --> 03:10:21.936
data. 
Right.  You are working with 

03:10:21.937 --> 03:10:25.848
that all of the time.  So my 
question would be, how do you 

03:10:26.101 --> 03:10:30.910
possibly store all of that, and 
then how long do you store it?  

03:10:31.829 --> 03:10:38.319
And then how is it similar or 
different for each of you 

03:10:38.320 --> 03:10:40.320
because you have such

03:10:43.267 --> 03:10:52.257
 different projects?  
SPEAKER:  So for our project, at

03:10:52.931 --> 03:10:55.534
 this point, we have a 
manageable amount of data 

03:10:55.535 --> 03:11:01.028
because we are maintaining the 
images after we have processed 

03:11:01.302 --> 03:11:09.249
them.  And then the features 
data set.  I am not in a 

03:11:09.250 --> 03:11:16.845
institution that has a data re
repostory and the expectation of

03:11:18.831 --> 03:11:21.540
 the institution will be the 
place that manages that data and

03:11:22.573 --> 03:11:22.852
 we work with deepen, as one 
example.  So we will we will 

03:11:22.853 --> 03:11:24.853
have we will have to see. 

03:11:28.085 --> 03:11:32.910
 We are -- our needs are not 
necessarily for, it's not 

03:11:33.209 --> 03:11:35.948
preservation forever.  We are 
looking at managing the data for

03:11:37.367 --> 03:11:41.785
 reproducibility for X number of
 years and I think I think at 

03:11:37.082 --> 03:11:39.082
this point I think at this point
 it's

03:11:41.560 --> 03:11:45.094
 five years.  So since we are 
not the collectors of the 

03:11:45.836 --> 03:11:48.626
original images and we don't 
need to maintain the digital 

03:11:49.010 --> 03:11:52.933
images.  It's not to say that we
 may not run into some 

03:11:52.934 --> 03:11:55.551
challenges but I feel like 
institutionally we are in a 

03:11:55.552 --> 03:11:57.552
pretty

03:12:01.999 --> 03:12:05.929
 good place for that.  
SPEAKER:  Well I do have copies 

03:12:06.163 --> 03:12:11.458
of some of what I study and I 
believe to keep stuff safe.  So 

03:12:11.836 --> 03:12:13.836
I put them in multiple hard

03:12:15.976 --> 03:12:22.717
 drives and I also have copies 
that you know, I use for basic

03:12:26.071 --> 03:12:29.124
 processing and work so I have 
digital pile with a better 

03:12:29.687 --> 03:12:34.291
resolution and more preservation
 copy.  So I teach introductions

03:12:35.691 --> 03:12:37.691
 to visual 

03:12:42.383 --> 03:12:46.263
digitization and I follow the 
model of what I teach.  But I'm 

03:12:46.264 --> 03:12:49.638
not -- I definitely don't have 
collections of the level of 

03:12:51.312 --> 03:12:56.629
repository that would make, you 
know, large corporal materials 

03:12:58.623 --> 03:13:01.243
such a daunting task.  
SPEAKER:  We actually also -- 

03:13:01.445 --> 03:13:05.723
we're not necessarily 
responsible for maintain the 

03:13:06.577 --> 03:13:12.341
images or the collections over 
time, some are going to create a

03:13:12.342 --> 03:13:17.087
 project, they are the ones that
 are responsible over the long 

03:13:18.305 --> 03:13:24.823
term.  Maintaining and 
organizing those images.  But 

03:13:24.824 --> 03:13:30.725
just from like a technical 
standpoint, UWS, the sources 

03:13:30.927 --> 03:13:33.353
that host a lot of our 
information.  I guess we are in 

03:13:34.851 --> 03:13:43.312
the clouds for the most part.  
And actually I'm a developer.  

03:13:44.559 --> 03:13:50.301
And in terms of the entire back 
end picture, I think, yeah, 

03:13:50.507 --> 03:13:52.040
essentially it sounds sounds 
like sounds like we are

03:13:52.041 --> 03:13:58.189
 all kind of somewhat similar.  
SPEAKER:  Okay I think we have 

03:13:58.532 --> 03:14:01.272
time for one more question.  
Here in the back.  

03:14:01.273 --> 03:14:04.024
SPEAKER:  This question is for 
Ricky.

03:14:07.169 --> 03:14:13.093
He was intrigued by your grid to
 show the reunification.  I 

03:14:13.471 --> 03:14:19.117
wonder if these have been used 
for indigineous collections or 

03:14:19.297 --> 03:14:21.297
is it typically for 

03:14:23.842 --> 03:14:28.829
anthropological field work?  
SPEAKER:  So the model that I 

03:14:31.518 --> 03:14:35.358
did was primarily to explain the
 complexity of virtual 

03:14:35.586 --> 03:14:39.592
unifications mainly for people 
who are in charge of 

03:14:39.907 --> 03:14:45.691
collections.  And because I do 
tell them that, you  you know, 

03:14:38.256 --> 03:14:40.256
you know, if you are trying to 
capture the

03:14:45.517 --> 03:14:47.517
 whole, you need to have to have
 some

03:14:50.269 --> 03:14:52.269
 --

03:14:53.402 --> 03:14:54.896
 at this point I don't think 
it's possible.  You know, 

03:14:54.897 --> 03:14:58.650
consider this as a way to 
analyze the problem for 

03:14:59.736 --> 03:15:03.565
yourself.  And you know, create 
a representation that would 

03:15:03.566 --> 03:15:09.126
somewhat allow the 
representation and different 

03:15:10.108 --> 03:15:12.108
aspects of

03:15:13.352 --> 03:15:17.204
 dispersing.
This is mainly for the graphics 

03:15:17.751 --> 03:15:21.073
collection that I studied but I 
do think that other types of 

03:15:21.417 --> 03:15:27.105
collection could use this model 
as well.  For native American or

03:15:30.273 --> 03:15:34.718
 indigineous communities, I am 
starting a project that was 

03:15:35.021 --> 03:15:38.741
recently funded by IMLS called 
evaluating our stance.  And this

03:15:39.150 --> 03:15:43.312
 goes to our communities.  
Looking at the impact of 

03:15:44.280 --> 03:15:48.024
digitized collections once they 
are downloaded because we are 

03:15:48.542 --> 03:15:52.922
quite good at doing research on 
like how do we discover ability,

03:15:53.098 --> 03:15:56.233
 you know, when you search for 
something, how quickly can you 

03:15:56.608 --> 03:15:59.583
get something that you are 
looking for.  What happens once 

03:15:59.584 --> 03:16:04.767
the image is taken by a person 
into their home.  What happens? 

03:16:04.768 --> 03:16:07.753
Do they keep it?  Do they use it
 for something else?  What is 

03:16:07.754 --> 03:16:13.772
the impact of it?  So I am 
taking that model more to inform

03:16:14.255 --> 03:16:20.877
 my research on that project.  
So yeah, this is an ongoing 

03:16:21.243 --> 03:16:25.319
conversation, if I would put it 
that way.  So you know, I am 

03:16:25.806 --> 03:16:27.806
definitely learning a lot as I I
  I move

03:16:29.218 --> 03:16:35.364
 on.   
SPEAKER:   

03:16:24.272 --> 03:16:26.272
SPEAKER:  Okay.  Thank 

03:16:30.115 --> 03:16:35.515
you.  So we will have to break 
here for lunch.  Again, be back 

03:16:35.516 --> 03:16:39.601
here at 1:30 and leave time for 
security.  Thank you.  

04:18:57.166 --> 04:18:59.166
This is a test. 

04:38:28.409 --> 04:38:29.609
This is a test. 
. 

04:38:28.409 --> 04:38:30.409
is a test.  This is a test 
SPEAKER:  Hi everybody.  

04:38:42.065 --> 04:38:43.265
This is a test. 
. 

04:38:42.065 --> 04:38:44.065
is a test.  This is a test 
SPEAKER:  Hi everybody.  Hello. 

04:38:56.205 --> 04:38:58.205
Hi

04:39:10.470 --> 04:39:58.048
 everybody.  Welcome back from 
lunch.  Thank you so much for 

04:38:26.958 --> 04:38:29.845
coming back.  I was a little bit
 worried.  And so we are having 

04:38:29.846 --> 04:38:31.846
are having a are having a little

04:38:32.396 --> 04:38:35.907
 bit of trouble with the closed 
captioning here.  We're going to

04:38:35.908 --> 04:38:41.432
 have a chat for a little bit so
 you don't leave and lose 

04:38:41.715 --> 04:38:43.673
interest.  Those of you you who

04:38:43.674 --> 04:38:52.257
 are live streaming, join with 
the hash tag as data.  I was 

04:38:52.258 --> 04:38:55.234
looking at the registered list 
and all of the people that are 

04:38:55.735 --> 04:39:01.700
here.  Would you please raise 
your hand if you're from a 

04:39:01.701 --> 04:39:03.566
library please?  Could you raise
 your hand hand if hand if you

04:39:03.567 --> 04:39:07.816
 are from an archive?  Could you
 raise your hand if you are from

04:39:08.937 --> 04:39:12.729
 a media organization?  Awesome.

04:39:12.730 --> 04:39:17.581
Awesome.  One moment here.  
University.  Museum, museum, 

04:39:18.121 --> 04:39:22.409
obviously museum.  Hello.  Thank
 you for coming.  University and

04:39:22.790 --> 04:39:24.780
 not a library.  Good good good.

04:39:24.781 --> 04:39:26.429
What else?  Like you are here by
 yourself because you are just  

04:39:26.430 --> 04:39:28.430
wanting to wanting to make 
friends and be

04:39:31.845 --> 04:39:38.760
 cool.  Oh, federal agency.  Oh,
 yay.  Thank you for coming.  

04:39:38.761 --> 04:39:40.761
Our friends and brothers and

04:39:43.472 --> 04:39:47.450
 sisters.  Sorry.  So what else 
can we talk about right now? 

04:39:59.093 --> 04:40:02.311
like jokes.  Does anybody have 
any questions?  We can take some

04:40:02.583 --> 04:40:08.947
 questions if you can yell loud 
enough.  Someone up there have

04:40:15.399 --> 04:40:22.724
 a question.  Hello.  Oh, we 
have a system, we have lots of 

04:40:22.725 --> 04:40:29.119
folks in the audience and maybe 
if anybody wants to jump jump up

04:40:20.597 --> 04:40:22.597
 jump up and

04:40:26.896 --> 04:40:30.775
 answer on my behalf.  I don't 
work for OCIL but from my 

04:40:31.264 --> 04:40:35.705
memory, we are used a tiered 
source system and then we have 

04:40:36.035 --> 04:40:38.035
mere line storage

04:40:40.955 --> 04:40:42.955
 for our access

04:40:46.690 --> 04:40:53.254
 system.  Anyone else?  How we 
looking?  We getting there.  

04:40:53.255 --> 04:40:55.255
Okay.  Why was Why was six

04:40:57.918 --> 04:41:05.102
 afraid of nine?  Thank you.  
Why was six afraid of seven?  

04:41:05.103 --> 04:41:12.302
Because seven ate nine.  
Delivery.  I don't know.  One of

04:41:12.303 --> 04:41:17.112
 the things -- when you saw my 
presentation earlier, it showed 

04:41:17.113 --> 04:41:18.456
a a picture a picture of the 
stacks

04:41:18.457 --> 04:41:21.781
 in the Jefferson building, and 
one of the things that was 

04:41:21.782 --> 04:41:29.922
really interesting about the 
building building here building 

04:41:17.708 --> 04:41:19.708
here was

04:41:23.652 --> 04:41:24.846
 that the

04:41:24.847 --> 04:41:28.109
 stacks are actually 
foundational support so you 

04:41:28.431 --> 04:41:30.716
couldn't remove the stacks and 
the shelves from the Library of 

04:41:31.198 --> 04:41:34.829
Congress without it collapsing, 
which I think is kind of a 

04:41:35.018 --> 04:41:39.357
beautiful beautiful metaphor.  
As Thomas Jefferson said, I 

04:41:40.753 --> 04:41:43.777
cannot live without books.  He 
was not very well

04:41:49.956 --> 04:41:51.956
 liked by some people.  
[Laughter]

04:42:00.896 --> 04:42:06.548
 great question.  My friend Leah
 from Neh first asked how I 

04:42:06.549 --> 04:42:08.549
first heard about 

04:42:10.766 --> 04:42:15.851
Henryiette Avram.  A friend of 
mine introduced her to me, he is

04:42:16.035 --> 04:42:19.309
 a software developer and really
 awesome.  Any other questions? 

04:42:19.536 --> 04:42:23.251
 You people are leaving me 
hanging.  I don't mean to blame 

04:42:23.383 --> 04:42:25.383
you.  Justin 

04:42:27.620 --> 04:42:29.620
Whitman,

04:42:31.080 --> 04:42:34.363
 hi Justin.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  

04:42:34.547 --> 04:42:38.062
SPEAKER:  It's hard for me to 
give the entire perspective of 

04:42:38.254 --> 04:42:44.035
the inside.  I am thrilled.  She
 is a huge inspiration and I 

04:42:44.036 --> 04:42:52.389
will say that when we did a 
welcome  video and video and a 

04:42:39.616 --> 04:42:41.616
welcome photograph,

04:42:47.935 --> 04:42:48.396
 manymany of

04:42:48.397 --> 04:42:54.196
 you may have seen it on the 
Facebook page.  A huge generous 

04:42:54.197 --> 04:42:57.897
applause getting ready for her 
arrival really spoke volumes to 

04:42:57.898 --> 04:43:00.581
me about how excited the people 
were.  We couldn't

04:43:07.782 --> 04:43:14.726
 be as happier.  A question from
 Twitter?  

04:43:14.727 --> 04:43:17.542
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  
SPEAKER:  It's not very 

04:43:20.690 --> 04:43:25.523
good.  
[Laughter].  Not very good.  

04:43:25.748 --> 04:43:32.914
Yeah.  Yup.  The question was 
great.  The stand up comedy 

04:43:33.247 --> 04:43:35.899
routine.  I think it's very 
well-known -- so the question is

04:43:35.900 --> 04:43:53.302
 how do do I do I feel about 
meta data?  

04:43:21.231 --> 04:43:23.231
The

04:43:38.203 --> 04:43:40.203
 history of meta data data has

04:43:40.518 --> 04:43:44.216
 been studied for many many 
years and I think that we have 

04:43:44.217 --> 04:43:49.656
come to the conclusion, after 
years of intense investigation, 

04:43:49.657 --> 04:43:53.389
that meta data meta data rocks. 
 Thank you.  [Cheers and 

04:43:53.390 --> 04:43:55.390
applause]. 

04:44:13.921 --> 04:44:23.735
SPEAKER:  Well how many 
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  

04:44:07.840 --> 04:44:16.471
SPEAKER:  Well how many jokes do
 I get from from late from late 

04:44:03.475 --> 04:44:05.475
fees and

04:44:10.031 --> 04:44:12.719
 returning library book.  As far
 as I know we don't have late 

04:44:13.065 --> 04:44:17.297
fees, am I right?  They cut off 
the account.  Yup.  But anybody 

04:44:17.579 --> 04:44:19.579
over the age of 16 16 is 16 is 
welcome to come here

04:44:20.561 --> 04:44:22.561
 and get a reader's 

04:44:25.929 --> 04:44:28.682
card.  So please do.  I would 
also like to mention that we 

04:44:28.853 --> 04:44:30.663
have a couple of jobs posted if 
you check the jobs page at the 

04:44:30.664 --> 04:44:32.664
at the  at the Library of 

04:44:33.635 --> 04:44:38.839
Congress.  Might as well well 
squeeze every drop of juice out 

04:44:38.840 --> 04:44:40.823
of the orange. orange.  If
orange.  If you go

04:44:40.824 --> 04:44:43.503
 to the jobs page at the Library
 of Congress, one of the 

04:44:44.318 --> 04:44:46.828
exciting new jobs is the chief 
of digital collection and 

04:44:47.220 --> 04:44:49.810
management services which is 
posted right now.  And I think 

04:44:50.491 --> 04:44:52.761
that will shape the digital 
future of the Library of 

04:44:52.988 --> 04:44:55.289
Congress, so please apply for 
that.  Anybody else have jobs 

04:44:57.081 --> 04:44:59.499
that they are advertising for?  

04:45:07.286 --> 04:45:10.809
No other questions.  So thanks 
to the office of equal 

04:45:12.145 --> 04:45:14.818
opportunity and diversity 
program, we have live streaming.

04:45:15.033 --> 04:45:19.051
I believe someone is on the 
phone listening and live typing 

04:45:19.257 --> 04:45:22.975
what is going on.  And we also 
have our awesome interpreters 

04:45:23.444 --> 04:45:25.444
live here.  [Cheers and 

04:46:19.106 --> 04:46:40.777
applause].  Oh, my gosh, we have
 a question from the

04:46:00.901 --> 04:46:06.500
 front here. 
Do we have any pirate shanty in 

04:46:07.080 --> 04:46:14.983
the collection?  Yes, we do, in 
fact, Nikki Saylor right here.  

04:46:16.141 --> 04:46:22.774
You can Google and find pirate 
shanty.  

04:46:22.775 --> 04:46:24.360
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  
SPEAKER:  Another great 

04:46:24.361 --> 04:46:27.889
question.  There are also pirate
 maps.  If the geography and 

04:46:27.890 --> 04:46:29.296
maps collection, if you get get 
a get a point

04:46:29.297 --> 04:46:35.508
 to head down there, which I 
really recommend, lots lots of 

04:46:27.086 --> 04:46:29.086
lots of good

04:46:32.671 --> 04:46:38.406
 stuff.  They have a whole 
section in the collection full 

04:46:38.641 --> 04:46:43.657
of maps of fantasy places, maps 
of places that don't exist in 

04:46:43.950 --> 04:46:52.813
the real world like riverdale 
and Lord of the Rings places, 

04:46:53.016 --> 04:46:56.168
it's really neat.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  

04:46:56.333 --> 04:47:00.749
SPEAKER:  I would like to repeat
 that joke.  From Dan Chedna 

04:47:00.750 --> 04:47:04.514
from the audience, he says if 
you would like to process pirate

04:47:04.515 --> 04:47:05.665
 maps as  data,

04:47:05.666 --> 04:47:09.561
 do you know what programming 
language is used?  

04:47:09.562 --> 04:47:11.708
Arrrrr.  [Laughter]

04:47:32.273 --> 04:47:34.273
.  I have a .  I have a 
rebuttal.  A pirate's favorite 

04:47:38.068 --> 04:47:39.282
love is the sea.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  

04:47:39.283 --> 04:47:41.278
SPEAKER:  Oh, good question.  I 
would like to repeat the 

04:47:41.279 --> 04:47:45.559
question.  The question is where
 are we on the schedule?  And we

04:47:47.107 --> 04:47:52.824
 are on "after lunch".  The next
 step is concerns for data 

04:47:53.195 --> 04:47:55.731
scholarship but we are right now
 working to get the closed 

04:47:56.154 --> 04:47:58.627
captioning working so we are on 
pause on the schedule.  It 

04:47:58.862 --> 04:48:01.202
doesn't say it there, pause, 
because we just invented

04:48:11.038 --> 04:48:16.168
 it.  
Asks what are the concerns for 

04:48:16.563 --> 04:48:19.170
data scholarship and I would 
like to tell you that I don't 

04:48:19.357 --> 04:48:24.259
have have concern for spoilers. 
I don't want to ruin everyone's 

04:48:24.260 --> 04:48:25.307
good ideas good ideas by

04:48:25.308 --> 04:48:27.308
 good ideas by telling

04:48:29.449 --> 04:48:31.449
 you

04:48:38.450 --> 04:48:40.450
now. 

04:48:56.732 --> 04:49:14.635
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  
SPEAKER:  Oh, that's great.  

04:48:42.895 --> 04:48:48.446
Thank you.  One of our 
colleagues mentioned that if you

04:48:49.079 --> 04:48:53.389
 are interested in the maps, I 
am way more interested in the 

04:48:53.550 --> 04:48:58.521
fantasy than the real world, we 
have the several division blogs.

04:48:59.506 --> 04:49:04.594
You can go on blogs -- if you go
 to blogs.LLC.GOV, you can find 

04:49:05.023 --> 04:49:10.244
it there and they did a series 
over the summer for blogs from 

04:49:11.838 --> 04:49:13.838
imaginary 

04:49:15.758 --> 04:49:17.825
locations.  Yes?  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  

04:49:17.826 --> 04:49:21.376
SPEAKER:  Another colleague from
 the Library of Congress says 

04:49:21.815 --> 04:49:24.048
related there is an exhibit on 
literary maps.  If you go

04:49:31.667 --> 04:49:33.667
 to the exhibits exhibits  
exhibits page.  Any

04:49:34.774 --> 04:49:39.325
 other treasures that anybody 
wants to highlight.  There is a 

04:49:39.326 --> 04:49:41.326
lot. 

04:49:52.271 --> 04:49:54.271
Yeah?  

04:49:56.425 --> 04:49:59.475
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  
SPEAKER:  Yeah, so please 

04:49:59.720 --> 04:50:07.512
interrupt me Deb or Leah if you 
would like, but we have many 

04:50:08.804 --> 04:50:10.696
non-English language newspapers.
We do not have Russian 

04:50:10.697 --> 04:50:12.697
currently, but it's

04:50:13.890 --> 04:50:18.983
 eligible for selection.  We 
have thousand of pages in six 

04:50:18.984 --> 04:50:20.984
different languages currently, 
and that is

04:50:23.087 --> 04:50:24.625
 a fact that I knew. knew.  
knew.  Deb did

04:50:24.626 --> 04:50:26.051
 not have to tell me.  I am 
given the signal that we are are

04:50:26.052 --> 04:50:28.052
 okay are okay to start.  Thank 
you for

04:50:32.041 --> 04:50:39.418
 indulging me while we got ready
 with the live captioning.  We 

04:50:39.419 --> 04:50:43.150
will begin again.  So before we 
begin, I just wanted to mention 

04:50:43.151 --> 04:50:46.812
another resource that is 
available for researchers 

04:50:46.813 --> 04:50:51.537
working with collections and 
data.  You heard a lot about 

04:50:51.538 --> 04:50:58.682
chronicling America which is 
part to make available newspaper

04:50:58.683 --> 04:51:03.693
 pages.  We have WDL, the world 
digital library which is between

04:51:03.818 --> 04:51:06.802
 the Library of Congress and 
hundreds of partners throughout 

04:51:06.803 --> 04:51:10.456
the world to highlight a place, 
the gems of their collection and

04:51:12.786 --> 04:51:20.473
 what is exciting is all of the 
meta data is 

04:51:25.399 --> 04:51:29.803
API.WDL.org.  If you are 
interested here we are very much

04:51:29.929 --> 04:51:32.738
 available to you.  The 
developers are very much 

04:51:32.890 --> 04:51:34.890
available to you if

04:51:39.818 --> 04:51:44.480
 you have questions about it.  
Let's begin.  The second half of

04:51:44.481 --> 04:51:48.935
 the symposium is to talk about 
protecting data and privacy and 

04:51:49.336 --> 04:51:54.884
honoring copy rights very 
seriously and the commits can 

04:51:55.042 --> 04:51:57.169
have down stream especially with
 access to collection data at 

04:51:57.365 --> 04:51:59.365
scale.  We are excited to

04:52:01.235 --> 04:52:07.865
 bring you a group of speakers 
who will talk about the tools.  

04:52:07.866 --> 04:52:16.820
First we have Bergis Juleshave 
Bergis Jules who ishave Bergis 

04:52:03.045 --> 04:52:05.045
Jules who is going

04:52:08.986 --> 04:52:13.485
 to be talking about the 
community and developmental 

04:52:13.634 --> 04:52:19.758
collection for the media 
content.  Bergis is at the 

04:52:20.048 --> 04:52:26.037
university of California river 
side library, the community own 

04:52:29.011 --> 04:52:31.011
consortium at the university of 
California.  Previously

04:52:34.016 --> 04:52:36.016
 designed

04:52:37.070 --> 04:52:39.070
 the 

04:52:41.494 --> 04:52:44.038
DC African center.  And then we 
have Nicole Saylor

04:52:50.200 --> 04:52:53.011
 documenting folks culture 
around the world.  Collections 

04:52:53.012 --> 04:52:55.012
range from the earliest 
recordings of

04:52:59.447 --> 04:53:06.288
 1890s out of a wax cylinder and
 the nation's oldest and largest

04:53:06.544 --> 04:53:11.108
 documentation including 
stories, and other creative 

04:53:11.109 --> 04:53:17.004
expressions from people in the 
student.  

04:53:17.005 --> 04:53:19.005
Today will discuss

04:53:20.804 --> 04:53:22.804
 engaging

04:53:25.768 --> 04:53:31.481
 with communities and API driven
 accessioning of digital folk 

04:53:31.819 --> 04:53:34.481
life.  Then we have

04:53:37.543 --> 04:53:45.270
 Maciej and he is here today 
because he writes so warmly 

04:53:45.271 --> 04:53:48.870
about his love and keeping it a 
place with connection of 

04:53:49.342 --> 04:53:52.114
knowledge.  He said quote the 
web we have right now is 

04:53:52.115 --> 04:53:56.245
beautiful, it shatters the 
tyrany of distance and gives you

04:53:56.823 --> 04:54:00.422
 a way to bear witness to people
 half away around the world.  We

04:54:00.699 --> 04:54:04.675
 built it by accident.
Yet we are already taking it for

04:54:04.676 --> 04:54:10.430
 granted.  We should fight to 
keep it , end quote.  I think

04:54:13.797 --> 04:54:18.977
  some of the ideas will open 
today's topic.  It's my pleasure

04:54:19.177 --> 04:54:21.177
 to welcome Bergis to the 

04:54:30.509 --> 04:54:31.234
stand. 
[Applause].  

04:54:31.235 --> 04:54:38.601
SPEAKER:  Okay.  Thank youOkay. 
 Thank you forOkay.  Thank you 

04:54:28.069 --> 04:54:30.069
for having

04:54:33.062 --> 04:54:37.136
 me.  Right after lunch people 
are energized and now I'm going 

04:54:37.137 --> 04:54:40.799
to talk you about my concerns 
about collecting social media 

04:54:40.800 --> 04:54:44.848
data.  I am excited that this 
session is part of the program 

04:54:45.336 --> 04:54:47.599
today, because we don't do 
enough thinking around, you 

04:54:47.795 --> 04:54:51.486
know, the ethics of doing this 
stuff.  And how to protect 

04:54:52.013 --> 04:54:55.212
people, so I am really glad to 
see this panel is part of the 

04:54:55.417 --> 04:54:57.417
program and I am glad to be

04:55:01.179 --> 04:55:09.415
 part of it.  So all right.  So 
at a basic level, documenting 

04:55:09.416 --> 04:55:13.741
the new is a project to build 
free and open-source tools that 

04:55:13.742 --> 04:55:17.351
are easy to use for collecting, 
analyzing and sharing Twitter 

04:55:17.499 --> 04:55:23.803
data.  It's a collaborative 
project between UC river side 

04:55:23.804 --> 04:55:27.835
and the Maryland institute for 
humanities at the university of 

04:55:27.836 --> 04:55:30.490
Maryland and Washington 
University in St. 

04:55:30.491 --> 04:55:34.008
Louis.  The doc now team, the 
development team has been hard 

04:55:34.479 --> 04:55:37.260
at work over the past ten 
months, you know, really trying 

04:55:37.745 --> 04:55:38.461
to build something great great 
that great that everyone

04:55:38.462 --> 04:55:41.796
 will be able to use and I am 
really excited for what is to 

04:55:41.797 --> 04:55:45.294
come but today I'm going to 
focus less on the technical 

04:55:45.570 --> 04:55:49.298
parts of our work.  What has 
been really exciting -- what has

04:55:49.299 --> 04:55:53.352
 been the most exciting part of 
the project in my opinion is how

04:55:53.521 --> 04:55:57.748
 much people from all kinds of 
backgrounds have engaged in some

04:55:57.983 --> 04:56:02.149
 of the ideas that we have been 
addressing and I think those 

04:56:02.467 --> 04:56:07.178
ideas can help us address some 
of the more serious implication 

04:56:07.360 --> 04:56:09.360
of data especially as they 
relate to

04:56:12.562 --> 04:56:17.569
 social media data.  So because 
our work was inspired by the 

04:56:17.570 --> 04:56:21.244
activism and protest that 
followed the police killing of 

04:56:21.840 --> 04:56:29.973
Michael Brown in Ferguson 
Missouri in 2015, we had the 

04:56:30.118 --> 04:56:34.089
responsibility really not to 
forget that there are in fact 

04:56:34.272 --> 04:56:39.582
people behind all of this data. 
This is why doc now has such a 

04:56:40.766 --> 04:56:45.044
focus on ethics for long term 
conservation.  We are really 

04:56:45.204 --> 04:56:49.523
interested in how our building 
of these collections might 

04:56:49.935 --> 04:56:53.471
affect peoples' lives.  It's 
also why we are being really 

04:56:53.889 --> 04:56:55.759
transparent with our work, at 
the same time trying to help 

04:56:55.760 --> 04:57:01.327
build a community of people who 
also value these ideas.  So 

04:57:01.669 --> 04:57:05.487
really, you know at the higher 
level, doc now is about a couple

04:57:05.488 --> 04:57:09.048
 of things in my mind.  It's 
about valuing people enough to 

04:57:09.049 --> 04:57:13.576
care about how we collect and 
store their data and helping to 

04:57:14.227 --> 04:57:18.862
build a community of archive 
professionals engaging with 

04:57:19.628 --> 04:57:23.004
content owners in equitable and 
safe ways to use their data.  

04:57:23.430 --> 04:57:27.741
These two things are priorities 
above our technical work on the 

04:57:27.742 --> 04:57:32.508
project and a lot of credit 
really has to go to Ed Summers 

04:57:32.659 --> 04:57:35.163
for the project being framed 
this way.  Ed has been my 

04:57:35.298 --> 04:57:38.147
partner in crime over the past 
couple of years doing this work.

04:57:38.148 --> 04:57:45.637
And he is also a principal 
investigator on the doc now 

04:57:45.892 --> 04:57:49.496
project.  So we all agree that 
there is an immense value in 

04:57:49.829 --> 04:57:55.201
social media data.  Especially 
as it relates to our work and 

04:57:56.309 --> 04:57:58.548
archives on libraries.  I am 
primarily interested in 

04:57:58.696 --> 04:58:01.535
collecting that type of data, 
especially Twitter because I 

04:58:03.204 --> 04:58:06.014
think it presents tremendous 
opportunities to present some 

04:58:06.163 --> 04:58:08.781
aspects of African American 
history and culture.  For 

04:58:11.241 --> 04:58:13.993
example, this is a few -- this 
is a graph from the research 

04:58:14.635 --> 04:58:17.245
that talked about how young 
African Americans are the 

04:58:17.796 --> 04:58:21.299
highest users -- among the 
highest users of Twitter 

04:58:21.300 --> 04:58:24.649
especially, right.  So a large 
number of African Americans are 

04:58:25.720 --> 04:58:28.445
found in states where they feel 
free to share and engage in 

04:58:28.746 --> 04:58:31.033
issues that matter to them, 
especially considering how 

04:58:32.151 --> 04:58:34.151
little information we hold in 
our traditional collections 

04:58:34.446 --> 04:58:36.685
about African Americans, you 
know, I think this is a good 

04:58:37.087 --> 04:58:39.265
opportunity to at least learn 
about some of those issues, if

04:58:45.652 --> 04:58:49.726
 not collect data about them.  
So we have also seen the value

04:58:53.338 --> 04:58:58.112
 that platforms such as Twitter 
had in amplifying voices like 

04:58:58.113 --> 04:59:01.680
the movement for black lives and
 Howard spring and several other

04:59:01.866 --> 04:59:09.715
 social justice events that have
 played online.  This is a 

04:59:09.716 --> 04:59:17.455
screen shot from the shot from 
the brilliant shot from the 

04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:07.910
brilliant work

04:59:10.270 --> 04:59:12.270
 of

04:59:16.026 --> 04:59:19.786
 Freemomt, Macleson and Wayne.  
I highly suggest you check it 

04:59:19.787 --> 04:59:23.780
out if you get a chance.  It's a
 90 something page report that 

04:59:23.781 --> 04:59:27.446
the impact that Twitter and 
other social media had on 

04:59:27.447 --> 04:59:32.001
spreading the message in 
Ferguson.  All of this is good, 

04:59:32.002 --> 04:59:37.059
but we should also acknowledge 
the significant responsibility 

04:59:37.060 --> 04:59:41.481
and embrace the data that makes 
that accessible and we should be

04:59:41.973 --> 04:59:42.423
 prepared to do prepared to do  
prepared to do this work

04:59:42.424 --> 04:59:48.011
 in ways that don't compromise 
people's safety or presents 

04:59:48.012 --> 04:59:50.300
their data in ways that distorts

04:59:56.040 --> 04:59:59.847
 the original intent.  
Because we know we are not the 

04:59:59.987 --> 05:00:02.478
only ones interested in 
collecting this kind of data, 

05:00:02.479 --> 05:00:07.071
right, so this is a screen shot 
from a -- this is a screen shot 

05:00:07.072 --> 05:00:09.142
of an e-mail from the ACLU 
California last week published 

05:00:09.143 --> 05:00:11.143
published a published a report 
about the growing use of 

05:00:16.167 --> 05:00:19.800
social media collection tools 
via law enforcement, especially 

05:00:20.015 --> 05:00:22.969
local law enforcement and were 
able to get their hands on a lot

05:00:23.325 --> 05:00:26.839
 of documents for this, and this
 is a screen shot from an e-mail

05:00:26.840 --> 05:00:31.196
 that a company, GOpedia which 
is really popular in the states 

05:00:31.325 --> 05:00:37.090
right now, is sending out to its
 clients about Ferguson.  Saying

05:00:37.222 --> 05:00:42.346
 hey, we have a lot of good 
stuff on the Ferguson protesters

05:00:43.129 --> 05:00:45.129
 here.
Click here to view the 

05:00:45.194 --> 05:00:49.815
collection.  And you know, here 
I think the ACLU articulates 

05:00:50.215 --> 05:00:53.168
really well the danger to people
 of color and other minority 

05:00:53.169 --> 05:00:56.440
groups when police start using 
these kinds of tools, right and 

05:00:57.229 --> 05:01:00.033
for those in the back, I will go
 ahead and read this.  The 

05:01:00.034 --> 05:01:03.599
racist implications of social 
media surveillance technology 

05:01:03.600 --> 05:01:07.549
are not surprising.  We know 
that when law enforcement gets 

05:01:07.550 --> 05:01:11.098
to conceal the use of 
surveillance technology to also 

05:01:11.099 --> 05:01:17.466
get to conceal its misuse.  
Discriminatory policing that 

05:01:18.719 --> 05:01:22.085
targets people of color and 
surveillance technology 

05:01:23.206 --> 05:01:23.583
supersized the impact of racial 
profiling and abuse.  So So 

05:01:23.584 --> 05:01:25.584
there So there is

05:01:26.707 --> 05:01:31.244
 some real issues that we have 
to consider here.  How will our 

05:01:31.381 --> 05:01:35.217
collections of social media data
 be different than those built 

05:01:35.218 --> 05:01:38.060
by law enforcement or private 
security firms?  I think that is

05:01:38.401 --> 05:01:44.672
 a question that we all need to 
think about.  Here is an image 

05:01:44.673 --> 05:01:48.633
of two prominent activists who 
became well-known during the 

05:01:50.335 --> 05:01:57.762
Ferguson protest.  Here they are
 labeled as threat actors by a 

05:01:57.951 --> 05:02:03.122
private security firm.  Here on 
the left, and Jonetta Elsy.  I 

05:02:03.298 --> 05:02:09.137
think this is in relation to the
 Baltimore uprising when they 

05:02:09.566 --> 05:02:12.159
found out this this company was 
doing a lot of data collection 

05:02:13.618 --> 05:02:18.075
for local law enforcement.  So 
it's ait's a scaryit's a scary 

05:02:13.294 --> 05:02:15.294
situation because these

05:02:19.551 --> 05:02:23.052
 companies are increasingly 
interested in this data as a way

05:02:23.221 --> 05:02:27.444
 to punish people for being 
active citizens.  When Ed 

05:02:28.382 --> 05:02:32.416
Summers and I am dropping Ed's 
name a lot here today, going to 

05:02:33.927 --> 05:02:39.831
owe me a beer after this, when 
Ed Summers first made a blog 

05:02:39.832 --> 05:02:47.023
post about the Ferguson Twitter 
data set, a private security 

05:02:47.024 --> 05:02:50.476
firm first reached out to him 
asking him if they can access 

05:02:50.477 --> 05:02:52.477
that data.  It's a really 
concern for our profession to be

05:02:52.749 --> 05:02:57.173
 aware of.  How do we make sure 
that the massive Twitter data 

05:02:57.174 --> 05:02:59.527
archive being built right here 
at the Library of Congress 

05:03:00.307 --> 05:03:05.011
doesn't become a tool that these
 groups can use against already 

05:03:05.485 --> 05:03:07.686
marginalized people, who are 
concerned for the police to stop

05:03:08.073 --> 05:03:12.621
 killing them.  So how will the 
library respond to requests from

05:03:12.800 --> 05:03:17.349
 private security firms and law 
enforcement for the data?  Part 

05:03:17.350 --> 05:03:22.095
of the answer is that we have to
 directly engage with people 

05:03:22.673 --> 05:03:25.503
using social media for how 
collecting this type of data 

05:03:26.488 --> 05:03:27.969
might affect their lives.  I 
think that would be an important

05:03:27.970 --> 05:03:32.720
 way for us to come up with some
 policies around offering public

05:03:32.721 --> 05:03:34.648
 access to some of this content.

05:03:34.649 --> 05:03:40.091
It's a difficult task.  But I 
think it's possible and you know

05:03:40.550 --> 05:03:42.790
 it's especially tough because 
of the number of people who can 

05:03:43.582 --> 05:03:47.424
engage with an issue on a social
 media platform at any given 

05:03:47.752 --> 05:03:52.571
time. That number can be 
daunting.  I'm not sure how 

05:03:52.756 --> 05:03:57.883
large the LLC Twitter data set 
is right now.  But I'm sure it's

05:03:58.015 --> 05:04:00.847
 significant.  In the last week 
it has collected almost 2 

05:04:01.038 --> 05:04:06.123
million tweets related to the 
killing of Keith Scott in 

05:04:06.587 --> 05:04:13.854
Charlotte and Terence crutcher 
in Tulsa.  I think it's it's key

05:04:15.779 --> 05:04:19.907
 if we are willing to drop some 
ideas about professionalism in 

05:04:20.724 --> 05:04:22.724
the midst of neutrality over the

05:04:26.476 --> 05:04:31.420
 people in the communities.  So 
last month, the doc now project 

05:04:31.966 --> 05:04:35.376
hosted our first advisory board 
meeting in St. Louis.  And this 

05:04:35.740 --> 05:04:40.005
was an opportunity to get our 
awesome advisor board members 

05:04:40.367 --> 05:04:44.118
and some of these names and 
faces are familiar to you.  To 

05:04:44.274 --> 05:04:47.198
get together for a deep dive 
into many of the issues that we 

05:04:47.900 --> 05:04:52.051
have been raising around social 
media web archiving, ethics and 

05:04:52.702 --> 05:04:58.578
technology over the past year.  
And this was a really, you know,

05:04:58.925 --> 05:05:04.947
 we have six really great panels
 of inciteful and challenging 

05:05:05.210 --> 05:05:07.825
discussions.  And I really hope 
that you will check them out on 

05:05:08.507 --> 05:05:10.507
our website, docnow.IO when when
 you

05:05:11.763 --> 05:05:15.956
 get a chance.  Because I don't 
think this group of people 

05:05:16.280 --> 05:05:18.393
really have been brought 
together before in the context 

05:05:18.394 --> 05:05:23.293
of sort of archiving digital 
media or web archives.  

05:05:23.294 --> 05:05:26.360
Definitely check it out if you 
get a chance for the meeting 

05:05:26.511 --> 05:05:30.457
page on our website.  But I want
 to focus on just one of those 

05:05:30.760 --> 05:05:33.822
panels for the last few minutes.
I think it's a great example of 

05:05:34.013 --> 05:05:37.864
the type of community work we're
 going to need to engage in in 

05:05:37.865 --> 05:05:41.017
the future if we want to 
continue building these types of

05:05:41.206 --> 05:05:45.396
 data sets as archives.  The 
panel was made up of four 

05:05:45.547 --> 05:05:50.062
activists from Ferguson.  Who 
were some of the many organizers

05:05:50.200 --> 05:05:55.324
 in Ferguson after Michael 
brown's killing

05:05:59.777 --> 05:06:06.609
 including who was expertly 
moderated by Jonathan Fengleson 

05:06:06.610 --> 05:06:11.017
who is a faculty director at 
Washington university.  I am 

05:06:11.018 --> 05:06:13.965
thankful for the activists 
joining us.  These are people 

05:06:13.966 --> 05:06:17.593
with 9:00 to 5:00s and they are 
students and they took time out 

05:06:17.594 --> 05:06:21.814
of their day to be with us for a
 good chunk of the day.  We 

05:06:21.815 --> 05:06:24.998
appreciated that.  They added a 
richness and a realness to the 

05:06:24.999 --> 05:06:31.442
event that we wouldn't have had 
otherwise.  You know and they 

05:06:31.443 --> 05:06:37.110
talked about their lives before 
Ferguson and talk about their 

05:06:37.111 --> 05:06:40.273
lives now.  There are some 
really difficult conversations 

05:06:40.274 --> 05:06:43.554
that happened on that panel.  
It's about an hour and a half 

05:06:43.555 --> 05:06:48.164
long.  The longest panel of the 
day.  I think that there is some

05:06:48.165 --> 05:06:52.566
 really good stuff in there.
Check it out.  I am seeing my 

05:06:52.781 --> 05:06:56.000
five minute cue here.  I will go
 ahead and stop here.  But I 

05:06:56.001 --> 05:07:00.264
want to share a short clip from 
that panel with you.  It's about

05:07:00.265 --> 05:07:07.396
 six minutes long so I will just
 leave it open and then we can 

05:07:07.397 --> 05:07:10.587
get into conversation that way. 
So let's see if this will work. 

05:07:10.790 --> 05:07:12.790
It

05:07:17.335 --> 05:07:19.335
 worked during testing.  So So 
you So you all are

05:07:19.669 --> 05:07:22.256
 in a room full of people who 
are really interested in 

05:07:22.257 --> 05:07:27.255
documenting the now, right, try 
to be able to capture what is 

05:07:27.666 --> 05:07:29.666
happening.  Particularly with 
social movement as it's 

05:07:32.125 --> 05:07:34.697
happening.  Right.  And so one 
of the things that is really 

05:07:35.018 --> 05:07:38.197
interesting is that -- sorry, 
you're going to hear from Alexis

05:07:38.401 --> 05:07:43.339
 first and Kayla in a second.  
This is a story that you all 

05:07:43.735 --> 05:07:46.552
helped create.  Helped make into
 a global story, but at the same

05:07:46.553 --> 05:07:53.167
 time, it's a story, and in many
 ways, attempted to control via 

05:07:53.447 --> 05:07:57.038
Twitter but at the same time 
it's a story that comes so big 

05:07:57.176 --> 05:07:59.916
that it's also beyond any of 
your controls, right, so one of 

05:08:00.061 --> 05:08:03.034
the questions that I really 
wanted to get at was, how do you

05:08:03.642 --> 05:08:05.642
 all want the movement to be 
remembered?  And where is some 

05:08:05.816 --> 05:08:07.816
of the things that you would you
 would  you would like people

05:08:08.275 --> 05:08:13.788
 doing research around your 
lives, your work, what are some 

05:08:13.789 --> 05:08:15.283
of of the of the things that you
 want them

05:08:15.284 --> 05:08:15.364
 to be conscious of?  You can't 
stop them.  them.  

05:08:15.365 --> 05:08:17.365
Right. them.  
Right.  But what are some of

05:08:19.518 --> 05:08:21.627
 the things that you want them 
to keep in mind as

05:08:26.695 --> 05:08:32.852
 they are doing that work?  All 
right, so, really iffy I guess I

05:08:32.853 --> 05:08:41.066
 am more so talking to the black
 folks in the room, the 

05:08:41.067 --> 05:08:45.842
movement, like don't watch out 
the internal politics.  And like

05:08:46.122 --> 05:08:51.675
 the argument -- like don't 
watch the way the homo phobia 

05:08:51.676 --> 05:08:53.676
and the sexism,sexism, sexism, 
don't

05:08:55.199 --> 05:08:57.941
 watch the way there are live 
stories about what is happening 

05:08:57.942 --> 05:08:58.931
to people like internally and 
like people felt unsafe and

05:08:58.932 --> 05:09:00.932
unsafe and people

05:09:02.946 --> 05:09:05.844
 fighting next to you.  Don't 
leave that out because we have, 

05:09:05.845 --> 05:09:12.361
in all of our movements, people 
are so hurt and bitter.  And 

05:09:12.362 --> 05:09:16.108
this is why a lot of the 
arguments are happening online 

05:09:16.109 --> 05:09:19.287
and this is why like they don't 
really bother me because this 

05:09:19.288 --> 05:09:27.066
also humanizes our movement and 
I don't think we have got that 

05:09:27.067 --> 05:09:33.303
with anything we have had.  It's
 always been persistent.  We 

05:09:33.304 --> 05:09:38.590
just aren't.  We are like 
depressed.  We like to drink and

05:09:38.591 --> 05:09:42.802
 smoke.  We have kids. 
We have jobs.  We are married.  

05:09:43.079 --> 05:09:47.497
We are like scorned.  We are 
human like whatever.  Actually 

05:09:48.057 --> 05:09:49.906
humanize the people out there,  
these 

05:09:49.907 --> 05:09:54.354
everyday people, because they 
are bitter just like ya'll in 

05:09:54.355 --> 05:09:56.355
this room. 

05:09:59.745 --> 05:10:07.584
 And you just can't.  
SPEAKER:  Really quick I saw the

05:10:08.774 --> 05:10:10.774
 sign.  
SPEAKER:  So for me that's 

05:10:10.782 --> 05:10:15.278
really important.  And the other
 thing I would add to that is 

05:10:15.279 --> 05:10:17.279
just the idea idea of idea of 
the social

05:10:17.877 --> 05:10:24.116
 media experts, super 
democritized and somewhat 

05:10:25.077 --> 05:10:29.110
perpetuates that for those of 
you who have -- like I have 

05:10:29.827 --> 05:10:35.024
15,000 followers, whatever, it 
changes.  But it's a lot.  And 

05:10:35.545 --> 05:10:39.530
so people -- like mistakenly put
 your value at how many people 

05:10:39.531 --> 05:10:42.569
follow you.  And leadership 
isn't based on how many 

05:10:43.076 --> 05:10:44.583
followers you have online.  
Leadership is based on how many 

05:10:44.584 --> 05:10:46.584
how many  how many people

05:10:48.050 --> 05:10:53.155
 you are invested in and 
developing on the ground.  One 

05:10:53.498 --> 05:10:56.423
of the most important thing that
 I felt like I accomplished over

05:10:56.855 --> 05:11:00.454
 the past two years were not 
told on social media and they 

05:11:00.455 --> 05:11:02.478
did not need to be told on

05:11:06.073 --> 05:11:09.724
  social media and the space 
that you see where we are lifted

05:11:09.911 --> 05:11:13.944
 up, we are standing on the 
shoulders of hundreds of giants 

05:11:13.945 --> 05:11:15.945
and Ferguson was not because the
 four of of us of us go

05:11:18.117 --> 05:11:21.339
 together and fight the black 
generation because thousands of 

05:11:22.221 --> 05:11:27.339
people in St. Louis say yo, this
 is messed up and we're not 

05:11:27.340 --> 05:11:32.265
going to let that stand.  We see
 those people at Target, 

05:11:32.266 --> 05:11:38.202
hopefully you don't get to 
Walmart.  Or when you go to a 

05:11:38.203 --> 05:11:40.945
fast food spot, you see the 
people that say I want to give 

05:11:40.946 --> 05:11:46.243
all of myself to a space and we 
go back to life.  We have been 

05:11:46.244 --> 05:11:48.244
ethically blessed and we

05:11:50.532 --> 05:11:53.390
 worked for it and also part of 
the equation that put us into 

05:11:54.022 --> 05:11:57.383
the elevated space.  And our job
 is also to fight for those who 

05:11:57.520 --> 05:12:00.812
are not in our faces and try to 
do that, but that's your job, to

05:12:01.774 --> 05:12:04.768
 tell the story and find those 
people.  If you can't find the 

05:12:04.769 --> 05:12:07.708
people, at least create space 
for the narrative to be build, 

05:12:07.709 --> 05:12:10.355
like for the rest of my life, I 
owe people that I will never 

05:12:10.765 --> 05:12:17.239
know.  And I take that shit so 
seriously.  Like every state 

05:12:17.240 --> 05:12:21.371
that I represent, my mom and 
grandma are behind the window 

05:12:21.558 --> 05:12:25.960
that I can't see.  That's the 
way I behave because people 

05:12:26.177 --> 05:12:29.327
literally sacrifice their lives 
and comfort for one person.  And

05:12:29.520 --> 05:12:32.984
 we have somewhat benefitted 
from it and somewhat been super 

05:12:32.985 --> 05:12:39.451
traumatized by it.  And accept 
that, and like tell our 

05:12:39.630 --> 05:12:41.630
wholeselves and I made the 
commitment in therapy because I 

05:12:41.723 --> 05:12:44.108
didn't go to therapy.  And I 
made this commitment that says I

05:12:44.264 --> 05:12:50.463
 will love, and I commit to my 
community to love the entirety 

05:12:50.767 --> 05:12:51.820
and that is the not romantic 
story.  We are hungry and didn't

05:12:51.821 --> 05:12:53.821
 didn't have didn't have food.  
That's the subway lady

05:12:57.322 --> 05:13:02.220
 having no money and then 
getting cancer and making a go 

05:13:02.375 --> 05:13:08.558
fund me and reaching out to 
Ferguson activists and say I 

05:13:08.763 --> 05:13:11.586
have cancer and reach out to us 
every night.  That is a story 

05:13:11.798 --> 05:13:15.763
that a lot of people don't know.
But it's so important that that 

05:13:15.932 --> 05:13:17.932
is how we sustain that

05:13:21.586 --> 05:13:23.586
 kind of community.  
SPEAKER:  All 

05:13:27.540 --> 05:13:31.784
right.  Okay.  All right.  All 
right so that's all I have.  And

05:13:32.098 --> 05:13:34.098
 I look forward to the 
discussion.  [Applause]

05:14:25.756 --> 05:14:27.756
. 

05:14:50.522 --> 05:15:38.948
. 
SPEAKER: Hello.  This is an 

05:14:04.096 --> 05:14:06.175
extremely tough act to follow.  
follow.  

05:14:06.176 --> 05:14:09.546
Thanks forfollow.  
Thanks for that.  I want to 

05:14:10.421 --> 05:14:14.144
thank NDI, Kate, for this 
wonderful opportunity to 

05:14:15.269 --> 05:14:17.269
participate in such a

05:14:21.518 --> 05:14:27.295
 terrific event.  So my talk is 
a rehash of a paper that we put 

05:14:27.296 --> 05:14:30.550
together for the upcoming eye 
press conference.  So it's less 

05:14:30.551 --> 05:14:32.551
about the ethical considerations
 of this work and more

05:14:36.011 --> 05:14:38.996
 about the technical side of the
 work.  But I am certainly happy

05:14:38.997 --> 05:14:44.016
 to talk about ethics in the Q 
and A.  I  I would like to give 

05:14:38.178 --> 05:14:40.178
I would like to give a shout out
 to the 

05:14:44.171 --> 05:14:47.620
co-authors and I invite them to 
chime in and correct and expand 

05:14:47.621 --> 05:14:56.373
as needed.  I welcome that.  I 
want to shout out Julia Kim and 

05:14:56.374 --> 05:15:05.159
Melissa Linberg and they pushed 
us through the presentation and 

05:15:05.160 --> 05:15:09.594
we couldn't have done this 
without them.  I want to 

05:15:09.595 --> 05:15:18.049
acknowledge Betsy Peterson and 
other leaders in library 

05:15:18.050 --> 05:15:20.050
services and and web and web 
services

05:15:20.854 --> 05:15:24.553
 for seeing where the 
experimentation and 

05:15:24.772 --> 05:15:28.235
implementation can exist.  So 
today I will be talking about 

05:15:28.236 --> 05:15:31.773
the collaboration among my 
library colleagues.  Web 

05:15:31.968 --> 05:15:34.807
contents for preservation access
 that moves us beyond classic 

05:15:34.808 --> 05:15:39.113
web archiving methods and focus 
on two community collecting 

05:15:39.287 --> 05:15:43.729
projects.  One to solicit and 
harvest community-generated 

05:15:44.825 --> 05:15:49.286
photos off of flicker and the 
other is to gather information 

05:15:49.693 --> 05:15:54.398
over a fairly-new form of 
application.  So both projects 

05:15:54.544 --> 05:15:58.368
involve a public call to action 
and prompt public engagement in 

05:15:58.683 --> 05:16:01.393
building library collections.  
They leverage our partnership --

05:16:01.394 --> 05:16:05.223
by leveraging or partnering with
 third-party software platforms,

05:16:05.414 --> 05:16:09.480
 these efforts allow us to focus
 on preservation and long term 

05:16:10.167 --> 05:16:13.877
access of records while still 
supporting immediate and dynamic

05:16:19.465 --> 05:16:23.191
 engagement in the community.  
Kate got into it a little bit.  

05:16:23.711 --> 05:16:29.820
A background on the American 
folk life center.  We are a 

05:16:30.007 --> 05:16:35.893
large ethnographic archive.  And
 these extensions include audio 

05:16:36.403 --> 05:16:41.114
visual documentation of visual 
art and cultural expressions and

05:16:41.115 --> 05:16:44.532
 oral history in the access of 
songs, stories and other 

05:16:45.888 --> 05:16:50.544
creative expressions of people 
from diverse communities.  And 

05:16:50.545 --> 05:16:57.830
as mentioned they range from wax
 cylinders from 1890 as we 

05:16:57.831 --> 05:17:01.250
talked about yesterday in the 
other building, to the digital 

05:17:02.010 --> 05:17:06.084
collection and many others.  We 
have pretty much every 

05:17:06.845 --> 05:17:09.575
technology in our collection.  I
 will mention to you that we are

05:17:09.787 --> 05:17:13.561
 perhaps best known for our 
collection of field recordings. 

05:17:14.613 --> 05:17:18.386
The performances of songs, 
instrumental music by little 

05:17:19.303 --> 05:17:22.384
known musicians and also by 
famous musicians such as 

05:17:22.527 --> 05:17:29.873
Elizabeth Lorang Cotton and 
Molly Jackson, Jerry Morton, 

05:17:30.803 --> 05:17:33.098
Johnny Cash and so on, many who 
did performances

05:17:36.138 --> 05:17:43.929
 right on this stage.  All right
 so moving ahead, maybe, the 

05:17:43.930 --> 05:17:47.960
American folk life center was 
created in 1976 by an act of 

05:17:47.961 --> 05:17:52.348
Congress and we have a 
wide-ranging mandate to preserve

05:17:52.349 --> 05:17:57.462
 and to present folk life so I 
am showing you a snippet of the 

05:17:57.463 --> 05:18:01.934
verbiage from the legislation 
that defines what folk life is, 

05:18:01.935 --> 05:18:06.630
and sort of sets our tone for 
collecting the scope.  Which I 

05:18:06.631 --> 05:18:12.849
would say is broad, if not 
wildly ambitious to try to get 

05:18:12.850 --> 05:18:14.850
all of

05:18:16.040 --> 05:18:19.450
 this documented.  So I want to 
point out that the digital 

05:18:19.451 --> 05:18:22.270
collecting initiatives that I am
 going to talk about are part of

05:18:22.431 --> 05:18:26.432
 a long history of the archives 
of soliciting public 

05:18:26.433 --> 05:18:29.490
collaboration in documenting the
 cultural record.  You know with

05:18:29.491 --> 05:18:33.913
 the founding of the archives, 
Robert Gordon went out and 

05:18:33.914 --> 05:18:38.802
recorded singers to document 
American folk song.  Of course, 

05:18:39.646 --> 05:18:43.966
Alan Lomax right after Pearl 
harbor who has been the 

05:18:43.967 --> 05:18:48.286
assistant in charge of the 
archives, sent a telegram in 

05:18:48.287 --> 05:18:50.057
field workers to various 
locations throughout the United 

05:18:50.058 --> 05:18:56.048
States that the man on the 
street interviews gets peoples' 

05:18:56.049 --> 05:19:06.252
reactions on what happened. 
happened.  Wehappened.  We have 

05:18:49.846 --> 05:18:51.846
since built on

05:18:58.677 --> 05:19:02.947
 that tradition for doing the 
same in 911 and the same 

05:19:03.064 --> 05:19:06.083
commemorating the inauguration 
of the first African American 

05:19:12.744 --> 05:19:16.823
president.  And so on.  So of 
course with the proliferation of

05:19:16.988 --> 05:19:21.748
 smart phones, tablets and 
wireless internet connections, 

05:19:22.541 --> 05:19:24.937
network communication is 
increasingly where the cultural 

05:19:25.074 --> 05:19:28.647
record is being documented and 
AFC staff has long recognized 

05:19:30.379 --> 05:19:33.260
this need to preserve folk 
expression on the web and until 

05:19:33.614 --> 05:19:37.714
now, has not had but paper tools
 to do them.  You'll see we have

05:19:38.988 --> 05:19:44.271
 a very respectable collection 
of scam e-mails in our inboxes 

05:19:44.664 --> 05:19:48.714
printed out.  But any way, we 
have since evolved and in June 

05:19:49.795 --> 05:19:57.669
of 2014, we worked with Abby 
Gratt's team in the archiving to

05:19:58.530 --> 05:20:03.835
 create a web culture collection
 and we study with colleagues 

05:20:04.008 --> 05:20:07.961
that use digital culture and 
capturing a set of sites.  So we

05:20:08.249 --> 05:20:13.525
 are up to about 49 sites 
changing from know your mean.  

05:20:13.672 --> 05:20:22.353
There is a pepper spray 
everything mean.  Feel free to 

05:20:22.631 --> 05:20:26.621
Google that later.  All right so
 our -- just briefly, yeah,

05:20:30.599 --> 05:20:38.626
 I love that one.  Any way so we
 are looking at sites that 

05:20:38.948 --> 05:20:43.833
document communities that are 
engaging with each other, DIY 

05:20:44.078 --> 05:20:48.284
communities, spanned 
communities, people talking 

05:20:49.323 --> 05:20:53.128
about urban legends and these 
are extensions of the kind of 

05:20:53.315 --> 05:20:55.315
documentation that we have in 
the 

05:20:57.128 --> 05:20:59.128
analog.  All right.  So by 

05:21:01.608 --> 05:21:03.959
way of background, the Library 
of Congress has been collecting 

05:21:04.396 --> 05:21:07.538
web archives since 2000 and has 
a well established practice for 

05:21:08.056 --> 05:21:10.056
establishing and processing the 
collections.  Most website 

05:21:10.240 --> 05:21:14.751
collections are harvested via a 
tool character.  And they are 

05:21:15.574 --> 05:21:19.959
saved into a format called work.
The crawler works from a list of

05:21:20.171 --> 05:21:26.452
 known seeds that are starting 
URLs and then it -- you are 

05:21:27.335 --> 05:21:33.752
doing a great job.  And it 
crawls to a specific depth from 

05:21:34.122 --> 05:21:39.092
each one following internal 
links on websites.  There is no 

05:21:39.336 --> 05:21:41.089
verification against the 
original source.  That the is 

05:21:41.090 --> 05:21:43.119
not possible in the context.  
But the results are subjectively

05:21:43.829 --> 05:21:45.829
 reviewed and these methods are 
are  are appropriate

05:21:46.938 --> 05:21:50.668
 for collecting documentation of
 everyday life. 

05:21:50.669 --> 05:21:55.281
But they are different and 
distinctive fromdistinctive from

05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:51.990
 the

05:21:53.304 --> 05:21:55.754
 abilities that are offered in 
the two projects that I am going

05:21:56.068 --> 05:21:58.068
 to talk about in ten

05:22:01.481 --> 05:22:04.374
 minutes or less.  
Okay.  We first started working 

05:22:04.375 --> 05:22:12.667
with the library developers to 
collect user-submitted 

05:22:13.071 --> 05:22:15.467
photographs via flicker that 
documented day of the dead and  

05:22:15.468 --> 05:22:17.468
other sort of other sort of 
constellations of holidays

05:22:20.940 --> 05:22:23.947
 that are late October or early 
November.  Participants were 

05:22:23.948 --> 05:22:28.462
asked to post photos to flicker 
with that hashtag.  We have done

05:22:28.659 --> 05:22:34.111
 it again since last year.  And 
then have a creative license 

05:22:34.112 --> 05:22:36.413
accompanying that.  We have 
since expanded that.  This is 

05:22:36.414 --> 05:22:40.355
the 40th anniversary of the 
center, and so we have asked 

05:22:40.525 --> 05:22:42.894
people to document their 
traditions and do the same 

05:22:42.895 --> 05:22:45.420
thing, because the end of the 
calendar year, we will be 

05:22:45.766 --> 05:22:50.721
working again with developers to
 pull that content into our 

05:22:51.110 --> 05:22:54.053
archives.  So the flicker 
harvesting project, like the 

05:22:54.228 --> 05:22:56.228
project that I am going to to 
talk to talk about

05:22:57.094 --> 05:23:02.850
 in a minute, have the contours 
well suited for approaches and 

05:23:02.969 --> 05:23:04.987
processing.  
There is no external link in the

05:23:05.346 --> 05:23:07.748
 data.  No easy list of fees 
that are linked to the 

05:23:07.749 --> 05:23:16.385
collection externally and most 
of the data was collected -- 

05:23:16.386 --> 05:23:19.627
well in the app and so the data 
sets need to be treated 

05:23:19.628 --> 05:23:23.741
differently in terms of access. 
 But in the case of story, well,

05:23:24.407 --> 05:23:28.474
 in flicker, access is being 
handled by these third parties. 

05:23:28.732 --> 05:23:30.732
 So that is

05:23:32.137 --> 05:23:36.501
 off the hook for now.  Okay.  
So any way, at the library we 

05:23:36.502 --> 05:23:42.302
have seem to have settled into a
 rhythm where we treat digital 

05:23:42.303 --> 05:23:44.303
data sets sets and sets and web 
harvesting as two independent

05:23:44.993 --> 05:23:49.153
 and related practices.  Data 
sets are generally collected in 

05:23:49.154 --> 05:23:53.637
time or tag bound chunks by 
querying an external API.  

05:23:53.638 --> 05:23:58.354
Downloaded onto LP storage and 
baggage structure and continued 

05:23:58.355 --> 05:24:01.685
through the usual workflow.  
Depending on whether they are 

05:24:01.686 --> 05:24:09.382
preservation or online access or
 both.  Let me move quickly into

05:24:09.968 --> 05:24:15.408
 the story core example.  So 
this venture is an extension of 

05:24:15.409 --> 05:24:19.919
a long standing relationship we 
have had with the story core.  

05:24:19.920 --> 05:24:25.292
Story core started in 2003 and 
now among the largest narrative 

05:24:25.293 --> 05:24:28.390
projects of their kind and 
interviews have been collected 

05:24:28.391 --> 05:24:33.144
at mobile booths and permanent 
story booth located in New York,

05:24:33.314 --> 05:24:36.590
 Chicago, San Francisco and 
Atlanta.  The traditional 

05:24:36.591 --> 05:24:41.050
interview is two people who knew
 each other talking for 40 

05:24:41.051 --> 05:24:44.783
minutes in a booth and each 
recording is preserved at the 

05:24:44.784 --> 05:24:47.458
Library of Congress, the 
American folk life center.  And 

05:24:47.459 --> 05:24:52.439
then these snippets of the stuff
 gets broad casted on national 

05:24:52.440 --> 05:24:53.608
public radios.  And so since the
 inception of the project in

05:24:53.609 --> 05:24:55.609
project in 

05:24:56.877 --> 05:24:59.444
2003, the signature, what we are
 calling, you know,

05:25:02.659 --> 05:25:06.028
 face to face story core, is 
where they have gone through 

05:25:06.313 --> 05:25:09.058
more than 67 thousand 
interviews.  Then in 2015, 

05:25:09.415 --> 05:25:15.749
founder Dave Isay won the Ted 
prize and when you win the Ted 

05:25:15.896 --> 05:25:19.212
prize, get one million dollars, 
which is great.  And Dave wanted

05:25:20.001 --> 05:25:23.784
 to create an app.  Which is 
great.  And he took the app for 

05:25:24.256 --> 05:25:26.601
story core global and he did.  
And we were like okay, let's do 

05:25:26.725 --> 05:25:28.725
this. 

05:25:30.429 --> 05:25:32.844
 So we worked with story core 
developers

05:25:36.287 --> 05:25:38.917
 to put something together.  And
 that is what I will talk about.

05:25:38.918 --> 05:25:42.050
  At story core developers, they
 worked with the software 

05:25:42.051 --> 05:25:45.066
developers here at the library 
to identify and design and 

05:25:45.067 --> 05:25:47.622
construct this transfer  
mechanism, the team agreed that 

05:25:48.026 --> 05:25:51.930
an API would benefit both 
parties.  The library would

05:25:55.628 --> 05:25:56.466
 receive or fetch and then it 
would allowwould allow thewould 

05:25:56.467 --> 05:25:58.467
allow the expose collection

05:26:00.877 --> 05:26:08.386
 instead of spending staff time 
pushing it out to us.

05:26:08.387 --> 05:26:12.013
Story core developers considered
 their content fluent, library 

05:26:12.644 --> 05:26:15.659
developers were addiment that we
 need things to be fixed.  

05:26:15.832 --> 05:26:19.426
Right, and so explaining this to
 an external partner was 

05:26:19.427 --> 05:26:24.217
beneficial for us, because it's 
a technical factor that the 

05:26:24.218 --> 05:26:29.213
library world that exposes 
archival preservation practices 

05:26:29.214 --> 05:26:32.044
more broadly.  This is where we 
were going to go to explain 

05:26:32.219 --> 05:26:39.313
that.  I couldn't do it.  Any 
way, so each interview packet 

05:26:39.314 --> 05:26:44.606
consists of meta-data files and 
there is an optional upload 

05:26:44.607 --> 05:26:50.954
photo selfie with your partner 
in JPEG and an MP3 audio file 

05:26:50.955 --> 05:26:55.053
and these are discrete packets 
that are served up.  They were 

05:26:55.054 --> 05:26:59.271
happy to add the check sum 
feature which is a digital 

05:26:59.272 --> 05:27:06.450
finger print of some sort which 
can be made be made later be 

05:26:56.160 --> 05:26:58.160
made later for

05:27:02.432 --> 05:27:08.389
 errors.  And the MP3 was hosted
 at sound cloud and was not sure

05:27:08.562 --> 05:27:10.871
 if sound cloud would be cool 
with adding that.  They were 

05:27:10.872 --> 05:27:15.141
after, a little bit of back and 
forth, happy to do that for us. 

05:27:15.418 --> 05:27:20.815
So that made it a lot better.  
Decisions had to be made like 

05:27:22.326 --> 05:27:27.890
what about the associated meta 
data.  Do we care about likes?  

05:27:29.984 --> 05:27:31.984
Do we care about

05:27:34.461 --> 05:27:39.177
  description tags?  We 
certainly thought tags were 

05:27:39.178 --> 05:27:44.737
incredibly important for meta 
data.  And so any way, once the 

05:27:44.738 --> 05:27:48.279
developers were happy with the 
general design of the transfer 

05:27:48.439 --> 05:27:54.505
mechanism, then both parties 
began to iterate and the API 

05:27:54.506 --> 05:28:01.233
side and the library on the 
sketching side and I will go 

05:28:01.580 --> 05:28:08.461
through a few technical details.
In doing this work just to jump 

05:28:08.612 --> 05:28:12.196
to the two big errors that we 
were trying to protect against 

05:28:12.197 --> 05:28:19.132
were one, a single file where 
the check is destroyed.  And the

05:28:19.299 --> 05:28:25.235
 second class would be losing 
access to correlated errors 

05:28:25.618 --> 05:28:27.734
which is practice and mistakes 
where somebody follows a bad 

05:28:28.041 --> 05:28:33.273
practice or relies upon bad code
 and inventory can help identify

05:28:33.714 --> 05:28:35.884
 those sort of things and making
 a good copy.  Okay so this this

05:28:35.885 --> 05:28:37.885
 is this is how

05:28:40.524 --> 05:28:42.524
 the

05:28:44.340 --> 05:28:48.017
 development is going.  I will 
just move ahead.  All right well

05:28:48.309 --> 05:28:52.922
 in closing, you know these 
projects have enabled AFC to 

05:28:53.671 --> 05:28:59.481
engage a broad public to 
collaboratively build the 

05:28:59.673 --> 05:29:02.614
collections and able to do so in
 an automated way and a way that

05:29:03.008 --> 05:29:07.655
 bakes in sound preservation 
practices, which we love.  And 

05:29:07.656 --> 05:29:11.958
if there is time to play a one 
and a half minute clip.  Okay.  

05:29:12.392 --> 05:29:16.011
I would like to close with this 
clip from a story core 

05:29:16.191 --> 05:29:20.546
interview.  And I want to say, 
that this is a tremendous 

05:29:20.830 --> 05:29:32.861
research research corpus,
research corpus, these 

05:29:11.999 --> 05:29:13.999
interviews,

05:29:21.828 --> 05:29:25.629
 and they do get dinged 
sometimes for being

05:29:32.686 --> 05:29:36.206
advertalntly sentimental.  And 
same thing like on Friday.  So 

05:29:36.361 --> 05:29:38.361
enjoy.  I

05:29:40.508 --> 05:29:42.508
 will leave you with 

05:29:44.606 --> 05:29:45.876
this.  
SPEAKER:  One of the last 

05:29:45.877 --> 05:29:48.541
questions basically is to take 
time to tell your interview 

05:29:48.704 --> 05:29:52.941
partner what you mean.  So I'm 
going to say that to you.  I 

05:29:53.373 --> 05:29:57.703
absolutely adore you.  You are 
easily the best thing that has 

05:29:58.063 --> 05:30:02.412
ever happened to me in any way, 
shape or form.  While like you 

05:30:02.413 --> 05:30:07.253
said earlier, there is so many 
things that we can be unsure 

05:30:08.445 --> 05:30:13.341
about in our future, I can 
always say that I know I want 

05:30:13.752 --> 05:30:17.973
you in it.  So in the home that 
we have built together and the 

05:30:18.135 --> 05:30:21.157
lives that we have made together
 with each other, and in the 

05:30:21.594 --> 05:30:25.160
family that we have started with
 our little furry friends here 

05:30:26.576 --> 05:30:28.576
Asia, 

05:30:30.800 --> 05:30:34.451
Colleen, Atcot, will you give me
 the greatest honor,

05:30:37.689 --> 05:30:38.877
 will you you marry

05:30:38.878 --> 05:30:41.119
 me?  
SPEAKER:  Yes.  

05:30:45.421 --> 05:30:47.421
[Crying].  Of 

05:30:50.381 --> 05:30:51.920
course I will.  
SPEAKER:  What better way than 

05:30:51.921 --> 05:30:54.308
to talk about all of the 
wonderful things that we have 

05:30:56.155 --> 05:30:57.783
done in our lives so far?  And 
then to think about the great 

05:30:57.784 --> 05:30:59.784
thing that going

05:31:01.118 --> 05:31:04.562
 to happen in the future.  
SPEAKER:  You're so amazing.  

05:31:04.964 --> 05:31:09.047
SPEAKER:  I didn't tell you this
 yet, but this could also be 

05:31:09.243 --> 05:31:13.210
saved in the Library of 
Congress's archives.  Forever.  

05:31:13.377 --> 05:31:17.505
So that
So that everyone

05:31:10.782 --> 05:31:12.782
So that everyone can listen to

05:31:17.112 --> 05:31:23.002
 this.  I love you so much.  
SPEAKER:  I love you too.  

05:31:23.003 --> 05:31:25.003
SPEAKER:  This could have been

05:31:29.299 --> 05:31:36.689
 my interview/surprise proposal 
to my wonderful girlfriend and

05:31:39.850 --> 05:31:45.189
 now fiancé.  I am now the happy
 of the man in the world.  Thank

05:31:45.190 --> 05:31:47.190
 you.  [Applause]

05:32:06.385 --> 05:32:12.769
. 
SPEAKER:  I have never had a. 

05:32:02.134 --> 05:32:04.472
SPEAKER:  I have never had a 
simultaneous translator before, 

05:32:07.541 --> 05:32:12.978
pumpernickel, flap jack, moose 
handles.  My name is Maciej 

05:32:14.826 --> 05:32:19.222
Ceglowski and I run a web 
archive of 20,000 people so to 

05:32:19.605 --> 05:32:23.492
be invited to the Library of 
Congress is like a kid tied to a

05:32:23.632 --> 05:32:35.424
 tube and then then coming then 
coming to tell NASA about 

05:32:15.706 --> 05:32:17.706
propulsion. 

05:32:28.159 --> 05:32:31.612
 Like everyone said, it's a 
special honor to be here.  It's 

05:32:31.613 --> 05:32:39.189
a special thing for me because I
 am usedam used toam used to 

05:32:28.103 --> 05:32:30.103
talk about

05:32:33.761 --> 05:32:37.496
 the U.S. 
government as a big scary 

05:32:37.688 --> 05:32:40.820
adversary and here I am in a 
government institution that 

05:32:40.996 --> 05:32:43.444
despite the fact that we went 
through a metal detectivor

05:32:47.991 --> 05:32:49.991
   to 

05:32:53.068 --> 05:32:55.068
  to be 

05:32:57.333 --> 05:32:59.333
here,

05:33:01.989 --> 05:33:03.989
 during

05:33:06.676 --> 05:33:19.934
 the panel of September 11th, 
Carla Haden who was on the 

05:32:57.218 --> 05:33:00.536
library association look a 
provision act that requires 

05:33:00.537 --> 05:33:08.954
libraries to divulge what they 
were reading and she did this 

05:33:08.955 --> 05:33:10.955
with 

05:33:13.725 --> 05:33:15.337
ridicule and now she is working 
at the Library of Congress.  

05:33:15.338 --> 05:33:19.819
What a woman.  For me it is 
depressing to think that those 

05:33:19.820 --> 05:33:24.424
provisions that seem threatening
 and un-American look almost 

05:33:24.425 --> 05:33:27.867
quaint now compared to what we 
have done in it the commercial 

05:33:27.868 --> 05:33:31.727
internet to destroy privacy.  
Libraries have a commitment to 

05:33:31.728 --> 05:33:34.943
protect information that 
relevant patrons are reading and

05:33:35.184 --> 05:33:36.445
 amazon knows every book that 
you have read,read, Googleread, 

05:33:36.446 --> 05:33:38.446
Google has your

05:33:40.357 --> 05:33:45.033
 correspondence and web history 
and your phone company knows 

05:33:45.371 --> 05:33:48.903
where you are, based on a device
 that you choose to carry with 

05:33:49.272 --> 05:33:52.544
you.  And in some ways, the 
commercial internet is the 

05:33:52.849 --> 05:33:55.906
opposite of a commercial 
library.  The libraries exist to

05:33:57.251 --> 05:34:02.301
 inform.  The web is there to 
extract as much information that

05:34:02.432 --> 05:34:11.553
 known about.  There is no 
alterior motive in a library but

05:34:11.682 --> 05:34:18.774
 in the web, every link is there
 to show you an ad.  As a 

05:34:20.564 --> 05:34:23.839
librarian I have made enormous 
advances in technology and I 

05:34:24.166 --> 05:34:27.272
want to talk to you about 
machine learning.  I rather you 

05:34:27.426 --> 05:34:30.990
hear it from me or out on the 
street or from your friends.  I 

05:34:31.932 --> 05:34:35.029
come to think that the 
machine-learning techniques that

05:34:36.271 --> 05:34:41.855
 are mistaking are like like a 
like a deep-fryer.  If you never

05:34:42.158 --> 05:34:48.685
 deep fried something in your 
life, you taste and it's amazing

05:34:49.100 --> 05:34:53.603
 and then you taste and if 
you're like this is work with 

05:34:53.901 --> 05:34:57.335
anything.
And you're right.  In college I 

05:34:58.190 --> 05:35:03.116
had friends that worked at the 
snack bar and they would deep 

05:35:03.283 --> 05:35:07.064
fry cheese and candy and pens 
and it all tasted good.  And if 

05:35:07.249 --> 05:35:08.694
you sit on it in  college, 
college, it

05:35:08.695 --> 05:35:15.680
 kind of gives you a little bit 
of hangovers.  The statistical 

05:35:18.389 --> 05:35:21.576
techniques and names keep thing,
 AI, machine learning and next 

05:35:22.124 --> 05:35:27.000
year is going to be a new buzz 
word.  The correlation is that 

05:35:28.084 --> 05:35:31.383
you feed your computer lots of 
data and it recognizes the 

05:35:32.149 --> 05:35:35.708
structure.  In any deep fry 
situation, you want to ask what 

05:35:36.142 --> 05:35:41.480
is the stuff being deep fried?  
In the 70s, where I am from, a 

05:35:41.481 --> 05:35:48.011
person brought a craft fryer in 
Italy and called it, and you had

05:35:48.547 --> 05:35:54.124
 to stand in your own line for 
blocks.  If you brought your own

05:35:54.565 --> 05:36:00.028
 chicken, in three minutes it 
would be deep fried and the most

05:36:00.984 --> 05:36:04.712
 tasty thing and then the health
 department shut it down, it was

05:36:05.076 --> 05:36:08.663
 it was never clean and the 
stuff inside of it was basically

05:36:08.664 --> 05:36:10.127
 black tar and that was and that
 was the and that was the flavor

05:36:10.128 --> 05:36:11.772
 secret.  So what

05:36:11.773 --> 05:36:17.441
 is your data getting fried in? 
 These algorithms train on large

05:36:18.115 --> 05:36:20.674
 collections that you don't know
 anything about and Google  

05:36:20.675 --> 05:36:22.675
operates on things 100 operates 
on things 100 times

05:36:22.767 --> 05:36:28.936
 bigger than what we are 
familiar with in humanity.  I 

05:36:28.937 --> 05:36:32.592
refer to this as machine 
laundering because you can 

05:36:32.593 --> 05:36:36.021
smuggle in conceptions based on 
how you train.  For example if 

05:36:36.022 --> 05:36:41.144
you go to Google translate and 
plug in a horrible article about

05:36:41.692 --> 05:36:44.894
 Syria, you get something in 
English that looks like it's 

05:36:44.895 --> 05:36:51.405
from a native speaker.  But if 
you put in, in Arabic, a kid's 

05:36:51.406 --> 05:36:58.503
letter or a passage letter, it 
looks like frankenStein's 

05:37:04.261 --> 05:37:06.261
monitor

05:37:25.517 --> 05:37:28.783
r.  It's just other 
ideosynchrosies.  If you use 

05:37:25.517 --> 05:37:35.355
optimal character recognition,r.
  It's just other 

05:37:19.012 --> 05:37:23.012
ideosynchrosies.  If you use 
optimal character recognition, 

05:37:19.012 --> 05:37:23.947
you may see it.  I would be 
weary of anything with social 

05:37:23.948 --> 05:37:26.701
networks without careful 
thoughts of where it has 

05:37:27.877 --> 05:37:31.176
trained.  I find it helpful to 
think of alga rhythms as 

05:37:31.752 --> 05:37:35.572
graduate students that you don't
 really trust.  If you want an 

05:37:36.426 --> 05:37:38.426
index or want them to go through
 (1) 000-0000

05:37:42.551 --> 05:37:45.910
  photos where there are horses,
 or if you want to do social 

05:37:45.911 --> 05:37:53.260
analysis or census data or want 
adult supervision in the room, 

05:37:53.261 --> 05:37:57.498
but the sudden issues of bias, 
it's the opportunity cost that 

05:37:58.976 --> 05:38:04.168
irk me.  The uniques deal with a
 lot of potential for surprise. 

05:38:04.169 --> 05:38:06.957
 If you are going to search for 
patterns in your data, you're 

05:38:06.958 --> 05:38:10.720
going to find patterns in your 
data.  Woo-hoo.

05:38:10.721 --> 05:38:15.397
What gets lost in that data is 
really interesting and fresh.  

05:38:15.398 --> 05:38:17.895
We have seen entire fields 
disappear.  Economics came 

05:38:18.797 --> 05:38:23.418
first, sociology and political 
science is still trying to get 

05:38:23.739 --> 05:38:29.446
out, bioinformatics is out there
 and trying to get out there for

05:38:29.447 --> 05:38:35.037
 a while.  The computers are a 
tool and eliminate some trudge 

05:38:35.038 --> 05:38:37.038
ri

05:38:38.924 --> 05:38:43.970
ri.  If you deep fry some 
things, it's tasty.  I don't 

05:38:46.126 --> 05:38:48.126
think we have internalized the 

05:38:51.728 --> 05:38:56.362
eeeenormity of the step.  I am 
laughing because the Andrew 

05:38:56.363 --> 05:38:59.675
Mullen foundation once hired me 
as a program officer, that was 

05:38:59.676 --> 05:39:03.712
crazy of them.  When I was a 
program officer I remember 

05:39:04.575 --> 05:39:09.211
working with the J store and 
finding out that 50 percent of 

05:39:09.212 --> 05:39:13.461
J. store records, not only had 
no one read them, but not have 

05:39:13.827 --> 05:39:18.234
seen them and part of that was 
because it was extremely 

05:39:18.433 --> 05:39:21.972
restrictive agreement as 
publishers and part of it was 

05:39:22.357 --> 05:39:26.113
failure in your imagination.  
You have everything under the 

05:39:26.114 --> 05:39:34.324
sun and no attempt to connect it
 to the academy.  We completely 

05:39:34.325 --> 05:39:39.214
flubbed Wikipedia and I remember
 my boss went as far as whether 

05:39:39.573 --> 05:39:40.490
to print a a copy a copy of

05:39:40.491 --> 05:39:44.501
 it and publish it that way.  
That is what we saw.  And then 

05:39:44.502 --> 05:39:51.339
later after leaving Mullen I saw
 the librarians fail to engage 

05:39:51.340 --> 05:39:55.756
in the early days.  Services 
that later grew to love, 

05:39:55.757 --> 05:39:59.671
basically because of the lack of
 trust and openness to an 

05:39:59.672 --> 05:40:01.672
experiment

05:40:03.200 --> 05:40:11.736
 around unstructured tagging.  
And when And when we And when we

05:39:58.864 --> 05:40:00.864
 talk

05:40:05.298 --> 05:40:08.605
 about data, a lot of our 
language is extracted.  You talk

05:40:08.913 --> 05:40:12.300
 about data flow and data mining
 and data crunching.  It's like 

05:40:12.301 --> 05:40:17.531
a rocky substance that you have 
to smash to get the jewels out. 

05:40:22.571 --> 05:40:29.931
You need the right condition, 
the profitous climate and a 

05:40:30.250 --> 05:40:33.179
sprinkling of bullshit.  You 
need the ability to accept that 

05:40:33.534 --> 05:40:36.470
you don't know exactly what is 
going to grow.  If we take 

05:40:36.776 --> 05:40:45.996
seriously the idea that 
digitaling the collections are 

05:40:46.855 --> 05:40:50.490
reasonable, we have to give out 
control.  It should make perfect

05:40:51.205 --> 05:40:54.391
 sense because human cultures 
are normally diverse.  It's 

05:40:54.392 --> 05:40:58.774
normal that there are different 
music and culture and distance 

05:40:58.775 --> 05:41:03.267
and you delight in the fact that
 there is one hundred different 

05:41:03.268 --> 05:41:11.780
type of cuisines but when we go 
online, the dynamics narrow and 

05:41:12.146 --> 05:41:16.002
programmers meet the needs 
everywhere.  And we think it's 

05:41:16.275 --> 05:41:21.203
normal to build a social network
 for millions of people.  I call

05:41:21.527 --> 05:41:25.813
 this the mormon bartender 
problem, where you imagine you 

05:41:25.814 --> 05:41:28.917
can think your way through it.  
I will give you an example of my

05:41:29.339 --> 05:41:36.662
 own website.  I run a very 
vanilla archive where people 

05:41:37.022 --> 05:41:39.022
save their information for 
later.  I have a priest who 

05:41:39.076 --> 05:41:42.534
searches for sermons on it, 
which I am happy about it.  But 

05:41:43.623 --> 05:41:49.934
the biggest users on my life are
 users of fan fiction.  You're 

05:41:50.137 --> 05:41:54.034
going to pretend you don't know.
But the librarians are avid of 

05:41:54.350 --> 05:41:58.813
it.  These are people often 
highly neurotic set on various 

05:41:58.814 --> 05:42:01.611
pictures in the universes.  If 
you always thought there was 

05:42:01.819 --> 05:42:04.849
sparks, this is the culture for 
you and I encourage you to 

05:42:05.136 --> 05:42:10.313
explore it.  Came to my site and
 to them, it's a search engine 

05:42:10.314 --> 05:42:13.149
and publication tool and it's 
not an archive at all in the 

05:42:13.480 --> 05:42:16.849
sense that I intended it and 
they do a lot of technical work 

05:42:17.052 --> 05:42:22.679
to make it suit their needs.  
For me it's like watching bees 

05:42:23.057 --> 05:42:25.883
arrive and make honey and honey 
comb and make sure that you 

05:42:26.405 --> 05:42:29.365
don't get stung.  It was really 
a wonderful experience but made 

05:42:29.366 --> 05:42:34.155
me think that the internet has 
to get a lot weirder than it is.

05:42:34.548 --> 05:42:38.110
People are tired of the deep 
fried data flavor and they want 

05:42:38.502 --> 05:42:42.084
substance.  They do interesting 
things but you have to trust 

05:42:42.703 --> 05:42:46.429
them first.  In an institutional
 setting it can be frightening. 

05:42:49.481 --> 05:42:51.395
grants online other than the 
hope that it will be 

05:42:51.396 --> 05:42:53.465
interesting.  It takes more 
courage to award such a grand

05:42:57.588 --> 05:43:01.432
 grant.  It takes time for 
someone to use a project that 

05:43:01.961 --> 05:43:04.851
might make a cat video.  I 
realize that is not the royal 

05:43:04.852 --> 05:43:08.304
road for a ten year in most 
institutions and it takes

05:43:11.452 --> 05:43:13.611
 courage to commit to 
maintaining those collections 

05:43:13.612 --> 05:43:17.049
for a long period of time.  But 
search for intelligent life in 

05:43:17.050 --> 05:43:20.384
the internet means that you have
 to put away the life in the 

05:43:20.385 --> 05:43:25.581
internet about who the 
communities are.  I thought the 

05:43:25.582 --> 05:43:28.551
phantoms on my site were 
pursuing a hobby.  What I didn't

05:43:28.552 --> 05:43:37.983
 realize is that online the 
frivilous blend easily.  

05:43:37.984 --> 05:43:41.830
There is a seminar on feminism 
where young fans use the issues 

05:43:41.831 --> 05:43:45.587
to explore gender identity and 
use phantom to discover that 

05:43:45.754 --> 05:43:48.952
there is something called gender
 identity that they are allowed 

05:43:48.953 --> 05:43:52.745
to have and think about in 
question and do it through 

05:43:53.944 --> 05:43:57.911
something that they genuinely 
enjoy and make writing in a way 

05:43:58.225 --> 05:44:01.207
that might make a Russian critic
 blush and they coach each other

05:44:02.224 --> 05:44:06.546
 in writing better.  They coach 
each other in technology.  

05:44:06.547 --> 05:44:13.154
Because serious people enjoy 
frivilious things, it becomes a 

05:44:14.057 --> 05:44:18.195
secret educational system that 
works in thriving ways.  In an 

05:44:18.596 --> 05:44:22.943
upcoming talk, about describe 
things similar with the boy band

05:44:23.518 --> 05:44:28.536
 One Direction that has a fan 
following of young women and 

05:44:28.810 --> 05:44:33.204
they have technical achievement 
that media companies can't get 

05:44:34.286 --> 05:44:38.655
with, developers, video editors 
and journalists and they don't 

05:44:38.656 --> 05:44:42.276
think of it that way, and end 
quote, these interests are not 

05:44:43.061 --> 05:44:45.434
serious so they don't matter.  
These women would not never

05:44:49.806 --> 05:44:54.539
 dream of applying to jobs that 
they are already doing.  I am 

05:44:54.876 --> 05:44:57.579
convinced that our time is much 
better spent trying to reach 

05:44:58.153 --> 05:45:03.637
them and engage them than trying
 with the

05:45:09.641 --> 05:45:11.641
 same algarhythmic toys.
There is the question of what is

05:45:11.771 --> 05:45:15.157
 already on the internet.  One 
approach is going to the people 

05:45:15.158 --> 05:45:18.438
who have control in the data, 
the big companies and partner 

05:45:18.439 --> 05:45:21.679
with them and study it.  I think
 this is awkward though because 

05:45:22.266 --> 05:45:27.952
the very thing that the Library 
of Congress objected to in the 

05:45:29.338 --> 05:45:34.170
patriot act is the bread and 
butter.  Much of it would never 

05:45:37.145 --> 05:45:40.987
pass ethical standards in 
academia and the data is there. 

05:45:41.664 --> 05:45:45.204
There are no laws that constrict
 or constrain us from how ever 

05:45:45.205 --> 05:45:46.075
we want, want, and want, and I 
know

05:45:46.076 --> 05:45:46.400
 that you

05:45:46.401 --> 05:45:48.998
 can hear the data calling to 
you.  

05:45:48.999 --> 05:45:55.633
It's saying study me.  Preserve 
me.  The fly-by-night companies 

05:45:55.634 --> 05:46:00.454
are going to lose me.  You can 
try to add layers of ethical 

05:46:00.455 --> 05:46:06.036
paint and say that you are 
really helping but but I but I 

05:45:58.740 --> 05:46:00.740
worry

05:46:04.719 --> 05:46:09.457
 about legitimizng a culture of 
surveillance like that.  I am 

05:46:10.185 --> 05:46:12.741
very uneasy when I see social 
sciences working with Facebook 

05:46:12.742 --> 05:46:19.320
for example.  In the absence of 
meaningful privacy protection, 

05:46:19.682 --> 05:46:24.254
the privacy is click okay and 
pray.  Since we have yet to see 

05:46:25.179 --> 05:46:27.910
a really big misuse of personal 
information, we are just kind of

05:46:28.347 --> 05:46:30.387
 hoping that it doesn't happen. 

05:46:30.388 --> 05:46:34.635
Remember we live in a time when 
the spiritual success is on the 

05:46:34.636 --> 05:46:39.604
sense in a lot of western 
democracies.  Having large 

05:46:40.579 --> 05:46:46.272
unregulated information 
harvesting people without their 

05:46:38.619 --> 05:46:40.619
their  their knowledge

05:46:41.917 --> 05:46:47.374
 is just dangerous.  
Don't legitimize it.  People 

05:46:47.589 --> 05:46:51.551
face social pressures to abandon
 their privacy.  Being on social

05:46:51.875 --> 05:46:56.558
 media is an unexpected part of 
getting a job or an apartment.  

05:46:56.868 --> 05:47:01.310
The border patrols wants to look
 at your social media.  Realize 

05:47:01.487 --> 05:47:08.602
that the behavioral modification
 is not consentual.  It's an 

05:47:09.896 --> 05:47:16.258
illusion.  I want to talk 
momentarily about my bread and 

05:47:16.780 --> 05:47:21.610
butter which is websites.  
Forgive me for my technical 

05:47:21.884 --> 05:47:26.446
talks.  The average website is a
 giant pile of steaming garbage.

05:47:31.240 --> 05:47:38.015
  context but the way it is.  
It's full of java script and 

05:47:38.016 --> 05:47:43.688
what does it mean?  You have 
everything in the browser and is

05:47:44.721 --> 05:47:47.985
 the dynamic out on the page of 
an annoyance or is it a valuable

05:47:48.399 --> 05:47:50.399
 window in the life of  2016?  
2016?  Which are

05:47:51.369 --> 05:47:56.093
 we supposed to archive?  How do
 we pull it in?  Who should it 

05:47:56.094 --> 05:47:59.958
be targeted to?  You know, you 
end up in the situation where 

05:47:59.959 --> 05:48:03.026
you have to build a simulator of
 the entire computing 

05:48:03.027 --> 05:48:06.527
environment of today and I don't
 think future generations will 

05:48:06.528 --> 05:48:11.081
forgive us for doing that.  Game
 developers have already 

05:48:11.082 --> 05:48:13.905
wrestled through this program.  
They have stuff that we can 

05:48:13.906 --> 05:48:16.165
learn from, because 

05:48:19.718 --> 05:48:22.581
they have tried to emulate games
 that are hard implemented in 

05:48:22.768 --> 05:48:26.910
software and the reason they are
 able to do it is because they 

05:48:26.911 --> 05:48:29.520
are passionate about playing the
 games and teaching it to their 

05:48:30.213 --> 05:48:33.655
kids.  Communities pop up as 
kind of a life saver.  One 

05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:35.910
problem in an institution that 
the Library of Congress faces, 

05:48:36.491 --> 05:48:40.554
is that you can't just role up 
your sleeves and say archive how

05:48:40.892 --> 05:48:45.677
 ever you can, because what you 
do will be considered normal and

05:48:46.338 --> 05:48:48.901
 everybody will follow.  I see 
the problem.  And communities 

05:48:50.145 --> 05:48:53.987
can happen.  An example from 
live journal that might help.  

05:48:54.630 --> 05:48:58.014
It's an early blog site that was
 quite popular.  For every 

05:48:58.015 --> 05:49:02.084
little post you can have a 
thumbnail type image and what 

05:49:02.085 --> 05:49:04.085
was happening, people would use

05:49:08.364 --> 05:49:11.718
 the images as a post.  People 
would have hundreds and 

05:49:11.719 --> 05:49:18.078
thousands of these images and 
became sort of an art on how to 

05:49:18.079 --> 05:49:21.352
do commentary. 
Live journal was not aware of 

05:49:22.175 --> 05:49:26.093
it.  It was a retro active limit
 and they destroyed a lot in 

05:49:26.094 --> 05:49:29.073
their archive without knowing 
that they did anything.  It's 

05:49:29.074 --> 05:49:33.678
easy to say that if you talk to 
your users you find out about 

05:49:33.679 --> 05:49:36.264
this.  A lot of it falls into 
the cracks when you use multiple

05:49:36.638 --> 05:49:40.855
 sites.  It's not limited to 
one0 or two places.  The only 

05:49:40.856 --> 05:49:47.757
way to know how to preserve is 
to talk to them.  We have more 

05:49:47.758 --> 05:49:50.563
than enough storage.  We can't 
recreate the environment without

05:49:50.564 --> 05:49:53.788
 bringing in all of the 
operating systems and browsers 

05:49:53.789 --> 05:49:58.515
and ads that exist now, which is
 an impossible task.  Focusing 

05:49:58.516 --> 05:50:04.808
on communities, like I said, 
means relinquishing control.  

05:50:04.809 --> 05:50:07.212
It's scary.  There are some key 
steps we can follow.  Making the

05:50:07.597 --> 05:50:10.562
 materials available in open 
formats without restrictions 

05:50:10.563 --> 05:50:11.630
with a serious restriction 
restriction to restriction to 

05:50:11.631 --> 05:50:16.600
having a URL being a permanent 
process goes a long way.  

05:50:16.601 --> 05:50:20.869
Publishing text as text.  APIs 
that we have seen talked about 

05:50:20.870 --> 05:50:23.664
today, which I find very 
encouraging, and a commitment to

05:50:23.665 --> 05:50:28.738
 fair use that is a copy right 
office has also shown, so people

05:50:29.169 --> 05:50:31.747
 can freely create and pitch 
this stuff together without fear

05:50:33.401 --> 05:50:39.396
 of automated robots and fear 
lawyers.  I want to give my 

05:50:40.564 --> 05:50:43.500
wishful closing memory of the 
place that I never thought I 

05:50:43.501 --> 05:50:45.754
would be wishful about, the 

05:50:48.790 --> 05:50:53.524
Glenview public library.  I grew
 up in the suburbs of Chicago 

05:50:53.525 --> 05:50:58.759
and like the nerdy kids I spent 
half of my adolescence there and

05:51:00.861 --> 05:51:03.908
 half checking out books.  It 
was the world on the internet 

05:51:03.909 --> 05:51:08.297
and I never understood why the 
urban library existed or who 

05:51:08.298 --> 05:51:14.828
funded it or the values of it.  
It was like the landscape to me,

05:51:15.403 --> 05:51:20.051
 like lake Michigan.  I had the 
right to learn.  I can ask 

05:51:20.052 --> 05:51:23.165
questions and learn my way to 
the answers and taught me to be 

05:51:23.166 --> 05:51:26.503
quiet in public spaces.  For the
 generation that is growing up 

05:51:26.724 --> 05:51:30.609
today, the internet is the 
window in the world and to them 

05:51:30.898 --> 05:51:36.761
it just exists.  At the take it 
for granted.  It's for us that 

05:51:37.525 --> 05:51:40.232
are aware of how contingent it 
is, that you need to worry about

05:51:41.113 --> 05:51:45.405
 it. The coming years are going 
to decide what extent the media 

05:51:45.406 --> 05:51:48.822
is for consumption and for what 
extent it's going to lift people

05:51:49.032 --> 05:51:53.019
 up and how much of a tool it's 
going to be for social control. 

05:51:53.020 --> 05:51:57.195
As it exists today, the internet
 is a big shopping mall.  There 

05:51:57.196 --> 05:52:00.704
is two big stores.  Facebook and
 Google and of course there is 

05:52:00.705 --> 05:52:08.003
an apple store in the middle and
 a food court with lots of punks

05:52:08.004 --> 05:52:10.828
 and lots of surveillance 
cameras watching everything that

05:52:10.829 --> 05:52:13.959
 happened and outside in the 
parking lot there is the book 

05:52:13.960 --> 05:52:18.417
mobile, which is you guys, just 
to add classiness to the place. 

05:52:18.418 --> 05:52:22.119
This isn't my dream of the web. 
My dream of the web is for it to

05:52:22.507 --> 05:52:25.841
 feel like the big city.  A 
place where you rub elbows with 

05:52:25.842 --> 05:52:30.162
people that are not like you.  A
 little scary and chaotic and 

05:52:30.163 --> 05:52:35.643
full of many things that you can
 imagine, and many things where 

05:52:36.018 --> 05:52:36.052
you can't and also for people to
 be themselves and for people 

05:52:36.053 --> 05:52:38.053
for people to for people to 
create

05:52:39.192 --> 05:52:43.068
 their own spaces and to learn 
from one another and of course 

05:52:43.069 --> 05:52:47.832
room for big, beautiful, huge 
tremendous library.  Thank you 

05:52:47.833 --> 05:52:49.833
very much.  [Applause]

05:53:09.704 --> 05:53:16.600
. . 
SPEAKER:  So Nicole can join us.

05:53:05.208 --> 05:53:08.836
We're going to do fifteen 
minutes of questions and then 

05:53:11.105 --> 05:53:13.530
take a quick ten minute break.  
Let's first get to the 

05:53:13.531 --> 05:53:15.531
questions.  I

05:53:19.170 --> 05:53:21.170
 believe we have the folks with 
micro phones and 

05:53:25.699 --> 05:53:28.780
also you can tweet your 
questions.  To as data hashtag. 

05:53:29.216 --> 05:53:33.845
Are there any questions in the 
audience here?  A couple right 

05:53:33.846 --> 05:53:36.579
here.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Hi, this is 

05:53:36.580 --> 05:53:38.580
for any of the

05:53:40.509 --> 05:53:43.041
 speakers who would care to 
respond.  I have discussed this 

05:53:43.042 --> 05:53:45.042
with

05:53:47.983 --> 05:53:53.220
 Nikki a little bit in the past.
  I am wondering if there is a 

05:53:53.221 --> 05:53:56.307
point where we are either going 
out as informed scholars or 

05:53:56.308 --> 05:54:00.299
informed members of community 
and trying to gather the data.  

05:54:00.300 --> 05:54:05.179
But we are not necessarily at 
least in many libraries, taking 

05:54:05.180 --> 05:54:10.150
the step that let's say an 

05:54:15.921 --> 05:54:20.114
anthropologist would do and go 
back to the old 

05:54:23.862 --> 05:54:25.862
school epnology in old-school

05:54:29.187 --> 05:54:32.380
 anthropology.  And although we 
are getting a little better, 

05:54:33.059 --> 05:54:38.204
libraries tend to think of the 
meta data that we collect as 

05:54:39.232 --> 05:54:44.092
neutral and as we know, no 
meta-data is completely neutral 

05:54:45.465 --> 05:54:52.102
and I'm thinking about of the 
thought process of the meta data

05:54:52.103 --> 05:54:57.954
 or the collecting.  If the 
three of you have any thoughts, 

05:54:57.955 --> 05:55:02.008
that would be interesting.  
SPEAKER:  Okay it sounds like 

05:55:02.374 --> 05:55:06.612
what you are asking is more 
informed collecting.  And I see 

05:55:06.991 --> 05:55:11.575
this is something that 
archivists also do in some ways.

05:55:11.779 --> 05:55:13.779
But we have seen the

05:55:15.858 --> 05:55:19.573
 move away from that when it 
comes to web or social media 

05:55:19.855 --> 05:55:23.868
archives.  I think we sort of, 
you know, take that distance 

05:55:23.869 --> 05:55:30.717
that you feel from between 
yourself yourself and yourself 

05:55:20.887 --> 05:55:22.887
and that type

05:55:26.636 --> 05:55:29.991
 of collection and we just say, 
you know, it's too big of a 

05:55:30.201 --> 05:55:36.860
problem to deal with to try to 
engage and at least that is what

05:55:37.177 --> 05:55:40.513
 I am seeing when I look at the 
collections out there.  I don't 

05:55:41.561 --> 05:55:47.115
see enough engagement with the 
people producing the content and

05:55:47.335 --> 05:55:49.277
 that is something is something 
that is something that we're 

05:55:49.278 --> 05:55:55.503
going to have to go back and big
 out.  I would definitely agree 

05:55:55.504 --> 05:55:57.504
with the idea that 

05:55:59.285 --> 05:56:03.162
eponagraphy is a good model.  
The communities out there remind

05:56:04.017 --> 05:56:08.939
 me where you go in the 
helicopter and throws spears at 

05:56:08.940 --> 05:56:11.939
you for a while and then you are
 able to talk.  We really need 

05:56:11.940 --> 05:56:18.026
to reach out to people who 
wouldn't be freaked out by the 

05:56:18.027 --> 05:56:23.349
idea of talking to archivists 
and realize that the people do 

05:56:23.350 --> 05:56:26.369
not just have value in their own
 lives but the richness of what 

05:56:26.370 --> 05:56:30.305
we consider to be the online 
world.  

05:56:30.306 --> 05:56:32.806
SPEAKER:  I think what of what 
we are doing on another project 

05:56:34.304 --> 05:56:37.595
with analog materials called 
traditional knowledge and 

05:56:38.436 --> 05:56:43.965
labels, we are working with 
communities -- they assign the 

05:56:44.405 --> 05:56:48.022
labels and we will pilot a 
project to put their labels and 

05:56:48.350 --> 05:56:51.094
definitions of their labels 
online.  So the labels denote 

05:56:51.782 --> 05:56:53.852
the cultural preferences of the 
tribe and maybe something is 

05:56:54.024 --> 05:56:58.715
supposed to be listened to 
seasonally or by women only or 

05:57:00.092 --> 05:57:03.404
whatever, and so you know, the 
folk life center is actively 

05:57:04.166 --> 05:57:10.505
working on that with its oldest 
materials from 1890s right now. 

05:57:10.853 --> 05:57:12.853
But

05:57:14.205 --> 05:57:19.691
 yes, it's with scale to DH and 
blah blah.  It's very high touch

05:57:19.692 --> 05:57:21.737
 and long-term relationship 
building.  I think

05:57:27.873 --> 05:57:29.873
 that we have to be doing that. 

05:57:37.324 --> 05:57:39.713
 other questions?  
Well for the recording we'll 

05:57:39.714 --> 05:57:42.405
need it.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  So I am 

05:57:42.852 --> 05:57:46.741
curious if you are not the 
Library of Congress, if there 

05:57:47.775 --> 05:57:53.594
are copy right issues with web 
harvesting?  I personally use 

05:57:54.355 --> 05:57:57.044
web scrapping or scraping and 
I'm not sure how to say it.  I 

05:57:57.045 --> 05:57:59.739
know you were going to talk 
about ethical issues and I'm not

05:57:59.999 --> 05:58:06.920
 sure if you can bring it up now
 and if this is part of it. 

05:58:06.921 --> 05:58:09.461
SPEAKER:  Yeah so we have to get
 permission from the site 

05:58:10.125 --> 05:58:13.660
owners.
At least

05:58:07.590 --> 05:58:15.835
At least in the
At least in the class of the 

05:58:02.278 --> 05:58:04.278
website

05:58:12.017 --> 05:58:17.530
 that we are most interested in 
that are focus on cultural 

05:58:17.810 --> 05:58:20.838
expression.  There are some 
sites on our wish list that we 

05:58:20.839 --> 05:58:25.358
not getting implications to do 
that.  So, does that answer your

05:58:25.359 --> 05:58:28.107
 question or not?  

05:58:34.015 --> 05:58:36.217
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Yes.  
SPEAKER:  Any other questions 

05:58:36.580 --> 05:58:38.580
from the audience

05:58:40.141 --> 05:58:42.141
 here?  Do we have any coming

05:58:44.565 --> 05:58:48.951
 in through Twitter?  If we 
don't have questions, I may cut 

05:58:48.952 --> 05:58:53.610
this short and invite everybody 
to come to the -- after our next

05:58:53.611 --> 05:59:03.102
 session after 5:00 we are 
meeting at the Hawk and Dove

05:59:03.727 --> 05:59:07.080
 for the social hour.  Because 
we ran over with our technical 

05:59:07.744 --> 05:59:11.151
difficulties, we will stop this 
now and go to break.  We will 

05:59:11.152 --> 05:59:20.870
come back in ten minutes, ten 
after 3:00, 310.  

05:59:21.186 --> 05:59:23.186
So back here in ten minutes 

06:15:46.438 --> 06:15:47.883
please.  Thanks. .  
SPEAKER:  Hey everybody.  

06:15:47.884 --> 06:15:49.884
Welcome 

06:15:54.395 --> 06:15:56.865
back.  Hi everyone.  In the 
beginning of the program I 

06:16:00.263 --> 06:16:04.381
asked how we can encourage 
collection tore used by data, 

06:16:04.625 --> 06:16:09.347
scholars and librarians.  They 
are a facilitator in the 

06:16:10.422 --> 06:16:13.210
community advocate.  Each of the
 speakers that you will now hear

06:16:13.211 --> 06:16:18.582
 are involved in projects that 
will empower and provoke 

06:16:19.405 --> 06:16:27.818
communities to seek.  Harriet 
Green, an aassociate 

06:16:28.671 --> 06:16:30.671
professional University

06:16:32.719 --> 06:16:37.328
 of  of  Illinois of  Illinois 
at 

06:16:45.859 --> 06:16:47.859
urban-Champaign

06:16:55.312 --> 06:16:57.312
 and

06:17:18.390 --> 06:17:20.390
digging

06:17:30.999 --> 06:17:32.999
 deeper

06:17:43.811 --> 06:18:40.076
 to mind, trust and empowering 
resources will help train the 

06:16:51.612 --> 06:16:54.893
trainer program to support 
digital scholars on academic 

06:16:55.413 --> 06:16:59.350
campuses.  
When the group

06:16:53.142 --> 06:17:02.539
When the group was
When the group was initially 

06:16:46.878 --> 06:16:48.878
thinking

06:16:57.543 --> 06:17:04.699
 about the topic, the input of 
technology and humanities to 

06:17:04.700 --> 06:17:10.128
speak with our next speaker 
Trevor Munoz to speak about the 

06:17:10.129 --> 06:17:14.926
university of Maryland who is 
working at the center for 

06:17:14.927 --> 06:17:18.643
humanities and African American 
culture center initiative and 

06:17:18.644 --> 06:17:23.720
besides being the associate 
director, also an No, I didn't 

06:17:23.721 --> 06:17:27.704
dean at the University of 
Maryland libraries and in both 

06:17:27.705 --> 06:17:29.705
roles

06:17:31.128 --> 06:17:34.202
 fosters digital programs 
between librarians, activists 

06:17:34.203 --> 06:17:37.019
and other researchers.
Close out the session, we will 

06:17:37.848 --> 06:17:46.014
hear from Marisa Parham and 
Amhurst and hear about the 

06:17:46.746 --> 06:17:48.746
initiatives that serve 

06:17:50.027 --> 06:17:57.198
Amhust, Holyoke and 
Massachusetts.  It helps create 

06:17:57.199 --> 06:18:00.905
creative work and brings incite 
to the implementation, 

06:18:00.906 --> 06:18:06.039
development and critique of 
technology.  Our team first 

06:18:06.040 --> 06:18:11.690
encountered Marisa when we first
 read her series in digital 

06:18:11.691 --> 06:18:16.222
humanities when she asked who 
can create the abilities and a 

06:18:16.223 --> 06:18:20.880
question that we ask and think 
about every day.  

06:18:20.881 --> 06:18:23.383
Please welcome to the stage, 
Harriet Green.  [Applause]

06:18:28.792 --> 06:18:30.437
. 
SPEAKER:  Thank you, Kate and I 

06:18:30.438 --> 06:18:38.441
am really excited to join this 
day of invigorating discussions 

06:18:38.919 --> 06:18:45.032
about the data and as Kate said,
 I'll talk about methods for 

06:18:45.291 --> 06:18:50.408
scholarship research. Ly talk 
about the issues that motivated 

06:18:50.835 --> 06:18:55.522
our project and talk about the 
project itself.  As you have 

06:18:56.198 --> 06:19:01.875
seen and heard from presenters 
earlier today, digitized content

06:19:02.896 --> 06:19:07.479
 is changing more rapidly as 
teachers ingrate the data into 

06:19:07.651 --> 06:19:12.515
the work and scholarship and 
work of strategic library and 

06:19:12.979 --> 06:19:14.984
thinking in support declares the
 vision in the future and in 

06:19:16.245 --> 06:19:20.661
2033, the research library will 
have shifted from its role as a 

06:19:20.662 --> 06:19:23.795
knowledge service provider in 
the university to become a 

06:19:24.183 --> 06:19:28.649
collaborative partner within a 
rich and diverse learning eco 

06:19:29.782 --> 06:19:34.261
system end quote.  The future 
declaration frames how 

06:19:34.602 --> 06:19:37.833
librarians and research queries 
that challenge our skillset and 

06:19:38.253 --> 06:19:43.187
library services and it has been
 made evident today what reaches

06:19:44.344 --> 06:19:45.470
 humanities and social sciences.

06:19:45.471 --> 06:19:49.059
So in light of all of the data 
that we have in humanities and 

06:19:49.321 --> 06:19:54.441
social sciences, how can 
libraries prepare for supported 

06:19:54.995 --> 06:20:00.491
data driven research?  I won't 
repeat the point given already 

06:20:00.666 --> 06:20:03.864
about data but I wanted to 
highlight this information from 

06:20:04.153 --> 06:20:07.208
the commonwealth report 
published about ten years ago 

06:20:07.974 --> 06:20:13.688
from the American council of 
Americaning Societies and it 

06:20:14.292 --> 06:20:16.805
defines concisely but thoroughly
 that richly diverse type of 

06:20:16.806 --> 06:20:20.998
data that research needs.  And 
the report goes on to say that 

06:20:20.999 --> 06:20:25.059
cyber infrastructure is not just
 the hardware and the software. 

06:20:25.241 --> 06:20:28.896
 It's the people and to quote, 
the cyber infrastructure between

06:20:30.814 --> 06:20:35.691
 humanities and social sciences 
works between the amateur and 

06:20:36.600 --> 06:20:39.641
the creative scholars, the 
teachers and students and it's 

06:20:40.247 --> 06:20:42.565
not just the data that is as 
important as the information 

06:20:42.842 --> 06:20:45.894
that goes around it, contributes
 to it and eventually integrates

06:20:46.604 --> 06:20:51.623
 with it end quote. So equal 
importance to a data is the 

06:20:52.155 --> 06:20:54.665
teacher and librarian or 
researcher that explores and 

06:20:55.139 --> 06:20:57.139
expands the data.  And examines 
what libraries are and should be

06:20:57.864 --> 06:21:09.014
 doing to engage to engage in to
 engage in digital scholarship. 

06:20:50.980 --> 06:20:52.980
 There have been

06:21:00.555 --> 06:21:05.131
 a number of studies in recent 
years that looks at how 

06:21:05.132 --> 06:21:09.083
libraries are accommodating the 
recent personnel to serve in 

06:21:09.409 --> 06:21:11.409
scholarship needs and

06:21:15.525 --> 06:21:19.522
 amok among others found that 
the support is relatively new so

06:21:19.523 --> 06:21:24.724
 that the responding library, 57
 percent of the scholarship 

06:21:24.725 --> 06:21:27.710
library personnel has joined in 
the last five years and 74 

06:21:27.711 --> 06:21:30.459
percent have been doing the work
 for less than five years and 

06:21:30.460 --> 06:21:33.519
digital scholarship report is 
frequently contributed across 

06:21:33.520 --> 06:21:37.755
the libraries from librarians 
and archivists and professional 

06:21:37.756 --> 06:21:42.390
support staff and student 
assistance.  Support for digital

06:21:42.937 --> 06:21:47.431
 libraries is growing rapidly.  
And on the individual level, 

06:21:47.432 --> 06:21:52.222
other states have examined what 
librarians are doing now in 

06:21:52.223 --> 06:21:56.771
digital scholarship and what is 
needed.  There are two volumes 

06:21:56.772 --> 06:22:02.787
that present a variety of youth 
cases and groups such as ACRL's 

06:22:02.788 --> 06:22:09.020
digital humanities interest 
group and special groups for 

06:22:09.021 --> 06:22:11.536
organizations that have the 
communities that are involved in

06:22:11.685 --> 06:22:15.838
 DH are growing. 
And then several libraries have 

06:22:15.839 --> 06:22:21.651
also begun to link programs to 
train the librarians in digital 

06:22:22.395 --> 06:22:24.514
scholarship school such as 
University of Maryland's 

06:22:24.657 --> 06:22:30.129
incubator, which we will talk 
about in a minute, Colombia's 

06:22:30.130 --> 06:22:36.645
library and several others.   
Despite the 

06:22:26.415 --> 06:22:28.415
Despite the initial advances 
there

06:22:33.186 --> 06:22:38.182
 is still a ways to go.  
How can we empower all academic 

06:22:38.364 --> 06:22:42.962
librarians to engage in 
scholarship and new forms of 

06:22:43.337 --> 06:22:48.202
research?  This is where our 
project intends to step in.  We 

06:22:48.664 --> 06:22:52.539
proposed a project to the 
institute of museum and library 

06:22:54.684 --> 06:23:01.793
services which they will fund to
 use the Hati trust digital 

06:23:02.387 --> 06:23:06.919
project resources.  I will talk 
about how it uses the skills 

06:23:08.390 --> 06:23:10.366
specifically by connecting 
librarians to digital 

06:23:10.367 --> 06:23:12.720
connections via skill building 
and research methods for tech 

06:23:12.899 --> 06:23:18.441
mine.  First to talk about the 
motivation and philosophy for 

06:23:18.669 --> 06:23:24.467
the project.  To set the 
context, our work is based in 

06:23:24.836 --> 06:23:30.614
the Hathi trust digital library.
Many of you may be familiar with

06:23:31.012 --> 06:23:38.250
 the Hathi trust digital library
 which is over 5 billion pages 

06:23:38.251 --> 06:23:43.805
at last count.  The Hathi trust 
digital library provides equal 

06:23:44.844 --> 06:23:50.366
access and preserves digital 
content.  We enable researchers 

06:23:50.367 --> 06:23:53.196
to gather the information from 
the library and work and data 

06:23:53.495 --> 06:23:59.273
sets and analyze and produce new
 findings.  The Hathi trust 

06:23:59.874 --> 06:24:05.091
research center is jointly led 
by the University of Illinois 

06:24:05.092 --> 06:24:09.446
Urbana-ChampaignUrbana-Champaign,
 and worked on the research 

06:24:09.447 --> 06:24:12.852
services and support.  We 
facilitate the access to textual

06:24:13.186 --> 06:24:16.559
 data so at the moment you can 
obtain access to the public 

06:24:16.560 --> 06:24:23.273
domain corpus as full text and 
other more granular context and 

06:24:23.274 --> 06:24:29.896
our goal is to provide out of 
copy right and copy right text 

06:24:29.897 --> 06:24:34.676
for consumption research and my 
colleagues are working on the 

06:24:34.677 --> 06:24:37.560
development very soon, more 
details can be on the website 

06:24:37.561 --> 06:24:43.700
about that.  As we develop the 
resources in the HTRC we 

06:24:43.701 --> 06:24:47.911
increasingly realize to make 
effective research for users, we

06:24:48.069 --> 06:24:52.040
 need to learn about their work 
and learn firsthand what they do

06:24:52.813 --> 06:24:56.084
 and large scale technology 
research so in the last year we 

06:24:56.085 --> 06:25:00.581
conducted a user assessment 
study consisting of of about 

06:25:00.582 --> 06:25:03.912
fifteen or sixteen interviews so
 far of scholars from a variety 

06:25:03.913 --> 06:25:11.276
of disciplines and librarians 
and the team members, did some 

06:25:11.277 --> 06:25:14.943
initial analysis of the data 
that we have coated to develop 

06:25:15.741 --> 06:25:19.085
preliminary user personas.  The 
digital librarian and the 

06:25:19.404 --> 06:25:22.501
faculty member and the students.
We are finalizing the analysis 

06:25:22.972 --> 06:25:27.078
and the personas are not 
concrete by any mean but they 

06:25:27.398 --> 06:25:30.057
characterize the different 
levels of users that engage with

06:25:30.407 --> 06:25:33.766
 our data and the faculty and 
researcher with advanced tools 

06:25:33.767 --> 06:25:37.102
or advanced need, the newer 
graduate researcher that is 

06:25:38.201 --> 06:25:40.201
exploring methods and tools and 
then there is the research 

06:25:40.217 --> 06:25:43.284
personnel that is establishing 
here as the librarian and the 

06:25:43.881 --> 06:25:46.725
persona of the librarian 
particularly caught our eye in 

06:25:47.058 --> 06:25:49.338
the front of what we have been 
considering.  As we seek to 

06:25:50.675 --> 06:25:55.495
engage researchers in using the 
Hathi trust digital library, we 

06:25:56.926 --> 06:25:59.834
realize that librarians are a 
critical linch pin to the data 

06:26:01.209 --> 06:26:05.533
and the tools to provide matches
 to data and tools to the

06:26:08.839 --> 06:26:13.331
 researchers.  And so in 2015, 
we were awarded a three year 

06:26:13.332 --> 06:26:19.305
Laura bush 21st century program 
from the library services to 

06:26:19.306 --> 06:26:23.645
develop a digital library 
service program as titled there.

06:26:23.646 --> 06:26:27.043
  I want to highlight the word 
empowerment in our title because

06:26:27.894 --> 06:26:31.595
 empowerment is key to our 
program.  We teach librarians 

06:26:31.596 --> 06:26:34.426
about the fundamental approaches
 to text mining and how to work 

06:26:36.492 --> 06:26:39.645
with textual data and I will 
explain in a minute how to work 

06:26:40.850 --> 06:26:46.390
with others and the textual data
 is a course to the HTRC, the 

06:26:46.802 --> 06:26:52.471
course of the curriculum is the 
text mining and the goal is to 

06:26:52.472 --> 06:26:54.701
help librarians promote digital 
digital more digital more 

06:26:54.702 --> 06:27:01.686
broadly.  Helping librarians 
with new context for the 

06:27:01.687 --> 06:27:04.999
services that address the 
particular needs for faculty 

06:27:06.139 --> 06:27:06.483
ensuing digital scholarships and
 active research projects to  to

06:27:06.484 --> 06:27:08.484
 become part to become part of 
the institutions and

06:27:10.867 --> 06:27:16.495
 to provide foundational 
knowledge to transform academic 

06:27:16.991 --> 06:27:19.623
library scholars and data into 
more data intensive 

06:27:19.969 --> 06:27:23.295
collaborative learning spaces 
into the use of knowledge that 

06:27:23.839 --> 06:27:27.441
enables them to participate in 
the scholarly dialogue.  The 

06:27:27.634 --> 06:27:32.447
colleague team is listed here 
led by me and then there is Beth

06:27:32.599 --> 06:27:36.204
 and Steven Downey and we have 
four partner institutions who 

06:27:36.205 --> 06:27:37.531
span different sizes and types 
of higher education.  So the the

06:27:37.532 --> 06:27:39.532
 university the university of 
bloomington which 

06:27:42.132 --> 06:27:43.939
is our HTRC partner and

06:27:43.940 --> 06:27:49.043
 led by Angela Courtney.  
Lafayette college, a liberal 

06:27:49.044 --> 06:27:55.492
arts college, dean Neil and 
Northwestern University and 

06:27:55.493 --> 06:28:02.336
University of Maryland, Chapel 
Hill, Louis was the original and

06:28:02.957 --> 06:28:06.442
 now Amanda Henry is joining our
 team.  So the project began in 

06:28:06.443 --> 06:28:10.533
October of 2015, again, and we 
spent the last year developing 

06:28:10.534 --> 06:28:13.824
the curriculum that keeps the 
trained librarians and the 

06:28:14.594 --> 06:28:18.959
professionals using the tools in
 text mining research and this 

06:28:19.521 --> 06:28:22.512
year we are launching pilot 
workshops at all five 

06:28:22.742 --> 06:28:25.906
institutions to test drive the 
curriculum.  To talk about the 

06:28:26.220 --> 06:28:30.423
curriculum in a bit of detail, 
it's the tools and services in 

06:28:31.571 --> 06:28:37.659
the HTRC.  We teach them to work
 with the HTRC portal which has 

06:28:38.637 --> 06:28:45.389
users build data sets of text 
and the corpus and the Hathi 

06:28:45.390 --> 06:28:50.375
trust digital library and the 
algorithm that is in the portal 

06:28:50.962 --> 06:28:54.859
as long as the caveats as 
mentioned today.  We are 

06:28:56.008 --> 06:29:02.316
preaching them how to use the 
Hathi trust data and we realize 

06:29:02.650 --> 06:29:05.092
that librarians function in a 
variety of different contexts 

06:29:05.333 --> 06:29:09.176
and our focus to teach about the
 fundamentals of text mining and

06:29:09.177 --> 06:29:12.383
 perhaps what we might call data
 science skills.  We introduce 

06:29:12.566 --> 06:29:15.842
participants to the command line
 and how to harvest data through

06:29:16.622 --> 06:29:24.377
 web scraping and how to clean 
data anddata and howdata and how

06:29:13.067 --> 06:29:15.067
 to run basic scripts

06:29:21.261 --> 06:29:25.142
 for data manipulation and basic
 type of text analysis.

06:29:25.143 --> 06:29:33.012
The curriculum is targeted 
targeted at targeted at 

06:29:20.674 --> 06:29:22.674
beginners mostly

06:29:27.631 --> 06:29:31.933
 and the platforms that we use 
in teaching such as python 

06:29:31.934 --> 06:29:35.901
anywhere are aimed at make the 
skills as widely accessible as 

06:29:35.902 --> 06:29:38.295
possible in various teaching 
environments so we ultimately 

06:29:38.296 --> 06:29:41.037
aim to build foundational skills
 in text mining in librarians 

06:29:41.038 --> 06:29:44.744
through the trainer approach.  
After they participate in the 

06:29:44.745 --> 06:29:47.033
workshop we hope to put them on 
the road to developing the 

06:29:47.034 --> 06:29:51.487
foundational skills and they 
also will be given a full speed 

06:29:51.488 --> 06:29:55.514
of instructional resources and 
tools to teach their own 

06:29:55.983 --> 06:29:58.858
workshops at their own 
institutions.  So next year 

06:29:58.859 --> 06:30:00.859
after we after we do after we do
 the pilots and we find

06:30:00.861 --> 06:30:05.062
 the curriculum a bit more, we 
will conduct a nationwide road 

06:30:05.063 --> 06:30:08.455
show workshop that will train 
professionals at major 

06:30:08.661 --> 06:30:12.202
conferences and key geographic 
areas around the United States 

06:30:13.702 --> 06:30:17.130
and teaches the HTRC tools and 
the principles at thethe 

06:30:17.131 --> 06:30:19.056
principles at the largethe 
principles at the large 

06:30:19.057 --> 06:30:23.160
scale text mining.  We will 
refine the materials one last 

06:30:23.578 --> 06:30:26.416
time and have the tool kit that 
has the last package for 

06:30:27.457 --> 06:30:29.852
materials and resources that all
 librarians can take and use and

06:30:29.853 --> 06:30:33.338
 will be hosted on the open 
institutional repository and 

06:30:33.532 --> 06:30:36.206
another outcome we hope to build
 is a network community of 

06:30:36.585 --> 06:30:38.955
librarians who want to continue 
these conversations and share 

06:30:39.832 --> 06:30:43.850
their experiences as they begin 
to keep text mining and digital

06:30:47.680 --> 06:30:49.680
 scholarscholarships at the own 
institution and has the 

06:30:51.891 --> 06:30:53.891
assessing of the process of 
research development and 

06:30:54.529 --> 06:30:56.959
examines strategies for LIS 
professional development.  In 

06:30:57.177 --> 06:31:00.084
this way we help to build a 
community practice around a 

06:31:00.891 --> 06:31:04.654
curriculum as the trainees 
become trainers.  So our project

06:31:04.971 --> 06:31:07.970
 I believe will be a significant
 step forward in addressing the 

06:31:08.295 --> 06:31:13.627
question of how do we build 
skills in digital humanities and

06:31:14.321 --> 06:31:18.208
 digital scholarship in the data
 in our libraries and I suppose 

06:31:18.209 --> 06:31:25.137
there are a couple of bigger 
larger issues as we think about 

06:31:25.651 --> 06:31:28.935
librarianship.  So first has 
been made clear by presenters 

06:31:29.309 --> 06:31:33.756
today, we need to 
reconceptualize our work and 

06:31:34.326 --> 06:31:36.326
engagement and not

06:31:37.552 --> 06:31:40.600
 all librarians are collection 
managers but most of us touch in

06:31:41.182 --> 06:31:45.254
 various ways collection and 
analyzing and architecture and 

06:31:45.583 --> 06:31:47.949
interface design and with our 
own collections as well as our 

06:31:47.950 --> 06:31:51.731
own holding and throughout the 
landscape from the vast digital 

06:31:52.653 --> 06:31:56.503
resources to the Hathi trust and
 the digital collections, 

06:31:56.647 --> 06:32:00.802
librarians will have to engage 
with collections as becoming 

06:32:02.583 --> 06:32:05.169
familiar with data acquisition 
and think about the broader ways

06:32:05.320 --> 06:32:09.473
 that users want to engage with 
our collection in the digital 

06:32:09.955 --> 06:32:13.452
format.  And a lot, another key 
area and opportunity along with 

06:32:13.747 --> 06:32:16.920
this is how librarians can 
engage and point in the research

06:32:17.850 --> 06:32:23.115
 life cycle.  Scholars across 
the discipline are gathering 

06:32:23.116 --> 06:32:26.854
data and looking for the library
 as a source of research support

06:32:27.340 --> 06:32:30.318
 beyond just providing research 
and reference guidance and this 

06:32:31.239 --> 06:32:34.918
is reflected in the changing 
nature of who we are hiring in 

06:32:34.919 --> 06:32:39.656
the library for areas such as 
data 

06:32:43.199 --> 06:32:46.307
Curation and data analysis.
The 2013 report from college 

06:32:47.123 --> 06:32:49.123
research and libraries notes 
that quote research 

06:32:49.165 --> 06:32:51.390
collaborations between faculty 
and librarians continue to 

06:32:51.924 --> 06:32:55.288
benefit both partners.  Faculty 
benefits from library resources 

06:32:55.842 --> 06:33:00.614
and librarian expertise and 
librarians benefit from the 

06:33:00.922 --> 06:33:08.340
opportunity of the significant 
partner ofpartner of research

06:32:57.504 --> 06:32:59.504
partner of research and partner

06:33:03.450 --> 06:33:07.916
 end quote.  The valuable 
reports is only a number of 

06:33:07.917 --> 06:33:11.091
studies that the partnership 
between researchers and 

06:33:11.092 --> 06:33:14.831
librarians is more necessary 
than ever.  So in conclusion I 

06:33:14.832 --> 06:33:18.611
believe that projects such as 
ours will categorize thought 

06:33:18.612 --> 06:33:22.251
processes on how to train 
librarians to meet the demands 

06:33:22.252 --> 06:33:26.472
of the data-driven 
scholarshipscholarships.  You 

06:33:26.473 --> 06:33:34.470
might consider the question, 
what does the librarian need and

06:33:34.471 --> 06:33:37.205
 respond for whom the research 
is needed and how can the 

06:33:37.206 --> 06:33:41.769
librarians share the skills and 
supportive research for digital 

06:33:42.247 --> 06:33:44.241
scholarship?  So as we think 
about translating our collection

06:33:44.242 --> 06:33:47.901
 into usable and accessible 
data, I believe that the 

06:33:47.902 --> 06:33:53.979
research connections with 
librarians and faculty users 

06:33:53.980 --> 06:33:59.456
will be key to our success.  I 
want to thank you again for 

06:33:59.457 --> 06:34:01.457
supporting our project and the

06:34:08.924 --> 06:34:11.858
 Hathi trust digital library and
 the institution.  

06:34:11.859 --> 06:34:13.859
Thank you.  [Applause]

06:34:37.420 --> 06:34:39.420
. 
SPEAKER:  A nice Switcharoo. 

06:34:53.029 --> 06:35:16.861
. 
SPEAKER:  A nice Switcharoo.  I 

06:34:31.463 --> 06:34:34.153
learned after a long painful 
experience that I can't type my 

06:34:34.336 --> 06:34:37.118
password and talk at the same 
time.  My computer is very 

06:34:37.587 --> 06:34:40.460
secure but I definitely can't 
multi task in that password.  So

06:34:40.461 --> 06:34:43.459
 I want to say that I am 
absolutely thrilled to have been

06:34:43.910 --> 06:34:45.910
 invited

06:34:51.889 --> 06:34:55.491
 to speak today alongside people
 who have been doing the work.  

06:34:55.492 --> 06:35:00.728
I hope that this is not a jaded 
thought, because speaking at the

06:35:00.729 --> 06:35:03.420
 Library of Congress is not all 
that.  But it is.  I am pleased 

06:35:03.421 --> 06:35:07.764
to be on that panel for two 
reasons.  Mycopanelists are two 

06:35:07.765 --> 06:35:11.110
people from whom I have learned 
a lot and who I look to continue

06:35:11.111 --> 06:35:14.929
 to learn, and also the topic of
 developing communities of 

06:35:15.396 --> 06:35:19.775
practice, is one that I have a 
lot of complicated feelings 

06:35:19.776 --> 06:35:21.776
about and that I love

06:35:24.544 --> 06:35:28.947
 to talk about.  So I am going 
to try to do this in the context

06:35:29.184 --> 06:35:35.018
 of the initiative that we are 
working on in the University of 

06:35:35.535 --> 06:35:37.535
Maryland,

06:35:40.460 --> 06:35:40.791
 Synergies Among Digital 
Humanities and African American 

06:35:40.792 --> 06:35:44.525
History and Culture: An 
Integrated Research and Training

06:35:40.792 --> 06:35:43.832
 Model and I want to make one 
other personal note that I 

06:35:43.964 --> 06:35:54.843
engage with collections,
collections, wecollections, we 

06:35:36.751 --> 06:35:38.751
personally

06:35:45.902 --> 06:35:49.367
 I engage with collections in 
data in a number of ways.  I 

06:35:49.368 --> 06:35:54.345
occasionally write code to do 
some analysis and satisfy 

06:35:54.346 --> 06:35:58.935
curiosity and have the data 
visualization.  However, my main

06:35:58.936 --> 06:36:02.662
 job is to work with people, who
 are doing things with 

06:36:03.038 --> 06:36:06.153
collections or want to do things
 with collections and these are 

06:36:06.154 --> 06:36:11.665
both analog and digital 
collections or maybe more 

06:36:12.668 --> 06:36:13.975
precisely to help bring together
 humans who are engaged with  

06:36:13.976 --> 06:36:15.976
data.  data.  So I want to

06:36:17.895 --> 06:36:20.746
 talk about the ways in which we
 are thinking some of the issues

06:36:21.765 --> 06:36:31.650
 that arise in the context of 
this initiative.  Synergies 

06:36:31.651 --> 06:36:33.651
among 

06:36:36.060 --> 06:36:38.455
digital humanities and African 
American history and culture is 

06:36:39.341 --> 06:36:46.943
too long.  We call it the ad hum
 initiative.  It's important 

06:36:46.944 --> 06:36:48.944
that the African American part 
comes first.  

06:36:53.926 --> 06:36:58.725
AADHUM.  So this is our project 
hashtag.

06:36:58.726 --> 06:37:02.131
Where hopefully we will be able 
to have further conversation 

06:37:02.387 --> 06:37:07.112
about the topic.  What you are 
hearing today is also one voice,

06:37:07.658 --> 06:37:12.086
 from what is already a sort of 
large and multi facetted 

06:37:12.242 --> 06:37:15.927
initiative.  This is me.  That 
is my Twitter handle and my 

06:37:16.069 --> 06:37:20.154
contact information.  Of course 
I am also speaking to you as a 

06:37:20.749 --> 06:37:22.749
member of the community, and 
really multiple other 

06:37:23.064 --> 06:37:25.572
communities.  The people who 
have been working hard for two 

06:37:26.438 --> 06:37:29.785
years to make this initiative a 
reality at Maryland, the team of

06:37:30.235 --> 06:37:34.375
 people beyond that, who are now
 joining the project and 

06:37:35.501 --> 06:37:38.547
contributing their skills and 
yet even though this project is 

06:37:38.748 --> 06:37:42.450
only really seven or eight 
months old, already the number 

06:37:42.451 --> 06:37:45.542
of people, the community of 
people who are engaged in this 

06:37:45.740 --> 06:37:49.706
work is quite large.  So I can 
only speak to, you know, the 

06:37:49.886 --> 06:37:53.508
limits of my personal experience
 and my reflections on the work 

06:37:53.974 --> 06:37:56.225
that we are collectively doing 
together and I think it's 

06:37:56.664 --> 06:38:00.996
important not to forget.  That 
we are always in meshed in the 

06:38:01.371 --> 06:38:07.173
larger communities and I will 
come back to that point in a 

06:38:07.403 --> 06:38:14.026
second.  So the website for 
today's event explains in the 

06:38:14.605 --> 06:38:20.488
kind of intro text that the rise
 and the tools of analyzing data

06:38:20.621 --> 06:38:24.041
 has allowed researchers to 
create new models of scholarship

06:38:24.453 --> 06:38:29.032
 and inquiry.  I'm a humanist so
 I can't help but picking at the

06:38:29.308 --> 06:38:33.435
 terms of the debate.  So I 
think that one way we can then 

06:38:34.177 --> 06:38:36.648
understand the communities of 
practice is as one model of 

06:38:36.848 --> 06:38:41.905
these new modes of scholarship 
and inquiry.  Which is to say 

06:38:41.906 --> 06:38:44.582
that communities are part of how
 accessible digital collections 

06:38:44.832 --> 06:38:48.653
may be coupled with or may 
failed to be coupled with tools 

06:38:49.093 --> 06:38:53.085
for processing and analyzing 
data, to do work that matters to

06:38:53.350 --> 06:38:57.682
 other humans.  And so my basic 
premise is that the world of 

06:38:58.275 --> 06:39:03.552
collections and data depends 
upon the design and nurturing of

06:39:04.032 --> 06:39:07.344
 communities and the phrase 
communities of practice, I think

06:39:07.345 --> 06:39:10.562
 is important to realize that 
this is a subset.  Right.  The 

06:39:10.708 --> 06:39:14.251
phrase community and practice is
 a term of art and comes from a 

06:39:14.702 --> 06:39:17.311
particular place.  To sketch 
this history very briefly and to

06:39:17.312 --> 06:39:21.809
 do it absolutely no justice at 
all.  The original Nexus for the

06:39:21.810 --> 06:39:24.880
 context of communities of 
practice is in workplace

06:39:28.842 --> 06:39:33.015
 anthropology and understands 
adult learning and improving 

06:39:33.453 --> 06:39:38.916
adult learning and provides ad 
hoc and improvised ways within 

06:39:39.266 --> 06:39:40.096
workplaces to quote get the job 
done when existing existing 

06:39:40.097 --> 06:39:42.097
knowledge existing knowledge or 
managerial

06:39:44.234 --> 06:39:47.790
 direction falls short and of 
course people who engage with 

06:39:47.791 --> 06:39:51.231
the idea have been interested in
 how these practices create and 

06:39:51.232 --> 06:39:57.312
reshape the identities of 
workers.  And thus surprisingly 

06:39:57.313 --> 06:40:00.977
the communities of practice have
 been taken up and discussed as 

06:40:00.978 --> 06:40:05.010
a managerial tool, especially 
for breaking the traditional 

06:40:05.011 --> 06:40:08.960
barriers and promoting quote 
innovation.  

06:40:08.961 --> 06:40:13.027
Andrew Cox has provided a brief 
overview in the practice in a 

06:40:13.028 --> 06:40:15.508
2005 article in the journal of 
information science for those of

06:40:15.647 --> 06:40:17.803
 you who are interested anymore.

06:40:17.804 --> 06:40:23.426
And the progression that he 
traces is certainly a more and 

06:40:24.695 --> 06:40:29.458
more organizational study, 
managerial approach for the 

06:40:29.835 --> 06:40:32.918
community to practice.  What 
should we take from the career 

06:40:32.919 --> 06:40:36.007
of our community to practice.  
As a concept to take back with 

06:40:36.196 --> 06:40:40.054
us for our reflection on how we 
think about collections of data.

06:40:40.055 --> 06:40:43.851
Certainly there is much to like.
Learning as an active social 

06:40:44.308 --> 06:40:46.810
process, not a mechanical 
transfer of skills and 

06:40:47.528 --> 06:40:49.528
knowledge, the emphasis on

06:40:54.576 --> 06:40:59.680
 improvising the suit and 
breaking down barriers and 

06:41:00.183 --> 06:41:04.403
building among like minded 
folks.  I think the theme around

06:41:05.271 --> 06:41:09.771
 today's event is certainly the 
expression that we feel when we 

06:41:10.731 --> 06:41:14.355
use terms like community 
practice.  And we want to find 

06:41:14.356 --> 06:41:17.743
others that are doing the same 
things we are doing.  That can 

06:41:17.744 --> 06:41:22.538
be beneficial and also block us 
from seeing other things.  What 

06:41:23.797 --> 06:41:27.158
might the two acceptances of 
practice be for thinking about 

06:41:27.702 --> 06:41:31.231
communities in the context of 
collection not allow us to be?  

06:41:31.610 --> 06:41:34.691
I think there is a tendency to 
treat communities of practice as

06:41:34.692 --> 06:41:38.816
 though they might be an 
emergent property of material 

06:41:38.817 --> 06:41:42.362
and method.
Right, if you make materials 

06:41:42.870 --> 06:41:45.556
available and you have people 
who might be expert in certain 

06:41:46.414 --> 06:41:49.188
methods or who are becoming 
expert in certain methods, they 

06:41:49.430 --> 06:41:53.003
will find each other.  They will
 do amazing things and certainly

06:41:53.004 --> 06:41:57.109
 that is true.  And some of the 
central scholarship in community

06:41:57.627 --> 06:42:01.438
 in practice can be read to 
support the quazi emergent idea.

06:42:01.649 --> 06:42:05.766
But in my experience, this is 
really almost never the case.  

06:42:06.315 --> 06:42:09.738
We are not seeing something 
important that is actually 

06:42:09.949 --> 06:42:12.493
happening.  It's important to 
remind ourselves that 

06:42:12.875 --> 06:42:18.288
communities are not spontaneous 
or organic.  And to quote the 

06:42:18.289 --> 06:42:22.135
wonderful critical theorist 
Miranda Joseph who has written 

06:42:22.870 --> 06:42:25.938
beautifully on the idea, to 
invoke community is to engage 

06:42:25.939 --> 06:42:30.131
the question of belonging and 
power.  And that I think is one 

06:42:30.680 --> 06:42:37.155
area in which the work we're 
doing within the AADHUM 

06:42:37.514 --> 06:42:40.905
initiative is asking us to push 
beyond the communities and 

06:42:40.906 --> 06:42:44.426
practice that we have inherited 
in the organizational context.  

06:42:44.632 --> 06:42:48.754
In the context it notoriously 
has done little to work with 

06:42:49.036 --> 06:42:55.784
power of notion and dominance 
which is an important element of

06:42:55.943 --> 06:42:57.795
 the community that is we live 
in.  It's important to 

06:42:57.796 --> 06:43:00.112
understand that communities of 
practice are always communities 

06:43:00.113 --> 06:43:05.968
within other communities.  The 
work of designing them, because 

06:43:05.969 --> 06:43:07.969
it is intentional design and

06:43:10.318 --> 06:43:14.283
 nurturing them will be done in 
the communities which we already

06:43:14.795 --> 06:43:17.111
 live, the destruction of power 
and relationships between people

06:43:17.378 --> 06:43:21.403
 of different backgrounds and 
experiences that exist already. 

06:43:22.081 --> 06:43:27.091
We don't get to sort of wipe the
 plate clean and work in narrow 

06:43:27.803 --> 06:43:30.421
technical terms about community 
of practice as if they were not 

06:43:30.645 --> 06:43:33.125
implicated in the American 
community, the DC community, 

06:43:33.448 --> 06:43:36.654
whatever community we find 
ourselves living in, the campus 

06:43:36.655 --> 06:43:40.290
community, that we have to sort 
of take this into account in 

06:43:40.505 --> 06:43:46.144
terms of both designs and 
nurturing.  It may be not 

06:43:46.523 --> 06:43:52.127
everyone in the community comes 
to work with the same sort of 

06:43:52.285 --> 06:43:54.804
emotional experience of things 
happening out there in the 

06:43:55.117 --> 06:44:00.159
world.  And so this is why it's 
imperative not to get the active

06:44:02.276 --> 06:44:05.495
 work of community development 
fall below the intention and 

06:44:05.839 --> 06:44:08.440
this work demands every bit as 
much for the collection and 

06:44:09.236 --> 06:44:11.725
development of tools and we are 
responsible for the communities 

06:44:12.287 --> 06:44:17.419
we create or fail to create.  I 
think listening to the talk 

06:44:17.740 --> 06:44:20.862
earlier, you know, we are 
working towards being maybe a 

06:44:22.425 --> 06:44:23.133
little bit more like the the fan
 the fan 

06:44:23.134 --> 06:44:26.417
section communities that we are 
hearing about and that might 

06:44:27.895 --> 06:44:31.102
look different from the way that
 we understand the communities 

06:44:31.103 --> 06:44:36.582
of senior scholars and academics
 of the public.  So to try and 

06:44:36.733 --> 06:44:39.817
explain a little bit more of 
what I mean in concrete terms, I

06:44:40.925 --> 06:44:44.413
 will say a little more on how 
we working through the 

06:44:44.414 --> 06:44:50.463
challenges in the AADHUM.  It's 
funded by a grant through the 

06:44:50.464 --> 06:44:53.098
Andrew W. 
Melon foundation and we are in 

06:44:53.099 --> 06:44:59.998
one year of three years of work.
The work of AADHUM is led the 

06:45:00.584 --> 06:45:05.069
center for Synergy and the 
humanities of myth or the 

06:45:05.746 --> 06:45:07.746
direction of my boss Neil and 
also partnering in the 

06:45:08.216 --> 06:45:12.342
initiative are the center for 
global migration studies, the 

06:45:12.669 --> 06:45:18.389
David C. Driscol center and the 
culture for African Americans as

06:45:18.607 --> 06:45:22.855
 well as the library where I 
report to my other boss and the 

06:45:23.639 --> 06:45:28.405
work is led by our faculty 
member and includes post 

06:45:28.841 --> 06:45:32.021
doctoral associates, research 
faculty and staff and advisory 

06:45:32.408 --> 06:45:34.889
board of scholars for multiple 
disciplines in the African 

06:45:35.788 --> 06:45:39.090
American culture of history and 
librarians have the assistance 

06:45:39.620 --> 06:45:44.106
and we hope that faculty 
students and members of the 

06:45:45.296 --> 06:45:49.839
wider community that we hope to 
fold in.  And it's worth saying 

06:45:50.059 --> 06:45:56.121
since Harriett mentioned that 
the incubator which is part of 

06:45:56.122 --> 06:45:59.321
the initiative, where we have 
gone from the first generation 

06:45:59.725 --> 06:46:03.343
where it was gone from building 
up skills and capacity along our

06:46:03.344 --> 06:46:05.946
 librarians to a model where 
everyone is all mixed together. 

06:46:05.947 --> 06:46:09.475
And we take on that greater 
challenge of having all of these

06:46:09.476 --> 06:46:13.844
 people mixed together with 
their different experiences and 

06:46:14.025 --> 06:46:16.414
expertise because ultimately I 
think that is the way that we 

06:46:16.974 --> 06:46:17.307
need to be working and for the 
goals of the AADHUM initiative 

06:46:17.308 --> 06:46:19.308
initiative is initiative is to 
advance and expand the

06:46:21.600 --> 06:46:27.199
 fields of digital humanity and 
African American cultural 

06:46:27.345 --> 06:46:31.128
studies and develop the pipeline
 for the next generation of 

06:46:31.436 --> 06:46:34.017
scholars who engage in the 
intersection.  Which is to say 

06:46:34.388 --> 06:46:36.737
that we are directly engaged in 
building communities of 

06:46:37.046 --> 06:46:41.662
practice, in building 
communities and that the 

06:46:42.004 --> 06:46:46.144
communities will be a measure of
 our project as much as any of 

06:46:47.584 --> 06:46:50.430
the scholarship whether it be a 
project or public

06:46:53.785 --> 06:46:56.287
 programming that we also 
produce.  We be willing to be 

06:46:56.288 --> 06:46:59.232
measured by the community we are
 making.  That is a critical 

06:46:59.233 --> 06:47:04.828
part of the work that the grant 
has set itself out to do.  So 

06:47:04.829 --> 06:47:09.685
rather than produce a single 
research project, AADHUM seeks 

06:47:09.686 --> 06:47:12.603
to transform the African 
American community and the 

06:47:12.604 --> 06:47:15.313
social studies field.  To 
accomplish this goal we will do 

06:47:15.314 --> 06:47:19.522
a number of things, foster 
scholars and students and 

06:47:19.523 --> 06:47:24.148
working at the intersection and 
will facilitate and creating and

06:47:25.368 --> 06:47:27.368
 revising new sources at the 
University of Maryland in 

06:47:28.550 --> 06:47:30.423
disciplines related to African 
American history and culture 

06:47:30.424 --> 06:47:35.582
which is frankly all of them.  
And to provide training and 

06:47:36.490 --> 06:47:38.332
development opportunities to 
support local and regional 

06:47:38.333 --> 06:47:40.700
participants in receiving and 
producing the research, and I 

06:47:40.701 --> 06:47:43.778
will come to that part in a 
second.  We are also planning to

06:47:43.779 --> 06:47:45.701
 organize the national 
conference to bring together 

06:47:45.702 --> 06:47:49.589
those parts of the network that 
we can -- who are doing digital 

06:47:49.590 --> 06:47:54.175
research like this, that we can 
touch and we can reach, and to 

06:47:54.176 --> 06:47:58.059
oversee the digitization and 
description at the Driscol 

06:47:58.060 --> 06:48:03.990
center and the ASCLOR archive at
 the library that are relevant 

06:48:03.991 --> 06:48:09.384
to research, labor, migration 
and artistic expression which 

06:48:09.385 --> 06:48:13.036
are the core themes which we are
 organizing our work and I want 

06:48:13.037 --> 06:48:17.329
to stop here and say also that 
this is only sort of the latest 

06:48:17.330 --> 06:48:20.223
entry in work that many people 
have been doing for a very long 

06:48:20.435 --> 06:48:25.182
time.  Right, again, we're not 
wiping the plate clean.  We're 

06:48:25.183 --> 06:48:29.466
not newly bringing into being 
this collaborative community for

06:48:30.124 --> 06:48:32.976
 people working into digital 
ways and people studying African

06:48:32.977 --> 06:48:35.391
 American histories and life.  
There is a long history of such 

06:48:36.096 --> 06:48:39.504
work and we are happy to be 
joining that conversation.  

06:48:39.505 --> 06:48:44.155
Trying to do our part.  So let 
the central point be lost in all

06:48:44.330 --> 06:48:50.571
 of these details.  The way that
 I would describe our community 

06:48:50.572 --> 06:48:53.106
of practice, our community, 
AADHUM is a community invested 

06:48:53.516 --> 06:48:57.272
in the study of African American
 history and culture.  And I 

06:48:57.273 --> 06:48:59.706
want to phrase it that way 
because I think that often 

06:48:59.707 --> 06:49:04.068
because of the history of the 
term communities of practice, we

06:49:04.069 --> 06:49:11.041
 find ourselves using it in far 
too technical intent.  That it's

06:49:11.807 --> 06:49:16.161
 about skill transfer or 
achieving some sort of 

06:49:16.162 --> 06:49:22.770
organizational mission.  And so 
we are putting the idea of all 

06:49:22.771 --> 06:49:26.137
of the different ways that we 
can use digital methods and 

06:49:26.517 --> 06:49:28.966
tools and digital collection to 
study African American history 

06:49:28.967 --> 06:49:32.152
and culture at the center.  And 
by no means does that mean we 

06:49:32.464 --> 06:49:37.175
are giving up being invested in 
a vision of digital work, that 

06:49:37.755 --> 06:49:41.738
explores new ways of using 
computing and informed by you 

06:49:41.739 --> 06:49:45.099
know, the scholars who have 
studied African American history

06:49:45.100 --> 06:49:49.961
 and culture before the project 
even began.  And a lot of the 

06:49:49.962 --> 06:49:53.990
work right now is sort of 
imagining the programming that 

06:49:54.287 --> 06:49:59.121
we call the digital humanities 
incubator because we have it 

06:49:59.308 --> 06:50:02.054
from the past and my colleagues

06:50:05.656 --> 06:50:09.843
 Catherine and Lynne are doing 
this work and I am reflecting 

06:50:10.038 --> 06:50:15.583
the work they are doing and the 
incubators has been an evolving 

06:50:16.297 --> 06:50:19.679
process where we focus on the 
idea of incubating project 

06:50:19.941 --> 06:50:23.362
ideas.  Building particularly 
skills and capacities such that 

06:50:23.770 --> 06:50:26.923
librarians can do digital 
projects.  And that had some 

06:50:27.214 --> 06:50:29.645
positives as far as they went.  
But then the next time you got a

06:50:29.646 --> 06:50:32.489
 chance to run this it 
programming we decided that we 

06:50:32.960 --> 06:50:35.959
would put the data at the 
center, and that has been a new 

06:50:36.287 --> 06:50:40.910
idea that has sort of stuck with
 us.  Right.  That we put the 

06:50:41.323 --> 06:50:44.869
data in the center and asked our
 community all of the ways in 

06:50:45.082 --> 06:50:49.959
which they might wish to respond
 to it, without presuming that 

06:50:49.960 --> 06:50:54.062
we know particular methods or 
techniques that we need to 

06:50:55.234 --> 06:50:58.848
communicate outward to them.  
The scholar of visual culture at

06:50:59.813 --> 06:51:03.349
 Laura Wexler makes a nice point
 with regard to crowd sources 

06:51:03.350 --> 06:51:06.523
and talking about how we go 
beyond sort of using the crowd 

06:51:06.524 --> 06:51:08.975
for data collection or data 
production and being open to all

06:51:09.400 --> 06:51:13.248
 of the other ways in which the 
community might wish to respond 

06:51:13.249 --> 06:51:17.967
to a given data center or given 
collection and also be open to 

06:51:18.460 --> 06:51:23.014
taking that in.  Even if it goes
 beyond simple transcription.  

06:51:23.413 --> 06:51:28.768
The idea of the incubate is 
evolving, we are evolving this 

06:51:29.274 --> 06:51:33.295
idea with the ethics of building
 a community fully in mind.  So 

06:51:33.719 --> 06:51:36.669
this perhaps means, how do we 
stay in touch with people who 

06:51:37.271 --> 06:51:39.898
come into contact with us or 
engaging with us for longer than

06:51:40.265 --> 06:51:44.200
 we might, if it was simply 
skills training.  How do we 

06:51:44.201 --> 06:51:47.588
build an ongoing relationship.  
Another aspect of it is, where 

06:51:47.589 --> 06:51:51.410
do we do this work?  Right.  We 
are all sort of embodied people.

06:51:51.411 --> 06:51:55.804
And the spaces in which we do 
this work and who else is in the

06:51:56.188 --> 06:51:59.033
 room, and a lot about who can 
access and feel like they are 

06:51:59.415 --> 06:52:09.398
part of the committee.  That is 
an aspect that we are really 

06:52:09.680 --> 06:52:18.386
thinking about and there are 
some key practitioners who have 

06:52:19.111 --> 06:52:24.532
the partsdesign and citing the 
feminist in technology that says

06:52:24.694 --> 06:52:26.688
 we need to get need to get away
 need to get away from

06:52:26.689 --> 06:52:31.877
 viewing things as discrete 
objects and network devices and 

06:52:31.878 --> 06:52:37.395
instead view design work as 
quote entry development into 

06:52:37.396 --> 06:52:40.349
regulations including context 
and alliances that make 

06:52:40.350 --> 06:52:48.505
technical systems possible and 
as in Helgram Write this is hard

06:52:49.677 --> 06:52:52.292
 design work or various 
practices and technology can 

06:52:52.293 --> 06:52:55.735
currently under go change and 
demand what they call continuous

06:52:55.736 --> 06:52:59.386
 infrastructuring and aligning 
of partly conflicting interest. 

06:52:59.387 --> 06:53:03.166
 So I think it's useful to think
 about the work we do about 

06:53:03.167 --> 06:53:05.167
building community 

06:53:07.041 --> 06:53:09.165
around the collections, around 
the data as the work of 

06:53:10.804 --> 06:53:15.324
continuous infrastructuring and 
think about the people in if our

06:53:16.540 --> 06:53:19.948
 communities and the work that 
they are having, the goals that 

06:53:20.333 --> 06:53:22.333
they have, the work that they  
they have.  they have.  And the

06:53:22.512 --> 06:53:24.512
 infrastructure that we do, how 
how do how do we imagine

06:53:26.727 --> 06:53:29.052
 aligning all of the conflicting
 interest and not getting caught

06:53:29.381 --> 06:53:33.691
 up in the rush of finding 
people who are just doing things

06:53:34.126 --> 06:53:36.886
 like us, but think about doing 
the hard design work of 

06:53:36.887 --> 06:53:39.052
continuous infrastructuring or 
designing

06:53:42.961 --> 06:53:46.423
 and nurturing communities.  
Just as a closing thought, 

06:53:46.662 --> 06:53:51.065
communities of practice may be a
 fine starting point to how we 

06:53:51.905 --> 06:53:56.769
imagine access and youth model. 
It can't be the stopping point. 

06:53:56.952 --> 06:54:00.246
It's between 20 and 30 years old
 and of course does not make it 

06:54:00.564 --> 06:54:03.982
out dated in the humanities and 
people have had a lot of 

06:54:03.983 --> 06:54:07.011
interesting things then.  And in
 the spirit of being good 

06:54:08.100 --> 06:54:10.100
interdisciplinary borrowers, we 
should try to engage those ideas

06:54:10.273 --> 06:54:12.923
 as well and that is 
particularly important as we do 

06:54:13.132 --> 06:54:18.091
this.  To think about how we 
make collections as data into 

06:54:18.092 --> 06:54:23.027
what Miranda Joseph calls 
legitimate sites of empathy and 

06:54:23.028 --> 06:54:25.028
concern.  
Thank you.  [Applause]

06:54:53.863 --> 06:54:55.863
person.  So just

06:55:01.665 --> 06:55:04.946
 give me a moment.  I will go as
 far as to say the dream is dead

06:55:11.701 --> 06:55:14.697
 but it's not thriving.  
Unfortunately I have my bag.  My

06:55:14.989 --> 06:55:16.989
 mommy

06:55:23.496 --> 06:55:25.496
 bag of 

06:55:33.924 --> 06:55:36.671
dongles.  I have been interested
 today in sort of thinking about

06:55:36.908 --> 06:55:40.231
 how things can be pulled 
together, right.  I am not here 

06:55:40.575 --> 06:55:43.058
necessarily to pull things 
together, but I am always 

06:55:43.345 --> 06:55:45.345
interested.  This is when the 
problems are coming at the end 

06:55:45.838 --> 06:55:48.751
of the day, I am always sort of 
interested in where we can find 

06:55:50.121 --> 06:55:53.740
connections between the things 
that have always been said.  

06:55:53.930 --> 06:55:57.169
This is the way that it's the 
end of the day and there is so 

06:55:57.541 --> 06:56:01.794
much to say because I am hyper 
stimulated by all of the stuff 

06:56:01.951 --> 06:56:06.127
that people have said before, so
 I want to begin today by 

06:56:07.024 --> 06:56:11.510
thinking about the kinds of 
issues that emerge when we think

06:56:11.511 --> 06:56:13.556
 about data as a personal 
matter.

06:56:13.557 --> 06:56:16.431
Often we speak of collections at
 large and thinking about small 

06:56:16.942 --> 06:56:21.802
things.  Right, there is a way 
in which we talk about 

06:56:22.518 --> 06:56:25.170
collections when we think about 
digital humanities and work and 

06:56:25.487 --> 06:56:28.532
archives and so on.  When you 
are thinking about the raw 

06:56:29.055 --> 06:56:31.055
material that constitutes 
collections, you are often 

06:56:31.252 --> 06:56:33.252
talking about personal 

06:56:36.471 --> 06:56:38.375
things.  
Right.  At some point much of 

06:56:38.376 --> 06:56:41.463
what we refer to in collections 
is personal.  That's what I want

06:56:41.464 --> 06:56:44.928
 to talk about today.  
Collections, the boxes of 

06:56:45.239 --> 06:56:48.977
receipts, piles of play bills in
 someone's closet.  I had the 

06:56:49.146 --> 06:56:52.448
huge privilege of being able to 
go to the national museum of 

06:56:52.920 --> 06:56:54.920
African American history and 
culture opening this weekend and

06:56:55.111 --> 06:56:58.831
 a lot was made I think 
rightfully of how so much of 

06:56:59.052 --> 06:57:02.155
this sort of material history 
has been left out of 

06:57:02.392 --> 06:57:06.636
conversation because it has been
 flown away in the addicts of 

06:57:06.786 --> 06:57:08.220
people in the conversations 
previously.

06:57:08.221 --> 06:57:11.673
So it is really sort of weighing
 on me as we prepare to talk and

06:57:12.319 --> 06:57:14.714
 think about collections.  I 
also want to think about what is

06:57:14.715 --> 06:57:18.934
 gained and loss in a transition
 from one kind of space to a 

06:57:19.213 --> 06:57:23.789
local and a personal and to 
other kinds of uses, the 

06:57:23.982 --> 06:57:29.652
archivals to computational and 
so on.  Even though I refer not 

06:57:29.653 --> 06:57:35.795
to belabor the usually dicotomy 
I pulled the term Datum story 

06:57:37.168 --> 06:57:42.804
telling because it helps me 
think about data, to reveal 

06:57:44.948 --> 06:57:53.904
theestheestheestheestheescavated
 and think about what is at 

06:57:53.905 --> 06:57:58.843
stake in control and management 
and thereof.  If we accept that 

06:57:58.844 --> 06:58:04.092
there is value in data, we need 
to accept that our lives are 

06:58:04.093 --> 06:58:09.745
strings of data.  I am thinking 
here of reason work.  

06:58:09.746 --> 06:58:15.739
The work done by Louis Pulvacich
 and each artist goes through 

06:58:15.740 --> 06:58:19.374
all kinds of personal 
information and conveys the 

06:58:19.375 --> 06:58:22.628
personal information tracked 
over a week into hand-drawn data

06:58:23.396 --> 06:58:26.364
 visualization.  I found this 
super interesting, right.  I 

06:58:26.365 --> 06:58:29.598
will put it back so you can see 
a little more.  I found this 

06:58:29.760 --> 06:58:32.090
super interesting because there 
is a way in which you took this 

06:58:32.802 --> 06:58:35.797
notion of tracking, right, the 
watch you wear, the wearables 

06:58:35.964 --> 06:58:41.285
and so on and made it back to 
what we usually think of as an 

06:58:41.286 --> 06:58:43.970
analog art.  Right.  So I was 
interested in how they talk 

06:58:44.135 --> 06:58:49.601
about it as well.  This is a 
quote.  We have also conceived 

06:58:49.862 --> 06:58:52.840
their data as a personal 
documentary.  Rather than the 

06:58:53.522 --> 06:58:56.872
quantified self-project which is
 a subtle but important 

06:58:57.442 --> 06:59:00.001
distinction.  And instead of 
using data to become more 

06:59:00.341 --> 06:59:04.400
efficient, we argue we use data 
to become more humane and to 

06:59:04.626 --> 06:59:09.717
connect with ourselves at a 
deeper level.  Life is partly 

06:59:09.718 --> 06:59:14.745
the data and still transformed 
and produces nearly liable law 

06:59:14.926 --> 06:59:19.027
material for art, story and 
visualization.  In dear data, 

06:59:19.380 --> 06:59:24.953
each datum is self-consciously 
employed to tell a story.  Datum

06:59:25.174 --> 06:59:31.150
 story telling then is a way of 
thinking about intentionally in 

06:59:31.151 --> 06:59:32.917
the archival development and 
without losing at the same time,

06:59:32.918 --> 06:59:37.957
 the people, despite of the 
human.  And later on I want to 

06:59:38.165 --> 06:59:41.080
interrogate the notion of the 
human a little bit.  But for now

06:59:41.416 --> 06:59:44.329
 we will go with it, right.  
When thinking about the data, 

06:59:44.330 --> 06:59:48.656
the human, the person is a 
reference.  And I'm thinking of 

06:59:49.277 --> 06:59:54.072
a person who can self-manage, 
disseminate and remix the trays.

06:59:54.234 --> 06:59:55.425
This reminds me of the work that
 we know happens at every at 

06:59:55.426 --> 06:59:57.426
every  at every age.  
Telling

06:59:59.389 --> 07:00:03.108
 stories and telling to our 
personal collections, rounds our

07:00:03.109 --> 07:00:07.731
 sense of self very much, in the
 sense of what is familiar and 

07:00:07.732 --> 07:00:15.214
the metaphor I use for it is 
digging in the crate.  The 

07:00:15.876 --> 07:00:17.940
archive that you are constantly 
digging through and you are 

07:00:18.138 --> 07:00:21.990
digging through it in the 
interest of being able to show 

07:00:22.428 --> 07:00:26.157
people something new.  So the 
archival is specifically 

07:00:22.365 --> 07:00:31.305
specifically  specifically 
deployed and it sounds very old.

07:00:34.571 --> 07:00:36.571
It

07:00:38.540 --> 07:00:40.540
 sounds

07:00:42.931 --> 07:00:44.931
 corny

07:00:47.838 --> 07:00:49.838
 when

07:00:52.979 --> 07:00:54.979
 you

07:00:58.292 --> 07:01:00.292
 say

07:01:03.746 --> 07:01:35.098
 it  like that like that but

07:00:34.260 --> 07:00:35.054
 when you

07:00:35.055 --> 07:00:37.974
 are there, it's the 
meaningfulness. 

07:00:37.975 --> 07:00:41.727
And it's corny.  It's this old 
sort of -- God it was really 

07:00:41.902 --> 07:00:44.909
embarrassing.  I was looking for
 it and it was essentially a 

07:00:44.910 --> 07:00:47.899
coke commercial that had would 
be in a moment of marketing and 

07:00:47.900 --> 07:00:52.821
it was the own sort of, you 
know, Mary J. Blige and method 

07:00:52.822 --> 07:00:54.834
man commercial and in the 
commercial they were playing the

07:00:55.037 --> 07:00:58.777
 song, you are all I need to get
 by and there were kids up 

07:00:58.778 --> 07:01:01.256
stairs looking for the hip hop 
version and the grand parents 

07:01:02.560 --> 07:01:07.665
downstairs listening to the 
Marvin gains version and they 

07:01:07.666 --> 07:01:11.901
have the floor, up stairs, right
 and you have the kids jumping 

07:01:11.902 --> 07:01:16.739
up and down stairs they are like
 yes, they finally found the 

07:01:16.740 --> 07:01:19.652
truth.  So the notion of digging
 the crate is always found 

07:01:19.653 --> 07:01:23.358
really interesting.
And I think it's useful for 

07:01:23.970 --> 07:01:29.213
thinking about the individual 
making choices to generational 

07:01:29.214 --> 07:01:35.243
and communities.  It also brings
 the idea of duration and the 

07:01:36.001 --> 07:01:42.106
idea of the past itself is a 
collection because of the 

07:01:42.107 --> 07:01:46.011
historical contour.  The crate 
brings with us the joy of 

07:01:46.306 --> 07:01:51.198
discovery, a joy amplified by 
what the discovery will enable. 

07:01:51.628 --> 07:01:54.699
What is more difficult to 
conceptualize is the limits.  

07:01:54.700 --> 07:01:59.786
There should be a limit to that 
digging.  And in titled the 

07:02:00.882 --> 07:02:01.603
digital afterdigital after life
digital after life of

07:02:01.604 --> 07:02:08.106
 lost family photos, described 
the work done, you can see it 

07:02:08.107 --> 07:02:12.990
here on the screen, called faded
 resistance.  There is profound 

07:02:13.151 --> 07:02:15.151
photographs of African 
Americans, and what I was 

07:02:15.836 --> 07:02:19.570
talking about in terms of the 
stuff in flee markets, right, 

07:02:20.177 --> 07:02:26.633
the collection of photographs, 
so no one knows to whom they 

07:02:26.634 --> 07:02:29.680
belong but we know my virtue 
that they are important to 

07:02:30.050 --> 07:02:33.643
someone, how do we fill that 
gap?  How do we think about 

07:02:33.644 --> 07:02:38.010
this?  The anecdote is released 
in the project and we might 

07:02:38.230 --> 07:02:40.957
experience a transition from 
data to datum in the 

07:02:41.344 --> 07:02:45.236
increasingly digital life world.
Who took these photos?  Who do 

07:02:45.774 --> 07:02:48.965
they depict?  The basic 
conceptual details we would have

07:02:49.673 --> 07:02:53.189
 usually expected from snapshots
 that are missing here.  The 

07:02:53.464 --> 07:02:58.389
absence of this information is 
bitter sweet.  We

07:03:02.754 --> 07:03:04.754
 are 

07:03:05.780 --> 07:03:10.399
bewilded and there was a 
surprising term.

07:03:10.400 --> 07:03:13.188
The facial recognition 
technology began to match them 

07:03:13.189 --> 07:03:20.319
with real people.  We were not 
sure who wassure who was doing

07:03:10.125 --> 07:03:12.125
sure who was doing the tagging, 
intrigue

07:03:16.768 --> 07:03:23.695
d and worried he sent a message 
to one of the individuals who 

07:03:23.696 --> 07:03:26.852
was tagged in several of the 
pictures.  There was no 

07:03:27.062 --> 07:03:30.438
response. A few weeks later he 
got a request that he take the 

07:03:30.439 --> 07:03:33.048
pictures down.  Of the 
experience he had already been 

07:03:33.254 --> 07:03:39.896
thinking about how databases and
 tags are not neutral.  How can 

07:03:40.403 --> 07:03:43.933
they wind up being hostile 
towards communities of color.  I

07:03:44.093 --> 07:03:47.280
 can totally understand.  Quote 
this man was saying we are not 

07:03:48.027 --> 07:03:54.237
really participants.  The black 
body is used as a commodity and 

07:03:54.802 --> 07:03:57.903
something prevailed.  You are 
not welcome.  This is not art.  

07:03:58.230 --> 07:04:00.702
Get the hell out of our lives 
and I understood it.  Insofar as

07:04:00.935 --> 07:04:06.269
 the collection that speaks 
curation we can think about the 

07:04:06.813 --> 07:04:13.473
rightful sense of danger and the
 danger and the very danger and 

07:04:04.419 --> 07:04:06.419
the very idea of being

07:04:09.942 --> 07:04:13.119
 collected might bring and the 
invasive work of conversion is 

07:04:13.120 --> 07:04:18.086
the object of moments into data 
and the parsing and the 

07:04:18.461 --> 07:04:22.075
combined.  It's important to 
note that I am actually quite a 

07:04:22.076 --> 07:04:25.181
technical person so it's a 
shadow technical talk behind and

07:04:29.533 --> 07:04:34.542
thisityity I'm talking about 
data.  I am thinking will JSON 

07:04:34.543 --> 07:04:39.379
and the ways in which we break 
larger things down into smaller 

07:04:39.749 --> 07:04:42.474
compartmentalized mixable units,
 right, the shadow behind it, 

07:04:42.635 --> 07:04:45.679
like the tech shadow.  But I 
only have so much time so I am 

07:04:45.850 --> 07:04:50.639
rushing through the other part 
for now.  I wish I can have a 

07:04:51.890 --> 07:04:55.745
super hero name.  Like tech 
shadow, whatever.  Sorry.  I am 

07:04:56.698 --> 07:05:00.137
also taking with the problem of 
disappearance which by the 

07:05:00.138 --> 07:05:00.238
thought works against this work.
work.

07:05:00.239 --> 07:05:02.239
Andwork.
And one examples has

07:05:04.045 --> 07:05:06.753
 the code turn to, actually it's
 this one.

07:05:06.754 --> 07:05:11.841
This photo.  As you read the 
back of this photo, he says 

07:05:12.164 --> 07:05:16.226
quote it's suggested that it's 
paced into an album and that 

07:05:16.642 --> 07:05:20.312
it's ripped out and people who 
are familiar with this even 

07:05:21.181 --> 07:05:24.959
through the blackness that shows
 the particular kind of glue 

07:05:24.960 --> 07:05:28.284
that was made to last and then 
it was nonetheless ripped out.  

07:05:29.008 --> 07:05:31.195
Right, how do we map and mark 
the transition?  How do we think

07:05:31.353 --> 07:05:38.502
 about it as well.  This is no 
glue stick decision.  As equally

07:05:38.704 --> 07:05:43.713
 significant then to us in this 
image is hidden from us.  Much 

07:05:43.714 --> 07:05:48.438
of what is at stake in example 
comes down to ownership.  The 

07:05:48.645 --> 07:05:51.894
idea of personal collection is 
an exercise in exclusion.  

07:05:51.895 --> 07:05:55.805
Right.  My example is I have 
been doing work for the last few

07:05:55.806 --> 07:05:58.943
 years and butler managed the 
archives which is just amazing 

07:05:59.353 --> 07:06:02.308
but whenever I am working at 
some point I am overwhelmed by 

07:06:02.309 --> 07:06:05.466
the sense that I have to be 
careful and thinking about the 

07:06:05.665 --> 07:06:09.212
archive as her collection.  It's
 a collection of her stuff.  But

07:06:09.645 --> 07:06:16.601
 insofar as she died suddenly 
and unexpectedly and young.  

07:06:17.348 --> 07:06:19.872
Researchers live with the fact 
that she had little hand in the 

07:06:20.694 --> 07:06:25.234
duration.  I wonder what she 
would have thrown away, little 

07:06:25.407 --> 07:06:29.656
flips of paper and receipt and 
all kinds of information, right.

07:06:30.066 --> 07:06:35.005
On one hand it's for researchers
 like me but because she so 

07:06:35.587 --> 07:06:37.826
carefully practiced her life, I 
know that her delusions would 

07:06:38.154 --> 07:06:42.014
have probably be just as 
instructive, as a

07:07:03.123 --> 07:07:12.543
 somewhat  somewhat incluesist
inclusivity.  Digging in the 

07:06:57.636 --> 07:06:57.812
crates and permission that can't
 always co-exist when thinking 

07:06:57.813 --> 07:07:00.730
of the path.  Many have taken 
the ethical questions of taking 

07:07:00.731 --> 07:07:03.715
the archives and so on and I 
want to think about this for a 

07:07:03.716 --> 07:07:11.058
moment as a way of introducing 
the mission mission of mission 

07:07:00.507 --> 07:07:02.507
of how we

07:07:06.042 --> 07:07:08.042
 might mourn in the midst of 
opportunity

07:07:10.964 --> 07:07:14.661
 so I will move on.  At the 
forefront of thinking about 

07:07:14.662 --> 07:07:17.202
purpose in the in most digital 
works and the commitment to open

07:07:17.341 --> 07:07:20.600
 as we hear this a lot, it's 
important works and many of us 

07:07:20.601 --> 07:07:25.495
pointed out, unlock some of the 
negative oppressive ownership 

07:07:25.496 --> 07:07:27.496
relation

07:07:28.652 --> 07:07:32.365
 with resource-enabled entities 
collecting with willing and 

07:07:32.735 --> 07:07:35.646
sometimes not others where you 
get all of your stuff.  

07:07:35.647 --> 07:07:38.472
Regardless the openness and 
publicness and access on a hall 

07:07:38.690 --> 07:07:40.993
mark with the colonial 
approaches to archive making, 

07:07:41.245 --> 07:07:43.779
and I believe they are.  I am 
also nonetheless interested in 

07:07:47.562 --> 07:07:49.678
the meaningfulness of exclusion,
 illusion and deletion and 

07:07:50.431 --> 07:07:53.011
sometimes in the name of the 
narrative making.  The 

07:07:53.669 --> 07:07:56.258
meaningfulness, in other words, 
the story telling.  I am 

07:07:56.744 --> 07:08:01.495
thinking here is Michelle 
Caldwell's work and thinking 

07:08:01.749 --> 07:08:06.915
about the employment through the
 archival materials.  The 

07:08:07.197 --> 07:08:09.918
theoretical foundations for 
community-based archives, 

07:08:10.927 --> 07:08:14.482
reminds us that quote the memory
 archives are not just memory 

07:08:14.680 --> 07:08:20.509
activists but visionares whose 
work receives space and time.  

07:08:20.852 --> 07:08:24.039
In the lining archival work with
 memory and the future, rather 

07:08:24.541 --> 07:08:31.718
than only the historical 
recovery of the past, Caldwell 

07:08:32.036 --> 07:08:35.046
gets us to think about our own 
archival project and quote not 

07:08:35.385 --> 07:08:38.929
just about documenting a more 
diverse identity of the past 

07:08:39.115 --> 07:08:41.598
based on the present but rather 
by uncovering previously untold,

07:08:42.379 --> 07:08:45.192
 ignored or misinterpreted 
history, communities can imagine

07:08:45.518 --> 07:08:48.198
 and reimagine different 
trajectories for the future so 

07:08:48.500 --> 07:08:51.641
it's not just enough to say we 
are going to expand our archives

07:08:52.461 --> 07:08:54.694
 by putting all people into it. 

07:08:54.695 --> 07:08:58.750
Right.  The notion of 
empowerment is about making the 

07:08:59.042 --> 07:09:01.543
archive available in such a way 
that it can be done by the 

07:09:02.349 --> 07:09:04.349
communities that need it most.  
Right.  It's an important 

07:09:04.414 --> 07:09:06.147
distinct.  Thinking about  about
 this, about this, 

07:09:06.148 --> 07:09:10.762
I would argue, gives us the 
generic possibility of eliciting

07:09:11.272 --> 07:09:16.626
 data, computationally.  And 
it's also titled network 

07:09:16.627 --> 07:09:21.521
knowledge and digital spaces, 
methodology and Emily

07:09:24.963 --> 07:09:28.779
 asked us to think about quote 
story telling is knowledge 

07:09:28.780 --> 07:09:31.759
making in a place of knowing 
it's not the place of one 

07:09:31.760 --> 07:09:35.212
individual who has passed down 
to others instead it's the 

07:09:35.540 --> 07:09:37.540
network state in the role of the
 community as the knowledge 

07:09:37.755 --> 07:09:43.243
partner.  Again, I offer not all
 of this as a commentary on the 

07:09:43.244 --> 07:09:45.935
difference between story telling
 and the local versus data and 

07:09:46.329 --> 07:09:47.325
the machine or something, but 
that if we are thinking about  

07:09:47.326 --> 07:09:49.326
about how to about how to 
decolonize what

07:09:53.605 --> 07:09:58.918
 is collected, we must be 
thinking about knowledge 

07:09:58.919 --> 07:10:02.058
transfer and thinking about 
different design and interface. 

07:10:02.524 --> 07:10:06.349
 The motion quote of knowledge 
is seated in the context and 

07:10:06.350 --> 07:10:09.646
emerges when we're supposed to 
listen to it.  The idea, right, 

07:10:09.647 --> 07:10:12.662
is that you can't necessarily 
approach an archive already 

07:10:12.663 --> 07:10:13.244
knowing what you are expecting 
to get.  A proper  proper 

07:10:13.245 --> 07:10:15.245
archive is proper archive is 
something that comes

07:10:16.838 --> 07:10:23.162
 up all day today, right, the 
idea, right for the archives is 

07:10:29.044 --> 07:10:32.148
a depository teaching you that 
you are not going to know what 

07:10:32.872 --> 07:10:36.398
you get when you get there.  But
 this is a compelling designed 

07:10:36.613 --> 07:10:38.613
problem.  How do we enable

07:10:43.324 --> 07:10:48.971
 these arrivals sns, right, and 
points out quote 

07:10:52.570 --> 07:10:56.402
decolonization is not just about
 the designs but reshaping the 

07:10:56.403 --> 07:10:59.737
crafts men and crafts women 
about reshaping the matters and 

07:10:59.738 --> 07:11:03.463
reform need not to look at the 
resisting models and not to use 

07:11:03.464 --> 07:11:07.576
them as paradigm.  
When there are so many archives 

07:11:08.323 --> 07:11:10.837
or archival collections there 
are models, right on different 

07:11:11.118 --> 07:11:14.583
kinds of repositories that 
assume you are working with the 

07:11:14.744 --> 07:11:18.097
material at hand.  The digital 
is in fact different.  I know 

07:11:18.284 --> 07:11:23.358
many people are talking about 
this but when we are thinking 

07:11:24.105 --> 07:11:32.490
about what they can do, we need 
no lost art form or lost world. 

07:11:33.140 --> 07:11:40.190
So with humanities we try to 
work on ways of intellectual 

07:11:40.997 --> 07:11:43.017
understanding and the practice 
again that shadows the 

07:11:43.293 --> 07:11:49.217
background it.  I am talking 
about real projects and JSON and

07:11:49.747 --> 07:11:53.448
 all of these things right to 
think about the different 

07:11:53.775 --> 07:11:57.352
realities and different 
visualization.  One example goes

07:11:57.353 --> 07:11:59.921
 beyond the riot.  That has been
 a really interesting project 

07:11:59.922 --> 07:12:07.609
and I will say a little more 
little more about little more 

07:11:56.168 --> 07:11:58.168
about it

07:12:02.099 --> 07:12:07.836
 quickly.  It works with what 
are essentially very localized 

07:12:08.127 --> 07:12:10.888
collections that are small 
magazines made in small 

07:12:11.079 --> 07:12:13.187
communities between friends and 
as you can imagine, this imposes

07:12:13.621 --> 07:12:16.860
 a wealth of information about 
women's lives, right and the 

07:12:17.903 --> 07:12:18.082
last 30 to 50 years and holds 
enormous information, right,  

07:12:18.083 --> 07:12:20.083
about all about all of the ways 
that

07:12:22.238 --> 07:12:25.720
 the girls interact with pop 
culture and ideas about growing 

07:12:25.721 --> 07:12:29.937
and so on, it's impressive but 
at the same time you are 

07:12:29.938 --> 07:12:33.785
exquisitely dealing with 
material that was made on some 

07:12:33.786 --> 07:12:36.098
level to walk a very fine line 
between the private and the 

07:12:36.489 --> 07:12:49.384
public, right, they arethey are 
madethey are made to be shared 

07:12:27.794 --> 07:12:29.794
and 

07:12:39.391 --> 07:12:43.304
they are private.  That's a 
difficult line to think about.  

07:12:43.606 --> 07:12:47.008
Twitter and Facebook, same 
place.  It's kind of private.  

07:12:47.836 --> 07:12:50.166
You would not just jump into 
someone else's Twitter 

07:12:50.728 --> 07:12:52.728
conversation if you don't know 
the people.  Just start thinking

07:12:52.900 --> 07:12:55.276
 about what that means, right.  
So they changed the project, not

07:12:55.819 --> 07:12:59.608
 just changed the project but 
served the project again about 

07:12:59.993 --> 07:13:07.208
thinking not just a repository 
but thinking quote subcultural 

07:13:08.439 --> 07:13:12.970
digital platform, right, and New
 Hampshire college and mount 

07:13:15.036 --> 07:13:22.134
Holyoke college realized that 
not onlynot only doesnot only 

07:13:11.938 --> 07:13:13.938
does the collection enable

07:13:19.187 --> 07:13:22.516
 a vast number of computational 
mapping and visualization 

07:13:22.517 --> 07:13:25.959
possibilities but the clicking 
-- sorry, eliciting the 

07:13:25.960 --> 07:13:29.878
narratives and meaningfulness of
 the incredibly localized and 

07:13:29.879 --> 07:13:35.271
specific texts also makes 
creating some form of encounter 

07:13:35.272 --> 07:13:38.767
interface that enables you to 
understand the experience is as 

07:13:38.768 --> 07:13:40.834
important as the self-code.  
That the experience of 

07:13:40.835 --> 07:13:45.360
navigating the archives is as 
much as an educational 

07:13:45.644 --> 07:13:51.518
experience as finding the actual
 object which the archives hold.

07:13:56.130 --> 07:13:58.594
we have been talking about in 
archives in reproducing a moment

07:13:58.595 --> 07:14:02.431
 of discovery, right, a moment 
where you realize this is it.  I

07:14:02.432 --> 07:14:07.330
 did not know this was it.  How 
did I live without this?  What 

07:14:07.818 --> 07:14:15.454
is this?  Much like musical 
improviization, it

07:14:18.267 --> 07:14:20.532
 has an incredible archive

07:14:23.787 --> 07:14:29.116
 and what I am calling archives 
is meta data machine readable 

07:14:29.117 --> 07:14:32.677
structure because if we imagine 
the way that we would like to --

07:14:32.987 --> 07:14:36.841
 the way that I would like them 
to, I am getting away, it's a 

07:14:36.842 --> 07:14:40.856
sad day, but the ways that we 
want them to work, right, then 

07:14:40.857 --> 07:14:44.613
there is a way in which we have 
to go in the opposite direction 

07:14:44.614 --> 07:14:47.585
of what one imagines this 
conversation might go, right, we

07:14:47.586 --> 07:14:50.940
 turn back to the machinery, we 
turn back to the compartmental 

07:14:50.941 --> 07:14:56.222
life and turn back to the 
smallest bits of data because it

07:14:56.223 --> 07:14:59.589
 produces the flexibility that 
makes possible more kinds of 

07:14:59.590 --> 07:15:05.847
interfaces and more kinds of 
exchangeses.  We have to break 

07:15:05.848 --> 07:15:11.769
it even more than we realize.  
This means moving away from 

07:15:11.770 --> 07:15:15.312
retrieval on the archive person 
and enable the user to 

07:15:15.313 --> 07:15:18.854
personalize the encounter and 
bring what they made to the 

07:15:18.855 --> 07:15:23.495
archive and by virtue of the own
 specificity make their own 

07:15:23.922 --> 07:15:27.232
things.  I am happy to say more 
about this in the projects and 

07:15:27.233 --> 07:15:31.017
also the kind of resistance that
 you want us to think about.  

07:15:31.018 --> 07:15:34.231
When to exclude and when to 
delete.  Many items in the 

07:15:34.232 --> 07:15:38.213
collection were likely produced 
by people who never intended for

07:15:38.500 --> 07:15:42.153
 them to be disseminated that 
the kind of scale that 

07:15:42.154 --> 07:15:44.169
digitization makes possible and 
they might want to share 

07:15:44.170 --> 07:15:47.094
something else and something 
that none of us could imagine 30

07:15:47.640 --> 07:15:52.451
 years ago.  Again if we imagine
 the most critically informed 

07:15:52.452 --> 07:15:56.633
decolonial future oriented 
perspective on archives, that 

07:15:56.634 --> 07:16:04.167
work must still nonetheless, 
graph with the refusal of data. 

07:16:05.104 --> 07:16:10.337
 At any moment, datum, the 
individual must be recovered 

07:16:10.338 --> 07:16:10.973
from data never to be returned 
again.  I'll stop there.  there.

07:16:10.974 --> 07:16:12.974
  [Applause]. 

07:17:39.740 --> 07:18:28.832
there.  [Applause].   so again I
 think we have Mike for Q and A 

07:16:54.914 --> 07:16:56.914
out 

07:16:58.846 --> 07:17:01.217
here.  Do we have any questions 
from the audience

07:17:05.657 --> 07:17:07.657
 for our panel?

07:17:09.353 --> 07:17:14.302
Do the panelists have any 
question for each other?  

07:17:14.303 --> 07:17:16.592
SPEAKER:  I totally do.  I was 
really changing my whole my 

07:17:16.593 --> 07:17:18.593
whole level my whole level when

07:17:20.750 --> 07:17:25.760
 I was on the hot seat.  But I 
was really compelled by this 

07:17:25.976 --> 07:17:28.721
notion in the community of 
practice that is something that 

07:17:28.722 --> 07:17:32.568
can't be spontaneous and 
something that takes work.  And 

07:17:36.556 --> 07:17:39.712
I was justering wondering the 
kind of work that you do, what 

07:17:39.980 --> 07:17:44.715
the challenges look like.  It 
was in your talk, your talk was 

07:17:44.883 --> 07:17:47.905
like the bomb, but if I was to 
step back, it was a little out 

07:17:48.092 --> 07:17:50.500
of place where you said this 
thing that some people might 

07:17:51.062 --> 07:17:53.862
come to work that day and might 
not be feeling all of the weight

07:17:54.288 --> 07:17:56.108
 of the world and things 
happening outside and I think it

07:17:56.109 --> 07:17:58.849
 was an amazing way of when you 
are doing the good work and 

07:17:58.850 --> 07:18:01.987
doing the work that matters, 
right, and then you are working 

07:18:02.404 --> 07:18:14.902
with the team and everyone does 
does  does not have the same 

07:17:53.972 --> 07:17:55.972
relation with

07:18:04.716 --> 07:18:08.915
 the work, can you say more 
about that?  

07:18:08.916 --> 07:18:11.932
SPEAKER:  Right, I think it's --
so one thing I didn't get to say

07:18:11.933 --> 07:18:17.202
 was that part of the sort of 
trying to imagine this structure

07:18:17.203 --> 07:18:22.993
 and sort of keeping our 
community sort of before our 

07:18:23.179 --> 07:18:29.553
eyes is I think to grappel with 
the ways in which our different 

07:18:29.854 --> 07:18:33.483
experiences are producing the 
new knowledge right there as we 

07:18:33.700 --> 07:18:36.270
are having the different 
experiences and not to say that 

07:18:36.462 --> 07:18:39.426
stuff is outside of the work 
that we are doing and to try to 

07:18:39.633 --> 07:18:43.166
understand how to comes into the
 work that we're doing and 

07:18:43.167 --> 07:18:46.433
whether it's my experience that 
day or someone else's experience

07:18:46.434 --> 07:18:50.616
 or all of our experiences to 
find out how those different 

07:18:52.052 --> 07:18:54.498
ways of coming to the work then 
shape the work, rather than 

07:18:54.690 --> 07:18:58.266
trying to draw the boundary and 
say if we only keep all of those

07:18:58.476 --> 07:19:01.330
 things outside we can get on 
with it.  So I guess that was 

07:19:04.227 --> 07:19:06.227
partly what was on my mind. 

07:19:14.828 --> 07:19:17.781
SPEAKER:  Other question back 
here?  If you can yell, I will 

07:19:18.327 --> 07:19:20.327
repeat it.  

07:20:27.320 --> 07:20:27.828
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible).  
SPEAKER:  Sure service something

07:20:27.829 --> 07:20:32.328
 from Marisa's talk about 
thinking about question in the 

07:20:32.522 --> 07:20:36.055
archives and interfaces to what 
is deleted or missing, to what 

07:20:36.880 --> 07:20:39.479
we ourselves need to protect in 
the archives so I wonder if you 

07:20:40.072 --> 07:20:44.207
have reflections on it as well. 
Just as a sort

07:20:50.229 --> 07:20:55.828
 of general way of certainly, 
being in being in tune being in 

07:20:48.763 --> 07:20:50.763
tune for the

07:20:54.189 --> 07:20:57.814
 record is not a new thought but
 trying again to return to the 

07:20:58.219 --> 07:21:02.139
conversation that we are just 
having about what do I see from 

07:21:03.278 --> 07:21:07.947
my perspective and what do I see
 from their perspective and can 

07:21:07.948 --> 07:21:11.847
we piece that data together.  
Now I am trying to put it 

07:21:11.848 --> 07:21:15.475
together with the idea of data 
and idea and I'm not going to be

07:21:15.476 --> 07:21:19.011
 able to do it on the fly.  
Certainly there is that.  

07:21:19.012 --> 07:21:21.344
Thinking about being conscious 
of the ways in which the people 

07:21:21.543 --> 07:21:24.101
who might be in this archive are
 in the archive because they are

07:21:25.845 --> 07:21:29.606
 being represented there, you 
know from like by the state or 

07:21:30.825 --> 07:21:33.232
from some other body and not in 
their own control and maybe we 

07:21:33.751 --> 07:21:37.641
want to recover their story but 
maybe we also sort of don't want

07:21:37.944 --> 07:21:39.944
 to ex foes, you know,

07:21:42.087 --> 07:21:44.684
 populations that you know have 
been mistreated in certain ways 

07:21:44.685 --> 07:21:48.900
and there is a lot of it that 
goes into it.  We're at the 

07:21:48.901 --> 07:21:51.181
beginning of the process and I 
am learning from my colleagues 

07:21:51.182 --> 07:21:53.863
about what they want to bring to
 this and what they want to look

07:21:54.159 --> 07:21:57.045
 for and I think we will have a 
better answer for you in a year 

07:21:57.290 --> 07:22:00.295
or six months and we are really 
kind of at the beginning and I 

07:22:01.319 --> 07:22:03.936
am wondering if you really any 
reflections on that.  

07:22:03.937 --> 07:22:05.937
SPEAKER:  I really don't know.  
There is so much in that 

07:22:06.386 --> 07:22:08.658
question.  It's the question of 
translation, right, between 

07:22:08.919 --> 07:22:13.001
media and thinking about what 
happens when one thing becomes 

07:22:13.002 --> 07:22:16.051
another.  I think the question 
of exclusion, right, you have 

07:22:16.270 --> 07:22:20.322
exclusion that sort of personal 
agency and choice trying to talk

07:22:20.773 --> 07:22:24.360
 about it and then there is also
 exclusion as protection which 

07:22:24.733 --> 07:22:28.347
I'm really compelled by the 
social media stuff thinking back

07:22:28.601 --> 07:22:34.821
 to what is terrifying to think 
about, right.  And so there is a

07:22:35.594 --> 07:22:39.509
 way in which imagining what 
should be excluded has to take 

07:22:39.780 --> 07:22:45.221
into account the imagination of 
the future the archives can 

07:22:45.465 --> 07:22:48.957
produce and at the same time 
understand the way in which it 

07:22:48.958 --> 07:23:02.043
works in the present.  That's  
what we what we are talking 

07:22:39.806 --> 07:22:41.806
about in

07:22:50.825 --> 07:22:52.598
 a way that we are talking about
 exclusion,

07:22:52.599 --> 07:22:58.167
 it's a person who is standing 
there and remains and says no 

07:22:58.168 --> 07:23:02.477
more, right and I am babling 
around this and you can sort of 

07:23:02.478 --> 07:23:06.296
see it like where we are trying 
to, both of us, you more so, 

07:23:06.297 --> 07:23:09.162
this is something that you are 
thinking about on the ground 

07:23:09.163 --> 07:23:13.408
right now and like I was saying 
with the project sort of 

07:23:13.728 --> 07:23:18.770
thinking about what it means to 
have to, at every moment, also 

07:23:19.038 --> 07:23:26.446
understand yourself as a steward
 and what constitutes yourself 

07:23:26.447 --> 07:23:33.742
as a good stewardship and at 
many times it was not given to 

07:23:34.179 --> 07:23:35.389
us.  
Nobody said please take these 

07:23:35.390 --> 07:23:37.899
things and do this stuff, right.
SPEAKER:  To have

07:23:45.368 --> 07:23:51.508
  humility about the 
stewardship.  

07:23:51.509 --> 07:23:53.906
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  You talked 
about making librarians for 

07:23:54.090 --> 07:23:56.295
digitally sufficient, how will 
you get in contact with the 

07:23:57.911 --> 07:24:00.777
programs in your local area?  
SPEAKER:  So we are reaching out

07:24:01.002 --> 07:24:06.892
 in terms of our pilot workshops
 -- so yeah we have natural 

07:24:07.141 --> 07:24:09.711
contact already with librarians 
who are interested and we are 

07:24:09.900 --> 07:24:14.605
promoting at least the pilot 
workshops and each partner 

07:24:14.606 --> 07:24:20.526
institution has plans to not 
only work with their own, but 

07:24:20.527 --> 07:24:24.510
reach out to other librarians 
and start bringing them in and 

07:24:24.901 --> 07:24:27.628
we have started reaching out to 
programs and librarians in the 

07:24:28.987 --> 07:24:31.538
area in Atlanta and then 
thinking at the

07:24:35.633 --> 07:24:44.942
 conversation conferences and
conferences and howconferences 

07:24:30.324 --> 07:24:32.324
and how we

07:24:36.170 --> 07:24:40.798
 reach out to libraries and 
digital scholarship centers and 

07:24:40.799 --> 07:24:43.783
anybody who has natural 
inclination can be interested in

07:24:44.024 --> 07:24:47.796
 this work and there is a number
 of outlets that you can reach 

07:24:47.797 --> 07:24:53.236
out to as well.  
SPEAKER:  Any other questions?  

07:24:53.237 --> 07:24:55.248
Right here.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Professor 

07:24:56.658 --> 07:25:01.875
green, and the whole panel, in 
your training there is a lot of 

07:25:02.519 --> 07:25:04.688
talk about collaboration today. 
Have you thought about training 

07:25:04.689 --> 07:25:10.196
the librarians and the 
researchers together?  

07:25:10.197 --> 07:25:12.772
SPEAKER:  Certainly that is 
something that we are thinking 

07:25:13.090 --> 07:25:17.697
about doing and thinking about 
the ideas of mutual informing 

07:25:18.076 --> 07:25:22.173
expertise and ignorance between 
the many different ideas back 

07:25:22.438 --> 07:25:26.977
and forth in the training rather
 than thinking of it as one set 

07:25:27.800 --> 07:25:32.817
of experts delineated in the 
front of the room.  We are try

07:25:35.867 --> 07:25:43.290
trying specifically to do that. 
SPEAKER:  In HTRC workshops we 

07:25:43.619 --> 07:25:47.219
do that already and teach 
librarians and researchers in 

07:25:47.558 --> 07:25:52.273
the workshop and the grant is 
specifically focused and 

07:25:52.590 --> 07:25:55.282
targeted and man dated through 
librarians but we are developing

07:25:55.494 --> 07:25:59.901
 the training and curriculum so 
librarians are able to teach 

07:26:00.438 --> 07:26:02.867
researchers across all 
discipline and research 

07:26:03.122 --> 07:26:06.577
questions so it's an interesting
 challenge with the curriculum 

07:26:06.761 --> 07:26:16.832
addressing what librarians 
librarians need librarians need 

07:26:00.623 --> 07:26:02.623
to

07:26:07.892 --> 07:26:08.649
 know and their

07:26:08.650 --> 07:26:09.889
 needs and also thinking 

07:26:09.890 --> 07:26:10.328
through, how do

07:26:10.329 --> 07:26:17.579
 we enable them to then train 
and serve audiences.  

07:26:17.580 --> 07:26:22.118
SPEAKER:  And at digital 
humanities we have a very 

07:26:23.162 --> 07:26:27.400
explicit set up where we very 
actively encourage -- so we do 

07:26:27.401 --> 07:26:30.396
most of our training around 
projects and develop the 

07:26:30.647 --> 07:26:32.699
training so we can develop a 
sense of what people need and 

07:26:33.565 --> 07:26:36.556
offer a little bit of the 
workshop to get the appetite so 

07:26:36.557 --> 07:26:39.274
people want to learn more, in 
terms of bringing their own sort

07:26:39.487 --> 07:26:41.599
 of subject area, but we have a 
very exquisite very exquisite 

07:26:41.600 --> 07:26:43.600
rule very exquisite rule of 
flattening

07:26:44.698 --> 07:26:48.065
 out some of the relations 
whenever possible and the staff 

07:26:48.066 --> 07:26:52.462
as soon as they are equally 
eligible for the BPI together on

07:26:52.463 --> 07:26:55.454
 projects, we encourage projects
 to have to work across campuses

07:26:55.851 --> 07:27:00.258
 and also across the categories 
as a way of sort of emphasizing 

07:27:00.259 --> 07:27:05.665
not only the collaboration like 
yay team but emphasizing that 

07:27:05.666 --> 07:27:08.917
the subject positions also bring
 different kinds of expertise 

07:27:08.918 --> 07:27:12.813
even if they share a common 
interest the sharing of the 

07:27:12.814 --> 07:27:14.814
expertise is somewhat mandatory.
  I

07:27:18.779 --> 07:27:22.532
 hate using that word.  
SPEAKER:  Okay.  Can we have the

07:27:31.149 --> 07:27:33.149
 microphone down here? 

07:27:56.226 --> 07:27:58.226
 Okay

07:28:10.070 --> 07:28:31.278
 Okay so we

07:27:49.862 --> 07:27:55.468
 got seven minutes to go.  A 
tweet came in from Dr. HatFord 

07:27:56.416 --> 07:28:02.043
and the question is, it's not to
 anyone specifically, but in in 

07:28:02.529 --> 07:28:06.467
general, the communities as a 
practice are not represented in 

07:28:06.636 --> 07:28:11.591
cataloging schemes and digital, 
so how do you manage the levels 

07:28:11.876 --> 07:28:14.921
of those?  Great question.  
SPEAKER:  Yeah I mean that 

07:28:15.340 --> 07:28:18.210
question, I will respond because
 I feel like I was trying to 

07:28:18.211 --> 07:28:22.895
talk a little bit about that.  
It's a challenge.  I think that 

07:28:22.896 --> 07:28:29.379
is the thing, I said it very 
quickly and it's really not a 

07:28:29.380 --> 07:28:32.618
digital scholar.  But I think 
it's incredibly important 

07:28:32.619 --> 07:28:38.936
because Bimbay is trying to get 
us to think about the way that 

07:28:39.225 --> 07:28:41.957
inclusion is nothing without a 
transformation of the actual 

07:28:43.333 --> 07:28:46.287
structure, right so I think that
 is absolutely true that in many

07:28:46.288 --> 07:28:54.743
 ways the communities are not 
right, and aren't represented in

07:28:55.335 --> 07:28:59.203
 the interfaced in the way we 
use the archives and I think 

07:28:59.204 --> 07:29:03.182
when we're thinking about the 
inclusion narrative where you 

07:29:03.589 --> 07:29:06.836
imagine life is a big pot and 
get all different kinds of 

07:29:07.200 --> 07:29:11.714
people in it, we'll be okay, 
right, I can't lie, it will make

07:29:12.166 --> 07:29:16.235
 me happy.  But at the same time
 there is a way in which we are 

07:29:17.193 --> 07:29:19.480
talking about transformation by 
default, we are thinking about 

07:29:19.743 --> 07:29:22.850
the digital, there has to be a 
technical structural 

07:29:23.069 --> 07:29:26.503
transformation, right, so I am 
not trying to dodge the 

07:29:26.504 --> 07:29:29.849
questions but I think that 
people are looking that using 

07:29:29.850 --> 07:29:33.809
different ways of using other 
kinds of programs that enable 

07:29:33.810 --> 07:29:37.241
you to produce interactive 
interfaces because I do think 

07:29:37.242 --> 07:29:41.497
that interactivity does not sort
 of solve or fix everything, but

07:29:42.353 --> 07:29:45.855
 it does get us a little bit 
closer to thinking about the 

07:29:46.179 --> 07:29:48.706
calls and responds and the give 
and the take from various 

07:29:49.134 --> 07:29:51.726
communities, right, that could 
really be useful for thinking 

07:29:51.901 --> 07:29:53.901
about the work of archives

07:30:01.013 --> 07:30:03.013
 in the 

07:30:06.595 --> 07:30:08.412
digital.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  To what degree

07:30:08.413 --> 07:30:16.250
 are people represented in 
archives or seen in others.  

07:30:16.402 --> 07:30:18.621
That's a question from Elise 

07:30:24.852 --> 07:30:28.219
Ednall on Twitter.  
SPEAKER:  I mean it's certainly 

07:30:28.438 --> 07:30:31.326
true that we have more 
collections of state records or 

07:30:32.093 --> 07:30:35.738
organization records and that 
the idea of that sort of 

07:30:35.739 --> 07:30:41.938
community archives which is in 
the control of those people, 

07:30:42.634 --> 07:30:45.982
relatively newer, that is not a 
very satisfying answer to that 

07:30:46.192 --> 07:30:50.212
question.  I think it's a 
dynamic that we all need to be 

07:30:50.450 --> 07:30:53.791
aware of and it shouldn't come 
as a surprise.  But for instance

07:30:54.009 --> 07:30:58.743
 there is some of the work that 
Jared

07:31:02.751 --> 07:31:06.893
  Drake is doing and informing a
 lot of the questions and a lot 

07:31:06.894 --> 07:31:12.340
of the archives right now.  
SPEAKER:  I think unfortunately 

07:31:12.341 --> 07:31:14.956
the answer is that they are not,
 right, the stuff we have, the 

07:31:15.467 --> 07:31:18.956
materials that we have the most 
of are the things that were 

07:31:20.749 --> 07:31:23.250
probably selected in the least 
desirable ways, right, which is 

07:31:23.481 --> 07:31:27.703
another thing to reckon which.  
I think a lot of the talks today

07:31:27.704 --> 07:31:31.841
 reflected that is why what you 
are doing is so important in 

07:31:32.461 --> 07:31:35.193
just empowering more people to 
actually create the collections 

07:31:36.295 --> 07:31:39.676
and also technically -- not even
 just technically, but 

07:31:40.500 --> 07:31:44.878
collaboratively more people 
create the archives as well and 

07:31:46.079 --> 07:31:48.596
those are two things that have 
to happen and not just the 

07:31:49.284 --> 07:31:51.284
question for the future, but 
it's something that we have to 

07:31:51.398 --> 07:31:54.772
think about because at the end 
of the day, most of it is not 

07:31:54.773 --> 07:31:59.508
going to sound very good because
 it's not actually a happy path.

07:32:00.931 --> 07:32:04.357
have to end there.  Thank you 
for sharing your work and your 

07:32:05.385 --> 07:32:09.960
thoughts with us.  And let's 
give a round of applause.  

07:33:01.527 --> 07:33:03.527
[Applause]. 

07:33:26.058 --> 07:34:12.049
[Applause]. 
SPEAKER:  closinger

07:32:45.155 --> 07:32:50.705
 speaker today came earning 
agraduate degree in it history

07:32:53.770 --> 07:32:59.423
 from university of California 
University and went to library 

07:32:59.900 --> 07:33:07.661
school.  Since then Thomas has 
held positions at University of 

07:33:07.853 --> 07:33:09.853
Illinois at

07:33:14.709 --> 07:33:20.568
 Urbana-Champaign and was hired 
in UC santa Barbara.  

07:33:20.569 --> 07:33:23.261
I was the kid that always got 
sick before the holiday.  This 

07:33:23.564 --> 07:33:27.942
is my holiday.  When asked in an
 interview what a humanities 

07:33:28.418 --> 07:33:32.805
curator does, he said quote 
translating a researcher's 

07:33:33.124 --> 07:33:36.335
disciplinary competencies so 
they have purchased in the 

07:33:36.336 --> 07:33:48.977
digital digital environment 
digital environment with 

07:33:27.228 --> 07:33:29.228
materials

07:33:37.390 --> 07:33:42.125
 that they may not be accustom 
to working with.  This 

07:33:43.202 --> 07:33:46.046
commitment to making the 
database more accessible can be 

07:33:46.047 --> 07:33:51.898
seen in the recent launch with 
James Baker which helped use the

07:33:51.899 --> 07:33:55.722
 command lines that come up when
 looking for digital resources. 

07:33:57.778 --> 07:34:01.939
really cool.  We asked him to be
 the closing keynote speaker to 

07:34:01.940 --> 07:34:07.519
help make the future a bit more 
accessible too.  Member of the 

07:34:09.225 --> 07:34:16.947
global outlook digital 
humanities, member of common 

07:34:20.884 --> 07:34:26.124
practices, manager of data, it's
 my pleasure to welcome Thomas  

07:34:26.125 --> 07:34:28.125
Thomas Padilla.  Thomas Padilla.
  [Applause]

07:35:14.746 --> 07:35:16.746
. 
SPEAKER:  Okay.  So we are 

07:35:16.879 --> 07:35:19.468
finally here.  I would just say 
at the out set that I am really 

07:35:19.846 --> 07:35:23.658
honored to be a part of this 
conversation.  It wasn't so long

07:35:23.851 --> 07:35:28.692
 ago that about siven years 
actually that I got on a plane 

07:35:28.693 --> 07:35:33.429
and flew to DC.  No job lined 
up.  No internship lined up, 

07:35:33.704 --> 07:35:41.440
purelily based on wrangling one 
of the manu script curators to 

07:35:41.935 --> 07:35:48.644
give me a tour and  it was in 
October and I would like to say 

07:35:48.645 --> 07:35:52.151
it's a beautiful day but it was 
pouring and freezing and I took 

07:35:52.686 --> 07:35:57.649
my shoes and luckily they let in
 me at the back to let me in to 

07:35:58.714 --> 07:36:02.120
see George Washington's diary 
and set me in on this path and 

07:36:02.569 --> 07:36:05.390
made it extra special that I am 
actually here today.  I would 

07:36:06.435 --> 07:36:13.184
like to start by thanking Kate 
Ward and the rest of the people 

07:36:13.185 --> 07:36:15.523
at the Library of Congress 
putting on the event.  I know 

07:36:15.877 --> 07:36:19.632
the great work that goes into 
putting on an event like  like 

07:36:19.633 --> 07:36:21.633
this. like this. 
Thank you

07:36:21.949 --> 07:36:25.747
 for the work that you do.  I 
think it's time for this to 

07:36:25.748 --> 07:36:28.498
happen and it's great to see the
 Library of Congress take a 

07:36:29.873 --> 07:36:32.914
leadership role.  Today I'm 
going to speak about --

07:36:40.381 --> 07:36:43.906
speak about three conditions of 
possibility to frame the way I 

07:36:44.354 --> 07:36:46.869
look at the data collection of 
conversation.  Agency, 

07:36:47.158 --> 07:36:51.334
empowerment and ethics, but 
first I want to start with a 

07:36:51.689 --> 07:36:56.509
story.  Early last week I exited
 the library at UC santa Barbara

07:36:56.807 --> 07:37:00.844
 and put on my sunglasses and 
made my way across campus.  It 

07:37:00.845 --> 07:37:04.663
was a typical day there, like 
every day, 72 degrees, sunny, no

07:37:05.239 --> 07:37:12.017
 humidity, and I hope that 
doesn't make you hate me.  The 

07:37:12.658 --> 07:37:15.316
quarter is just starting.  
Students are out and about 

07:37:15.763 --> 07:37:18.839
running their way.  You can say 
it's a time of uncertainty and 

07:37:18.840 --> 07:37:25.384
you can also say it's a time of 
possibility.  I took a deep 

07:37:25.385 --> 07:37:27.598
breath and I tried to clear my 
bind.  Lots of things to compete

07:37:31.273 --> 07:37:34.884
 for attention and to be honest,
 it's not clear what matters.  

07:37:35.098 --> 07:37:38.160
What really matters is that it 
can be difficult to hold close 

07:37:38.325 --> 07:37:41.679
to your heart, the reason you do
 the things that you do and what

07:37:41.680 --> 07:37:45.166
 you do them for.  One foot in 
front of the other, I started to

07:37:45.328 --> 07:37:51.756
 gain a measure of clarity.  
Bikes, long boards, bikes with 

07:37:52.172 --> 07:37:58.488
people carrying surf boards and 
enterprising Pokemon go players,

07:37:59.524 --> 07:38:04.189
 I reached my destination and it
 was taller and had a tower at 

07:38:04.553 --> 07:38:07.340
the university.  We had a lot of
 those.  I entered an elevator 

07:38:07.341 --> 07:38:13.242
to go into the tower.  The red 
digits clicked past.  The doors 

07:38:13.497 --> 07:38:16.716
opened.  And I stepped toward a 
meeting with the director on 

07:38:16.996 --> 07:38:19.840
campus and I am sure that there 
are folks in the respective 

07:38:20.359 --> 07:38:25.077
communities walking to very 
similar meetings as I am speak. 

07:38:25.830 --> 07:38:30.734
It was one of the first 
conversations with the pressure 

07:38:31.023 --> 07:38:33.598
of possibilities everywhere.  
Our conversation had a familiar 

07:38:34.225 --> 07:38:39.918
course and despite a bit of 
variation here and there, the 

07:38:40.088 --> 07:38:42.088
surface is

07:38:44.572 --> 07:38:48.013
 often the same.  For you what 
do you do and why does it matter

07:38:48.014 --> 07:38:54.657
 to the people?  In these 
conversations I often find

07:38:58.488 --> 07:39:05.777
 myself in what is a humanity 
curator, what is a librarian 

07:39:05.971 --> 07:39:08.646
for.  As the conversation 
progressed, there was a lot of 

07:39:08.851 --> 07:39:12.475
academic hand gesturing around 
the table.  We are pretty good 

07:39:12.642 --> 07:39:19.798
at that in university land and 
after theafter the initialafter 

07:39:09.686 --> 07:39:11.686
the initial introductions I have
 transition

07:39:15.997 --> 07:39:22.717
ed to open the data topics when 
the director interrupted me and 

07:39:22.718 --> 07:39:26.419
took a measured breath and 
looked me squarely in the eyes 

07:39:26.420 --> 07:39:28.420
and asked yes, but Thomas,

07:39:32.535 --> 07:39:36.231
 what are the stakes?  It's an 
important think to thing on.  

07:39:36.732 --> 07:39:38.732
Right.  What are the stakes?  
Why

07:39:41.588 --> 07:39:47.662
 are all of us here in this 
room?  I am sure that many of 

07:39:47.663 --> 07:39:49.973
our institutions have 
collections that are not too 

07:39:49.974 --> 07:39:56.718
similar to me.  In this case, 
it's the collection of themes.  

07:39:56.719 --> 07:40:00.704
We could relatively easily make 
available the catalog data 

07:40:00.705 --> 07:40:05.572
describing those collections in 
the way that the British library

07:40:05.740 --> 07:40:08.673
 has here.  
Similarly, many of us probably 

07:40:09.200 --> 07:40:13.442
have works of art in our 
collection.  Maybe not all of us

07:40:13.884 --> 07:40:20.347
 have Van Gough but surely we 
have works of art and could 

07:40:20.348 --> 07:40:24.940
release individual measurements 
of pixel value measuring things 

07:40:24.941 --> 07:40:28.336
like brightness and hue and 
saturation, we can make that 

07:40:28.734 --> 07:40:31.704
available.
Some of us may even have things 

07:40:31.998 --> 07:40:35.256
in our collection that could be 
used to try to make some sense 

07:40:35.257 --> 07:40:39.520
of the Paris attacks that 
occurred earlier this year.  And

07:40:40.385 --> 07:40:42.385
 some of

07:40:44.411 --> 07:40:49.320
 us have released data related 
to those attacks.  I think it 

07:40:49.321 --> 07:40:52.848
was more than 10 million tweets 
captured in

07:41:00.020 --> 07:41:04.139
 the days following.  It brings 
us back to the original 

07:41:05.160 --> 07:41:07.160
question.  
What are the stakes?  Why

07:41:12.547 --> 07:41:17.112
 are we doing this?  For me I 
learn to identify the mistakes 

07:41:17.113 --> 07:41:29.200
for  architecture.  
architecture.  Like architects 

07:41:08.426 --> 07:41:10.426
we

07:41:19.563 --> 07:41:22.212
 are builders and we build 
infrastructure and collections 

07:41:22.213 --> 07:41:24.462
and support the formation of 
communities through these 

07:41:24.819 --> 07:41:26.847
efforts and the collection of 
data conversations is an 

07:41:27.241 --> 07:41:33.441
extension of the commitments and
 though it's important -- so it 

07:41:33.677 --> 07:41:36.650
is important to emphasize the 
efforts that the conversation is

07:41:37.172 --> 07:41:41.991
 not about data for data's sake 
or computation or computation's 

07:41:41.992 --> 07:41:47.088
sake.  Rather the work is 
intended to build upon our 

07:41:47.780 --> 07:41:55.428
commitment and support nothing 
nothing less than nothing less 

07:41:44.265 --> 07:41:46.265
than the ability that life

07:41:50.375 --> 07:41:50.624
 is

07:41:50.625 --> 07:41:54.454
 worth living.  This is not a 
new role for us.  We have not 

07:41:54.810 --> 07:41:59.884
been without imperfection in 
this role as has been indicated 

07:42:00.138 --> 07:42:03.733
by some of the presenters today.
Collection of data provides an 

07:42:03.978 --> 07:42:05.978
opportunity to continue

07:42:09.786 --> 07:42:12.816
 to learn to do better.  
Condition of possibility.  For 

07:42:12.817 --> 07:42:19.295
me, the agency empowerment and 
ethics and in my perspective, 

07:42:19.296 --> 07:42:22.263
the first condition in the 
collections of data 

07:42:22.626 --> 07:42:25.098
conversations centered on 
agency, to see collections as 

07:42:27.057 --> 07:42:33.712
data.  Is to step towards claim 
agency and to extend individual 

07:42:33.995 --> 07:42:38.152
capacity to act.  I acknowledge 
the chance of initial alien

07:42:41.912 --> 07:42:43.912
 AsianAsian. 

07:42:45.279 --> 07:42:50.170
  The book of following image.  
In the face of the familiar the 

07:42:50.171 --> 07:42:54.443
data may seem as a cold path to 
discovery.  And yet data is 

07:42:54.444 --> 07:42:58.427
vibrant with possibility.  And 
they are the product of human 

07:42:58.428 --> 07:43:03.498
design.  And world view.  And 

07:43:06.602 --> 07:43:09.991
reclimation of agency is 
recognizing and interpreting the

07:43:10.251 --> 07:43:20.094
 data.  By figuring collections 
of data we seek to make the 

07:43:20.095 --> 07:43:26.929
facets known to the community.  
There is a path towards data and

07:43:27.490 --> 07:43:33.963
 I will talk about one.  Depends
 on the notion of accordance.  

07:43:33.964 --> 07:43:40.185
It's a problematic approach 
where I ask seemingly obvious 

07:43:40.351 --> 07:43:43.162
questions, what it does to 
resolve a question.  To consider

07:43:43.745 --> 07:43:49.706
 the additional function it 
aboards with data.  Something 

07:43:49.707 --> 07:43:54.920
that comprise the numerical 
distance that speaks to each 

07:43:54.921 --> 07:43:58.490
other across great distances.  
As this path is reversed I think

07:43:58.870 --> 07:44:05.349
 it's really helpful to think on
 Martin Muhler's reminder that 

07:44:05.350 --> 07:44:09.269
every surrogate has its own 
query potential and for some 

07:44:09.270 --> 07:44:12.723
exceeds that as the original.  
As a physical object the 

07:44:12.724 --> 07:44:15.558
newspaper readily affords 
certain types of functions.  You

07:44:15.743 --> 07:44:19.337
 can pick it up. 
You can fold it.  You can unfold

07:44:19.697 --> 07:44:25.458
 it.  You can orient yourself to
 a relatively significant amount

07:44:26.224 --> 07:44:28.224
 of hetero

07:44:34.828 --> 07:44:39.377
 genius conduct.  Once you 
digitize it, it becomes 

07:44:39.378 --> 07:44:44.437
familiar.  Data being leveraged 
to enhanced the ability to 

07:44:44.820 --> 07:44:51.000
enchance upon it at microscopic 
level.  Paradigm that extends 

07:44:51.948 --> 07:44:55.394
familiar application for working
 with the object, the ability to

07:44:55.781 --> 07:44:58.733
 browse, ability to search and 
to read. 

07:45:05.527 --> 07:45:11.037
 While the platform is there, 
committed with API and get bulk 

07:45:11.038 --> 07:45:13.509
access to the data.  
These preparations have since 

07:45:13.709 --> 07:45:15.709
supported a number of projects

07:45:18.955 --> 07:45:22.603
 that explore the collection.  
This was covered a bit earlier 

07:45:22.817 --> 07:45:26.762
and I'm going to talk about it 
in more detail.  And funded by 

07:45:27.440 --> 07:45:29.440
the NEH context.  It was one

07:45:31.831 --> 07:45:37.423
 project, I think it won.  And 
identify machine learning over 

07:45:37.707 --> 07:45:40.709
166 thousand quotations and 
verbal illusions from the bibles

07:45:41.074 --> 07:45:46.207
 across 700 million pages of the
 historical newspaper and 56 

07:45:46.577 --> 07:45:48.735
billion words not only 
identified the fa

07:45:54.444 --> 07:46:01.877
  phenomenon he was speaking but
 also structuring the data so 

07:46:01.878 --> 07:46:06.088
they indicate how often it 
intended to occur together.  

07:46:06.089 --> 07:46:09.740
This act shed the more complex 
view on use of the bible to 

07:46:09.741 --> 07:46:15.189
support the formation of our 
varied imagined communities over

07:46:15.898 --> 07:46:20.429
 time.  Of course, our 
collection are not limited to 

07:46:20.430 --> 07:46:25.422
surrogates to physical objects. 
Increasingly we collect 

07:46:25.423 --> 07:46:30.677
so-called born digital data and 
web archive collections, and 

07:46:30.678 --> 07:46:35.033
throughout the world.  
Institutions large and small.  A

07:46:35.034 --> 07:46:38.276
 key component of the 
orientation with respect to the 

07:46:38.277 --> 07:46:42.185
collection is learning how to 
recognize what the nature is for

07:46:42.670 --> 07:46:45.863
 supporting exploration of 
questions and will continue the 

07:46:46.100 --> 07:46:49.755
case that we will have users 
that want to interact with the 

07:46:49.981 --> 07:46:55.281
archives as the user may have 
interacted with them them at the

07:46:48.814 --> 07:46:50.814
 time them at the time of the

07:46:53.412 --> 07:46:57.551
 formation in a web browser and 
mobile device and so forth and 

07:46:57.552 --> 07:47:04.194
if we feel back the layer for 
under lining visible structures,

07:47:04.195 --> 07:47:06.195
 it becomes

07:47:08.415 --> 07:47:11.494
 possible to ask the questions. 
 Consider the works on Canadian

07:47:14.638 --> 07:47:20.247
 interest parties.  In the 
groups has drawn connections to 

07:47:20.248 --> 07:47:25.295
the cross cross Canadian parties
 and special interest websites. 

07:47:27.823 --> 07:47:31.801
data and multi dimensional view 
in the activity that may not be 

07:47:32.978 --> 07:47:37.135
apparent or intelligible without
 the awareness of the 

07:47:37.374 --> 07:47:43.490
possibility, sitting below the 
surface of the the push forwards

07:47:44.419 --> 07:47:48.837
 reaching past and the 
collections of data conversation

07:47:49.048 --> 07:47:52.221
 is all about.  The better we 
serve our community's ability to

07:47:52.825 --> 07:47:58.173
 peel back the layer of covering
 seemingly mundane interactions 

07:47:59.098 --> 07:48:02.374
of everyday life in order to

07:48:05.535 --> 07:48:07.535
 encover the ability to

07:48:10.949 --> 07:48:12.949
 act.  

07:48:14.133 --> 07:48:19.286
Empowerment.  In order to do the
 work that lies ahead we need to

07:48:19.287 --> 07:48:23.147
 be empowered to think 
differently.  When I say we I'm 

07:48:23.409 --> 07:48:26.569
referring to the builders at the
 inheritage institutions large 

07:48:26.870 --> 07:48:30.509
and small.  When I say we must 
have the power, I refer to the 

07:48:31.804 --> 07:48:34.842
contents and the extent of 
moving towards the 

07:48:35.900 --> 07:48:39.064
actualization.  I will speak now
 to the respect of libraries in 

07:48:39.324 --> 07:48:43.814
particular since that is the 
community that I am most 

07:48:43.815 --> 07:48:47.372
familiar with.  University 
collections with impartial aims,

07:48:47.373 --> 07:48:50.525
 services with the universal 
scope.  In this manner, 

07:48:51.168 --> 07:48:56.050
libraries are figured like 
transaction groups and black 

07:48:56.051 --> 07:49:01.903
box.  But seriously, down with 
the black box.  Libraries are 

07:49:02.234 --> 07:49:07.250
people.  Individual hands, hopes
 and dreams build the 

07:49:07.251 --> 07:49:10.889
collections we use.  Let's 
acknowledge that, celebrate it 

07:49:10.890 --> 07:49:14.568
and give credit where credit is 
due.  

07:49:14.569 --> 07:49:18.253
Collections of data providing 
opportunity.  Who designed the 

07:49:18.254 --> 07:49:21.502
schema.  Who did the 
transcription?  Who decided why 

07:49:23.251 --> 07:49:26.333
the acquisition should be made 
and for whom?  Why did a 

07:49:26.741 --> 07:49:29.277
normalization occur?  This is 
about recognizing the labor and 

07:49:29.719 --> 07:49:32.411
the value of librarian 
contribution crafting the 

07:49:32.588 --> 07:49:36.008
materials which with a wide 
array of communities gain a 

07:49:36.409 --> 07:49:42.115
sense in the world.  It is also 
did the design decision under 

07:49:42.475 --> 07:49:44.630
lining these collections in 
order to give them their fullest

07:49:45.612 --> 07:49:53.175
 integrity so they can actually 
be used to substantiate claims 

07:49:53.518 --> 07:49:56.148
based on them.  There are many 
collections that the data 

07:49:56.706 --> 07:50:00.866
project can go.  In almost any 
direction we will bump into 

07:50:01.174 --> 07:50:04.507
pre-existing normal for going 
about this work and undoubted by

07:50:04.508 --> 07:50:12.453
 be expectations in terms of 
scaleability.  Here are the 

07:50:13.781 --> 07:50:16.364
chickens if anyone was following
 on Twitter.  I apologize that 

07:50:17.494 --> 07:50:19.494
the expectations

07:50:21.382 --> 07:50:25.319
 were erased.  
But the scaleability question.  

07:50:26.246 --> 07:50:31.102
That is framing.  To be honesty 
am a little bit tired of 

07:50:32.894 --> 07:50:39.249
scaleability.  It's like the 
chicken or the egg debate where 

07:50:39.656 --> 07:50:44.081
someone says the chicken sprung 
and a head and won't consider 

07:50:44.506 --> 07:50:48.041
the egg.  It's parallel.  And it
 needs to happen that way in 

07:50:48.314 --> 07:50:51.249
order to push the conversation 
forward in the space.  Side bar,

07:50:52.154 --> 07:51:00.062
 I want to thank Katie and 
Trevor Munoz who in their piece,

07:51:00.554 --> 07:51:04.119
 they introduced me, so I am 
just going to quote here on the 

07:51:04.120 --> 07:51:07.450
next show slides because she 
really captures this notion of 

07:51:07.841 --> 07:51:11.033
scaleability that I am trying to
 get at.  Highly recommend they 

07:51:11.034 --> 07:51:14.553
are piece as well.  So when 
small projects become big 

07:51:14.885 --> 07:51:18.116
without changing the nature of 
the project we call that 

07:51:19.404 --> 07:51:23.588
designed futuristic 
scaleability.  Scaleability is 

07:51:23.795 --> 07:51:27.208
possible only at project 
elements that do not form 

07:51:27.778 --> 07:51:29.778
transformative relationships

07:51:30.908 --> 07:51:36.495
 that might change the project. 

07:51:36.496 --> 07:51:38.700
But transformative relationships
 are the relations for 

07:51:39.004 --> 07:51:42.901
diversity.
Tying it all together, from what

07:51:42.902 --> 07:51:45.794
 I would consider a classic 
piece although it's probably 

07:51:45.795 --> 07:51:52.354
only four or five years old to 
talk about what Beth gave in the

07:51:52.355 --> 07:51:55.441
 library, writing on digital 
library work and speaking on it.

07:51:55.442 --> 07:51:59.966
  If you want unusual results 
you can't expect this to come 

07:51:59.967 --> 07:52:05.311
from playing by the usual rules.
  A couple of issues typically 

07:52:05.312 --> 07:52:09.966
arise as librarians have 
commitment to save space. 

07:52:09.967 --> 07:52:14.900
The new ground is broken but the
 potential of the work is 

07:52:15.758 --> 07:52:20.374
committed by outset and has the 
scaleability paradigm.  

07:52:20.375 --> 07:52:22.695
Scaleability cannot be the soul 
precondition of possibility in 

07:52:23.285 --> 07:52:26.154
the collections of data space.  
In order for diverse solutions 

07:52:26.528 --> 07:52:30.101
to occur we must learn to 
embrace experimentation, that 

07:52:30.375 --> 07:52:34.739
accommodates and even embraces 
the value of failure as equally 

07:52:35.051 --> 07:52:38.790
as success.  Some may say that 
the ability to engage in this 

07:52:38.791 --> 07:52:40.791
span of

07:52:45.337 --> 07:52:47.713
 outcome constitutes the luxury 
and I would say to look at 

07:52:47.714 --> 07:52:51.296
liberal arts colleges by the 
research university peers 

07:52:51.676 --> 07:52:54.137
throughout the countries.  They 
are doing the most interesting 

07:52:54.138 --> 07:52:57.679
work throughout the space and 
vastly limited resources xar

07:53:02.819 --> 07:53:06.276
 comparatively.  As previously 
mentioned it is often the case 

07:53:06.494 --> 07:53:10.122
that there is expectation and 
little is done administratively 

07:53:10.526 --> 07:53:14.905
to free up time and contribute 
to new projects. I find more 

07:53:15.427 --> 07:53:17.936
often than not that personal 
interests or excitement of what 

07:53:18.968 --> 07:53:24.391
you might call the preconditions
 of empowerment not the barrier 

07:53:24.561 --> 07:53:29.606
collection of data work but 
simply a question of time and 

07:53:29.748 --> 07:53:35.162
resolution can be traced to miss
 match between goals and 

07:53:35.532 --> 07:53:37.987
reality.
Simply put, let's free people up

07:53:40.001 --> 07:53:43.024
 to empower themselves in their 
work whether that's collection 

07:53:44.235 --> 07:53:53.040
of data work or another new 
initiative.  In my work, they 

07:53:53.041 --> 07:53:56.832
are enthusiastic and public 
about their experience.  

07:53:56.833 --> 07:54:00.980
Actually have a menu on their 
website.  And they are currently

07:54:01.333 --> 07:54:07.505
 experiments listed there.  They
 are all disabled.  Does this 

07:54:07.803 --> 07:54:13.409
mean they failed?  Can we 
consider the possibility that 

07:54:13.410 --> 07:54:26.087
they may have been meant to  
fail?  fail?  They may actually 

07:54:04.799 --> 07:54:06.799
be a 

07:54:17.280 --> 07:54:19.280
good thing, these failures. 
failures.  Asfailures.  As we

07:54:21.149 --> 07:54:29.571
 move out of the experimental 
menu of the experimental menu, 

07:54:29.572 --> 07:54:34.942
we have the collection by color,
 by 

07:54:39.708 --> 07:54:42.975
concordance.  Why not?  I bet 
the features started with the 

07:54:43.198 --> 07:54:51.273
mind of someone who had the 
power to explore, started.  And 

07:54:52.015 --> 07:54:53.718
in this way we would miss one of
 the experiments in in action 

07:54:53.719 --> 07:54:58.806
and what we are seeing is a 
really novel solution to 

07:54:58.807 --> 07:55:00.529
addressing a particularly 
challenging program, essentially

07:55:00.530 --> 07:55:02.530
 they

07:55:03.651 --> 07:55:08.663
 are trying to deal with  
differing scales between an 

07:55:08.664 --> 07:55:15.209
object in a collection and how 
to challenge thumb nails that 

07:55:15.210 --> 07:55:19.264
convey things to the user.  If 
you took a distance from the 

07:55:19.265 --> 07:55:25.831
chair maybe 5 feet and a stencil
 from 8 inches above, how do you

07:55:26.262 --> 07:55:29.542
 create an equivalent thumbnail.
  One of the things that they 

07:55:29.543 --> 07:55:34.475
did in the lab and wrote a 
python script to generate 

07:55:36.282 --> 07:55:40.791
shanon's values for each image 
to inch which part of the image 

07:55:40.792 --> 07:55:46.700
would actually be cropped so 
they can convey the most 

07:55:47.164 --> 07:55:50.829
information. The British library
 labs have been doing fantastic 

07:55:50.830 --> 07:55:58.629
work in the space for years now.
  Lauren McGregar and 

07:56:02.314 --> 07:56:05.158
James Bakerr.  I feel like they 
have been eating everyone's 

07:56:05.426 --> 07:56:10.777
lunch a little bit, especially 
in the national library space.  

07:56:10.778 --> 07:56:14.313
But yeah, they're an 
enterprising group and engage in

07:56:14.621 --> 07:56:17.405
 the scholarship of the 
institution and work towards 

07:56:17.746 --> 07:56:20.583
releasing a whole different type
 of collection of data.  You may

07:56:20.584 --> 07:56:24.050
 have heard of the pioneering 
work extracting millions of 

07:56:24.761 --> 07:56:30.817
images from historical text and 
make them under a license.  

07:56:30.818 --> 07:56:32.818
Subsequently, they have 
encouraged the number of

07:56:35.118 --> 07:56:38.762
 competitions working with the 
collection and data.  These 

07:56:39.046 --> 07:56:43.337
efforts are not purely about 
simplicity but provide the way 

07:56:43.338 --> 07:56:47.019
that we compare access to 
collections and have concrete 

07:56:49.110 --> 07:56:53.042
reciprocal benefits. In this 
case, Mario's experimentation 

07:56:53.198 --> 07:56:58.301
with machine learning and semi 
automated classification has 

07:56:58.302 --> 07:57:01.457
meta data for the flicker 
release and subseting for 

07:57:01.621 --> 07:57:04.970
really, you know, interesting 
features and all of a sudden 

07:57:05.895 --> 07:57:10.092
becomes possible for collection 
by portrait.  It's kind of cool.

07:57:10.358 --> 07:57:12.797
I'm not sure what the 
application would be but it's a 

07:57:14.594 --> 07:57:17.083
cool function.  There are a 
number of libraries in north 

07:57:17.581 --> 07:57:21.760
America that have been working 
in the space as well.  I am 

07:57:21.987 --> 07:57:24.522
formerly at Michigan state 
university.  For those who are 

07:57:24.882 --> 07:57:29.246
not big fans of college football
 that is the green helmet up 

07:57:29.475 --> 07:57:32.146
there on the left.  While our 
collections across the board 

07:57:32.474 --> 07:57:35.624
here differed in scope, we all 
shared in common a desire to 

07:57:36.046 --> 07:57:39.058
explore and release our 
collections of data in order to 

07:57:39.650 --> 07:57:45.230
encourage traditional types of 
use.  The process in my case was

07:57:46.209 --> 07:57:48.850
 fairly straightforward.  
Identifying existing digital 

07:57:49.273 --> 07:57:51.438
collections and evaluate the 
possibilities in the data, are 

07:57:52.124 --> 07:57:56.102
they unstructured?  Are they 
structured?  What is the quality

07:57:56.836 --> 07:58:02.016
 of MPR?  Has it been 
transcribed?  The representative

07:58:02.765 --> 07:58:07.205
 is the data given to its 
relationship of the fatality of 

07:58:07.384 --> 07:58:11.179
the collection.  The next step 
was to create derivatives and 

07:58:11.600 --> 07:58:15.241
out with the thumb nails and in 
with the PDFs and the plain text

07:58:15.928 --> 07:58:20.805
 derivatives and wrap all of the
 above with the documentation 

07:58:20.806 --> 07:58:25.214
for boarding computational use. 

07:58:25.215 --> 07:58:28.837
Subsequently this data was used 
for digital humanities and 

07:58:28.838 --> 07:58:34.109
became a text set in a text 
analysis program and sought 

07:58:34.289 --> 07:58:36.289
after for

07:58:37.942 --> 07:58:40.677
 a computational analysis in 
American cooking.  

07:58:40.678 --> 07:58:43.118
If we not treated this 
collection of data and not 

07:58:43.273 --> 07:58:48.721
treated it as such, it's not 
likely that it would have seen 

07:58:48.722 --> 07:58:52.168
these types of views.  Work of 
this kind only becomes possible 

07:58:52.452 --> 07:58:54.452
when individual people are still
 empowered

07:58:57.124 --> 07:58:59.851
 to pursue their passion, the 
cost of that self-actualization 

07:58:59.852 --> 07:59:03.587
is time and the confidence to 
perceive projects whether they 

07:59:03.588 --> 07:59:05.588
succeed or fail.  

07:59:08.045 --> 07:59:11.409
Really, should be a goal.
That said, embracing failure 

07:59:11.647 --> 07:59:15.969
doesn't mean doing our work 
without intention to ethics.  We

07:59:16.202 --> 07:59:18.202
 must commit the

07:59:19.646 --> 07:59:24.793
 transparency, inclusivey and 
respect for what lies ahead.  A 

07:59:24.794 --> 07:59:27.987
number of things are raised in 
the space.  Some things are new 

07:59:27.988 --> 07:59:31.136
and others are familiar and 
possibly more complex in the 

07:59:31.137 --> 07:59:35.968
light of the medium. The first 
issue relates to transparency in

07:59:35.969 --> 07:59:40.578
 the process of collection 
building.  How is the data 

07:59:41.087 --> 07:59:44.401
processed?  What was left in?  
What was left out?  

07:59:44.402 --> 07:59:48.510
Why?  The representative of the 
data.  What bias of the 

07:59:48.511 --> 07:59:51.231
organization does the data 
request.  And I think for a 

07:59:51.910 --> 07:59:54.179
number of reasons the 
data-driven journalism has some 

07:59:55.209 --> 07:59:58.374
qualities that we can learn from
 as we consider these questions.

08:00:02.939 --> 08:00:08.345
feed supplemented an article 
shown here with a blog post that

08:00:08.346 --> 08:00:12.363
 links the date methods and 
analysis and code to produce the

08:00:12.364 --> 08:00:20.375
 work.  We see the level of 
transparency is quite granular 

08:00:20.376 --> 08:00:21.026
and they go down and links to 
the python notebook that that 

08:00:21.027 --> 08:00:23.027
has that has the

08:00:24.369 --> 08:00:26.369
 code, and the generated data to
 support

08:00:27.037 --> 08:00:31.444
 that particular claim.
As I cast my eye over this 

08:00:31.793 --> 08:00:36.894
approach, I wonder what it can 
teach us in libraries for data. 

08:00:36.895 --> 08:00:42.742
Will our users expect similar 
levels of transparency and 

08:00:45.111 --> 08:00:47.830
computational processes and what
 we consider access to.  They 

08:00:47.831 --> 08:00:50.624
may.  Transparency in the same 
may actually

08:00:54.083 --> 08:00:57.192
 be a precondition use.  As 
collections of data are 

08:00:57.193 --> 08:01:01.359
developed we cannot lose sight 
of interest beyond north 

08:01:02.568 --> 08:01:06.726
American borders and must have 
an inclusive vision, global 

08:01:06.945 --> 08:01:12.762
outlook of humanities reminds 
us, there is a wider world to 

08:01:13.296 --> 08:01:17.325
engage with and can think deeply
 about how we invest.  Part of 

08:01:19.106 --> 08:01:20.667
that consideration is 
linguistics.  Part of that 

08:01:20.668 --> 08:01:22.668
consideration speaks to 

08:01:24.508 --> 08:01:27.891
questioning, assumptions of 
normal access to computational

08:01:31.091 --> 08:01:35.506
 infrastructure.  To the model 
for computing, we can develop a 

08:01:35.674 --> 08:01:38.738
model for collection and data 
conversations that is more 

08:01:39.008 --> 08:01:41.951
expansive than it would be 
otherwise.  Across the board we 

08:01:45.362 --> 08:01:48.406
require acts of bravery large 
and small to make our 

08:01:49.410 --> 08:01:55.377
collections as open as possible.
A few things make the light of 

08:01:55.820 --> 08:02:02.016
curiosity die. More like quickly
 when they give you the 

08:02:02.806 --> 08:02:05.252
accessibility.  This is 
something that I have witnessed 

08:02:05.413 --> 08:02:08.387
myself from primary school 
teachers when I worked at the 

08:02:08.950 --> 08:02:10.587
communication outreach at the 
Library of Congress to 

08:02:10.588 --> 08:02:13.636
researchers interested in large 
scale text analysis in the large

08:02:13.637 --> 08:02:17.199
 scale university that is I 
worked at and I would argue that

08:02:17.200 --> 08:02:22.813
 this is a shining light in this
 space, I am very grateful for 

08:02:22.814 --> 08:02:26.297
it.  More collections equal more
 access which in turn equals

08:02:34.002 --> 08:02:37.147
 more inclusive range of use.  
Now this is important.  

08:02:37.148 --> 08:02:40.570
Collections of data represent 
lived experience.  And we should

08:02:41.062 --> 08:02:45.859
 respect that.  Traces of human 
activity are not butterflied to 

08:02:45.860 --> 08:02:49.395
be collected catalogs and 
finished in 21st century

08:02:52.894 --> 08:02:57.973
 cabinets of curiosity.  
Documenting the now focuses on 

08:02:58.443 --> 08:03:02.032
capturing the form of data, the 
tweaks.  While the technical 

08:03:02.423 --> 08:03:05.831
development is impressive, is 
also presents an approach that 

08:03:06.610 --> 08:03:09.857
models how we might engage in 
collection of data activity that

08:03:09.858 --> 08:03:13.578
 is predicated on sustained 
attempts to ground the act of

08:03:17.063 --> 08:03:19.342
 collection in community needs. 

08:03:19.343 --> 08:03:21.492
Documenting the now approach is 
the work in a number of 

08:03:22.245 --> 08:03:24.245
different ways and I

08:03:26.892 --> 08:03:36.602
 am particularly intrueinged by 
Bergis Jules'

08:03:37.055 --> 08:03:41.100
 thoughts of what lies ahead 
when it refers to data producers

08:03:41.567 --> 08:03:46.417
 and data collectors.  I hope we
 see more of this in the space. 

08:03:46.418 --> 08:03:51.765
 A contract after all is about 
the terms of the agreement.  

08:03:51.766 --> 08:03:54.758
It's about mutual respect.  In 
her interview with the LA review

08:03:55.528 --> 08:03:59.670
 of books, Jessica Marie Johnson
 hits upon one of the key 

08:04:00.087 --> 08:04:05.017
sailings of our collections, 
their inclusivity and 

08:04:05.541 --> 08:04:08.337
representativeness, and she like
 many others thought necessity 

08:04:08.338 --> 08:04:14.144
by the meaning of fragment in 
holdings to testify for 

08:04:14.753 --> 08:04:16.753
practices of systemic biases and
 did nothing less

08:04:19.938 --> 08:04:24.091
 than the historic.  Sometimes 
it's the says that the history 

08:04:24.092 --> 08:04:29.837
is buried underneath the har 
monized approach to collection. 

08:04:31.448 --> 08:04:33.988
 and searches different in the 
historical records.  In the case

08:04:34.199 --> 08:04:40.369
 of the real face of white 
Australia, Tim Shera leveraged 

08:04:40.370 --> 08:04:44.851
the detection script to 
automatically have faces in the 

08:04:45.042 --> 08:04:47.817
documents and place them front 
and center to give people 

08:04:48.391 --> 08:04:55.497
privacy.  In doing so, Shera 
utilized the data-oriented 

08:04:56.341 --> 08:05:01.472
approach in stories that might 
have otherwise been told.  As we

08:05:02.070 --> 08:05:05.133
 transition our historical 
sources to meet the collection 

08:05:05.134 --> 08:05:07.537
of data mark, we

08:05:12.004 --> 08:05:14.210
 must be conflicted for the 
English language that is 

08:05:14.211 --> 08:05:20.375
predominant in the legacy 
history.  This is born from the 

08:05:20.376 --> 08:05:24.319
micro development legacy 
policies and subsequently many 

08:05:24.320 --> 08:05:30.264
digital projects have worked 
from the data sources which has 

08:05:30.265 --> 08:05:35.027
projects reenforcing a less 
clearistic view of the world.  

08:05:35.028 --> 08:05:38.048
Presently we have opportunity to
 create opportunities of data to

08:05:38.489 --> 08:05:43.100
 better support the community 
that craft narratives of a 

08:05:43.101 --> 08:05:49.214
greater version of realities.  
Jarred Drake reminds us we are 

08:05:49.215 --> 08:05:54.987
all complicit in the creation of
 collection and reenforce the 

08:05:55.241 --> 08:05:58.506
equity.  In order to improve we 
must face that reality.  Really 

08:05:58.507 --> 08:06:05.011
look at it.  And aim to do 
better. As I have mentioned 

08:06:05.012 --> 08:06:08.641
throughout this talk, 
collections of data provides an 

08:06:08.642 --> 08:06:12.750
opportunity to be better.  There
 is some initial efforts seeking

08:06:13.137 --> 08:06:17.145
 to improve our work in this 
space.  The digital library 

08:06:17.146 --> 08:06:23.052
federation cultural assessment 
group is one promising.  It's 

08:06:23.053 --> 08:06:27.885
fairly on but geared towards 
identifying and questioning what

08:06:27.886 --> 08:06:32.641
 is under lining the collection 
and digital development.  You 

08:06:32.642 --> 08:06:36.480
may have noticed throughout that
 talk that I didn't talk much 

08:06:36.481 --> 08:06:40.797
about infrastructure with any 
degree of specificity.  Or 

08:06:40.798 --> 08:06:44.149
really anything particularly 
technical in nature.  It wasn't 

08:06:44.150 --> 08:06:48.839
my goal to do so.  That said, I 
wish it went without saying but 

08:06:48.840 --> 08:06:53.862
I feel I need to say it any way,
 any infrastructure we develop 

08:06:53.863 --> 08:06:58.978
to push the collections of data 
 conversation forward 

08:06:52.348 --> 08:06:54.348
conversation forward must take 
place in

08:06:58.945 --> 08:07:02.933
 an environment that recognizes 
and works against historic and 

08:07:02.934 --> 08:07:08.829
contemporary hostility towards 
women, people of color and other

08:07:10.847 --> 08:07:16.642
 under represented groups.  And 
it comes full circle.  There is 

08:07:16.643 --> 08:07:21.018
an incredible amount of 
opportunity that lies ahead.  If

08:07:21.223 --> 08:07:25.751
 we stay true supporting the 
agency as we seek to make 

08:07:25.752 --> 08:07:29.684
meaning for the data.  If we 
empower ourself to be desired by

08:07:29.852 --> 08:07:33.279
 our own experiment of data, and
 if we are guided by an ethics 

08:07:33.280 --> 08:07:38.488
that focuses on transparenc 
transparency, inclusivity and 

08:07:38.690 --> 08:07:42.575
respect, I trulily believe that 
we are heading in a promising 

08:07:43.170 --> 08:07:47.276
direction.  A direction whose 
past starts the core to nothing 

08:07:47.277 --> 08:07:50.794
less than supporting life that 
is worth living.  Thank you.  

08:08:17.059 --> 08:08:19.059
[Applause] 

08:08:33.262 --> 08:08:35.262
[Applause] 
SPEAKER: 

08:08:49.590 --> 08:09:30.548
[Applause] 
SPEAKER:  Thank you so much 

08:08:11.232 --> 08:08:14.422
Thomas.  As many of our speakers
 generously said they were 

08:08:14.562 --> 08:08:16.819
honored to be here on stage at 
the Library of Congress, but 

08:08:17.086 --> 08:08:22.203
truly it is our honor to have 
them here and my honor to share 

08:08:22.204 --> 08:08:25.400
the stage with the inspiring and
 unbelievable folks.  Thank you 

08:08:25.401 --> 08:08:28.290
so much for sharing your time 
and expertise with us.  So many 

08:08:28.488 --> 08:08:31.991
of you in the room are also 
working on really interesting 

08:08:31.992 --> 08:08:35.616
projects.  I know the GW book 
from the social speed manager 

08:08:36.207 --> 08:08:39.462
here and the web archiving books
 including our own here at the 

08:08:39.842 --> 08:08:43.119
Library of Congress, we would 
really love if you can join us 

08:08:43.322 --> 08:08:45.322
at the hawk and dove right after
 this to continue the 

08:08:45.737 --> 08:08:49.212
conversation.  We will be 
meeting upstairs, a couple of us

08:08:49.477 --> 08:08:53.075
 will walk over to follow us if 
you are not sure where that is. 

08:08:53.411 --> 08:08:57.003
Video will be posted shortly.  
If you registered for the event 

08:08:57.004 --> 08:09:00.765
you should get an e-mail about 
that.  And lastly I just want to

08:09:01.079 --> 08:09:04.377
 give a big thank you to 
everyone who helped make this 

08:09:04.378 --> 08:09:10.668
possible today and especially 
our speakers, the office of 

08:09:10.669 --> 08:09:13.881
equal opportunity and NAIO 
management for supporting us, 

08:09:13.882 --> 08:09:15.882
the staff at Np

08:09:18.670 --> 08:09:24.182
 go  NGI and Abbey and the 
engineering folks that are here 

08:09:24.329 --> 08:09:26.969
for the special events and those
 of you that read the drafts for

08:09:26.970 --> 08:09:33.868
 our slides and friends and 
colleagues who are available to 

08:09:34.757 --> 08:09:37.177
run errands during the day.  
Thank you so much.  Thank you 

08:09:37.323 --> 08:09:39.323
all for coming.  Please keep in 
touch.  [Applause].
