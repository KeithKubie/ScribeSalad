00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.320
The Earth’s climate is shifting, and it’s
our fault.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.540
Not Seeker, specifically, I mean humans in
general.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.139
We’re digging up and burning sources of
carbon that otherwise would have been locked

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.269
away within the Earth, adding it to our atmosphere
and driving average global temperatures up.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.090
So why don’t we take the carbon from the
air, and push it somewhere else?

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.120
That’s the idea behind Negative Emission
Technologies, or NETs.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.910
They’re one possible tool to stop climate
change, but they aren’t the silver bullet.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.610
It’s tempting to think that if we develop
a way to scrub the air of CO2 we won’t have

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.910
to cut down our emissions so much.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.690
No lifestyle change, no big shift in energy
infrastructure, just some quick fix that keeps

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.400
this climate change thing from getting out
of hand.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.380
Unfortunately while that’s theoretically
possible it’s very far from practical.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:54.070
At the start of 2018 the European Academies
Science Advisory Council released a report

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.920
on how feasible NETs are for slowing or reversing
the effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.969
and their conclusion is… not good.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.890
First it helps to understand why plucking
CO2 from thin air isn’t as easy as it sounds.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.479
As of 2013 we were adding an estimated 40
billion tons of CO2 to the air annually.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.110
While that’s a lot of CO2, it’s not very
concentrated; there are only about 400 CO2

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.299
molecules per million molecules that make
up our air.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:29.080
So if you want to just neutralize the stuff
we’re putting out each year, you’re going

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.799
to have to churn through a lot of air.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.240
Jennifer Wilcox, an assistant professor at
Stanford University, imagines what she calls

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.650
a synthetic forest.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.360
Sounds like cool funky neon trees but really
it’s more a 200 meter wall of fans pushing

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.920
air through liquid with chemicals that capture
carbon dioxide.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.560
The chemical is then separated from the CO2
using high heat, allowing it to go back and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.010
capture more carbon.

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.119
What’s left behind is high-purity CO2 that’s
easier to liquify or repurpose.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.479
Now you may have noticed this process isn’t
passive, you need to put energy into it.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.289
Wilcox estimates that to remove a million
tons of CO2 a year, you’d need a dedicated

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.700
power plant putting out anywhere from 300
to 500 megawatts.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.300
So to balance out that 40 billion tons we’re
emitting annually, that works out to 40,000

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.520
additional power plants.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.890
And that’s assuming you use carbon neutral
power.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.910
If you use a coal plant, you emit more than
you extract.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.540
A synthetic forest isn’t the only possible
negative emission technology.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.490
We could go au naturale and plant more forests.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:33.490
Let the trees do the work.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.490
Smart.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.530
Except planting new forests is hard and we’re
already deforesting what currently exists.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.570
Really it’d be better to get that under
control first.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.040
Another alternative is sprinkling iron into
the ocean, stimulating photosynthetic plankton

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.950
to absorb more CO2.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.770
But that process is kind of like unleashing
a tiger and hoping it takes care of your gorilla

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.780
problem.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.800
We could try making a carbon capturing mineral
like magnesite in a lab.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.150
The mineral forms when magnesium is introduced
to carbonic acid, a molecule that results

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.370
when CO2 and water react.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.681
In August of 2018 scientists discovered how
to make it artificially in just 72 days, as

00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:14.910
opposed to the hundreds of thousands of years
it takes to form naturally.

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.010
Now we just need to make 80 billion tons of
the stuff every year and we’re set.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.270
All of these issues led the European Academies
Science Advisory Council to conclude that

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.260
betting on NETs alone is not the answer.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.069
We can’t keep emitting at the rate we are
now and hope some future carbon capture wonder

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.850
tech will turn the tide.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.440
The goal is still to cut current emissions
as drastically as possible.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.280
In the meantime we can still develop negative
emission technologies.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.090
Just because they can’t stop climate change
alone doesn’t mean they can’t help.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.830
But humans need to scale back our carbon emission
so NETs don’t have to counter 40 billion

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.520
tons of CO2 every year.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.209

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.660
technology powered by bacteria.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:04.209
While CO2 levels are at 400 parts per million
today, until 1950 CO2 hadn’t risen above

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.040
300 parts per million for over 400 thousand
years.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.010
Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next
time on Seeker!
