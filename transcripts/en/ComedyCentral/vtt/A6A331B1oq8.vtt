00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:03.070
I can do this.

00:00:03.604 --> 00:00:04.738
It's too hard.

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.574
In order for you to
move forward with your life,

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.476
you need to confront
this issue.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:10.777
Okay.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:16.183
(breathes out)

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.457
(sighs)

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.293
Hi, Mom.
Hi, darling.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.328
Hi, welcome.
Hi, how do you do?

00:00:28.428 --> 00:00:29.329
Please sit down.

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:30.697
It'll be very important
that you're here

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.699
for Amy's progress.

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:34.368
Amy?

00:00:34.468 --> 00:00:36.136
Mom...

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:40.140
What's the issue you've been
having with your computer?

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:46.013
Oh, I just wanted to e-mail
that cute picture

00:00:46.113 --> 00:00:48.515
of you and your
sister to your uncle...

00:00:48.615 --> 00:00:50.117
It's this way.
...Pat,

00:00:50.217 --> 00:00:52.786
but the photos just
disappeared.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:56.490
I just think that
machines don't work around me.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.325
They don't.

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.161
Okay, well, let's just turn
on your computer.

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:02.696
Isn't it on already?

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:04.765
No, wait, no-- I pushed the
little button thingy.

00:01:04.865 --> 00:01:06.733
Mom, you know how to turn
on your computer.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:07.935
Don't talk to
me in that tone, honey.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.737
I didn't grow up with
these things.

00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:13.574
Amy, what are you hearing your
mother say to you?

00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:15.242
I hear her saying that she
doesn't know

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:17.778
how to turn on her computer when
I know for a fact...

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.613
Yeah, easy.
... that she does know
how to turn.

00:01:19.713 --> 00:01:21.982
Easy, easy--
Let's just take it easy.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.918
I knew yesterday,
but I don't know today.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.753
Can you see how that doesn't
make sense?

00:01:26.854 --> 00:01:27.988
You forget.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.156
All right...

00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.391
How can
you accept her request

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:34.862
in a spirit of generosity
and maturity?

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:36.330
Okay.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.464
Mom?

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.600
You press the "on" button.

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:42.102
(startup sound)

00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.570
There you go, it's on.

00:01:43.704 --> 00:01:45.806
All right, now where's
your photo folder?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.342
If I knew that, I wouldn't
be asking for help.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:52.246
I don't have all day to
stare at computer screens.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:53.881
I think I'm done.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:55.616
I don't think I can do
this, actually.

00:01:55.716 --> 00:01:57.150
Obviously,
that triggered you,

00:01:57.251 --> 00:01:59.820
but it's because you
allowed it.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.123
And you
will not allow it.

00:02:07.728 --> 00:02:09.863
Well, here.

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.265
Here it is.

00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.133
Why do you have all these
photos of the TV?

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.835
Oh-- I wanted to
show you the hangers

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:16.737
that I just ordered
from HSN.

00:02:16.837 --> 00:02:21.108
These are cedar
and they smell like wood.

00:02:21.208 --> 00:02:22.409
Just. Let's take a look
at 'em.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.978
No, no, no,
I'm good, I'm good.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:26.213
You said
you needed hangers.

00:02:26.313 --> 00:02:27.781
I said
that five years ago

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:31.618
and you've bought me several
sets of them.

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:33.587
Now here's the picture
of me and Kim you wanted.

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:35.088
Will you
just drag it to your desktop?

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:41.328
It's like a shadow of...
It's okay?

00:02:41.461 --> 00:02:42.462
Yeah, just--
(alert tone)

00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:44.231
Ugh.
Just hold it
down and drag it.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:45.632
Hold the left down?

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:46.900
Yeah, and then just.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.502
Just anywhere in the desktop.
(alert tone)

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:50.137
Desktop meaning
the whole screen?

00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:51.438
Anywhere on the screen.

00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:54.575
(alert tone)
Hold the left,
roll the right.

00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:56.276
(alert tone)
It's holding, it's
holding.

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.111
(alert tone)

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.546
Desktop.

00:02:59.646 --> 00:03:01.548
There you go--
Okay, now open your browser.

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:02.883
You mean my AOL?

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.351
Let's just attach
the photo.

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:05.819
To the computer.

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.888
No, to the e-mail.

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:09.489
Well, I didn't bring
a cord.

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.092
Mom, there's no possible
logical reason

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:15.362
that you would
need a cord for this.

00:03:15.495 --> 00:03:17.197
Just let
me do it, all right?

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:20.067
(sighing)
Okay, here.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.969
I did it, it's done, you can
send it now.

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.970
I click "send"?

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.271
Yes.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.405
(mouthing words)

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:28.408
(whoosh)
Wow, okay,
I figured it out.

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:29.510
Huh!

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.979
Mrs. Schumer, thank
you so much for coming in.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.080
Thank you.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.348
I believe you both had a
breakthrough today.

00:03:34.448 --> 00:03:36.383
Breakthrough.
Be very proud of yourself.

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:37.684
These are cute.

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.086
They go
like that, right?

00:03:39.186 --> 00:03:42.089
No, they go how
they are-- They are already.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.091
Swashbuckling.
(buzzer)

00:03:44.191 --> 00:03:45.292
Sorry.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:47.094
My next
patient's buzzing in.

00:03:47.127 --> 00:03:48.395
it's the new system
we have.

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:49.897
(buzzing)
Gosh darn this thing,

00:03:49.997 --> 00:03:51.398
I just don't know how
this works.

00:03:51.532 --> 00:03:53.934
I just press this
and what's happening?
Well, what.

00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:55.802
And I press where it says
press, P-R-E-S-S,

00:03:55.936 --> 00:03:57.271
nothing's happening.
Yeah, well,
what's that thing?

00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:58.505
Try that one.
(buzzing)

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.606
See that.
See what I mean?
No.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:00.841
Did you just see it go
on and off?

00:04:00.941 --> 00:04:02.543
I know!
And now it's beeping at us.

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:04.044
See, this is
supposed to say "enter."
I know.

00:04:04.111 --> 00:04:05.646
What have we
done to deserve this?
I don't care.

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.581
I don't understand.
(laughing)

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:10.050
Amy, could you please come
help, uh, with this?
