00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:02.902
My opponent tonight
escaped from North Korea

00:00:02.935 --> 00:00:04.470
when she was just 13 years old.

00:00:04.503 --> 00:00:06.472
She's now
a human rights activist.

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.807
Yeonmi Park.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.143
-Yeonmi, welcome.
-(cheering and applause)

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.078
Yeonmi, all right,

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:15.681
last week, President Trump
met with Kim Jong-un.

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:17.283
-Yes.
-How did you think that went?

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.752
And I'm assuming swimmingly.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.954
That was unbelievable.

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:25.758
I cannot imagine
how can it go worse than that.

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:27.360
You thought it went...
you thought it would...

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:28.761
uh, poorly?

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:31.631 line:0%
Yeah. I mean,

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.801 line:0%
seriously, like,
how on earth did dic...

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:36.536 line:0%
I mean, Kim Jong...
I mean, Kim Jong-un

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:40.073 line:0%
was a guy that was praised by
the little... this free world.

00:00:40.106 --> 00:00:43.076 line:0%
The president of this United
States of America went there,

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.011 line:0%
said, "It's an honor
to meet you."

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:47.280
Now, w...
you know, you got to...

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.348
you got to start with something
nice, and then, from there,

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:51.884
you give away promises about,

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:53.619
uh, where your army's
going to be.

00:00:53.652 --> 00:00:56.823
Uh, those are, like,
the steps of diplomacy.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:58.424
No. That's-that's...

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.026
In the name of diplomacy,

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.228
if that diplomacy ever worked,

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:03.963
I would not be here
as a defector.

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.965
I would not be
a human rights activist.

00:01:05.998 --> 00:01:09.168
North Korea would not be
this way for 70 years.

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:10.970
So, talk to me a little bit
about that.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.239
-You grew up in North Korea.
-Mm. Mm-hmm.

00:01:13.272 --> 00:01:16.509
Uh, in-in looking
at, uh, this meeting

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:18.377
-between Donald Trump
and Kim Jong-un, -Mm.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.645
were you optimistic at all?

00:01:19.678 --> 00:01:20.847
Do you feel a meeting like that

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.049
could potentially bring about
peace?

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.118
Could that be the right step?

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.652
I initially thought

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:29.655
Trump was going to talk
about human rights issue.

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:31.057
He-he was right.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.793
He said on the way to Singapore
in the press conference

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.129
that he was going
to bring everything in.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.331
But the last minute, he said no.

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:41.534
He only just took lots of photos
with the dictator,

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:43.603
and he had a good time,
as he said.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:45.438
And he just gave so much,

00:01:45.471 --> 00:01:46.973
loved him as a dictator.

00:01:47.006 --> 00:01:49.509
He praise him,
entire the summit,

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.044
and he just was so, like,

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:54.247
impressed by dictator
the whole time.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.649
-And he didn't do anything.
-So you-you felt...

00:01:56.682 --> 00:01:58.584
It's the legitimacy
that you had an issue with

00:01:58.617 --> 00:01:59.652
in-in that meeting.

00:01:59.685 --> 00:02:01.187
Yeah, I mean, everything.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.257
The entire summit itself,
it was a reality show.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.926
It was a show itself.
It was not politics.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.662
That's what Trump gives ya.
He gives ya a good old show.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:11.664
-Exactly. Yeah.
-What-what would you say?

00:02:11.697 --> 00:02:13.466
What-what would you tell
Donald Trump?

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:15.268
What do you think
Donald Trump didn't know?

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.270
From your perspective,
walking into that meeting,

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:19.405
what's something you wish
you could have told Donald Trump

00:02:19.438 --> 00:02:21.407
to know walking into a meeting
like that?

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.808
I think, for him,

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:25.611
that he does not really
understand there are people,

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:28.414
25 million people,
at this moment

00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:30.917
that are waiting to be rescued,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.985
to be saved by justice,

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:35.988
that people in North Korea
gonna get killed

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:39.258
if they don't sit up
when Kim Jong-un talks.

00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:41.127
But that is not a something...

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.296
a subject
that Trump should praise for,

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.699
should be envy
to have in this country,

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:48.501
because he has no idea.

00:02:48.534 --> 00:02:51.103
In North Korea, people
have no freedom of speech,

00:02:51.136 --> 00:02:53.839
and I don't think
he really make that interview

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:55.441
-a full, like, reality.
-Yeah.

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.043
He's still catching up.

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:59.045
-I think they-they gave him
the books, -Right.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:01.247
-but he's a slow reader. Um...
-Mm-hmm. (chuckles): Yeah.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.917
Or he's, uh-- what's the word--
uh, not a reader.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.420
-Yeah. -Uh, uh,
there are a lot of images,

00:03:07.453 --> 00:03:08.955
a lot of pictures
that came from that meeting.

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:10.156
As somebody
who was in North Korea,

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.092
how do you expect
those pictures to be used?

00:03:13.125 --> 00:03:15.595
Like, what are... what are
people in North Korea seeing?

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.096
How are they viewing
that summit?

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:20.166
I think, actually, I was
really surprised when the...

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.236
Trump showed that picture
to the-the sky.

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.904
That's what exactly I learned,

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:27.707
when Kim Il-sung,
our first dear leader died,

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.242
that it was raining.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:32.245
The North Koreans said,
"Even the sky's crying

00:03:32.278 --> 00:03:35.314
for the death
of our dear leader, the gods."

00:03:35.347 --> 00:03:37.083
And that's what they say
in North Korea.

00:03:37.116 --> 00:03:40.019
That I believed
the rest of the humanity

00:03:40.052 --> 00:03:41.754
wanted to be like us.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:43.723
That we had nothing to envy

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.925
because we had our dear leader.

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.394
And Trump proved that,

00:03:48.427 --> 00:03:50.162
how much he loved Kim Jong-un,

00:03:50.195 --> 00:03:52.498
how much he was impressed
by how tough,

00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:54.400
that Kim Jong-un
killed his half brother

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:56.602
and how he just shot
his, like, uncle

00:03:56.635 --> 00:03:58.137
then made it into dust.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.806
And that's how exactly he prove

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:02.842
that all humanity wants to come

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:04.677
to under
the Kim Jong-un's leadership,

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.546
and I feel like we are
under Kim Jong-un's power now,

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.981
even being in America.

00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:11.017
-You do feel that here.
Well, what... -Of course.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:12.251
-Yeah?
-Yeah, now.

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:14.020
We are all under Kim Jong-un.

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:15.154
(Klepper stammers)

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:17.556
I mean, do you see
those connections, too?

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:18.758
Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un?

00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.160
Does it feel
a pretty clear connection?

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:24.063
Do you...
W-What do you see there?

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:26.032
I mean, Trump is our president.

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:28.401
Believe it or not, he is.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.336
(chuckles) He's the leader
of our country,

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:33.005
and he says he's going to make
North Korea,

00:04:33.038 --> 00:04:35.274
the regime, as a normal country.

00:04:35.307 --> 00:04:37.310
He's going to invite
this dictator

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.211
who's worse than Hitler, even,

00:04:39.244 --> 00:04:41.580
and to going to make him
as a normal leader.

00:04:41.613 --> 00:04:43.382
-Mm-hmm.
-Then what about us?

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:46.786
The dictator's not going to free
these people.

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:48.587
The dictator's killing us.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.524
He's using starvation as a tool
to control the people.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:52.958
What-what do people...

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:54.260
When you grew up in North Korea,

00:04:54.293 --> 00:04:56.262
what's a day like
in North Korea?

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:57.897
Hating American bastards.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.031
-Hating you.
-Oh!

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:00.933
That was my daily life.

00:05:00.966 --> 00:05:02.802
So you're like a Democrat.

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:04.403
(laughter)

00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:07.039
Yeah. Oh, my God. I guess so.

00:05:07.072 --> 00:05:09.675
Yeah, entire day of my songs.

00:05:09.708 --> 00:05:11.410
So it was like,
"I'm gonna build a tank

00:05:11.443 --> 00:05:12.878
and kill American bastards."

00:05:12.911 --> 00:05:14.547
-So like rap music.
-That was song that...

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.349
Yes, that was song that I sang.

00:05:16.382 --> 00:05:18.951
So you-you are...
On a day-to-day basis,

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:20.619
that's the things
that you're being taught?

00:05:20.652 --> 00:05:22.421
Those are the things
that you're literally singing?

00:05:22.454 --> 00:05:24.657
Yeah, and the plays that I did
with my friends.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.092
We were building a snowman,

00:05:26.125 --> 00:05:27.893
and we put a big nose

00:05:27.926 --> 00:05:30.396
because we heard
Americans have big nose.

00:05:30.429 --> 00:05:32.231
And we put the green eyes
on top of it,

00:05:32.264 --> 00:05:35.368
and we bring the hot water
and put on the snowman.

00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:37.136
What happens? It melts up,

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.605
and we say, "Yay!
American bastards are gone."

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:41.674
That's a play we did.

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.509
-That's a hell of a Christmas.
-(laughs) Yeah.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.077
Yeah.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.179
And you left at 13.

00:05:47.212 --> 00:05:49.315
-Yes.
-You mentioned that you, uh,

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:51.217
you saw an American movie,
and it made you realize

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:52.485
something was wrong
in your country.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.453
-What was that movie?
<i> -Titanic.</i>

00:05:54.486 --> 00:05:55.888
-You saw<i> Titanic?</i> 
-Yeah.

00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:57.523
And what did you get from that?

00:05:57.556 --> 00:06:00.092
Think, of course,
Leo DiCaprio's handsome.

00:06:00.125 --> 00:06:02.528
(laughter)

00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:04.530
Oh, my forever love.

00:06:04.563 --> 00:06:08.134
I think when I really watched
<i> Titanic,</i> I was so confused.

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:10.870
Why, first of all,
someone dying for love,

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:13.606
because we don't have word
for "love" in North Korea.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.941
We only have word
for "dear leader."

00:06:15.974 --> 00:06:18.077
Like, we only have to say
the word "love"

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.080
when we describe our feelings
to the dear leader.

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:23.983
And my mom never told me
she loved me.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:26.051
And there's...
I couldn't believe why

00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:29.221
someone made a movie
out of such a shameful story.

00:06:29.254 --> 00:06:31.957
In North Korea, we don't know
who Shakespeare is.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.192
The love stories,

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:35.561
the human stories
doesn't exist there.

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:39.064
It's only about how dear leader,
like, accomplished everything,

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:40.433
how he can do miracles,

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:43.469
and how he defeated
American bastards and freed us

00:06:43.502 --> 00:06:45.738
and how he protects us today.

00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:48.707
To be fair, most Americans don't
know who Shakespeare is, either.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.476
(laughs) Okay.

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:52.978
But then you defected.
Tell me about defecting.

00:06:53.011 --> 00:06:55.347
What was the straw
that breaks the camel's back?

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.383
It was hunger.
I was starving.

00:06:57.416 --> 00:06:59.418
And it was not like
I-I had Internet,

00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:01.587
and look up
on what to do with it.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.222
It was...
I literally...

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:06.225
Luckily, I was living in the
northern part of North Korea,

00:07:06.258 --> 00:07:09.862
and I could see the electricity
lights coming from China.

00:07:09.895 --> 00:07:12.631
I mean, if you see the North
Korea on the satellite map,

00:07:12.664 --> 00:07:14.667
it's the darkest place
on Earth.

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.569
We have the Earth Day
every day there.

00:07:16.602 --> 00:07:19.038
-Good for the environment.
-(laughter)

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.606
But, you know,
that made me say like,

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:23.209
why China have electricity
at nights?

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:26.412
And I thought if I go there,
I might find something to eat.

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:28.948
And that's all I did
to find a bowl of rice.

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.950
We defected North Korea.

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:33.519
You defect, you're a refugee
looking for a place to live.

00:07:33.552 --> 00:07:35.087
Yup.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.190
-That is a situation America's
dealing with right now. -Mm-hmm.

00:07:38.223 --> 00:07:40.059
As a refugee
who-who needed a home,

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:42.895
-who was fleeing
a North Korean regime... -Yeah.

00:07:42.928 --> 00:07:45.197
...a hostile regime, uh,

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:49.668
what do you hope the country
you live in now can provide

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:52.705
for other refugees
who might be seeking, uh,

00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:55.040
seeking some sort
of hospitality,

00:07:55.073 --> 00:07:57.209
-or a hospitable environment?
-Right.

00:07:57.242 --> 00:07:59.845
I think the...
When I went to South Korea,

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:03.215
uh, people ask me,
even in America,

00:08:03.248 --> 00:08:05.885
"Where are you from?"
And I say, "North Korea."

00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:08.521
They think, like, I say
I'm from North Carolina.

00:08:08.554 --> 00:08:11.991
They usually don't connect the
North Korea to North Carolina.

00:08:12.024 --> 00:08:14.226
And I say, "No, no,
I'm not from North Carolina.

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:15.694
I'm from North Korea."

00:08:15.727 --> 00:08:18.330
And they say,
"What?! You're like me.

00:08:18.363 --> 00:08:20.165
You look just like me."

00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:22.167
I think
that's what we forget.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.136
Refugees are just like us.

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.305
We are just so unfortunate

00:08:26.338 --> 00:08:28.040
that we are born
in that country,

00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:30.509
and we are being punished
for our birth place.

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:33.412
And no one should be punished
for their birth place.

00:08:33.445 --> 00:08:36.649
It's not our crime
to be born in North Korea.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:38.618
(applause)

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:44.089
Yeonmi, tell me something
I already know.

00:08:44.122 --> 00:08:45.724
(sighs)
Oh, my God.

00:08:45.757 --> 00:08:47.560
(Yeonmi laughs, Klepper laughs,
audience laughs)

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:49.261
Wow.

00:08:49.294 --> 00:08:51.063
Or tell me something...

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:52.798
something I<i> should</i> know
that I don't.

00:08:52.831 --> 00:08:54.133
That you should know?

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:56.268
Uh, I mean...

00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:58.671
As-as a, uh...
as a dumb American.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:00.139
As a dumb American. Right.

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:01.974
As I've heard
many people call me.

00:09:02.007 --> 00:09:03.809
(laughter)

00:09:03.842 --> 00:09:06.278
Who only knows what I see
on television about North Korea

00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:08.314
and what I-I hear
from the Trump administration,

00:09:08.347 --> 00:09:11.050
what is one thing to remember
about the, uh...

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.118
the experiences that
North Koreans are going through

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:14.954
day in and day out?

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:18.190
Freedom is not free.
Don't take it for granted.

00:09:18.223 --> 00:09:20.159
You might lose it like us,

00:09:20.192 --> 00:09:22.428
and gonna look
for a place to escape.

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:25.464
I thought, like,
when Trump praised Kim Jong-un,

00:09:25.497 --> 00:09:27.533
and saying what a great leader
he is, like,

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:29.802
I'm like, "Where I'm gonna
escape to now?"

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.937
I'm in a country
where the dict...

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.907
president accept my dear leader
who was...

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.576
who is killing my people,
who is killing my relatives

00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:39.678
right now
because I'm speaking out.

00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:41.714
I'm still not a free person.

00:09:41.747 --> 00:09:43.716
The Kim Jong's still trying
to kill me.

00:09:43.749 --> 00:09:45.918
And that's why
freedom is not free.

00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:48.253
We have to fight
for our freedom here

00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:50.489
so we don't become
like North Korea one day,

00:09:50.522 --> 00:09:52.858
and we have to sit up
when dictator speaks.

00:09:52.891 --> 00:09:54.693
And that's what Trump wants--

00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:57.596
that he wants us to...
to sit up when he talks.

00:09:57.629 --> 00:10:01.133
