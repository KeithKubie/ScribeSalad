00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.280
 Mobile games landscape

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.960
 has been changing faster than ever.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.420
 With millions of new Android users coming online

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.400
 especially in the emerging markets

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.940
 such as Southeast Asia and Latin America

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.920
 it’s become essential to understand the market

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.740
 and ride the next growth wave.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.620
 My name is Derek Oh

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.640
 I’m the Vice President 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.380
 of Business Development at Netmarble.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.120
 Netmarble was established in 2000 in South Korea

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.120
 as a PC online game developer and publisher.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 Around 2011

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.080
 we pivoted to mobile gaming

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.900
  and have a series of mega hit titles

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.320
 Lineage 2 Revolution is a top PC online game in Korea

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.060
 and its mobile version was a blockbuster hit

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.940
 since its day 1 launch in December 2016.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.760
 For us Indonesia is a top priority market

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.260
 because of the huge user base

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.860
 and growing smartphone adoption.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.520
 Since the essence  of MMORPG is community

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.640
 we made the game, store listing

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.480
 and also the customer care

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.660
 completely localised in Bahasa.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.900
 We also introduced “Barong”

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.140
 an Indonesian character, in the game play 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.480
 to connect with the gamers.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.340
 Our biggest challenge

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.380
 was tackling the low IP awareness.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.700
 One month pre-launch

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.260
 we used Google Play's pre-registration feature

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.340
 amplifying this with marketing and an on-site showcase.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.620
 We also launched Netmarble’s 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.060
 Indonesian channel on Youtube

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.480
 to connect with our audiences better.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.640
 For post-launch

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.400
 we focused on developing the right partnerships

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.840
 and with Google’s help

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.600
 our local partners like

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.040
 Telkomsel, GO-JEK, Indomaret and Tokopedia

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.380
 have played crucial roles

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.640
 to maintain our post-launch momentum.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.140
 We had a very successful launch in Indonesia.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.220
 We received 1.5 million pre-registrations

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.760
 and the game hit number 1 on the gross ranking chart

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.120
 on the first day of the launch.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.300
 and the game still remains top 10 today.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.280
 We already knew how important the localization

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.600
 and having the right marketing strategy was

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.160
 but the success in Indonesia

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.020
  reinforced the importance of it.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.260
 Netmarble’s moto is to create fun games 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.220
 for global gamers

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.140
 and we are doing our best to make that happen.
