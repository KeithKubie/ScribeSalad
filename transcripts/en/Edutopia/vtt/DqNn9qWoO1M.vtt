00:00:06.426 --> 00:00:10.296
&gt;&gt;Pamela: Social-Emotional skills
are the essential skills for success

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:12.546
in school, work and life.

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:23.286
&gt;&gt;Natalie: Social-Emotional
learning centers their mind and body.

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:26.796
It reduces their emotional
tension, so they can be open

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:28.376
to new content and material.

00:00:28.926 --> 00:00:32.136
We find that academic
outcomes increase exponentially

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:34.996
when students are nurtured,
loved and cared for.

00:00:35.426 --> 00:00:37.066
That we get much more out of them

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.226
when we first address
social-emotional needs.

00:00:39.666 --> 00:00:41.706
So for us, it's actually
an academic intervention,

00:00:41.706 --> 00:00:42.846
and not just an emotional one.

00:00:42.936 --> 00:00:47.396
&gt;&gt;Pamela: If we expect students
to be college and career ready,

00:00:47.686 --> 00:00:50.786
it's important for us to focus
on these skills and competencies:

00:00:51.106 --> 00:00:55.586
Self-Awareness; Self-Management;
Social Awareness;

00:00:56.036 --> 00:00:58.926
Relationship Skills; and
Responsible Decision-Making.

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:09.206
Self-Awareness is the ability
to identify your emotions.

00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:12.966
To be able to tie thoughts
and feelings to behaviors.

00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:14.786
&gt;&gt;Natalie: We find that
Self-Awareness is one

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:16.316
of the hardest things
for young people.

00:01:16.546 --> 00:01:19.906
Being aware of their own body
space, and the impact of their words

00:01:19.906 --> 00:01:21.286
and emotions on other people.

00:01:21.676 --> 00:01:23.526
So a lot of the work
we do is reflective,

00:01:23.716 --> 00:01:27.906
through conflict mediation,
through circles, through journaling.

00:01:27.986 --> 00:01:31.156
Having them see their own impact on
the world, and then how to shift that

00:01:31.156 --> 00:01:32.666
or make a different choice next time.

00:01:33.346 --> 00:01:37.286
&gt;&gt;Pamela: Self-Management is
the ability to self-motivate,

00:01:37.286 --> 00:01:40.876
to have self-control, to
regulate one's emotions.

00:01:42.006 --> 00:01:44.326
&gt;&gt;Natalie: In a classroom, that
may be a breathing exercise,

00:01:44.326 --> 00:01:47.586
or that might be counting
to five, or taking a break.

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:51.406
&gt;&gt;Rose: So with students who
don't really know how to deal

00:01:51.406 --> 00:01:54.056
with their anger, or don't really
know how to resolve conflict,

00:01:54.466 --> 00:01:57.326
we're giving them a tool
that helps them deal

00:01:57.456 --> 00:02:01.256
with it in a less stressful way.

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:04.046
&gt;&gt;Pamela: Social Awareness
is about embracing diversity,

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:06.006
showing empathy for others.

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:09.596
Activities might include
service learning projects.

00:02:09.996 --> 00:02:12.136
Addressing social justice issues.

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:15.046
Role playing is a great
opportunity for students

00:02:15.046 --> 00:02:20.296
to address how a person might have
felt in a conflict on the playground.

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:22.416
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're going to see
if other people have had some

00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:26.416
of the very same experiences
around bullying that we've had.

00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:31.576
&gt;&gt;Student: You're in my boat
if you have a bully now.

00:02:36.796 --> 00:02:40.176
&gt;&gt;Pamela: Relationship Skills are
important in project-based learning.

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:42.836
It's the ability to
work cooperatively

00:02:42.836 --> 00:02:46.046
with someone, to resolve conflict.

00:02:46.176 --> 00:02:48.966
&gt;&gt;Natalie: It's the one skill
you need your whole life.

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:52.366
You may not need calculus tomorrow,
but you have to know how to work

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:55.876
in a relationship, whether it's
for a co-worker, or a life partner.

00:02:56.146 --> 00:02:58.426
You have to know how
to handle conflict,

00:02:58.426 --> 00:02:59.866
and how to handle challenges.

00:02:59.966 --> 00:03:03.246
&gt;&gt;Student: Sometimes at
recess Maya would come over

00:03:03.246 --> 00:03:07.086
and like just start talking
about us, and saying mean things.

00:03:07.546 --> 00:03:09.876
&gt;&gt;Natalie: Is it your job to
make Denay's job at school hard?

00:03:10.766 --> 00:03:10.866
&gt;&gt;Student: No.

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:12.376
I know it's a form of bullying.

00:03:12.616 --> 00:03:14.866
And sometimes I'll
say, "Sorry" to her.

00:03:15.406 --> 00:03:17.396
&gt;&gt;Natalie: So you choose
to be someone's ally,

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:20.616
and make a better choice.

00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:27.046
&gt;&gt;Pamela: Responsible Decision-Making
is considering the well-being

00:03:27.046 --> 00:03:28.236
for self and others.

00:03:28.686 --> 00:03:33.556
It's evaluating the consequences
for various behaviors or actions.

00:03:34.186 --> 00:03:36.586
We do this through shared agreements.

00:03:36.586 --> 00:03:40.966
One-to-one problem-solving, or
having students debate an issue.

00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:43.986
&gt;&gt;Teacher: If you were
like, "Hey, Kashida, can I--

00:03:44.106 --> 00:03:45.846
how much does an egg
cost in this class?"

00:03:46.586 --> 00:03:49.756
And you like took out your
wallet, and I was like, "Eh,

00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:52.336
I think fifty bucks would work."

00:03:52.336 --> 00:03:56.936
Which one of us would
be corrupt in that case?

00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:02.996
&gt;&gt;Rebecca: We're truly teaching these
students to be productive citizens.

00:04:02.996 --> 00:04:04.846
We're teaching them life skills.

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:07.406
We're teaching them how to
problem-solve effectively.

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:09.226
We're teaching them
how to be resilient.

00:04:09.266 --> 00:04:13.496
&gt;&gt;Carlos: I think of all the billions
of dollars we've spent on Title One,

00:04:13.496 --> 00:04:15.556
and all these intervention programs.

00:04:15.556 --> 00:04:19.556
And when all is said and done,
what do we have to show for it?

00:04:19.556 --> 00:04:23.636
I think we're, you know, we're trying
to teach technical things instead

00:04:23.636 --> 00:04:27.216
of devoting some of the resources
to teach who you are as a person.

00:04:27.606 --> 00:04:30.946
Once you know who you are,
then learning becomes exciting,

00:04:30.946 --> 00:04:32.926
because you've already
established a discipline.

00:04:53.846 --> 00:04:57.346
&gt;&gt;Pamela: It's important for
teachers and Principals to understand

00:04:57.346 --> 00:04:59.396
that it can't be a
binder off the shelf.

00:04:59.756 --> 00:05:03.786
It can't be something that
happens from 2:15 to 4:30

00:05:03.846 --> 00:05:05.376
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

00:05:05.626 --> 00:05:08.196
It has to be part of
the school culture.

00:05:08.816 --> 00:05:11.146
&gt;&gt;Natalie: Giving teachers
flexibility, giving them a range

00:05:11.146 --> 00:05:14.676
of skills, giving them different ways
that it can look, and allowing them

00:05:14.676 --> 00:05:18.046
to take their own personality
and match that to what they want

00:05:18.046 --> 00:05:21.856
in their classroom has been the best
way to get authentic true practice.

00:05:23.836 --> 00:05:26.016
&gt;&gt;Carlos: If we continue to
do what we've always done,

00:05:26.016 --> 00:05:27.906
we're always gonna get
what we always got.

00:05:28.246 --> 00:05:30.096
Is that good enough?

00:05:30.356 --> 00:05:32.826
I don't think it's good
enough for the 21st Century.

00:05:35.306 --> 00:05:38.286
We need to be the outliers
to try things

00:05:38.286 --> 00:05:40.596
that have never been
tried, and see if they work.

00:05:42.896 --> 00:05:44.006
What are waiting for?
