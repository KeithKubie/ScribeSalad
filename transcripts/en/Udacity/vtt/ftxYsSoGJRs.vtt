00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Figuring out that by experimentation is quite difficult though.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So let's look at what you might have tried to do to answer that question.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So let's do some experiments, so we'll try making a simple set

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and we'll initialize a to be the result of set 1, 2, 3 and now I can see the value of a,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it's a set containing those three elements.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The first kind of experiment we might do to figure out that something is mutable is try an assignment.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is the kind of thing we could do with a list.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If this was a list, assigning to index 0 would replace this value in the set.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But when we try that with the set, what we do is get an error.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It says that set object does not support item assignment.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That might suggest that set is immutable and if we think of other things that we've done

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that don't support assignment when we had a string, we got the same error message

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we had that error message because the string was immutable.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But just because it doesn't support item assignment doesn't mean

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
there might not be another way to change it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Let's think about other ways we might change objects.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
If we had a list, we could change it by doing append

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that mutates the value of a list adding a new element to the end of it.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Can we do that with the set? Well, here's our set again.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Let's try if we can do append to the set and we also get an error message.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It doesn't have a way to do append.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So experiments don't tell us everything that we need to know, at least not these ones.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
&gt;From these experiments that looks like set may not be mutable, we haven't found a way to mutate it,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but that's certainly not enough to conclude that it's immutable.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So maybe we need to do more than just these experiments

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and let's look at what we can find by doing our search again

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and see if we can learn more about sets.
