Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio from W N. Y. S. T. E. Yep.

Speaker 2:          00:11          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today a story that we've been working on for close to two years, but just before you're about to put on the air, this happened

Speaker 3:          00:24          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          00:24          the next story in perspective, it's as if someone had killed last seat. As you probably know, over this past summer, a Minnesota dentist named Walter Palmer paid 55 grand to get permission today, Tom Hunt and kill a lion, a lion named Cecil,

Speaker 2:          00:41          an African lion considered to be a national treasure in the country of Zimbabwe. This is a pretty famous lion, sort of the star of that park and been in a few studies. So immediately there were allegations of poaching Zimbabwe where Cecil was killed, open up an investigation. But what really caught our eye was the reaction from the public lion killer. The words painted on the home of Dr. Walter Palmer. People found out his home address started sharing it online.

Speaker 1:          01:07          John Dam down the backlash, threatening his livelihood. Now protest Jews gathered outside his office, posting signs on the lock doors, branding him a coward and a killer. He was forced to temporarily close his business, vilified across the Internet.

Speaker 2:          01:22          There were attacks all over social media and Youtube. And warning this next minute contained some pretty strong language. You are truly

Speaker 1:          01:29          scrambled. The Earth wrote one Walter fucker call no fucking demented. This motherfucker is, may you fucking burn to death? I want somebody to take fucking drop dead.

Speaker 3:          01:40          What would happen? [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          01:47          today

Speaker 2:          01:49          we bring you a story that we hope will be a little bit of signal in all that noise. This is a story about the strange relationship between wanting to hunt and kill an animal and wanting to save it

Speaker 4:          02:03          and it comes from my producers, Simon Adler, one, two, three, four, five one, two, three, four, five. All right, so this story really started from me in Salt Lake City.

Speaker 5:          02:14          This past February I went to the western hunting and conservation expo, sometimes referred to as the super bowl of hunting. Some walking through a this airplane hanger sized a room set. This massive convention center called the Salt Palace. Over 40,000 people there, gun manufacturers that were bowmakers. There were call makers in the single reed camouflage clothing, apparel companies.

Speaker 1:          02:41          Well, this place is rocking and I hope you're having a good time and if you're having a good time, I want to hear a big ie hall. How

Speaker 4:          02:50          did the expo off this main floor? There was a banquet hall where there was an mc who is working in the crowd. Well tonight, I want to continue on a couple of

Speaker 6:          03:00          that we touched on last night, you know, our greatest conservation President Theodore Roosevelt said the wildlife and its habitat cannot speak for itself. So we must, well, let me tell you, we have and we will continue to speak, but we've got to go further than speaking. We're going to have to suit up in our armor to go into battle to protect our wildlife on our way of life. Well, let me tell you, we are at war brought on by the extreme radical environmental movement. If we're not vigilant, engage this enemy. The most endangered species in America could be the American hunter.

Speaker 5:          03:44          One of the things that surprised me kind of right off the bat was talking to people. Everybody kept coming back to this idea in hitting on this idea that like if it weren't for us, if it weren't for the hunters, the animals would not be alive without us onto them. They would go extinct. I got that line over and over again. There would be no animals other than hunt. Basically what they mean by this is they are the ones that are paying to keep these animals around. They are the ones who are funding conservation and I saw what that looked like on the final night of the expo Saturday night, uh, when the organizers held this auction

Speaker 6:          04:19          and now's the time to open your Wallets, Get out your checkbooks, your credit cards. In fact, we'll even take IOUs written on the back of a Napkin. Let's make some money for wildlife. Let's do it. Our first doctrine item tonight presented

Speaker 5:          04:32          the first couple of items, they were just like guns.

Speaker 6:          04:34          It's an American made Ruger rifle. But then item number three, we're going to full curl stone.

Speaker 5:          04:39          A picture of the sheep pops up on this jumbo screen up on the stage. Big stone sheep, as you can see right there. Big ones, huge curling horns, thick brown coat, beautiful color beauty that's on the bucket list, brother. That's all on the bucket list. So the winner of this auction item, what they're actually buying is the chance to go up to Canada on this very specific area and to shoot one of these sheep to get a tag. To shoot one of these sheets,

Speaker 1:          05:07          I have an opening bid of $30,000 that's what I'm talking about. Let's go 32 and a half, 32 and a half, one nine but I'm going to have to get to an editor and I do that now, but I've been unable to get 32 and a half for one of the best stone units there is. I'm 32 and a half down the middle. Need 35 one time but about, and nobody can find 35,001 diamond last call. Sold them right over here as $35,000 few items later.

Speaker 6:          05:33          Keep it rolling. We're a number six a picture of a mooth comes on the screen. Are All of you moose hunters want a great Sharis Moose,

Speaker 5:          05:40          the kind of Moose that you know their antlers ban out like giant wings.

Speaker 1:          05:45          Ladies and Gentlemen, I've got $10,000 somebody can me 12 and a half, 12 and a half one down. But up until now, but if I haven't had 12 and a half, 15 one time, but I'm going an have to give anybody 1517 to half 17 and a half, 2022 a high of one when to put him under 25 and hundred 25 and 31 down. But I go now to get 35 on time, but about an hour 40

Speaker 5:          06:02          wait, so how, how does the conservation angle work? Basically how this works is each state has an agency that's responsible for managing its wildlife. And so if you're a hunter, you basically have to buy a tag from that state agency in order to shoot just about any animal. For example, in Arizona, Arizona is this grid of hunting areas and you apply to a lottery. For Zone B, I would really like to be able to shoot a movie. You put your $20 in, this is typical and 60,000 if your name comes up, you get your tag for $20 but it's possible that you're not going to get one and sometimes you have to wait 10 or 20 years. Especially for these big game animals. So what these agencies do, they set aside a certain number of these tags every year, which are called conservation techniques and what these conservation tags are is like if you just give a bunch of money right now, I did not see this common. You have free range to do what you want, hop the line, shoot the animal you want. No Way. $80,000 eight dead freaking dead and then all that money goes back to those state agencies for a land management habitat restoration, like we're talking millions of dollars that get raised this way. One auction item that I saw sold that next special big game enhancement package, which basically gave whoever wanted the right to shoot just about any animal in the entire state of New Mexico. For a year. I'm 175 bucks.

Speaker 1:          07:34          No, 81 down, but I'm going to have it of ADHD and avid. I've been an avid 180 180 now able to get 91 downloadable to navigate 90 90 90

Speaker 5:          07:43          yeah. Sold it $230,000 one gentleman as close to one so you can do a sound fair levels and in fact the whole reason I hadn't come to this convention was to talk to a guy who had done an auction like this,

Speaker 7:          08:01          but in his case it kind of blew up on it. Honestly, did not expect to be in a position that I am today. My name is Corey Knowlton, c o r e y. K n. O. W. L. T. O. N. Is that how you're going to set, you're going to lead back? I, you know I'll probably move around a lot. Yeah. Okay. Cornell has become kind of the poster child of this idea of hunter conservation. He's a Texas millionaire. I met him in his hotel room right across the street from the expo. He was in a white tee shirt, blue jeans, a little bit of stubble on his face. And story goes back in January of 2014 he was at next post, super similar to this one put on by the Dallas Safari Club. I had my wife with me. He was just walking the floor when he bumped into a friend of his gentleman by the name of John Jackson.

Speaker 7:          08:47          Okay. And John Jackson heads up a group called conservation force. So anyway, John came to me and he told Corey that he was worried that the Dallas Fart club, they were auctioning off as an opportunity to hunt a black rhino in Namibia. The Namibian Ministry of Environment and tourism had given them one tag to hunt one black rhino and they were going to auction it off what had to get old. Now the black rhino is a critically endangered species and are about 5,000 of them in the world, about 2000 in Namibia. And what the Namibian government does is they auction off the older males. What happens is the black round gets older, it sees other rhinos, it wants to attack them oftentimes and kill them. So the government will offer up those problem rhinos for trophy hunting and then use the money to protect the others from poachers. Is Poaching of the Black Ryan as a real issue. Huge issue. Rhino Horn right now, it goes, what's the number of $60,000 a pound? Oh my God. Yeah. It's worth like three times as much as gold per ounce down. In any case, Corey says, the reason that John was so worried, John said, Corey, there's been a, a, a giant push of people coming out against this. It's literally a license to kill. People don't want it to happen.

Speaker 8:          10:06          A permit to hunt down and kill one of the world's most endangered animals.

Speaker 7:          10:10          You said, I'm really worried that um, we're not gonna have someone to bid this minimum bid. His friend was worried that there were going to be these Namibian ministers there and they, they just didn't want to be embarrassed. So John asked me, he said, would you at least bid the minimum bid just to sorta like get the auction rolling and as a friend, if somebody that had been friends with for over a decade, I said, yes, I will do that. So

Speaker 9:          10:36          now to the auction, they started this auction just like any other auction. Eventually Corey makes this bid $350,000 thinking that would just go to the other bidders. That's right. I was like, you know what? I'm going to do what I told you. I'm going to follow through with my commitment to when all of a sudden go once going twice, boom. It happens. You know, I'm just me. I'm just going old money,

Speaker 7:          10:56          Mr God, take people hunting. But immediately I've got people surrounding me, you know, a giant line of people congratulating me. He's like, I didn't expect to be the guy who'd get it by. Okay, but next 48 hours, we now know who pay $350,000 for a hunting permit to kill an endangered black rhino and none Namibia. A barrage of threats started coming.

Speaker 8:          11:22          He's being bombarded with death threats

Speaker 9:          11:25          among the thousands of postings. I hope the rhino rips you and half. Do your children know what a monster their father is? I hope you get what you deserve or short and painful existence. Corey says, people threatened to murder his parents to rape his wife to death. I'm coming to your house. I'm going to burn it down. I'm going to put your kids in a woodchipper. I'm going to do it in front of you.

Speaker 7:          11:49          At any point in this, have you been super enthralled by the idea? Have you always wanted to shoot a black rhino? Yes. Yeah. You're gonna have to now we're gonna have to be quiet. I definitely haven't always wanted to shoot a black rhino. Have I always wanted to hunt for as long as my, I remember. Yes. Okay. Matter big journey in life. When I was born, we had literally nothing. He told me he grew up in rural Missouri in a small house, then trailer home. His mom raised the family, his dad loaded trucks at Safeway. Okay. And we're trying to survive as a family. So when Corey was eight, we left Missouri in a, in a Monte Carlo with $2,500 in the bank and a dream to make it in this world. Okay. So by the time I was 15, we had moved all over the United States.

Speaker 7:          12:35          His Dad picked up jobs in Arizona, Texas. I'm going from school to school to school. I didn't really have the benefit of getting in any sports teams or whatever. But the one thing I did is I had a dad that worked his butt off every day and I didn't get to spend much time with him. So then when we would go want to go do things, Hey dad, let's go dove hunting. It's duck season. You know, and he loved that. He mentioned this one time when he was 11, we'd go out, I have shotgun in my hand to doves fly up and I shooting in both of them died. One shot fell right there. Okay. I went over there, got the doves, went through cleaning them. Okay. And preparing the cook them and just being in that moment and not worrying about, um, you know, other problems that you met that we all go through in life and just having a nice quiet town.

Speaker 7:          13:22          And my dad, I looked at it as a privilege to go hunting. I didn't look at it like, Hey, it's my right to go out and take some animals live. I look at it like this is an awesome opportunity. I get to go spend with my dad outside. Now. As I became older, I became more interested in hunting or learned about Bose. I want to learn about hunting. I was ate up with it by the time he was in his mid twenties. He says, and this was right around the time his dad hit it big in the oil industry. He was leading hunts all around the world from the North Pole to as far south as you could hunt in New Zealand, Nepal, Papa New Guinea. So I've seen the whole world and he says somewhere in the middle of all of those trips, he realized that there's a big fight out there.

Speaker 7:          14:06          This large bio mass of humanity is taking over the world and wildlife doesn't exist by accident anymore, and so he started thinking about not just hunting these animals but preserving them and keeping them here. All of which is to say when he won that auction without meaning to and started getting all those death threats, he didn't turn back. What on earth is keeping you so steadfast and going ahead and doing this? I think I would've thought I shouldn't have done this. I was willing to do this and it may have not been what I planned on that I was willing to do this based on a commitment to I may do a friend. I made a commitment to my family. I made a commitment to conservation as a whole. Look, this was never about me going over and taking a black rhinos live. Like finally I get to achieve the xen at of life and killing this black rhino.

Speaker 7:          14:58          Give me a break. It was about method of conservation to keep black rhinos on the face of this earth. You are saying that you're doing this for conservation. Your detractors will say, they will say, you say you are only doing it for conservation when you are really doing it for no, I'm not saying that's what you've said. I'm saying that this is what they will throw at you. You are only, you were saying you're only doing it for conservation. Well all you are actually getting out of it is some sort of satisfaction. And can you talk for a minute about God for more than a minute about it? Okay. All right. Sure. I enjoy the act of hunting. Can I tell you why? Could I wrap that up in a real pretty burrito for you to be able to eat and understand and it tastes good? No, but I can tell you that I care about the survival of these pcs.

Speaker 7:          15:46          And do you understand why people have a hard time wrapping their mind around that you believing that and simultaneously wanting to kill an animal or does that just does not compute to you at all? I mean at what point were we're getting redundant. They're missing the whole boat. We don't have one without the other. Okay. If we want wildlife to be around for future generations, we have to understand that that wildlife has to have a value. If it doesn't have a value, especially in the continent of Africa, it's going to be gone. And here he made a sort of economic argument. He said you've got to keep in mind that living next to a black rhino, not just talking about it, but actually living next to a black rhino, it's a nightmare. I mean who wants to live next door to a raging psychopathic beast?

Speaker 7:          16:40          It's killing things. No one. So in just very purely economic terms, it has a negative value. But what Corey will tell you and what conservation organizations like World Wildlife Fund and various others will tell you is by him paying $350,000 to shoot one, he is creating a positive value for that animal. He's creating jobs for game wardens. He's creating jobs for trackers. So you've got to look at the net benefit. It's there. And so what, what is the common ground here? Because you guys want the same things and yet there's somehow this, no, we don't want the same conservationist in general to be common ground has to be, do you or do you not want to see black rhinos on the face of the earth? And I think everyone agrees that they do, but I think even, no, I think they do. I, I as their actions are speaking louder than their words, they're all, I think to a lot of people there, these neo-colonial sentiments here that you are this guy who has a lot of money and you are paying a lot of money to go to Africa to shoot this thing and I think that that causes

Speaker 4:          17:50          a reaction in certain people. Do you think the amount of money plays into it or no, to take a break for ones. Okay.

Speaker 10:         17:57          Okay.

Speaker 4:          17:58          Okay. When did you, you, you can say you don't want to answer anything or that. No, I want to give you the best possible answer. Do you understand that? No, I didn't get, try it. Okay. I'm really trying to an emotional level where I'm like, God Dang Man, I want these people to get some fucking fat. I just don't know if I'm going to be able to, we can stop. No, you don't have to stop. Just give me a second. And I know that the words I put out mean something and I don't want to do to service. I don't feel like I'm letting people down and I'm not a radical psychopath. You can see that. Okay. Just something I believe in. I can believe in these animals and I believe that I want them here. But I also understand that death is inevitable.

Speaker 10:         18:53          Okay.

Speaker 4:          18:54          But the depth of this bcs doesn't have to be. And so I'm putting myself through this because I believe that it's right because I've seen that it's right. And I'll go down and I will sit next to people in Africa, both indigenous and non indigenous that have the exact same belief. And they want these animals, they love them, they want their kids to see it. They know that one night when the stars are above and they're sitting there with their family and lion roars and a distance that they feel that they feel what it means to be afraid of it. They feel what it means to respect it. They feel what it means to love it and they want that to continue. And I want that to continue in in a realistic view, a realist view. I believe I have a grasp on what it takes for that to continue.

Speaker 10:         20:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          20:06          thank you for being showing it. I don't have any guns. Okay.

Speaker 9:          20:11          So that conversation happened over six months ago. At that point, the, the hunt was totally in limbo. He was still receiving death threats. Uh, animal welfare organizations like Humane Society of the United States were lobbying and petitioning to try to stop the hunt. And what it all really hinged on was a decision to be made by us fish and wildlife under the endangered species act. It's illegal to import the carcass of an endangered species into the United States unless you can prove that by killing and importing that animal, you are helping the species. As a whole, so that's what us fish and wildlife had to decide. Would Cory killing and importing that one? Black Rhino help black rhinos as a whole. March went by April and then in early May I got a text from Corey that just read. Let's talk tomorrow.

Speaker 11:         21:15          [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         21:16          coming up.

Speaker 3:          21:27          We take a trip.

Speaker 9:          23:23          All right, we are off the plane walking into the airport. I suppose this would be the first time we've actually stepped foot in Namibia.

Speaker 9:          23:32          The uh, the destination. I'm Jen. I'm Ron. I'm Robert Krulwich. Back to our board. Simon Adler. Okay, so days after getting that text message, I land in Namibia. Meet back up with court. Today we're in Windhoek, Namibia, so 13th of May Thousand 15. This is Simon's big day to interview local officials, professional hunters in any bum on the street. That once the comment and how long have we been traveling for? Probably like closer to 48 hours. Now you're feeling all right at this point? Well a lot better now. I'm just getting off the plane and fill in the wind. Yeah,

Speaker 15:         24:04          the airport is tiny. We get through customs and everything and immediately, I'm Simon Simon, I'm 18 nice to meet you man. We're met by the Ph Hindi van here, the p h. I am a professional hunter, the professional hunter requested by Cody Knowlton to assist him on his hunt. He's sort of the manager of this entire project. Big Dude, scraggly beard, short shorts. We need to go and pick up our stuff. He leaves us out of the airport. So what does the day's agenda hold for us? Sort chaos out. Throw it in chaos. Your chaos just started my friend. So we get in his truck, start driving. Do you mind if I ask you some questions while we drive here but ain't going on? And I immediately just realize what a headache putting all this together has been for him. Oh

Speaker 9:          24:53          10 million phone calls, meetings after meetings with the Minister of Environment and tourism. Adolfous checking with local offices all to help them figure out which is the best rhino for Corey to shoot. So they had their list, but so how many at this point you know exactly which one you'll be going after or are there a couple? The main base we've identified that is two rhinos. We can then remove from that area, both male aggressive post reproductive. We gonna try to get on one of these two animals and try to run,

Speaker 15:         25:24          move it as professionally as we can possibly do. Right. So we're at the a ministry of Environment and tourism. This is apparently a meet and greet. Later that day we stopped to shake hands with the permanent secretary, Simeon. Nick Gumbo.

Speaker 16:         25:39          Okay. I want to welcome you all.

Speaker 15:         25:42          He gave this kind of prepared speech about how trophy hunting is a big part of why Namibia is considered the gold standard of conservation in Africa.

Speaker 16:         25:51          This program, as he says, to have a wildlife groin. Previously our wildlife was almost say declining, could like an elephant with less than 1000 but now we have plenty of them. We don't know where to put in

Speaker 15:         26:09          in descending thousand. So Amini now. So you've been so successful that you have to deal with the surplus.

Speaker 16:         26:15          Yeah, the lower type of species, we heavy dead. They green classmen.

Speaker 17:         26:19          Fast forward to the next morning. It's 4:46 AM I doubt that Simon nor I got any sleep last night despite all that. So Moon's going to get her before you through. He was in high spirits. Yeah. I woke up this morning. It was drizzling rain around the curb. Came a passenger train

Speaker 15:         26:41          first thing and bring it down to the his firearm and the ammunition. Big Knives and things. So we can scan a little rhino Monday morning. Oh, you think he was on the phone taking care of final details and much to my chagrin that there was this crew of CNN reporters hanging around once everything was loaded. We took off for the airport. Should I leave you here Corey? Yeah. And I waved them off. Okay. I'm happy hunting. Good luck. Thanks ma'am.

Speaker 7:          27:11          You what? What was that again? You're wave. I don't understand. I uh, I wasn't able to go on the rhino hunt itself. What? I know, I know you're seem disappointed, but in number one, a hunting party can only be so large in Namibia and with these three CNN guys, they're the, the party was just full. Um, but you also have to understand CNN, I was in the country illegally. Um, I had no press pass. I had no pressing visa. So this was like, oh, I've got to keep my head down. Okay, this is this. Yeah, that is our fault. Um, so are you telling me the story is over? Is that what you're basically saying? No, no, don't worry. Cory's personal camera man. He promised to give me all of his audio. So we do have the audio and we'll get to that. But while they were headed up north, I actually ended up going east and where I went totally unexpectedly made this model of conservation and how it works, like really finally clicked into place for me.

Speaker 7:          28:07          Uh, do you mind just telling me your name and where we are at? Oh, my name is [inaudible]. My name is Estelle [inaudible]. I'm a sort of the owner of these concerns. I'm going to keep you company. All right. Sounds good Andre. And it's still swan and pull own the Aro game farms, which are a series of huge slots of land that they've fenced in in total. They have like over 200 square miles of land that actually used to be filled with cattle end know 15, 16 years ago we converted into a game farm. Basically they decided to get rid of all the cattle and bringing all these animals. They've got your rafts, they've got two different species of Zebra Willdabeast our two beast in all. They've got 29 different species, including how many black

Speaker 15:         28:49          running around the property here. Uh, up until about three weeks ago, they within the, now we, uh, we've got 11. So one of the hunting guides, Steph, a statue bear at the Aro game lodge is in Namibia, told me that they actually just had a rhino born on the property. And in fact they've had several throughout the years born on this property. And he took me out to find what were you gonna look for signs and keep always building. So what should I be looking for? If I'm going to be of any help here on the distance, it'll just look like a big gray rock pit. You really got over Kenai. You're driving through this really tall, thick grass that kind of envelop the car. It was almost like we were driving through a cloud. It's, this is the Kolari sour grass. It's a real thick, it's almost like the mice can run on top of it. Yeah, and after searching and searching and searching.

Speaker 3:          29:44          Yeah.

Speaker 15:         29:44          Have, we've just spotted the own. Oh Shit. There it is. Like a hundred yards away. Oh Man. Okay one. Okay. Shit. It's pointing at us. So he's noticed us now. He's probably heard the vehicle. So you know, we're still at a very safe distance. I'm just, I want to get us into the shade and then we can have a closer look and you can put the binoculars up from taking a real good look at it. Oh Man. Looking through the binoculars and he's just pointed straight at us. His head's moving left to right. Left to right. I think this is a bull boy that looks at things. God, it looks like a dinosaur. It doesn't, it is a very prehistoric looking animal.

Speaker 3:          30:21          He didn't, you were there.

Speaker 15:         30:23          Oh yeah. He was totally looking at us. I'm going to put the binoculars on and seat. He's trotting away from us. He started moving away from us to cut these tiny looking legs. So when they run they have to kind of shuffle along. I think if the grass was in that youth would laugh at him. The way they move it's, and he's quite comical, very lucky to, to found one Jesus that we were tailing behind it. And the crazy thing is this huge animal that weighs like over it ton. Oh and it is on the move. It's thinking move like 30 miles per hour. We are currently driving at about 15 kilometers an hour and he's getting away from us, kind of left us behind. So he wants nothing to do with us. He's moving off the, at one point before it took off. Um, we actually got close enough that with the binoculars on, Steph was able to get a good look at its ear.

Speaker 15:         31:13          The Blues of the project initially have all got earmarks and this one doesn't actually have an earmark in it. So perhaps this one was born on this property. What's the, how does that work? How did, how did the rhinos get to be on this property? Uh, the, the, the Ministry of Environment Tourism, uh, had been in touch with the owner of outer game nudges. Government said, hey, you've got all this land, will you take a couple of these rhinos and protect them for us? And they said, sure. You know, we started off with a couple, three rhino and the numbers grew and it becomes this like strange foster care type situation. Each year we have to take photos of them and we build up a portfolio and then we can send it into met. It's interesting that like they are breeding here. So there are more of them now than there would have been if they hadn't been moved here. Yeah. Yes, exactly. And another thing, uh, we were unlucky last year. We actually, we lost two runners. Steph said he wanted to show me something, uh, drove for about 10 minutes. Then he stopped the car at this small clearing, almost no grass, one lone tree, kind of an eerie Phineas. So I sort of feel when I stumbled across this place.

Speaker 3:          32:23          Oh Man.

Speaker 15:         32:25          And can you just describe what we're looking at right here? Boone's just got that all over the red sand of the calorie bleach. White bones against red, red sand. See a FEMA. We can see some positive spine as well. Is that a rhino? Yeah, this, it's always, it's just unreal. Wow. Can you see that there? We got out of the car and like actually like held these bones. Oh God. Wow. How did that happen? That it was the dominant bu I was fighting with a younger bull, the two squared off and the older one ended up goring the younger one with its horn, or at least we think fortunately the young old passed away so it killed it. Then this, this older bull that had just killed the younger one, Steph told me it then went up to this female wanting to reproduce and the young female wasn't ready. She wasn't mature enough yet. He kept forcing himself on her over and over until, till she couldn't any longer.

Speaker 15:         33:32          I guess it would happen in nature as well. It's just unfortunate that they had to be. Yeah. Um, so yeah, they would have been even more, but, uh, nature took this course. We didn't get involved. And so it is, Steph explained to me that it was these type of black rhinos, these older aggressive bowls that get auctioned up for guys like Corey to come over and shoot and then all the money that's been paid for it is going back or going back into a anti-poaching unit is going back into conserving, uh, rhinos. And it's nice to see such a large sum of money coming in for a good cause. So he believes in this program. But personally I, I'd never be able to, to shoot the

Speaker 17:         34:18          a black rhino.

Speaker 15:         34:20          I don't know. And why, what, what about your personally wouldn't shoot her rhino eyes for me.

Speaker 17:         34:28          Let me have Konrad explain why. Well, no, I, they know it's difficult to say, but the doesn't tickle me.

Speaker 4:          34:40          Who's catching visit the [inaudible] over the next couple of days at the lodge. As I was hanging out with kind of these tourists from all over the world who had come here to be wined and dined and then go out and shoot stuff in the morning and afternoon Steffes ambivalence started to make a deep sort of sense to donate. Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, for instance. I spent a lot of time with this guy, Stefan Lindstrom. I'm from Sweden, middle-aged there with his family on vacation. We decided six years ago that we will go to Africa, so I'm very happy to be here today. This is six years in the making for you? Yeah, you can see, so it works in Volvo's corporate office and he's a big trophy hunter. Maybe you actually, to show you some picture from my home, do you have laps on the wall already? Start to show him? It's far too and after the camp we have at least 50 Mars. I got to follow him on a few hunts. Him and his guide. My name is Benjamin scrubber scrape. It is my pseudonym.

Speaker 18:         35:38          Okay.

Speaker 4:          35:40          One of the hunts we spent about two and a half hours searching for different animals, stocking different animals and then in the distance so we still have very nice. What about Buddha? We finally found a waterbuck, which is what? It's kind of like a reindeer, but uh, it has these two big long horns that kind of shoot backwards. Almost like spears. Big Animal. Yup. I guess don't [inaudible]. We're just going to close and see. We hopped down from the car and just start kind of slowly moving towards it through the grass type of element is the top for me. This weekend or this holiday, Steven told me he had a list of animals he was hoping to shoot and this was at the top of this one. I think it's just such a beautiful big animal. That's why the game lodge charges $2,800 to shoot one. Okay. They went above us. Yes sir. He said, okay, okay, let's go and see. Okay. There's light wind or walking through Shin length grass there, shrubs to the left and the ride every like 10 minutes. We'd stopped to measure how far away it was. It's about two, 600 meters. Take about the, tried to manage to call, but all the close to that.

Speaker 18:         36:53          Okay.

Speaker 4:          37:09          Eventually we got just a couple hundred feet away from it. The animals off in the distance. It's just kind of pacing that then pulls out this tripod, sets it up and Stephan gets into positions.

Speaker 18:         37:31          Yup.

Speaker 4:          37:35          The buck stumbled a few paces and he's done. [inaudible] falls down, but then it gets right back up and stumbled forward. Put another bulletin one in this one, one in the first shot. Didn't kill it. Shoot rather high because to a lot of girls at this point, Ben seems tense. He doesn't like that because it's like he knows that the animal is suffering. Uh, so the dog takes off, runs after it and just keeps it at bay by kind of circling it and we start moving towards it. Let's go closer. Let's try [inaudible] next.

Speaker 18:         38:14          Okay.

Speaker 4:          38:20          Again, second shot doesn't kill it. Falls down, gets back up, falls down again. At least on the, just it's arriving in the grass. Ben Now seems pretty upset. I Dunno what

Speaker 18:         38:36          you showed the the first time, but rather high school came up the fried. Yep. And the third shot, wheat doesn't kill it. Sweet. Don't fuck shit. This is no fun. Is this [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          39:07          finally fourth shot. It goes limp dem [inaudible] shots. It's like on the ground and the leg is still kicking a little bit. But if it's done well, it's a nice, I am so happy. I'm so happy. This was the top of the list for me this weekend. So this artist perfect is very nice feelings.

Speaker 18:         39:39          So

Speaker 7:          39:40          seeing it up close, it can be emotionally difficult. But when you pan out, it's pretty clear. The numbers showed that this Namibian model is working. Um, wildlife numbers on private land have gone up by almost 80% since the government allowed people to buy, sell and shoot wildlife on their land. And since trophy hunting of the black rhino was legalized, that population has grown by like 30%. But from my face, not all African conservation is they're on board. I talked to a guy named Richard Leakey, super famous anthropologist who also directed Kenya's wildlife program for awhile. And I asked, what is your stance on this idea of sustainable use

Speaker 19:         40:29          a of wine? Listen to me, I think it's utterly ridiculous. Well, you know, w w w if a father cannot afford to pay school fees for his children, does he say to somebody, you can rape my daughters, I can get the money to pay for school fees. I mean, I think we've got to set some standards in life and I think this is nonsense. What, what this argument is about killing wild animals so that they can be looked after. Absolutely said the wrong message. This was the big issue he took with Namibia strategy. Yes, you can. You can afford to lose five runners from a breeding perspective, but does that send the right message?

Speaker 4:          41:05          He then told me a story about when he took over Kenya Wildlife Service in 1989 at the time, things were dire.

Speaker 19:         41:13          Elephants were being killed at an alarming number and we will get to lose. I elephants totally

Speaker 4:          41:17          poaching was on the rise and his predecessors had actually confiscated a huge number of elephant tusks from these poachers

Speaker 19:         41:25          12 times, 12 times. Once you saw it, you thought that's a lot of ivory.

Speaker 4:          41:30          And they recommended to him, sell designery make about $3

Speaker 7:          41:34          and then use that money to help fight poaching the patient. But leaky said no. What he did instead was he built a giant tower out of that ivory [inaudible] project,

Speaker 18:         41:45          millions of dollars in ivory taken by poachers burned more than 12 tons of contraband, lol, tons of illegally poached ivory worth several million dollars

Speaker 7:          41:56          fun for three days. Punk television, newspapers, magazines, radio. It was this massive PR stuff to draw the world's attention to the plight of elephants. And part of what he was saying in that was like, we have to value these things beyond their dollar value. We have to respect the intrinsic value of these creatures. Well, wait a second. If you're burning a bunch of ivory, aren't you in effect increasing the value of the ivory cause now there's just less of it out there. Let's say you're looking at the supply end of it, right? Um, yes. By reducing supply that would push up price. Leaky was attacking the demand side. What an impact it had around the world. Pinion changed overnight. He said it woke the public up. People stopped buying ivory and the market for ivory. It just crashed. Up to that time we'd been losing about three and a half thousand elephants to 4,000 elephants a year and a year later we were losing at most 60 really it has an enormous impact. My friend getting a public that supports conservation of wildlife, that's a huge challenge and we just can't afford, I think just send up the wrong messages,

Speaker 7:          43:06          but the problem with that is finding the right message is getting harder and harder. I called various conservation organizations and one guy who I talked to told me that their average age of donor is getting older. More and more people are just living in cities. Less people are having positive experiences in the natural world at a young age and so he said that they're going to have to continue focusing on people focusing on us. This message of what does wild life give us? What does it do for people?

Speaker 18:         43:44          This is our third day up in the area. Still no luck and we're just going to keep at it.

Speaker 7:          43:50          Back in Namibia, after three days of bushwhacking through this dense vegetation up in the north of the country, Corey and his crew finally got on the

Speaker 15:         43:59          tracks of the right rhino. The local guy says, we found a rhino that had guild, another rhino that had killed another rhino. So we're gonna follow this one, make a hundred percent sure that it's the Ryan one, and then we'll try to take it if we can. So for the next couple of hours they track the animal looking for basically footprints anywhere that has marked its territory.

Speaker 18:         44:20          So we're not dragging this like probably a couple hours now bumped at least twice.

Speaker 15:         44:25          We were, had walked at this point just about 12 miles. It was very hot. You can see how pick it right here. Pretty

Speaker 4:          44:32          intense. The grass was so thick that they really couldn't see more than about 30 feet in front of them. And eventually they find, you can see this as the rhinos, a pile of rhino feces that still warrants, still very moist, doesn't mean it's fright. This is, we're not more than an hour behind that animal right there and you can see the Dung beetles and everything in it. And so this nmos with Ada. We sat there for a few minutes, right, gathered our thoughts. So it lets you line it out. We're going to do what you say. And then about two hours later

Speaker 18:         45:03          we've heard some noise from my left all by t is running fees with a giant saber on its head. It was like lightning. So we also didn't get it with the first shot. The first several shots did not kill this thing. It ran off and then they had to start tracking it again and it just wounded.

Speaker 20:         45:28          Yes, we followed it. I would say 10 minutes. I don't know. I looked over there, I saw it. It wasn't lying down at this point. It was standing up, but it had already fallen down twice. It was dying.

Speaker 18:         45:39          And then I shot it a few more times.

Speaker 20:         45:48          The last thing you do is once you are really assured it's dead, you can touch its eye and if it doesn't blink, it's gone. So did you go touch your tie? Absolutely. In a moment like that, is there some sort of, is there a conversation going on now that the animal is dead and you're not? No, we just kind of looked at everybody looked at each other and made sure we were okay. There wasn't a whole lot of talk right then in this case, but it was an emotional moment for me.

Speaker 7:          46:16          So the mate, we've been sitting here skin in this animal so far this morning and now we're about to roll it over skin the other side and then just take the quarters off just like any other animal that you would if you were on a hunting trip.

Speaker 4:          46:32          They loaded up all the meat to be shipped off to a local village and they kept a little bit of it for themselves.

Speaker 7:          46:40          Cook. And my first piece of black rhino me here on the coals next to the CarGurus, right? Here's the moment when we've, everybody here has started eating some of this black rhino. So it's just a part of a part of hunting and a part of being a human. So it's a pretty unique and awesome moment right here.

Speaker 20:         47:01          I'm not really morally outraged by it. I'm, maybe I'm a little, but I think you might be vulnerable if you insist that your enthusiasm for hunting is part of the balance of nature, but I think it's perfectly, you don't have those canine teeth for eating salad, and I understand that people don't like it any more than they wouldn't like going and killing the lamb of the lamb shots they eat. Well, what about that doesn't mean that it's wrong hunting. It's part of who we are. Now it may be a bigger part of who I am than you are and that's fine, but when wildlife populations abound is when they're managed by humans beings.

Speaker 14:         47:40          The alternate model might be a view of humans that's different from yours. I think you assume that because we are smart and because there are so many of us that inevitably we will bump into them and when we do we will win. And thus your calculations, the alternate model might be that because we are smart, we might create a space where we won't bump into them.

Speaker 20:         48:09          Now you're now, you're not in the real world. We're dealing not in reality. Okay, I'm, I'm living in a world that matters. And that's real. So it's not, it's not a dream scenario. And it's not saying, okay, well let's just create this. Unfortunately these animals don't have that time. So I'm not trying to outsmart anybody. It's just a traditional method that's worked. And until somebody comes up with a methodology that we could look at and say, this is a better way, I'm going to continue to fight and believe in the traditional model. So now we're going to ask ourselves these questions. How do we really on an individual basis, value this animal's survival on earth? Do you really value it? Do you value it past making 75 characters into your iPhone and tweeting about it? Do you value it passed watching animal planet? To me, I know, and I care, and I placed an extreme value financially, physically, emotionally on the survival of the black rhino.
