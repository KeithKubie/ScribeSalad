00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.589
&gt;&gt; 
So, I work for Brightkite. Brightkite is a

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.580
location-based social network. It allows you
to have, you know, friends and things like

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.250
other social networks do. But, it’s more
about saying what’s going on at a certain

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.170
place, so places are very important to Brightkite.
I can check in at a place like Moscone Center

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.250
or even, like, Google I/O and then I can post
the stream of notes and photos and also see

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.440
other people that are doing the same thing
around me. Discovering interesting thing happening

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.350
around me is kind of what Brightkite is all
about.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.850
&gt;&gt; What was to be your motivation for creating
Brightkite?

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.350
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; Your motivations for creating?

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:54.239
&gt;&gt; So, I didn’t create Brightkite. I’m
just the mobile developer. I think the motivation

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.690
was to get place, to be an important thing-—to
be an important aspect of social networking

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.600
and annotating the real world is a real important
feature too. So, like when I post a stream

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.580
of photos at some place, somebody could come
back later and see these things that are taking

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.400
place there and that’s kind of an interesting
thing to see about what’s going on at places.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.820
&gt;&gt; So, you choose the Android Application,
can you tell us a little bit about that techno-decisions

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.220
regarding that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean, any device that has a GPS

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.250
is going to be something that is really important
part of our platform and Android devices are

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.740
going to be one the first class citizens for
sure. There is already an iPhone Application

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.770
and so the Android Application is doing a
lot of things that the iPhone Application

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.020
already does but we need to make sure that
we’re supporting that. It’s also interesting

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.700
to us to be able to do some of the things
that you can do on Android, like it’s great

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.850
that your application is part of an ecosystem
of applications on the user’s phone. So,

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.080
we want to do some things down the line and
take advantage of that.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:08.420
&gt;&gt; Okay, people really like hearing “war
stories” but—so, is there anything particularly

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:16.769
difficult thing that you were able to encounter
and (inaudible) it out?

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.280
&gt;&gt; So, the one thing was working with the
camera, if you just want to call out to the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.920
camera and get a quick snapshot, the version
1 and 1.1 would just give you a small—scaled

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.500
down image when it came back from there. We
needed more than that, so we have to kind

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:43.099
of build our own. We got passed that by looking
at the source which is a very cool part of

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.620
Android development as well. You can see what
Google did to build the applications that

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.749
are already on your phone. So, we have to
check out those-—check out the source and

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:54.430
kind of build things that way. Another thing
that was pretty tough was scanning and installing

00:02:54.430 --> 00:03:00.569
the application the way we wanted. That was—-I
would like that to be a little bit better

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.779
in the future--that’s one request that I
would have. A little bit easier to make some

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:10.760
of the, like, Tab Navigation is a common feature
of Android applications and it’s pretty

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.230
tough. We just basically had to build around
Tab navigator to make it look the way we want

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.039
it. Again, looking at the source helped us
a bit there.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:26.670
&gt;&gt; What’s your favorite aspect of the Android
development channels?

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.010
&gt;&gt; I really like the fact that you can easily
deploy it at any phone and tests instead of

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:37.180
going through a provisioning process. That’s
pretty nice, ADB has been pretty helpful,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.400
I like the GPDs that come in a command line
and fire off some quick things like geo-testing—-that’s

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.900
pretty nice. I already used it and I’m familiar
with the Eclipse, or already using what’s

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.290
familiar with the Eclipse so, I like using
Eclipse.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.769
&gt;&gt; And are there any features that you can
do on the Android platform that you weren’t

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.099
able to do one on here?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so, this is coming in a later version

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:12.419
of the iPhone SCK. We were able to get in
Maps integrated right in easily which is,

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:16.060
you know, a couple lines of code—-that was
a pretty nice feature and also the background

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.822
tasks are pretty nice, background services.
So, we got—we’re taking advantage of those

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:25.130
to look up to when there’s new friend request
or new messages and bringing that up in the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.410
Notification Bar. So, that’s a pretty nice,
nice feature we could take advantage of.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.340
&gt;&gt; Okay, and are there any tips or tricks
you could offer, you know, other people would

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.790
like to come up in the Android platform?
&gt;&gt; For anybody coming in to the platform,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.010
I would say, read the source. That’s a great
resource that Google made available. Figure

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.130
out how they build the Apps that are closest
to the App that you want to build and see

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:53.350
how they’re doing things. The documentation
is getting a lot better but you can always

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.560
see what’s happening in the source, that’s
important.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.169
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you very much and enjoy the
rest of the show.

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:02.180
&gt;&gt; Thanks, it’s been great so far.
