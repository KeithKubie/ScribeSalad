DYLAN THOMAS: Hello, and welcome
to What In The World.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.180
This is a regular show where
Geo Googlers dip into

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.680
interesting Enterprise
Maps-related topics and share

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.790
the results with you.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.070
I'm Dylan Thomas.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.280
I'm a Geo Enterprise
community manager.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.810
And joining me today is Ryan
Thomas, who works with our

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.910
Enterprise customers on getting
up and running with

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.550
our Geo products.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.010
Hi, Ryan.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.009
RYAN THOMAS: Hi, Dylan.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:32.610
How are you?

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.790
DYLAN THOMAS: I'm
good, thanks.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.600
I'm looking forward
to the show today.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.000
You're going to be
talking with us

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.430
about Google Maps Engine.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.130
And more to the point, how to
get GME layers up and running

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.810
and visible in Google Maps
JavaScript API, right?

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.580
RYAN THOMAS: That's right.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.150
Specifically, I'm going to be
talking about MapsEngineLayer

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.850
and DynamicMapsEngineLayer.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.910
And because that's been such a
tongue twister for me, I'm

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.310
going to refer to it as MEL
and DMEL during the

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.650
presentation.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.190
DYLAN THOMAS: That's
an awesome idea.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.990
RYAN THOMAS: Let's
take it away.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.580
And we'll look at
a presentation

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.340
that we have today.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.000
So this is what we're going
to go through today.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.650
We're going to talk about what
are MEL and DMEL, why they

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.790
were created, what are the
benefits to users, go over a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.910
little bit more information,
and then do a quick

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.700
demonstration on how
to use them.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.160
So what are MEL and DMEL?

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.962
Well, Google has the excellent
location data hosting service

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:31.910
of Google Maps Engine, which
you're probably familiar

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.350
about, where you can upload
your map data, style, and

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.780
store your data in the cloud.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.400
Google also has the map-making
tool of JavaScript API, and

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.140
MEL and DMEL are essentially
to the link between them.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.450
Now, using those, you can
easily put a map on your

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.325
website that shows
your GME content.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.460
So why were they created?

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.410
MEL and DMEL were originally
created because there wasn't a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.800
concise and simple way to put
styled GME data on a non-GME

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.800
map, an example of Maps API.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.960
Since customers went through the
effort to style their data

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.890
in GME, they didn't want to have
to repeat the effort in

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.000
the Maps API JavaScript.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.190
So enter MEL and DMEL.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.790
And MEL was created to make
it easy to visualize your

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.620
content on a map.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.830
And prior to MEL, the only way
to add GME content was to draw

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.760
one feature at a time, which,
as you can imagine, would

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.720
become pretty cumbersome
and time consuming.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.690
DMEL was created to make the
experience for your end user

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.900
much richer.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.320
And you can add styling changes
which reacts to the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.440
user, such as mouseover, which
we'll see later on during the

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.690
demonstration.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.020
So what are the benefits
to users?

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.120
Essentially, this is a powerful
integration between

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.310
our Geo products of
Google Maps Engine

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.860
and JavaScript API.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.880
And it's a simple and easy
way to visualize your

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.160
GME data on a map.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.480
And what's nice about is there's
little to no coding

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.180
experience necessary
for users.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.990
This is all accomplished in
approximately three lines of

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.580
code, which is very simple.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.560
And just giving a little
bit more information.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.470
This does not work with Internet
Explorer 8 or earlier

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.850
versions, so that's just
something to be aware of.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.130
And these are several links
with documentation on

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.860
MapsEngineLayer,
DynamicMapsEngineLayer, and

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.070
then OAuth 2.0 Playground.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.530
And these links will be embedded
within the video for

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.380
you to go to at your leisure as
you come across any issues

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.980
or questions.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.850
So let's move into the
demonstration.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:02.890
As you can see, right now I
am in Google Maps Engine.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.260
And let's say we created a layer
in Google Maps Engine,

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.000
and the data was about
the 2010 census.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.450
Now, if we go over to the right,
we can click on this

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.850
map to view a draft of
our data in GME.

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:33.480
As I zoom out and then zoom in,
we can see the data, or

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.505
the layer, that was placed
upon the map here in GME.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.040
Now, if we click on the map,
we can get some information

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.940
from the layer that
we've added.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.210
So now we want to get this
layer, and place this on a map

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.460
on a website.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.080
So the thing that you want
to do is go to the upper

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.320
right-hand corner--

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.010
and you can see this button in
the upper right-hand corner it

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.510
says access links.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.460
And if you click on that, you
have the asset ID, which is

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:12.100
the same as the layer ID.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:17.330
Now, you can copy
this layer ID .

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.320
And then from here, we'll move
into some actual script that

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.560
we have already filled out.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.290
And now that we're in the
script, you can see if there's

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:28.720
a place for the layer ID.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.320
And this is where you would
place the layer ID that we

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.640
just copied and pasted from
Google Maps Engine.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.760
And as we scroll down--

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.390
Now, this is a little more
complicated than it normally

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.556
would be, because in the
demonstration I'm going to be

00:05:44.556 --> 00:05:48.040
showing to maps side by side,
but it's really only a few

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.220
lines of code.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.670
And you can see we have
the DMEL code here.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.050
And then just below that,
we have the MEL code.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:58.550
DYLAN THOMAS: So that looks
really simple, Ryan.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.020
All you're doing is calling
each of those classes.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.000
And you're just passing in the
layer ID you go, and then

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.040
linking it to one or other
of the maps, right?

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.260
That's it.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.170
RYAN THOMAS: Exactly.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.820
So now that we've looked at the
script, let's go and take

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.250
a look at what the maps
will look like.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.780
These are the two maps that
we're now displaying.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:24.970
Now, the map on the left is from
MapsEngineLayer and is a

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:26.250
static map.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.990
The map the right is from
DynamicMapsEngineLayer and

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.470
it's more dynamic
and interactive.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.150
So let's zoom in on the
map on the left.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.620
And we're headed
toward Kansas.

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:47.310
Now, let's just scroll
over our data.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.870
See, we can click on it and
still get the same information

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.960
that was in Google
Maps Engine.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.780
Now, let's go over to the
map on the right.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:02.610
Zoom in back to Kansas.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.210
Now this time, this map is a
little bit more dynamic and it

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:07.420
has a mouseover effect.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.550
As you can see, as we scroll
over some of the data in the

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:13.220
layer, it'll light up.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:16.620
And so this is just a very
simple example of ways to make

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.810
your maps more interactive for
your users, and make it a

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.800
richer experience for them.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.330
DYLAN THOMAS: The key
difference here as I

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:28.170
understand it, then, is your
MapsEngineLayer, or MEL, as we

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.220
just renamed it, is the left.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:34.630
And that's really getting
traditional map tiles as

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.870
images that are being created
in Maps Engine, right?

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:41.320
So that we're downloading map
tiles and displaying them.

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.870
And that's why you have to click
on a feature to go get

00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:46.150
the feature information
on the left.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:49.180
But on the right, we're actually
streaming the vectors

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.070
from the MapsEngineLayer.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.580
Engine And that's why when
they're down on the client, we

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.330
have more of this
interactivity.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.090
RYAN THOMAS: That's
exactly right.

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:03.410
And this is what MEL and DMEL
can do for you by taking the

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.450
Google Maps Engine data and
displaying them for you with

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:08.770
the JavaScript API.

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:09.480
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.480
So it looks like it when you're
hovering there, I saw

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:12.480
the change of color.

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.510
So obviously, you can listen
to events with

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:22.370
DynamicMapsEngineLayer, like
mouseover or onclick,

00:08:22.370 --> 00:08:27.210
obviously and then change an
individual feature as well.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.870
RYAN THOMAS: That's right.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.480
DYLAN THOMAS: Well, thanks for
showing that, Ryan I do have a

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.110
couple of follow on questions.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.230
This is, after all, the
Enterprise folks who are

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.679
listening in.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:41.890
So one of things I wanted to ask
was about authentication

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.490
and authorization.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:49.500
I know that OAuth 2.0 is the
protocol we use to provide

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:52.800
authorization for Map Layers
so that access control data

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.780
isn't just wide open
to the internet.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:57.280
Are there some resources
available or a place a

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.480
customer can go to learn
more about that?

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.290
RYAN THOMAS: There are.

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:02.950
And that's a really good
question which a

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:04.310
lot of people have.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.140
In the links that I showed
earlier in the presentation,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.740
there was a link to an example
in the developers page where

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:15.460
it will have a JavaScript
example about OAuth 2.0.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.885
And another link is for the
OAuth 2.0 Playground, where

00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:22.470
you can go and learn more about
OAuth 2.0 and how to

00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.620
utilize it.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:28.430
And if you have additional
questions, feel more than

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:31.170
welcome to get in touch with
us through the community to

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.750
help answer any specific
questions you may have.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.330
DYLAN THOMAS: Good point.

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.910
Thanks for plugging the
community, there, Ryan.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:37.500
That's pretty nice.

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.330
So the two pieces you mentioned
there is the OAuth

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.270
Playground, where you can learn
more about OAuth just as

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:47.230
a base protocol and the approach
to doing this.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.410
And the second part is a
specific example for Maps

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:51.740
Engine, right?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:52.390
RYAN THOMAS: Exactly.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.380
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.370
One other thing I was thinking
about as you were hovering

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:57.700
over the map feature, there, is
you're changing the color,

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.140
but there's no reason you
couldn't just call any kind of

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.070
code at that point, right?

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:05.950
You hover over a feature, you
could show a picture or go get

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.090
some Wikipedia data about
that county in Kansas.

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:13.110
I know that a lot of customers
on the DynamicMapsEngineLayer

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:17.000
also want to then go and query
the Google Maps Engine via the

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.440
API as well.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.700
Are there any limitations that
they should think about as

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:24.260
they're streaming these vectors
down to the client

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:28.260
using the Maps API and then
querying back to the feature

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.690
in Maps Engine?

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.360
RYAN THOMAS: That's
a good point.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.340
The possibilities are
pretty great on what

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:36.310
you can do with that.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:39.510
But people should just
be aware that the

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.890
limit is 1,000 features.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:45.350
And so going over that, you
may run into some issues.

00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:48.880
DYLAN THOMAS: So you're saying
that there's no limitation on

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.030
the number of things that Maps
API could display, at least

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.440
today in terms of--

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.730
we're not going to say
a million, that may

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.480
be too many, right?

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.070
But the GME API itself is what's
used to make this thing

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.190
work, and that has a limitation
today of 1,000

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:05.700
features per request, right?

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.570
RYAN THOMAS: Exactly.

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:09.200
As long as that doesn't go up,
GME is essentially doing the

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:09.850
heavy lifting.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.390
And so 1,000 features in GME
is the limit as of today.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.540
DYLAN THOMAS: Got it.

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.060
Well, Ryan, I wanted to really
thank you for taking the time

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.840
to show us some tips and tricks
there on MEL and DMEL

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.000
today, so thank you.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.930
And we'll make sure that this
video is available online for

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:31.990
those of you who couldn't
watch it live, and we'll

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:32.860
include the links.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.040
And I want to reiterate
Ryan's offer

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.340
to help in the community.

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.385
So if you do have further
questions, just get in touch

00:11:39.385 --> 00:11:40.570
with us and let us know.

00:11:40.570 --> 00:11:41.820
Thanks very much.
