00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:09.880
MALE SPEAKER: Hi everybody.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.420
Thanks for coming.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.950
So, like many people here,
I'm a bit of an optimizer.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.690
I really enjoy the
opportunity to do things

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.960
for myself-- go on
to the flight search

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.210
and look for exactly the right
travel plans and whatnot,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.100
and not have to go through
some other intermediary.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.060
But, as Craig will tell us,
there's a dark side to this.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.530
We don't necessarily
have this choice anymore

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.280
in a lot of different domains.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.300
So, we're very pleased
to welcome Dr. Craig

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.170
Lambert on the topic of shadow
work, middle-class serfdom, all

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.610
these things that contemporary
economy and technology forces

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.230
us more and more to do
for ourselves, for better

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.490
or for worse.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.230
CRAIG LAMBERT: Thank you.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.310
Thank you very much, Richard.

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.000
It's a pleasure to join all of
you and to be here at Google,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.490
one of my favorite
companies that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.910
has changed my life for
the better in so many ways.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.560
Ways, speaking of which,
is a pun fully intended.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.180
And to share with you some
of what I tried to describe

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.460
and doing almost a
little whistle blowing

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.700
in my book "Shadow Work."

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.780
This opening slide here refers
to middle-class serfdom.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.230
And what do I mean
by-- that's what

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.650
we'll understand a
little better by the time

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.620
we're done here today.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.820
When I say middle class
serfdom, what is it?

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.470
I mean what went on here that
turned us into people working

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.570
for nothing?

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.780
And a big thing for
me is, how do we

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.410
start losing our leisure
time, which is precious?

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.360
And there's not that much of it.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.990
It's being eaten away
by a kind of erosion,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.130
by social and economic forces.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.090
It all began about
four years ago.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.780
I was standing in line
at the supermarket,

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.920
waiting to check
out my groceries.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.500
And I saw, about 20
feet away, a woman

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.850
I knew slightly who was a
partner at a downtown law firm.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.390
And I knew she made at
least $300,000 a year.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.970
She was a serious
attorney in Boston.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.316
But she was scanning
and bagging groceries.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.150
Of course, they were
her own groceries.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.970
But I realized, now, that
that's an entry level job.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.330
That's sort of a
minimum wage job.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.410
And I realized, in fact, she's
not getting minimum wage.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.930
She's getting
absolutely nothing.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.220
She's working for nothing.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.094
And then I begin to
think, there are actually

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:56.260
a lot of examples of this kind
of work that we are now doing,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.620
that include things like
pumping our own gas, right?

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.560
Or at the airport kiosk,
checking ourselves in.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.000
We book our own travel.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.490
We've become our own
travel agents online now.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.920
And we will be there
at the computer,

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.420
doing shadow work, as I
call it, or even wandering

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.730
around the aisles
of big box stores,

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.440
trying to find someone who
may help us, a salesperson.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.490
You know, hello?

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.040
Hello?

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.420
It's like a ghost town.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.160
There are so few salespeople
that you more or less

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.310
have to become your own, wait
on yourself in a lot of ways.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.650
When you go to Zipcar, you
become your own rental agent

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.050
to rent your car.

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.200
There's your car rental
agent, is your zip card.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.020
Or Uber.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.400
We become our own taxi
dispatchers with Uber.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.470
And even as far as home
pregnancy testing, things

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.170
that used to be done in a lab or
the doctor's office, an OB/GYN,

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.820
whatever, we now can do in
the privacy of our homes.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.070
And there are certain
advantages to this, of course.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.360
But then again, some people
liked that moment of discovery

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.400
that they were pregnant
their physician as a sort

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.050
of a joyful thing to share.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.570
So, shadow work includes
a lot of things.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.950
I'll define it here
as all the unpaid jobs

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.750
we do on behalf of
businesses and organizations.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.430
And it turns out that I am
not the very first person

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.150
to use this term, or even
to title a book that way.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.290
Ivan Illich, the
great social critic,

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.960
philosopher,
sociologist, he was a man

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.080
who spoke about 10
languages, I think.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.500
In 1981, his book came out.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.650
And he was a brilliant
guy who wrote

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.080
a lot of very provocative
books in the '70s,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.440
like "Deschooling Society"
and "Medical Nemesis."

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.780
And he had an idea
about shadow work

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.960
which overlaps a
lot with my idea.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.720
Mine isn't exactly
the same as Illich's.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.220
I've made it a
little more practical

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.250
and sort of adapted it
for the 21st century.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:16.910
My book looks like this.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.890
I talk about the unpaid,
unseen jobs that fill your day.

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.390
And I consider my book kind of
a field guide to shadow work.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.860
It's a book that will help
you spot it in the wild.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.130
And having the concept is
great, but the concept alone

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.460
is not really enough to see
all the instances we have,

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.770
because they sneak up on us.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.470
They more or less have become
so integrated into our routines

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.870
that we don't
notice, necessarily,

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.860
when we're doing
a job that someone

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.670
used to do for a salary.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:54.370
So, I will quickly
tell you there

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.150
are four main forces that create
shadow work-- the robotics

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.180
and digital technology,
democratization of expertise,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.460
the information dragnet,
and new social norms.

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.170
And my talk today will
go through these four

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:10.680
major factors in order,
starting with robotics

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.160
and digital technology.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.850
Now, in the history of
industry since the Industrial

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.220
Revolution, there
has been automation.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.060
Automation has
often meant layoffs.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.610
Jobs were being
replaced by machines.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.200
People didn't like it
sometimes, but this has

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.720
been part of industry forever.

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:43.020
Technology will delete
work, but these machines

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.740
were killing off jobs at
the point of production,

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.990
whereas the shadow work
today in the 21st century

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:55.580
is removing jobs at
the point of sale,

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:56.850
not the point of production.

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:59.330
Now, that may mean there's
a bump in unemployment

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:00.200
due to shadow work.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.610
And it will be
structural unemployment.

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:05.560
It's unlikely to go away very
quickly, because it's not

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.730
part of the business cycle.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:09.660
It's due to the
evolution of technology

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.670
and socioeconomic forces.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.960
So, kiosks and
customers together

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:21.730
are now doing jobs that
were once done by staff.

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.140
And it's a hidden force
driving unemployment.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.260
We don't know quite
to what degree.

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:28.080
It hasn't been quantified yet.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.240
I would say that
my book is probably

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.640
the first one, at
least since Illich,

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.720
to shine a light on this
and really define it

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.390
as an ongoing condition.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:42.170
And so nobody has measured
the degree of unemployment

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.980
that shadow work
might be causing.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:45.970
But we do know this.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.610
There are a lot
more points of sale

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.130
than there are
points of production.

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:53.560
So, there are places
where technology

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.250
will enable consumers
to dispense products--

00:07:56.250 --> 00:08:00.680
for example, dispense your
own gasoline at the pump,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.540
as this woman is
doing, or dispense

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:05.250
your own frozen yogurt.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.440
There are yogurt self-serve
emporiums everywhere

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.150
where you'll find these
kinds of taps or nozzles

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.440
to put your own yogurt,
usually not many flavors,

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:19.207
but there'll be a
lot of toppings.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:20.790
And there's usually
only one employee.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.830
The person is the cashier.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.020
There's no need for anyone
to dish out the goodies,

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.330
since you're doing
it for yourself.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:29.420
Even in bars.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.670
There's a new technology
called iPourIt--

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.429
there's a couple of
competitors to that-- where you

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.030
can pour your own beer or wine.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:39.850
You get a bracelet
issued to you,

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.350
verifying you're
old enough to drink

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:43.039
and you've got an ID on you.

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:47.520
And you will step up
to the taps like this

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.560
and draft your own beer.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.010
You can even sample a microbrew
that you may or may not

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:56.530
like by just taking
a couple ounces.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:58.789
You'll be charged by the ounce.

00:08:58.789 --> 00:09:00.330
The thing is, though,
you notice what

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.480
happens here is that
throughout history, bartenders

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:08.400
have been one of the great
lubricants of socialization.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.820
The longstanding tradition
of confiding in a bartender,

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.790
flirting with a bartender,
joking with a bartender,

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.030
hanging out.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.670
Think about Ted
Danson on Cheers.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:22.110
The whole Cheers
tradition involves

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.800
interaction between the
customer and the barkeep.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:31.520
And when you have self-serve
taps like this taking over,

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.010
you will be putting
bartenders out of work

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.665
and also changing the
transaction a great deal,

00:09:36.665 --> 00:09:38.040
taking the human
being out of it.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.080
And you will see that's often
the case in shadow work,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.380
is that the people are
getting squeezed out

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.560
of the commercial transaction.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.430
And it becomes work between
a robot and a customer,

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:52.470
in one form or another.

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.220
Robotic and customer.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.060
You can look at tablets
on restaurant tables

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.910
now sometimes, like this
one, where they will

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:06.020
take the place of a waitperson.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.240
You'll just order for
yourself on the tablet.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.370
You can slide your credit card
through at the end and pay,

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:14.420
and it never leaves your hands.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:17.930
And of course, inevitably,
there is a survey

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.187
at the end of your meal.

00:10:20.187 --> 00:10:21.770
We'll talk a little
more about surveys

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.550
later, the ubiquity of surveys.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:25.820
But they certainly want to
know, how was it for you?

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.800
And that's a part of
the delivery of goods,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.720
restaurant food in this case.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.150
And there is even areas where
you can design and produce

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.200
the products you consume.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.035
This is a kiosk of
sorts in New York City

00:10:43.035 --> 00:10:47.300
that New Balance set up which
allows the customer to design

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.420
and produce their own shoes.

00:10:53.126 --> 00:10:54.500
You see the color
swatches there.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.860
There 's shoe laces
at the bottom.

00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:59.447
You can mess around
with different parts

00:10:59.447 --> 00:11:00.530
of the design of the shoe.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.340
And you can actually
fabricate the shoe you

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.490
want that will be yours alone.

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:08.820
It may be one that no one
else would want to wear.

00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:10.930
But it will be unique to you.

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:12.680
And will be certainly
it will be your shoe

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.680
in every sense of the word.

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:18.236
So, we find that instead
of just wearing the shoes,

00:11:18.236 --> 00:11:19.610
that now you have
to design them.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:22.800
Instead of just drinking the
beer, you now have to pour it.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.000
And that is part of this
erosion of leisure time

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.210
that we've got to
be watching out for,

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.660
is how our free time
is turning into work

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:32.420
time in one way or another.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:36.510
And it's happening
in a very subtle way.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.750
It's easy not to notice.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:43.780
Now, the second part of
the shadow work equation

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.450
is the democratization
of expertise.

00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.890
Let me explain what
I mean by that.

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.720
Typically, expertise,
in many fields,

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.040
has the shape of a pyramid.

00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.930
At the bottom, that
green line, there's

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:01.610
a huge number of
people who really

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:05.920
have no particular expertise at
all in whatever the field is.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.270
And then, at a higher
level, as you go up

00:12:09.270 --> 00:12:11.020
through these
different colors, there

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.580
are smaller numbers of
people who know more and more

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:15.450
about it, who are more expert.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:19.310
Then at the very top, you
get the world-class experts--

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.420
the Warren Buffetts
of investment,

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.320
the Michael Jordans
of basketball,

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.270
the Julia Childs of cooking.

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.770
There's a very small
number of them,

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:33.330
and they really are
in a true elite.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:38.260
And expertise generally has
been distributed like that.

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.090
But the internet
has brought populism

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:44.610
to the information economy.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:47.610
And that kind of
levels of the pyramid.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.750
It flattens it out
in a lot of ways

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:56.330
because it allows people
to access information that

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:59.800
was once held
exclusively by experts.

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.530
And it can even be quite
sophisticated information

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:05.910
like that of professionals
like doctors and lawyers.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:08.450
There's a cartoon
where the patient says,

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.050
I've already got a
diagnosis from HomeDoc.com,

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.610
but I thought I'd see
you for a second opinion.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.430
And this is what a physician
may run into these days

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.680
because WebMD,
Wikipedia-- doctors

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.240
themselves use
Wikipedia, because it's

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.070
updated constantly.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:29.870
It's the most current
source of information

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:33.080
about many medical phenomena.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:37.350
I had a fellow I knew
of named Anders, who

00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.770
had received a
fairly serious cancer

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:41.430
diagnosis a few years ago.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:43.260
He sat down with his doctor.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:46.200
And the doctor explained to
him three major treatment

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.690
strategies, including surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation,

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:52.720
and the risks and
rewards of both,

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:54.240
the benefits and the costs.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.580
And it sometimes was
even political issues,

00:13:56.580 --> 00:14:00.715
like will the FDA approve
this drug for use or not?

00:14:00.715 --> 00:14:02.590
And he went through the
whole thing, a fairly

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:03.650
elaborate discussion.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.590
And then he says, well,
which one do you want?

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.969
Well, this guy Anders,
the patient, is thinking,

00:14:11.969 --> 00:14:12.760
wait a minute, Doc.

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.370
I thought you were
going to tell me

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.290
which was the right way to go.

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:17.920
And if you went
back to the 1950s,

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.271
that's what would have happened.

00:14:20.271 --> 00:14:22.770
Doctor would have said, well,
here's what we're going to do.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.420
But now we're in an era
of patient empowerment.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.160
And people do their
own medical diagnosis,

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.700
as we just saw in this cartoon.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.720
They can access a lot
of this information,

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.010
and they want to know.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:36.140
There is a bit of
a stumbling block,

00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:41.360
however, because, as we know,
we can't believe everything

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:42.720
we read on the internet.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.230
I'll show you a
plaque next that was

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.810
used at the Harvard-Yale
football game.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:52.470
I think it was last year.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.807
The colleges like to talk to
each other before the game

00:14:54.807 --> 00:14:55.640
and during the game.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:58.680
And this placard, some
of the Harvard fans

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:03.770
were holding this, right?

00:15:03.770 --> 00:15:07.800
The idea that Yale
cites Wikipedia.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:12.300
Well, the problem is that
Wikipedia, it's very good,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.690
but it's full of errors.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:15.970
Like most every source of
knowledge, it has mistakes.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.590
But people tend to trust it,
maybe more than they should.

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:28.680
And I have to say that even your
own YouTube here, as wonderful

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.580
as it is, people
trust the videos,

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.820
even more than they trust
what they read in words.

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.800
And unfortunately,
research has shown

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.980
that those health videos are
even more inaccurate than what

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:41.270
you read in the text.

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:42.370
But people love them.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:47.960
And so the self diagnosis
era, the self-care and patient

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.330
empowerment era, has
its downsides too,

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:52.160
in that patients are
caring for themselves,

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.630
but they may be using
incorrect information to do so.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:01.850
Now another thing that happens,
in this era of democratization

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.282
of expertise, is this.

00:16:05.282 --> 00:16:09.060
This is the former
receptionist's desk

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.980
or executive assistant's desk.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.370
Only the top executives anymore
seem to have human assistants.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:19.030
Most of that job has been
taken over by mobile devices--

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:23.850
making calls, receiving calls,
screening calls, sending out

00:16:23.850 --> 00:16:28.520
emails, getting email,
researching items.

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.910
The handheld is
taking over for what

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.900
used to be called a secretary.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:34.500
There's a company
many of you may

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.600
know called Forrester
Research that is around here,

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.380
and it works worldwide.

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:45.250
They have 1,300 employees,
and among those, there

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:48.990
are five executive assistants.

00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:52.740
The era of the support
staff has changed.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:53.730
They've thinned out.

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:58.300
And we have instead executives
doing their own copying,

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:00.670
doing jobs these
assistants once did.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:05.200
And now, instead of at home
surfing Google and the web.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.300
We are now handling
the postage meter

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.760
and doing the photocopying.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.940
And this democratizes
the office somewhat.

00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.569
Everyone is chipping in
on those routine jobs.

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:22.079
On the other hand, here's a
doctor maybe entering some data

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.930
on a digital medical record.

00:17:25.930 --> 00:17:28.380
And there are
efficiency experts that

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:29.760
might question
the idea of having

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.730
a doctor, who might be
worth $200 to $300 an hour

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.470
on the payroll, doing
this kind of data entry,

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:41.410
essentially, on electronic
medical records.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:46.750
And sometimes the support staff
jobs still need to be done.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.150
And it may not be done
by the existing staff,

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:51.570
but they could be
passed on to interns.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:55.520
I think we all know how
ubiquitous internships are.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.000
The ones in the
private sector tend

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.240
to pay better than the
nonprofit or governmental ones.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.540
But they are taking
up some of the slack

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.250
for support staff who used
to do these works for salary

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:11.920
and benefits that are quite
a bit more costly to whoever

00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.470
is now employing the interns.

00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:22.110
Now, here's another evolution,
more in the tech area.

00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:25.640
If you go back as
far as the '80s,

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.290
there used to be this thing
called tech support that people

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:29.980
did, believe it or
not, live people,

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.477
like these men and
women, who knew stuff.

00:18:33.477 --> 00:18:34.810
You could get them on the phone.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:37.610
When they rolled out personal
computers for the first time,

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:40.310
a lot of the users
didn't know anything,

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.230
and needed help, had to
have their hands held

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.896
walking through.

00:18:42.896 --> 00:18:46.207
Might take a long time
on hold to get to them,

00:18:46.207 --> 00:18:48.040
but these people would
actually speak to you

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.630
and walk you through
your problems.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:53.850
There is only one
problem with that, which

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.070
is that it's very expensive.

00:18:55.070 --> 00:18:58.430
This is very labor-intensive
work, and as we know,

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.020
that kind of tech support
hasn't completely vanished,

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:05.890
but it has attenuated
to the point

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:09.186
it's an endangered
species, to say the least.

00:19:09.186 --> 00:19:11.060
Three's very, very little
of it-- too costly,

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:15.000
and so much of it can now be
done more efficiently online.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.290
And so these workers
here have been replaced

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:22.750
by this, the user group.

00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:25.610
User groups are our
fellow customers.

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:31.290
They're your fellow Apple
users, or BMW drivers,

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.640
your Microsoft users.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.170
And they will coach you.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:36.160
You can put your question
up on the user group,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.701
and unpaid shadow working
customers will answer it.

00:19:40.701 --> 00:19:43.200
And you actually do get very
good results a lot of the time.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.390
I had a problem with my
BMW car a few years ago.

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:52.850
And I had uncoupled the
battery, and the radio

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.270
stopped working right.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.244
And I put up the question
about, what does that mean?

00:19:57.244 --> 00:19:59.160
And within a matter of
hours, I got a response

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:02.700
from New Zealand
which was accurate.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.260
And they'll send you wiring
diagrams of the fuse boxes.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.300
There are mavens out there.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.440
There are these sort
of amateur experts

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.210
who are happy to inform you
of what you need to learn.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:16.840
God bless them.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.920
But still, we go
back to the idea,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.760
instead of driving that
car with the top down,

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.170
we're now helping another
Bimmer owner get his top

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:27.590
up on his convertible, maybe.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:29.610
Or instead of
surfing YouTube, I'm

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:31.780
coaching a guy in
Finland who wants

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:36.130
to download a clip from
YouTube to put in his mashup.

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:38.524
We're doing some work there
that may be satisfying,

00:20:38.524 --> 00:20:40.440
but we're working where
we used to be playing.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:42.730
And there goes our
leisure, again.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:45.470
So, again, stay on
the lookout for this.

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:49.440
Now the third area, I'm calling
the information dragnet.

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.090
And this is the
part of the equation

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:58.890
that involves the relentless
search for information.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:02.920
I have this famous quote
from Hal Varian, who

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.195
is sort of a local fellow here.

00:21:06.195 --> 00:21:07.820
I don't know if he's
still with Google,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:12.070
but-- is he still around?

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:19.070
He's a [INAUDIBLE], a big
fellow in the world of Google,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.260
and wider.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.940
Where he said, I keep saying,
the sexy job of the next 10

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.040
years will be statisticians.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.879
People think I am joking.

00:21:26.879 --> 00:21:29.420
But who would have guessed that
computer engineers would have

00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:32.700
been the sexy job of the 1990s?

00:21:32.700 --> 00:21:34.120
That was in 2009.

00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:38.730
And there are laptop covers
that look like this-- Sorry,

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:43.810
this girl is already taken by
a smart, sexy statistician.

00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:44.710
For sure.

00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:47.410
And maybe this is
now the sexiest man

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:54.090
alive, Bill Gates with his
birth-control eyeglasses,

00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:55.350
as some call them.

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.120
Or is it this man?

00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.340
Is it Mr. Mark Zuckerberg?

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.790
Both Harvard dropouts.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.490
I sometimes think
that was my mistake.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:07.840
I stuck around and graduated.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.170
If only I had known enough
to drop out, like these guys.

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:17.550
But there is this information
dragnet out there.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.940
And this is the one place
today where I will give you

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:24.250
a brief reading from "Shadow
Work," just a couple paragraphs

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.030
about what makes information
and statisticians so sexy,

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:31.330
and why have they become
such a predominant factor

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:33.490
in our economy.

00:22:33.490 --> 00:22:36.930
This is a section called The
Grassroots of Billionaires.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:40.610
Though the term information
economy has become a cliche,

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:44.790
few have traced this stream
of data to its headwaters.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:48.260
The torrent of information
that washes through alien life

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:50.210
does have a source.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.040
You can see it in the mirror.

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.710
It is you.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:57.350
The data that institutions
seek, accumulate, analyze,

00:22:57.350 --> 00:23:01.260
and constantly refresh comes
largely from their clients.

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.200
Organizations recognize
that people are willing,

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:08.320
free of charge, to provide
data on themselves.

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.450
Time spent doing
so is shadow work.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:16.710
And I'll add another paragraph
that comes shortly after.

00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:19.830
Social media like
Facebook and LinkedIn

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:21.580
serve their members
free of charge

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:25.580
in order to extract reams
of information from them.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:29.990
With more than 1.35
billion active users,

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.550
Facebook has built a
gigantic database, which

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.730
offers commercial entities
a huge archive of consumers'

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:42.190
names and email addresses, along
with rich demographic profiles;

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:46.050
preferences in music, movies,
gifts, and other things;

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:49.190
groups they belong to;
apps and games they play;

00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:52.500
and of course their
networks of friends.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.500
Hence, Facebook
constantly encourages

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:58.410
users to post more data--
words, pictures, and video--

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.750
and to add more friends
to their circles.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.820
Shadow working users
comply, funneling

00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:11.420
their 21st-century petroleum
into Facebook's pool of oil.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:19.530
So, Facebook is an institution
that confirms the information

00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:22.470
era proverb, if you aren't
paying for the product

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:25.370
you are the product.

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:27.530
When Facebook went
public a few years ago,

00:24:27.530 --> 00:24:30.220
and for billions
of dollars, there

00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:34.250
were some of the Facebook users
who said, where's our cut?

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:38.160
Now, people very willingly
open Facebook accounts

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.540
and post to their pages.

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.420
And they're recreationally
enjoying themselves.

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.730
Socially, they're not working.

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:45.188
And they don't feel
it's like work.

00:24:45.188 --> 00:24:49.820
But, then again, when Facebook
turns around and sells

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:54.230
that information for large,
large amounts of money

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:58.317
to their advertisers,
etc., it does

00:24:58.317 --> 00:25:00.150
begin to look a little
bit like shadow work,

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.674
because the customers are
creating a product that's

00:25:03.674 --> 00:25:04.840
valuable in the marketplace.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.030
And they're doing it without
any share of the take.

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:10.960
So, that's probably an
area that will continue

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.400
to evolve in the future.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.440
There is another aspect
of the information dragnet

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:22.650
that some call password fatigue,
the need to constantly add

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:26.310
more passwords and
sometimes usernames.

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:29.054
Don't even think about using
your own name as a user name.

00:25:29.054 --> 00:25:30.720
With seven billion
people on this earth,

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:37.270
you'll be surprised when you
find that DrupalSandomirsky17

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.830
is already taken.

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.580
Luckily, we use our
e-mail addresses, mostly,

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.620
at this point.

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.220
But it can lead to
that kind of feeling,

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:50.310
when you are asked once
more for a new password

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:52.300
or have to refresh or
change the password

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:55.370
that you set a
month or three ago.

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:58.510
And that's just the nature
of the information economy

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.010
we work in.

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.450
And another side factor
that comes up with this

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:04.990
is the survey.

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:06.270
The relentless surveying.

00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.580
Brand awareness
survey, in this case.

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:14.180
Seems like any time you buy
something, or get a service,

00:26:14.180 --> 00:26:19.480
or go to the doctor, or take
your car in to be serviced,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.670
any commercial transaction,
there's a follow-up survey.

00:26:22.670 --> 00:26:25.874
We'd like to know how were
you satisfied or unsatisfied.

00:26:25.874 --> 00:26:27.790
We'd like to know more
to improve our service.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:31.630
Sounds good, but don't forget
that what's happening is,

00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.190
these corporations
or non-profits

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:36.780
or schools or hospitals
are also helping themselves

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.990
to your free time.

00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:40.620
You don't have to
take the survey.

00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.210
Maybe you like doing it,
but if you don't, you're

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:46.150
providing them free data.

00:26:46.150 --> 00:26:51.250
But that data is something that
takes you some time to produce.

00:26:51.250 --> 00:26:55.220
Just the other day, I
had a phone call, a poll,

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.300
and I said, all right,
I'll do the poll.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:03.430
And it was a matter of
punching the telephone numbers

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.620
to reply to the questions.

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.578
But they were going,
seven to eight minutes, it

00:27:06.578 --> 00:27:07.510
was still going on.

00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:09.960
I mean, how much polling
you guys going to do here?

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.030
So, eventually, I hung up.

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:14.680
That was the end of that for me.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.560
But essentially
institutions, yes,

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.710
are helping themselves to
chunks of our free time.

00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:24.170
And instead of enjoying
that new video game,

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:28.040
we're filling out a survey
on how enjoyable it was.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:33.070
So, just be aware that this
is a dynamic of shadow work

00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.860
that is in place.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.180
Now, the last area I
will discuss with you

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:39.790
is one of new social norms.

00:27:39.790 --> 00:27:43.080
These are 21st-century norms.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.760
And we are living, as
you are already aware--

00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:51.860
and some of what I've said
prepares you to go to grasp it,

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.980
if you haven't already--
is that it's an emerging

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.580
world of self-service.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.470
We go to the restaurant
and we don't necessarily

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.040
get any table service.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:06.110
We may go to a
buffet, a bar, and do

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.920
the shadow work of helping
yourself to the food

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.580
as you like it.

00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.000
Now, you do get it
the way you want it.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.500
You can have the
amount you want.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.260
You can put on dressings
or sauces as you like them.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.340
You'll get it your way.

00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:21.150
But you do the work.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:25.920
Instead of sitting at
the table and talking

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.000
with your family
or your friends,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.540
waiting for the waitstaff
to come and help you,

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:35.090
you are up there,
dishing out the food,

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:39.730
taking the food back to the
table yourself, on your plate.

00:28:39.730 --> 00:28:43.930
And this waitress who was
that friendly person who

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.500
used to help out, doesn't
have that job anymore.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.030
Or this bus person,
this bus boy here,

00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:51.335
this is in a New York deli.

00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:55.010
That has changed.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:57.400
These people are disappearing.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.930
When you go to a fast food
restaurant, which as we know

00:28:59.930 --> 00:29:03.660
are the largest chunk of
the restaurant business now.

00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:06.650
It's more than 50%
we qualify, I think,

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:07.955
as fast food restaurants.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.290
It's not like a
fine dining, where

00:29:12.290 --> 00:29:14.890
you have china
plates and china cups

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:18.350
and silverware made of
silver, or made of metal

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:23.420
at least, which are washed
and re-used after the meal.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:27.840
Here, you get paper plates,
paper cups, plastic utensils,

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.240
which are all thrown away.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:31.880
And when you buy your
meal, you own those things.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.360
They're yours. ,

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.400
So you are tasked now
with dispensing of them.

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.890
And it becomes your job to
bus your own table, instead of

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.580
this gentleman here.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:49.060
You take care of all the
detritus, all the leavings

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.070
and the napkins
and all that stuff.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.570
And you throw it away yourself.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:56.350
You've replaced him.

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:59.750
Today you may order at the
counter, pay right away,

00:29:59.750 --> 00:30:02.090
carry your food to the table,
and then bus the table.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:03.750
You've done the
whole transaction.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:08.560
Salad bars, of course, have
been ubiquitous for decades now.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:11.440
That's the same tradeoff, where
you can have a salad exactly

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.120
your way, whereas there was a
time when people in the kitchen

00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.630
made the salad.

00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:19.130
And the waitress
would bring it to you.

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:23.830
And that has now become a very
common form of shadow work.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:29.710
The place called Ikea
is another fountain

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.220
of shadow work of a
little bit different sort,

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.700
since we are producing
the product in this case.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:41.320
We, in many cases at least,
assemble our Ikea furniture

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.580
from instructions.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:46.510
They can be a little
bit puzzling at times.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:51.950
And it can be a kind of a
conundrum for the customer

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:56.640
to figure out how to put this
thing together, confusing

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.220
and even stressful for couples.

00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:01.570
There is a saying that
they say Ikea is actually

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.740
a Swedish word for argument.

00:31:04.740 --> 00:31:08.340
I'm sure it has
happened, and there you

00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:09.970
go, because how do you do this.

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.560
Well, there is something
called the Ikea effect

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:16.290
that Professor Michael Norton
of Harvard Business School

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.300
coined with his colleagues
in a paper a few years ago,

00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:23.080
that people value products more
highly when they make them.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.040
So actually, Ikea has
us working for them.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.650
You built it yourself.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:31.020
You'll see this is an origami
folding thing that people made.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:34.750
And the builder, whether
it was easy or difficult,

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.360
certainly evaluates
it more highly

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:41.970
than I outside people on the
right, the evaluators, who

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:44.410
don't think necessarily it
was as good as the person who

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:45.510
did the folding.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:49.790
And that's true, as well, of
building our own furniture.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.550
Either way, people
like what they build.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.190
So, Ikea is building a
relationship with its customers

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:59.220
in that sense that may actually,
in the long run, pay off.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:02.150
I thought it was
interesting, a few years ago,

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:05.460
it was revealed they
had in decades past

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:08.960
used prisoners in East Germany.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.980
It was sort of a
forced labor thing,

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.400
to build some of
the Ikea products.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.410
But now, they've
enlightened themselves.

00:32:15.410 --> 00:32:17.590
And now we have the
customers who are doing it.

00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.090
Instead of the
Stasi running them,

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:24.540
the people volunteer to do that,
and they actually may enjoy it.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:31.370
So, there are all these
various endangered species

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:35.070
of people building
furniture or waiting

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:38.520
on tables that seem to be
disappearing in favor of shadow

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.320
workers in this modern world.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:44.210
A guy like this, what
happened to this guy?

00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:46.770
The bus driver.

00:32:46.770 --> 00:32:48.380
he was there all the time.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.640
There are still bus drivers.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.770
But, in many cases,
instead, we have

00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:55.970
Mom as the school bus
driver, driving her kids

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.840
as a chauffeur to school.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:02.010
I had one guy of my
own age saying, gee,

00:33:02.010 --> 00:33:06.260
I'm not sure my dad knew
where my school was.

00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.000
But the modern
parent is much more

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.060
involved with their children,
for better or worse.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:14.520
And a lot of time
is spent driving.

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:18.000
Now, it's nice to have time
with your kids, for sure.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.130
I will say, at the same
time, this movement

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.070
towards chauffeuring
children in cars

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:25.910
is an environmental
disaster, in that

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:30.080
instead of one bus showing up at
the school with 40 kids on it,

00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.830
you've got 40 Volvos
and Audis showing up

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.900
with one kid each
or two in the cars,

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.940
and releasing a heck
of a lot more carbon

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:40.480
dioxide in the process.

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.450
So, that's a form
of shadow work that

00:33:42.450 --> 00:33:46.089
has its environmental
consequences, shall we say.

00:33:46.089 --> 00:33:47.380
And then there is another form.

00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.270
Even more extreme in
school is home schooling,

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:53.136
where the parents take over
not only the school bus driver,

00:33:53.136 --> 00:33:54.760
but the teacher, and
the administrator,

00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.160
and the librarian, and
everybody else at the school.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.960
They do everything.

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.870
And so that is another
nice piece of unpaid work.

00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:05.030
It affects recreation.

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:11.739
And sandlot basketball,
those were the days.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:14.340
Sandlot means it's
done with kids.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:15.279
Kids did everything.

00:34:15.279 --> 00:34:17.820
They organized the games, they
picked the teams, they played.

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:18.929
There were no referees.

00:34:18.929 --> 00:34:21.659
If you had a disagreement,
you're saying,

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:24.000
OK, your goal is from
that big tree over there,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.280
and this big boulder
here is our goal.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:30.690
If there was something that
the players disagreed with,

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:32.440
you had to settle it
with the other kids.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.130
There were no adults present.

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:35.820
That was part of the fun.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.280
But that has changed.

00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:43.560
Those sandlot days are over,
and now, instead, you have this.

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.580
Uniforms, you've got leagues,
you've got schedules,

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:50.780
you've got playoffs, you've
got sponsors, you have budgets.

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.850
It's all done in imitation
of professional sports.

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:55.880
And let me remind you,
professional sports

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.930
are sports that are work.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:01.210
Tom Brady goes to work when
he throws the football.

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:02.720
He's not just there having fun.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.210
He may be having fun,
but these are jobs.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:07.870
Pro athletes are working.

00:35:07.870 --> 00:35:12.370
And a lot of play, that used
to be play when the kids only

00:35:12.370 --> 00:35:14.620
were doing it, has
been sacrificed

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.470
to the adult takeover
of children's sports.

00:35:17.470 --> 00:35:20.470
Adults are there
in so many ways.

00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:24.700
They're there as coaches,
exhorting their teams

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.510
and teaching their kids
on the team to play.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.752
They're there as referees.

00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:32.590
They're there as linespeople
on the soccer field.

00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:36.770
And of course, very
opinionated, very vocal parents

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:41.110
who are there at the games,
giving their two cents'

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.620
worth to the referee.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:48.440
The only thing that's getting
left out here are the kids.

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:52.860
And it's unfortunate.

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.160
A lot of surveys have shown
that many, many kids-- maybe

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.960
a sizable majority, even--
have quit organized sports

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.110
by age 13.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:04.370
And they give different reasons,
but it mostly boils down to,

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:07.780
it just wasn't fun anymore.

00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:11.020
And you can see why, in a
way, when the adults have

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:14.650
made everything so organized.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:17.980
And it's not always fun
for the grown-ups, either.

00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.970
The driving, the driving.

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:23.270
You consider the hours
and hours of driving.

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:27.710
The US Soccer Academy is one
of these elite travel soccer

00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:30.030
leagues for high school kids.

00:36:30.030 --> 00:36:35.460
And their sponsor is Chevrolet,
which is very, very appropriate

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:38.920
when you consider the
hundreds of thousands of miles

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.950
that parents are driving.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.920
I've known of people at night,
driving two hours to a soccer

00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:47.770
practice that gets over at
10:00 or 11:00 at night,

00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:50.839
and then the child doing their
homework in the car on the way

00:36:50.839 --> 00:36:53.130
back, getting home at midnight
or later, and then going

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:54.710
to school in the morning.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.620
That's how far it goes.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:36:59.280
I did see a cartoon that had
the caption of a mom sitting

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:02.120
in a car, saying
to herself, Gee,

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.750
I thought that driving
around all day,

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:05.800
picking up kids and
dropping them off, then

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.805
waiting for them, would
be more fulfilling.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:14.090
It's not always as much
fun as it sounds like.

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:15.790
There are people that
ask me sometimes,

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:18.290
what are some of the surprising
instances of shadow work?

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:21.500
I'll give you just this one
example as we wrap up here.

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:26.795
And the example that I
thought of is the gift card.

00:37:26.795 --> 00:37:28.882
The gift certificates,
nice thing.

00:37:28.882 --> 00:37:30.590
How can you object to
a gift certificate?

00:37:30.590 --> 00:37:33.180
And the businesses that
issue them love them.

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.810
One reason, some surveys
have shown, 27% of gift cards

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:40.532
are never redeemed.

00:37:40.532 --> 00:37:41.490
Well, that's wonderful.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:42.970
That's like free money.

00:37:42.970 --> 00:37:45.680
If you're a business owner, how
do you not like that, right?

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.180
You get the money
but you don't have

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:49.910
provide the service or a good.

00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:52.065
But there's a funny thing,
a little subtle thing

00:37:52.065 --> 00:37:55.037
that's happened there when
I get a gift certificate.

00:37:55.037 --> 00:37:56.370
Sure, I'm grateful for the gift.

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:58.230
But that means I
do the shopping.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.165
I pick out the gift.

00:38:00.165 --> 00:38:03.730
It used to be, when you gave a
gift, that the gift giver was

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:07.830
the one who decided what it
would be, and did the shopping,

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:09.680
and bought it, and
then gave it to you.

00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.730
And often, it was
a lovely thing,

00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:13.010
if they noticed something
about you that this gift was

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:14.620
a perfect reflection of.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:17.316
That really takes some
thoughtfulness to do.

00:38:17.316 --> 00:38:19.940
Now, if you do it yourself with
a gift certificate, you'll get,

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:22.410
I guess, exactly
the gift you want.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:25.000
But it's a little bit
different kind of transaction.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.370
I had an executive friend
who got a Christmas

00:38:27.370 --> 00:38:28.650
gift a couple years ago.

00:38:28.650 --> 00:38:32.640
He got a Williams-Sonoma
gift card plus a catalog.

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.220
Here is your gift.

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.420
Yeah, you do it, Bill.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:40.010
I mean, that that's the modern
shadow work way of gift giving.

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:42.600
And it does happen.

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:46.360
Now, I'll wind up here
with the final mention

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.200
of the last section of my book,
called The Twilight of Leisure.

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.620
And I've talked about the
leisure time, our free time,

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:57.500
and how it's under siege by
a lot of these innovations,

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.400
a lot of these changes in norms,
and these technological changes

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.990
and social changes.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:06.280
And I want to note that
leisure is intrinsically

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:09.359
unorganized time.

00:39:09.359 --> 00:39:10.900
And once it starts
getting organized,

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.710
as with Little League baseball
and the Pop Warner football,

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:16.250
then it's not so
much leisure anymore.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:18.006
It's on its way to
being organized time.

00:39:18.006 --> 00:39:18.880
It is organized time.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:21.190
It's getting where
it's being being work,

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:25.080
with appointments and
leagues and all that stuff.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:28.450
And there is no lobby in
Washington, DC, for leisure,

00:39:28.450 --> 00:39:31.000
because it is unorganized.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.530
But there are some very
organized businesses,

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:38.400
non-profits, trade
associations in Washington

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.380
who are lobbying
very ferociously

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.610
to take control
of that free time

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:48.170
and turn it into productive
time-- meaning you are either

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:51.390
buying a good or you
are producing a good.

00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:55.100
You are trading stocks at
3:00 in the morning online.

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:58.380
Or you can shop on
Amazon all night long,

00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.440
every day of the week.

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:04.760
That productive time is time
with an economic consequence.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:09.720
And these institutions have
designs on your leisure.

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.720
And I once more will say to
guard that free time jealously,

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.860
because it is the most
valuable thing we have.

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.460
It's really the most precious
thing any of us have.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.720
Look, money is nice.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.620
We all like that money.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.320
But money is finite
in its worth.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:31.400
But leisure time, free
time to do what we wish,

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.990
is really infinitely valuable.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.180
Whether it is going
to the beach--

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.280
we don't have to spend
money to enjoy ourselves,

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:41.030
believe it or not.

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:43.196
You don't have to buy a
restaurant meal or a theater

00:40:43.196 --> 00:40:46.610
ticket or an airline trip.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.080
You can go just to the beach.

00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:51.200
You can go take a
walk in the forest.

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.890
Maybe you're just sitting near
a lake and enjoying the scenery.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:58.230
Or maybe you're taking
a nice walk at twilight

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:01.870
somewhere enjoying
yourself with your friends,

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:06.190
your family, your kids, just
having a good time for free

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.100
with your free time.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:11.140
And I will end there
and thank you now

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.890
for sharing your most precious
possession, your own time,

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.907
with me and taking
this walk with me.

00:41:17.907 --> 00:41:18.740
Thank you very much.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:26.620
AUDIENCE: So one thing that
you didn't talk much about

00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:30.200
is why there is this
mega-trend going on,

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:36.020
there and to some extent
how there's also offsetting

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:39.350
trends where people do less
of their own lawn mowing,

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:41.960
less and less of their own
house cleaning, perhaps,

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.300
and hiring those out.

00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:47.030
So, what's different
between the trend

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:51.460
toward hiring more things
out, and doing more things

00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:55.080
yourself as part of
product purchases?

00:41:55.080 --> 00:42:00.190
And what's causing the trend
toward the do-it-yourself part

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:05.030
of the point of sale,
that you think, anyway?

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:06.920
CRAIG LAMBERT: Well,
in the long run,

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.450
there'll probably be some Ph.D.
theses written about that.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.530
But I think you can
say, and you're right,

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.990
there are counter trends too.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:20.310
I have a section
in my book, I used

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.010
Beverly Hills as
an example, where

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:26.600
people have a pool man,
a gardener, someone

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.910
who organizes the kid's
birthday party, the cook.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:34.710
You can professionalize
almost everything in life

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:36.720
and have it all done by help.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.500
And I call this, instead
of the DIY, do it yourself,

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:43.510
this is the DNY, do nothing
yourself, mode of living.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:47.870
And, of course, that is cool,
if you like it that way,

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.400
although it costs money.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.050
That's why I mentioned
Beverly Hills.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:55.410
Those who can afford to hire
personal shoppers or chauffeurs

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:56.967
or whatever are wealthy.

00:42:56.967 --> 00:42:59.300
Generally, you have to have
a lot more disposable income

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:03.280
to get those people
doing that work for you.

00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.480
However, there are
certain incentives.

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.390
In the global sense,
shadow work is coming about

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:15.160
because it is efficient on
the part of the institutions,

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.350
the organizations.

00:43:17.350 --> 00:43:19.200
If you're a
businessperson, how can you

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.520
resist the idea of
having a consumer do

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.430
that job for nothing,
instead of paying

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:30.500
fringe benefits and
salary to a staff person

00:43:30.500 --> 00:43:33.080
to do the same work?

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.140
I discuss in my
book whether there

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:39.870
is a way in which shadow
working customers build

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.420
a relationship with
a corporation--

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.030
or with whatever the
organization is that they're

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:50.160
working for, for nothing--
because in a way,

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.870
they're a kind of employee.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:54.570
And there's an
intimacy between them

00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:57.110
and the organization
as a result of

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:00.252
that particular relationship.

00:44:00.252 --> 00:44:01.460
But the incentives are there.

00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.251
And you can't regulate
it out of existence.

00:44:03.251 --> 00:44:06.840
I predict shadow work is going
to increase in future decades.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.150
A self-serve world is rolling.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:13.710
And as long as the incentives
economic incentives

00:44:13.710 --> 00:44:16.840
continue to reward
this phenomenon,

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.230
it's certainly going to
stay very much alive.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:24.290
AUDIENCE: Thanks for the talk.

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:26.740
Brings a couple
of things to mind.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.750
One, in my parents'
generation, people

00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.000
who were considered
professionals

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.190
would have a maid and a gardener
and a cook and a chauffeur

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:36.890
and so on.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:39.480
But there were a lot
fewer of them then.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.110
So, although
currently we're seeing

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:45.560
an increase in inequality,
the secular trend

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.000
has been to more equality
over the past century.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.030
This century seems to
be going backwards.

00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:53.754
So, that's one of
the reasons that I

00:44:53.754 --> 00:44:54.920
don't have a cook and so on.

00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.667
I can't afford one, because I
can't pay a cook $2 an hour,

00:44:58.667 --> 00:45:00.500
which would have been
the equivalent of what

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:03.090
my parents were
paying, probably.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.990
So, I'm not sure where
you're going with all this.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:10.910
Self-service has been a
long term trend, right?

00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:14.110
So, do you really want to
go to the grocery store

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:19.000
and have to wait for the grocer
to pull the products down

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.410
from the shelves?

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:22.760
Is that actually
a benefit to you?

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.420
I'm not sure it is.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:27.190
I actually like going-- I mean,
I don't like the supermarket,

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:30.330
but I would rather
go to the supermarket

00:45:30.330 --> 00:45:32.052
and have a choice
of 10,000 items

00:45:32.052 --> 00:45:33.510
than go to the
corner grocery store

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.220
with a choice of 100 items.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.710
So, I'm not quite
sure where you're

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:41.070
going with this critique.

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:43.620
CRAIG LAMBERT: Well,
that's good stuff.

00:45:43.620 --> 00:45:45.330
In fact, there's a
section in my book

00:45:45.330 --> 00:45:48.900
that talks about the history of
supermarkets, which is actually

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.370
a very interesting story.

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.490
And you are right.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:53.645
There was a time 100
years ago, a little more

00:45:53.645 --> 00:45:55.020
than 100 years
ago, particularly,

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:59.090
when you'd go into a food
store, and the customers

00:45:59.090 --> 00:46:00.752
were all in the middle
of the one room.

00:46:00.752 --> 00:46:02.710
And there were counters
all around the outside,

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:04.740
and all the goods
were on shelves.

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:07.460
And there might be ladders,
or ways of getting them down,

00:46:07.460 --> 00:46:10.460
but the customers weren't
allowed to touch the goods.

00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:14.400
You'd go up and say, could
I have a pound of sugar,

00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:14.940
or whatever.

00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:17.249
And they would dispense it
for you and give it to you.

00:46:17.249 --> 00:46:18.790
And then you'd get
your order filled.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:22.030
But of course that was
very labor intensive.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:25.750
And the supermarket was invented
approximately 100 years ago,

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.835
in-- and I'll tell the
story of it-- in Tennessee.

00:46:32.460 --> 00:46:36.710
So, we do take on doing
these jobs, doing the work.

00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:40.810
Whether we're better off
with 10,000 choices or 100

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:43.262
is probably a debatable point.

00:46:43.262 --> 00:46:44.720
Many people would
think that having

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:48.650
200 kinds of cereal
available is not necessarily

00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:49.500
all to the good.

00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.500
But you're right.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:57.330
You do speed up things.

00:46:57.330 --> 00:47:01.890
You can sometimes check
out faster-- or maybe not,

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.920
if the people in front
of you are amateurs.

00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:06.860
So, sometimes those
self-service checkout lines

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:08.770
are actually slower
than the cashier.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:12.330
What I will say is
that many of these sort

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.850
of entry-level jobs-- like
pumping gas, a gas pump

00:47:15.850 --> 00:47:18.540
jockey, which has almost
disappeared, except in New

00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:23.660
Jersey and Oregon, where
it's illegal to gas

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:28.400
or pump your own gas-- you're
editing out the interaction

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.370
with the cashier.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:34.110
If you do your own kiosk
checkout, you don't get to say,

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:38.260
hey Sharon, what are you
going to do after graduation?

00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:42.460
Those small interactions
may seem trivial.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:44.680
But they really are part
of what builds a community.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:49.700
And it's sort of the glue in a
town, or even a neighborhood,

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:53.570
that makes a community
bond together.

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.870
They are important
interactions, in a way.

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:59.020
And when the kiosk takes the
place of Sharon the supermarket

00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.740
cashier, we're living in a
little bit different world

00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.520
where, again, we're on our own.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:07.440
I talk a lot about the
silo effect of shadow work,

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.710
of putting us each in our
own silo, our own world,

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:15.190
dealing with often a
robotic technology instead

00:48:15.190 --> 00:48:16.960
of another human.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.072
So, there are tradeoffs.

00:48:20.072 --> 00:48:21.780
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for coming.

00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:23.530
To follow up on
his question when

00:48:23.530 --> 00:48:25.570
you talk about erosion
of leisure time,

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:29.500
I'm sure you have statistics to
say that we have less leisure

00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:32.000
time than we once did.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.830
But I agree with his point.

00:48:34.830 --> 00:48:37.290
If I have the choice
of going to the bank

00:48:37.290 --> 00:48:39.150
and standing on line
to make a deposit,

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:43.580
or taking a picture with my
phone and depositing my check,

00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:47.140
it seems to me a net
increase in leisure time

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.370
to do a lot of
these things myself.

00:48:49.370 --> 00:48:53.697
And I'm wondering if you have
any analysis in terms of,

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:56.030
when you talk about erosion
of leisure time, how much is

00:48:56.030 --> 00:48:59.240
the shadow work actually
contributing to that--

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.790
versus, say, people
commuting longer

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:06.560
distances to and from work,
or other things that actually

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.600
do erode leisure time.

00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.766
Whereas a lot of the things
I think you're saying we

00:49:09.766 --> 00:49:13.800
do for ourselves now-- unless
you say getting out of your car

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.420
and pumping your own gas is
a psychological interruption

00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:20.230
to your leisure time
of staying in your car

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:25.170
and talking to someone or
listening to the radio.

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.020
To what extent is
the shadow work

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:30.054
actually the thing that's
taking our leisure time away?

00:49:30.054 --> 00:49:31.220
CRAIG LAMBERT: Well, thanks.

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:31.720
Yeah.

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.660
I mean, in the long
run, some research--

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:36.810
we're in on the ground
floor on this now.

00:49:36.810 --> 00:49:39.200
My book is the first one
to really investigate it,

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:41.330
probably, in this context.

00:49:41.330 --> 00:49:44.170
And maybe we'll find out.

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:47.130
There are many factors
involved in free time.

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:52.410
And it's not only quantity
but the quality of time.

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:54.695
In terms of the
ATMs at the banks,

00:49:54.695 --> 00:49:57.100
that can be certainly
faster than waiting in line.

00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:01.000
You do eliminate that
interaction with the teller.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.130
This is just a side issue, but
the thing I am concerned about

00:50:05.130 --> 00:50:08.034
is the disappearance
of entry-level jobs.

00:50:08.034 --> 00:50:09.450
The teller might
be the person who

00:50:09.450 --> 00:50:11.190
gets promoted to
be a loan officer,

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:15.370
and eventually, who knows, like
my dad, president of the bank.

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.480
He started at the very
bottom and he wound up

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.860
as a CEO and chairman
of the board.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.890
How do you get promoted
like that if there

00:50:22.890 --> 00:50:24.410
are no entry-level jobs?

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:26.010
How do you become
the office manager

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.940
if there are no secretarial
or executive assistant kind

00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:30.620
of jobs for you to start at?

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.750
But in terms of leisure, yes.

00:50:33.750 --> 00:50:35.670
You can go to a gas
station, let's say,

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:39.129
and maybe get out faster
by doing your own pumping,

00:50:39.129 --> 00:50:41.170
because you don't have to
wait for the attendant.

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:45.280
And you pay ahead of
time by putting your card

00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.142
into the robotic gas pump.

00:50:47.142 --> 00:50:49.350
And you don't have to wait
to have your bill settled.

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.410
So that all speeds things up.

00:50:52.410 --> 00:50:57.250
But on the other
hand, you are not

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:00.480
sitting in the car with
your spouse or your kids,

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:04.420
having the chance to talk
with them for a few minutes.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.330
You're out there,
working the gas pump.

00:51:07.330 --> 00:51:09.370
So, it changes the quality
of your experience.

00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:16.890
What we call leisure, it's
a matter of quantity, yes.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:21.620
But it also changes what
you're doing with that time.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.430
As I mentioned at
the restaurant,

00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:25.550
instead of going
to the salad bar,

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:30.500
maybe you're having more fun
at the table with your family.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:36.670
So, there's a tradeoff in terms
of what we invest our times in.

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:38.660
I guess that would be
the simple way to put it.

00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:44.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I agree with
his point about the time issue.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:46.190
And I really would
like to see some data

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:49.050
on this, because I think that
a heck of a lot of these things

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:52.170
have in fact cut down
the amount of time

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:53.920
that we have to spend
on things like this.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:57.520
The obvious example is shopping
at Amazon, which you mentioned.

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.000
I can buy something on Amazon
these days in five minutes.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.620
It would take me literally
hours, in many cases,

00:52:05.620 --> 00:52:07.860
to have to go out to a store
and buy that same thing.

00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:11.240
Anyway, to me, though, the
really interesting thing

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.530
that you're getting at is the
change in social relationships

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:16.080
and the kind of atomization.

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:20.030
Because I think
one of the reasons

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:24.420
people like to do this is that
in many cases it saves time.

00:52:24.420 --> 00:52:27.230
But another really important
reason is that a lot of people

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:30.730
just don't like dealing
with other people.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.730
They would rather check
in at a kiosk than deal

00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:35.520
with somebody
behind the counter.

00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:37.630
They would rather
serve their own food

00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:39.370
than deal with a waitress.

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:42.750
There's something
about this that I

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:46.580
think is kind of disturbing.

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.330
A lot of people just
don't want to have

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.970
those kind of incidental
social relationships

00:52:50.970 --> 00:52:53.169
that we used to
be forced to have.

00:52:53.169 --> 00:52:55.460
I think there's something
pretty disturbing about that,

00:52:55.460 --> 00:52:59.170
and I think it is changing the
quality of our relationships.

00:52:59.170 --> 00:53:01.290
And one effect that
it might be having

00:53:01.290 --> 00:53:04.990
is that the amount
of social interaction

00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:08.840
that people of different social
classes have with each other

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:11.370
may be being reduced.

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:13.950
I'm not sure about this,
but one hypothesis,

00:53:13.950 --> 00:53:16.580
that some of these
changes are basically

00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:19.550
making more of my
interactions be

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:22.120
with people of my
own social class,

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.000
and not as many with people
of other social classes,

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.910
in particular of
less affluent people.

00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:29.830
And if that's
really true, I think

00:53:29.830 --> 00:53:33.930
that could have profound
effects on our social life.

00:53:33.930 --> 00:53:36.430
CRAIG LAMBERT: Actually, I think
that's a really interesting

00:53:36.430 --> 00:53:36.930
point.

00:53:36.930 --> 00:53:38.890
It's a fascinating point
that I hadn't actually

00:53:38.890 --> 00:53:41.560
thought of in that
clear a way, which

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:44.150
is that when you're dealing
with a cashier in a supermarket,

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:46.970
the teller at the bank, you
may be dealing with someone

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:50.890
of a considerably different
social class than yourself.

00:53:50.890 --> 00:53:57.000
And when we deal with the ATM
or the kiosk checkout instead,

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.620
those interactions
are disappearing.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:07.460
We have a world in
which-- we don't always

00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:11.530
understand what we're doing
when we become our own travel

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:12.030
agents.

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:14.960
This is a case that
came to my mind.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.060
People think, well,
I can go onto the web

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.660
and I can buy my own
tickets, book my own travel.

00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:22.180
And you can.

00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:25.440
But there are still
travel agents.

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:30.600
And they don't use
Expedia or Kayak.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:36.560
They have their own system,
which is a proprietary system.

00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:42.180
And they see things in real
time, the seats in airlines,

00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.920
and they're able to do things
that we can't do online.

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:48.170
I did a trip last
winter to the Caribbean.

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:52.360
And I realized, I could spend a
whole weekend researching this.

00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:55.890
All of the airlines, the
islands, the fares, the hotels,

00:54:55.890 --> 00:54:58.790
the packages-- I could spend
10 hours with no problem

00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:00.220
researching this trip.

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:02.310
I said, I don't want to do that.

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:05.060
I paid $75 fee to
a travel agent.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:08.790
That was her commission, and
then she set it up for me.

00:55:08.790 --> 00:55:11.060
And I was very glad to do it.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:12.550
So, it's not always equivalent.

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:15.950
We think that us doing the
job of the travel agent

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:18.290
is the same as the travel
agent doing the job.

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:20.900
And it isn't always the case.

00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.100
Just sort of a footnote.

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:23.490
MALE SPEAKER: Let's
take one last question.

00:55:23.490 --> 00:55:23.900
CRAIG LAMBERT: OK.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:24.774
AUDIENCE: Yes, hello.

00:55:24.774 --> 00:55:25.820
Thank you for the talk.

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:29.220
So, I agree with some
of the critique that

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:30.870
was just expressed.

00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:33.900
But since many of the
things that you've said

00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:35.810
resonated with
myself, I felt like I

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:38.240
need to stand up and
go and say something

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:41.330
in defense of your points.

00:55:41.330 --> 00:55:42.260
Particularly one--

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:44.030 --> 00:55:47.580
AUDIENCE: The information
of [? ability ?].

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:50.570
The fact that we have access
to this vast, vast amount

00:55:50.570 --> 00:55:53.180
of information that enables
us to do things that normally

00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:54.440
would be difficult to do.

00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:58.300
Say, I'm a hardcore
do-it-yourselfer

00:55:58.300 --> 00:55:59.860
around my house.

00:55:59.860 --> 00:56:04.760
Having bought an old house,
having many things to fix,

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.900
I think, displaced
many contractors.

00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:11.690
So, I did many things that I
never thought I would be doing.

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:16.010
And not hiring other people
that maybe I would otherwise

00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:19.410
have hired because, first
of all, the information

00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:21.010
is available.

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:22.780
I have access not
only to information.

00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:25.300
I have access to tools
that I can buy easily

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.174
from online sources.

00:56:27.174 --> 00:56:28.840
Previously some of
these tools are maybe

00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.550
specialized, wouldn't
be so easy to build

00:56:30.550 --> 00:56:32.570
to buy and find locally.

00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:33.662
So that is easier.

00:56:33.662 --> 00:56:35.620
There is this aspect that
I also can relate to,

00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.590
the aspect of not wanting to
deal with some of those people,

00:56:38.590 --> 00:56:40.340
having these interactions
with contractors

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:44.870
while you are-- their actions
are often not that great.

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:46.400
So, being able to avoid them.

00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.680
But I think the main
point is the fact

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:54.380
that this information is
available, that is driving it,

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:55.240
in my case.

00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.510
But what resonated about
it, I always question,

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:00.430
is it worth the time
I'm putting into it?

00:57:00.430 --> 00:57:02.220
Losing my leisure time, maybe.

00:57:02.220 --> 00:57:07.460
Maybe spending the time just
relaxing, rather than working.

00:57:07.460 --> 00:57:08.620
So, there's that.

00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:09.911
CRAIG LAMBERT: Well, thank you.

00:57:09.911 --> 00:57:13.242
I mean, absolutely
it's a choice that you

00:57:13.242 --> 00:57:14.200
may be willing to make.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.470
And many will say there's a
great deal of satisfaction

00:57:17.470 --> 00:57:20.970
in doing things yourself, and
in building something or fixing

00:57:20.970 --> 00:57:23.710
something or having a
fixer-upper house that you've

00:57:23.710 --> 00:57:27.297
completely changed by your
own hand, with your own work.

00:57:27.297 --> 00:57:28.880
And that can be very,
very satisfying,

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.820
And you can call
it leisure time.

00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:33.510
That's your hobby, maybe.

00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:36.470
And it may pay off in
more ways than monetarily.

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:38.870
And not having to hire the
carpenters and the plumbers

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:41.280
to do it, you wind
up doing things.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.050
So, that can be a
legitimate choice,

00:57:44.050 --> 00:57:46.540
if that's the one
you want to make.

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:48.812
That is leisure.

00:57:48.812 --> 00:57:49.728
Thanks for sharing it.

00:57:49.728 --> 00:57:50.936
AUDIENCE: It is and it isn't.

00:57:50.936 --> 00:57:51.997
This is the dilemma.

00:57:51.997 --> 00:57:52.830
CRAIG LAMBERT: Yeah.

00:57:52.830 --> 00:57:53.312
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:57:53.312 --> 00:57:54.770
MALE SPEAKER: So
thanks, everybody.

00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:55.710
Great discussion.

00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:56.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:56.210 --> 00:57:58.500
CRAIG LAMBERT:
Thank you very much.
