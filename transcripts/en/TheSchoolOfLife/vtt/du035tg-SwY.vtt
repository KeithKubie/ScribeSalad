00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.950
One of the most important ways to calm
down is the power to hold on.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.419
Even in challenging situations 
to a distinction between what someone does

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:13.750
and what they meant to do. 
In law,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.619
the difference is enshrined in the
contrasting concepts of murder and

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:18.970
manslaughter.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.230
The result may be the same: the body is
inert in a pool of blood. But we

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.840
collectively feel it makes a huge
difference

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.490
what the perpetrators intentions were.
Motives are crucial,

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.600
but unfortunately we're seldom very good
at perceiving what motives happened to

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.489
be involved in the incidents that
frustrate us. We're easily and wildly

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.710
mistaken. We see intention where there was
none and escalate and confront when no

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.460
strenuous or agitated responses are in
fact warranted.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.500
Part of the reason why we jump so
readily to dark inclusions and see plots

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.670
to insult and harm us is a rather
poignant psychological phenomenon:

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.589
Self-hatred.

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:04.540
The less we like ourselves, the more we
appear in our own eyes as really rather

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.420
plausible targets for mockery and harm.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.380
Why would a drill have started up
outside just as we were settling down to

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.340
work?

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.970
Why are the email not arrive even though
we'll have to be in a meeting very soon?

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.490
Why would the phone operator be taking
so long to find our details?

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.740
Because there is, logically enough, a plot against
us. Because we are appropriate targets

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.030
for these kinds of things. Because we're the sort of people against whom disruptive

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.360
drilling is legitimately likely to be
directed.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.000
It's what we deserve. When we carry a
background excess of self-disgust around with us

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.250
operating just below the radar of
conscious awareness. We'll constantly seek

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.180
confirmation from the wider world that
we really are the worthless people we

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.280
take ourselves to be. The expectation is
almost always set in childhood where

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.970
someone close to us is likely to have
left us feeling dirty and culpable.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.960
And as a result we now travel through
society assuming the worst.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.190
Not because it's necessarily true or
pleasant to do so, but because it feels

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.510
familiar.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.010
And because as the prisoners of past
patterns we haven't yet understood.

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.140
We would be so much calmer around adults,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.190
if we could resort to some of the
unflustered poised we naturally use

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.530
around children. Small children sometimes
behave in really maddening ways. They

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.490
scream at the person who's looking after
them, angry push away a bowl of animal

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.900
pastor, throw away something you've just
fetched for them. But we rarely feel

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.880
personally agitated or wounded by their
behavior. And the reason is that we don't

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.500
assign a negative motive or mean
intention to a small person.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.890
We reach around for the most benevolent
interpretations.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.610
We probably think that they're just a
bit tired, or their gums are sore, or

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.220
they're upset by the arrival of a
younger sibling.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.090
We've got a large repertoire of
alternative explanations ready in our heads.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.660
And none of these lead us to panic
or get terribly agitated.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.000
This is the reverse of what tends to
happen around adults.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.459
Here we imagine that people have deliberately got us in their sights.

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.600
If someone edges in front of us in the
airport queue it's natural to suppose that

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.739
they've sized this up and of reason that
they can safely take advantage of us.

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:19.489
They probably relish the thought of
causing us a little distress.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.100
But if we employ the infant model of
interpretation

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.310
our first assumptions would be very
different. We think that maybe they

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.329
didn't sleep well that night, have a sore
knee, or have been upset by their lover.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.190
The French philosopher Inmilo Gustachtie, known as Ella, was set to be the

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.030
finest teacher in France in the first
half of the 20th century.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.320
And he developed a formula for calming himself and his pupils down in the face of

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.280
irritating people. Never say that people
are evil.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.459
He wrote. You just need to look for the
pin.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.829
What he meant was: look for the source of the agony that drives a person to behave

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.820
in appalling ways. The calming thought is
to imagine that they're suffering off

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:00.739
stage in some area

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.530
we can't see. To be mature is to learn to
imagine this zone of pain in spite of

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.700
the lack of much available evidence. They
may not look as if they were mad and by

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.799
an inner psychological element.

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.880
They may seem chirpy and full of
themselves, but the pin simply must be

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.729
there or they would not be causing us
harm.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.500
When others maden us

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.600
we need to imagine the turmoil,
disappointment, worry, and sadness beneath

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.280
an aggressive surface.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:33.500
We need to aim compassion in an
unexpected place at those who annoy us

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.520
most.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.770
We must do that very strange thing: move
from anger to pity.
