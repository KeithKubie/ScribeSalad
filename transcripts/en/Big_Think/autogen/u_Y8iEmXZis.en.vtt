farther and farther away so now that we
 

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:20.410
farther and farther away so now that we
understand thunderstorms maybe God lives

farther out still there's never been a
time in human history where we realized

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659
time in human history where we realized
 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:51.999
time in human history where we realized
that some things had scientific

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009
that some things had scientific
 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.099
that some things had scientific
explanations and some things didn't it's

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109
explanations and some things didn't it's
 

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:55.510
explanations and some things didn't it's
like okay well we know why the Sun

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520
like okay well we know why the Sun
 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.309
like okay well we know why the Sun
shines we know why the seasons change

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319
shines we know why the seasons change

personally religious it seems to me to
 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.819
personally religious it seems to me to
be a disservice to the idea of God that

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:12.829
be a disservice to the idea of God that
 

00:02:12.829 --> 00:02:14.709
be a disservice to the idea of God that
God constantly gets farther and farther

away you put that

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
away you put that
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.349
away you put that
him or however you want to call it just

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359
him or however you want to call it just

outside the grasp of human knowledge

someday we will understand what set off

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859
someday we will understand what set off
 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.559
someday we will understand what set off
the Big Bang and I don't think the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569
the Big Bang and I don't think the
 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.289
the Big Bang and I don't think the
answer is going to be God maybe God is

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299
answer is going to be God maybe God is
 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.360
answer is going to be God maybe God is
something more personal to you maybe

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370
something more personal to you maybe
 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.800
something more personal to you maybe
it's how you relate to other people

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810
it's how you relate to other people

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280
maybe it's how you define your morality
 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.830
maybe it's how you define your morality
maybe it's something that's very very

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840
maybe it's something that's very very
 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.530
maybe it's something that's very very
important in our culture but I also

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540
important in our culture but I also
 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.149
important in our culture but I also
think that we do the university's

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:38.159
think that we do the university's
 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:39.619
think that we do the university's
service because we're putting our own

there there are many religions that seem

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859
there there are many religions that seem
 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.890
there there are many religions that seem
to think of God as something like a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
to think of God as something like a
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.440

of a human being and there are other
 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:51.979
of a human being and there are other
religions that don't that talk about

natural forces or or gods that are
incomprehensible but all of them seem to

incomprehensible but all of them seem to
 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.599

care about any of that I sort of wish we
 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.470
care about any of that I sort of wish we
observed the universe the way it is and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480
observed the universe the way it is and
 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.539

then turn it back on ourselves we are a

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549
then turn it back on ourselves we are a
 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.580
then turn it back on ourselves we are a
reflection of the physical laws around

so perfectly tuned that human life can
 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.689
so perfectly tuned that human life can
exist at all why do we have the right

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:23.699
exist at all why do we have the right
 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:25.309

perfect type of star you can have you
 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.849
perfect type of star you can have you
know why are all the physical laws

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859
know why are all the physical laws
 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.009
know why are all the physical laws
exactly what you need for matter to hold

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019
exactly what you need for matter to hold
 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.559
exactly what you need for matter to hold
together and this to me always seemed

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569
together and this to me always seemed
 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.059
together and this to me always seemed
like putting the cart before the horse

evolved to be this type of biology is
 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.699
evolved to be this type of biology is
because we evolved on this planet there

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709

different planets that are asking the
 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.319
different planets that are asking the
same question why are we on the perfect

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329
same question why are we on the perfect
 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.420

you have to really understand that the

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250
you have to really understand that the

universe has nothing to do with our
 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.830
universe has nothing to do with our
vision but our minds our sense of beauty

fit together they do work really well

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:08.009
fit together they do work really well
 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:09.439

with the physical laws of the universe
 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:11.210
with the physical laws of the universe
but that's not a coincidence

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220
but that's not a coincidence

so I think we actually can learn more

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060
so I think we actually can learn more
 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.820
