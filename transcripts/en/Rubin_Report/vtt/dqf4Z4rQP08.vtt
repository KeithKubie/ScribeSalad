1
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.150
[inaudible].

2
00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.520
<v 1>Okay.
So after the march,
during the march,</v>

3
00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:10.090
before the march of this thing is just becoming more and more political.

4
00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:12.940
As you said,
you guys are getting up there and you want to,
you know,

5
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.440
sort of have your moment,

6
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:18.490
but there are certain issues you don't understand where politicians reaching out

7
00:00:18.491 --> 00:00:21.460
to you.
Uh,
I know that,
you know,
Kyle cashew shoe of his,

8
00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:24.580
talked to Marco Rubio a couple of times.
I mean,

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.600
how deep did this go in terms of reaching every part of American society?

10
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.930
<v 2>Sure.
We,
um,</v>

11
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.200
we reached out to a lot of people and a lot of people reached out to us.

12
00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.820
There were a lot of conservatives that we,
we were speaking to about the issue.

13
00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.990
I have a couple of friends who went to gun groups to talk about it,

14
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.020
sat down with some very big gun advocates in their areas,

15
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.130
not really in the country,
but notable where they were to talk about the issue.

16
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:52.200
And
the,

17
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.190
I know that the rest of my group was really interested in opening up and talking

18
00:00:56.191 --> 00:01:00.140
about this again,
I was the shitty one in March for our lives.
Um,
I,

19
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:04.410
I wanted to stir some shit.
You know,
I wanted to cause trouble.
I wanted to make,

20
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.010
I wanted to own the conservatives the same way a lot of conservatives want to

21
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:10.490
own the libs.
I mean that's what it's about right now.
People,

22
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.490
people play games where they're trying to one up each other and you know,
I just,

23
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.040
I was trying to do that.
I was trying to make politicians,

24
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:21.120
I didn't like look bad as opposed to say what can we do?
Yeah,

25
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.110
when I went up there

26
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.970
<v 1>and I was at where your folks or anyone saying,
you know,</v>

27
00:01:24.971 --> 00:01:28.900
maybe ease up on Twitter or like,
you know,
just just because you're going to get,

28
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.710
no matter what,

29
00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.410
even if everything you said was factually right and came from the right place

30
00:01:32.411 --> 00:01:32.950
and all that,

31
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.160
just the amount of hate you're going to get while you're still a young person in

32
00:01:36.161 --> 00:01:37.770
the morning.
So it cannot be fun.

33
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.080
<v 2>My mom is,</v>

34
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.390
her sole existence in the world is to make everybody in the world happy and love

35
00:01:45.391 --> 00:01:50.130
each other.
So she said to me,
be nice and loving.
My Dad,

36
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.800
who is a bit of a political advocate himself,

37
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.040
agrees with me on a lot of things and sometimes he would tell me to ease up.

38
00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.660
Sometimes he would tell me to,
you know,
be be a little bit rougher.

39
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.820
But he also said,
and this is why I think my parenting from my mom,
Stepdad,

40
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:07.830
dad step mom was so great,
was they said,

41
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.330
do what you think is right and don't let people put their hooks in you.

42
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.640
And I did.
I let,
I let,

43
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.480
I let people manipulate me a bit because I thought that they were kindred

44
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:22.500
spirits.
But you know,
my parents,
I'm lucky enough to have parents who say,

45
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.040
believe what you believe.
If I my,
you know,
my parents are all liberal.

46
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.340
But if I came home and said,
I'm,
if I came home with a trunk 2020 hat,

47
00:02:29.341 --> 00:02:33.510
which I do not expect to do unless some drastic change happens in my life,

48
00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.690
although I know you're not thrilled with the Democrats at the moment,

49
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.450
I'm gonna Throw the Democrats at the moment,
but I'm not thrilled with Democrats.

50
00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:41.060
At the moment because they're not being good Democrats,

51
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.240
not because they're Democrats,
but you know,
we'll get to that.
I um,

52
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.870
but if I came home and I told my parents that I would vote for the opposite of

53
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:50.190
what they would vote for,
they would say,

54
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.770
if you're doing it because you think it's right,
you're going to do it.

55
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.690
And I'm very grateful for that.
Yeah.
So we're,

56
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.810
<v 1>do you stand on gun control?
Generally because I think what happened was they,</v>

57
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:04.030
at the event at March for our lives,

58
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.880
there were a lot of people are getting up there and they were saying things that

59
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:09.550
implied,
and I think this is the way a lot of people on the right took it.

60
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.100
It's not about sensible gun control.

61
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:14.620
This is ultimately about taking away all the guns.

62
00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:17.500
And that of course is the fear of most of the people on the right.

63
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.840
And there were a couple of the students,
there was one young girl,

64
00:03:19.841 --> 00:03:22.540
I don't remember who said we're going to start with bump stocks,

65
00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.120
but we're coming for all the guns or something to that effect.

66
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.900
And that that feeds right into the people on the right who go,
all right,

67
00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:33.400
well now we're not going to talk.
[inaudible] negotiates who like better laws.

68
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:35.290
You guys are Mazda.
Dot.
Exactly,

69
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:39.660
and then because of that then the people on the left and you guys go,
well,

70
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.490
all right,
see now they don't want to talk at all so we're not going to talk.

71
00:03:42.491 --> 00:03:44.970
And then you end up sort of exactly where we're at at the moment.

72
00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.140
<v 2>It's an,
this is it.
Somebody told me this the other day,
it's a brilliant point.</v>

73
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.130
The left and the right attack each other's worst arguments and that does nothing

74
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:57.210
for us.
But when it comes to my personal stance on guns,
there's some,

75
00:03:57.211 --> 00:03:59.700
there are some differing opinions amongst my friends from our,
for our lives,

76
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:02.550
but we all,
we all agree with some similar things.
Personally,

77
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.800
I think that as long as people who are responsible can carry concealed firearms,

78
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.030
particularly handguns in the country in many situations,

79
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:13.080
the countries a safer place.

80
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.190
I also think that there is not a strong vetting process for people to purchase

81
00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:18.024
these firearms.

82
00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.470
And a lot of people just get guns and a lot of these people are not the good guy

83
00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:25.680
with the gun because I think the good guy with a gun argument is just a hasty

84
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:26.514
generalization.

85
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.780
I understand it in some ways because I intend to concealed carry when I'm an

86
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:35.781
adult because I intended to have a family and I intend to shoot anybody who

87
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:38.820
tries to kill my family.
And

88
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.130
<v 1>I,</v>

89
00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.640
I assumed that that even that position right there probably puts you on the outs

90
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:43.474
with a Lotta,

91
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.700
<v 2>a lot of your crew,
the outs conceptually,
you know,</v>

92
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.280
we all respect each other's opinions.
If somebody in March for our lives,

93
00:04:49.281 --> 00:04:51.380
and this is nobody in March where he lives,
but if somebody said,

94
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.270
I want to eliminate all guns,
I'd say,
okay,
well let's talk about that.

95
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.440
So you know,

96
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.450
my friends respect me for what I think and I respect them some.
It's difficult.

97
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:05.570
It's a difficult thing to respect people who disagree with you for those things.

98
00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:06.404
Do you find that

99
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.050
<v 1>you know guys and girls your age are able to have these conversations without</v>

100
00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:13.810
killing each other?
There was a terrible choice of words without sure,

101
00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.170
but without being at each other's throats,

102
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.030
I think more than adults are right now.
Is that possible?

103
00:05:19.031 --> 00:05:21.460
Because that seems to be a through line with you that you're friends with.

104
00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.140
A lot of people have different opinions.

105
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.160
<v 2>I think we want to,</v>

106
00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:28.780
I think that a lot of people who want to aren't taking the right steps because

107
00:05:28.781 --> 00:05:30.220
they're saying,
yes we can.

108
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.480
We can come to some common ground if you agree with me.
And there's a,

109
00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.650
there's a want out there.

110
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:38.920
And that's something I'm really interested in because I come from a generation

111
00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:43.840
that I believe puts principles and morals over money and political victories.

112
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.270
And I think that we've actually got a bright future now.

113
00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.620
People will call me in insane,
Bobby Kennedy more on per se.

114
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.510
We have a bright future,
but I think we do.

115
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.470
I think we need to de stigmatize the conversation.
I had a lot of friends who,

116
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.940
who before seven months ago I would have thought were racist,

117
00:06:01.941 --> 00:06:02.751
sexist,
bigoted,

118
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:05.810
homophobes who want the country to explode and want to destroy everybody who

119
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:08.000
isn't exactly like them,
and then I learned,

120
00:06:08.001 --> 00:06:12.470
maybe that's not the case and I have a lot of friends who would have thought

121
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:17.360
that I was some leftist Beta cook shill who wanted,

122
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:22.370
who wanted a communists to take everybody's guns and kill them and then they

123
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:24.050
learn.
Maybe that's not the case.

124
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:29.620
I think our generation really is moving in a good direction when it comes to

125
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.280
smart conversations.
I just think we need a bit of a social revolution.

126
00:06:34.281 --> 00:06:37.070
They're not a huge social revolution.
I love social revolutions.

127
00:06:37.071 --> 00:06:40.050
This isn't that big revolutions.
Cool.

128
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.620
At beetles where La Miz level yet,
we're not at your guys.

129
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.960
We're not hearing that people sing the song and making me mad yet,
but we,

130
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:51.470
we need some,
we need a,
we need a,

131
00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:55.640
a movement towards respecting each other because look,
before all of this,

132
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:57.500
if I could have gotten rid of the right,
I would have,

133
00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.320
and I know people who would have gotten rid of the left if they could have,

134
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:03.890
but it's not going to happen.
The parties might evolve over time.
I mean,

135
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.430
the parties,
the parties are flipping in a Lotta ways.
Why?
Well,
think about this.

136
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.170
The party of Lincoln is the only party that currently we're not the Democrat.

137
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:13.520
There are some Democrats who are like this,

138
00:07:13.521 --> 00:07:17.720
but the majority of people who are running as admitted white supremacists are

139
00:07:17.721 --> 00:07:22.460
part of the party of Lincoln.
So a lot of,
a lot of switches happen there.
Um,

140
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:22.821
I mean,

141
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:27.080
you've got some really awful rhetoric out there from folks like Candice Owens

142
00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.980
who will say,
we'll talk about the left plantation.
Look,

143
00:07:30.981 --> 00:07:32.780
I think identity politics are dangerous,

144
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.880
but calling saying that the real racists or the Democrats is a hasty

145
00:07:37.881 --> 00:07:41.480
generalization.
I think that,
I think there's actually some truth to it.

146
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.090
There's a difference between the the the liberals and the left.

147
00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:46.900
Well now you're speaking my leg,

148
00:07:46.901 --> 00:07:49.190
but the thing is you can't pigeonhole them together,

149
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:51.140
especially in all the right word for that.
Yeah.
Okay.

150
00:07:51.141 --> 00:07:53.330
You can't pigeonhole them together.
I'm a liberal,

151
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.980
but I think that all men and women are created equal and need to be respected

152
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:02.060
equally,
whereas people farther to the left will say as a,

153
00:08:02.061 --> 00:08:04.880
as a white,
cisgender,
heterosexual male,

154
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:09.830
I don't have the right to say any of that.
Look you.
A friend of mine,

155
00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.680
Michael Skolnik,
who I've worked with before,

156
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.310
said something to me that I really appreciated,

157
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:16.130
which was you can't judge somebody by the hand they're dealt.

158
00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:18.920
You judge them by how they elected to play.
That hand,

159
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:22.430
people farther to the left will judge me by the hand I'm dealt.

160
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.010
I grew up in a pretty well off family.
I had a pretty easy childhood.

161
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:30.080
I could have walked around my neighborhood without fearing death,

162
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.930
which is something that some of my friends I made in Chicago,

163
00:08:32.931 --> 00:08:34.430
we're not able to have,

164
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.570
but they'll say that my opinion is less valid than anybody's because I don't

165
00:08:38.571 --> 00:08:39.680
deal with the struggles they do.

166
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:44.960
I have an incredible amount of empathy for people who are not as privileged as I

167
00:08:44.961 --> 00:08:49.640
am.
I believe that white privilege exists.
I don't believe it's as systematic or,

168
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:54.440
or,
um,
really structural as people say it is.

169
00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.030
I don't think the government exists to oppress people,

170
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.640
but white privilege I believe exists.

171
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.940
I believe that there are certain situations where I will be,

172
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.960
where I will be in a better place because I'm a white,
cisgender,

173
00:09:06.961 --> 00:09:10.800
heterosexual male.
Again,
it's not this large,
oppressive force.

174
00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:13.470
The people treat it like,
but it's something we need to address.
And that's,

175
00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.630
that's the real thing I'm talking about recently,

176
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:20.780
which is we can find common ground on these issues and not try to push each

177
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:25.140
other away.
Because in my view,
in my view,

178
00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:29.460
white privilege exists and people will say,
well,
no,
because,

179
00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.340
um,
in many situations on the sat,

180
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:36.060
African American students were given points in Asian students were,

181
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:41.260
were deducted points.
And that proves that,
that,

182
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.480
<v 1>well,
I got myself into an yeah,
well,
I don't want to,</v>

183
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.480
we don't have to go too far down down that road because we could have a whole

184
00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:50.750
other conversation on that.
Cause I,
I,
I actually don't agree with you on that,

185
00:09:50.751 --> 00:09:55.040
but,
but that's the point of this mean that's the point.
And I'm still learning.

186
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:57.950
You're still learning it.
It's kind of a beautiful thing.
Actually.

187
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:00.740
I'm 17 I can hardly smell.
I'm not the expert on Shit.

188
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.710
And that's actually the point in the new podcast I'm putting out.
Yeah.

189
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:09.010
<v 2>Soon it's called Cameron knows nothing.
Uh,
do you watch game of Thrones?
I do.</v>

190
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.780
Look,
you grit told me.
Yeah.
I don't know.
And it's true.
I,
you know,

191
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:17.630
I had my own personal views on abortion.
I actually,
I watched a video of yours.

192
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:21.700
You and I have this pretty much the same exact view on the 20 weeks guy.
Um,

193
00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:24.940
but I also have not taken enough science classes.
I also do not,

194
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.190
I have not conversed with enough women who have had abortions.

195
00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.440
My opinions mean Jack Shit,
but I'm allowed to have them.
You know,
it's,

196
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.240
I'm a 17 year old boy,

197
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:38.530
so there's only so much I could truly say about pro lifers pro choice,

198
00:10:38.531 --> 00:10:42.730
but I'm allowed to say it.
Yeah.
And you know,
in Cameron knows nothing.

199
00:10:42.731 --> 00:10:45.850
I'm going to tell you guys what I think,
but doesn't mean it's right.

200
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.430
<v 1>Yeah.
Where do you think that attitude comes from within you?</v>

201
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:52.450
Because it seems to me that I think a lot of what's happening right now is I see

202
00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:56.200
adults that are now afraid to say what they think and you know,

203
00:10:56.201 --> 00:10:58.900
they think that the mom's going to come after them,
which is completely legit.

204
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.380
They think it might hurt their job opportunities or things like that.
Yeah.

205
00:11:02.381 --> 00:11:04.760
The mob,
whichever,
whichever way it is.
Right.
I mean,
I think,

206
00:11:04.761 --> 00:11:09.520
but we see boycotts on both sides and I think a lot of misguided anger often.
Uh,

207
00:11:09.521 --> 00:11:12.760
but I think most people need a little bit more of what you just did there,

208
00:11:12.761 --> 00:11:17.410
which is I just am what I am,
you know,
maybe convince me as some other stuff,

209
00:11:17.411 --> 00:11:18.460
but I'm trying to learn here.

210
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.980
<v 2>I don't want to hurt anybody.
You know,
I,
I don't,</v>

211
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.340
I want the government to crack down on guns.

212
00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.230
That doesn't mean I want the government to oppress you.

213
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.040
I believe that there's a certain amount of time somebody just should have access

214
00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:30.390
to an abortion.

215
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:33.600
And I think that abortion should be more accessible just for a certain amount of

216
00:11:33.601 --> 00:11:37.020
time.
But I don't want to kill babies and I don't want to oppress women.

217
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.800
I want the world to be a better place.
You want the world to be a better place.

218
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.700
Um,
I dunno about,
about,
you know,
anybody up in the booth,

219
00:11:44.701 --> 00:11:48.380
but they seem really nice.
Yeah,
they pretty good.
Yeah.
Uh,
Todd Macfarlane,

220
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.040
I hand selected these people.
Exactly.

221
00:11:50.041 --> 00:11:51.660
Topic falling wants the world to be a better place.

222
00:11:51.661 --> 00:11:55.650
David Hogg wants the world to be a better place.
Uh,
Jordan Peterson,

223
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:58.240
one of the world.
We all pretty much all of us do.

224
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.350
<v 1>I'm actually glad you mentioned Jordan Peterson because you know I'm on tour</v>

225
00:12:01.351 --> 00:12:04.830
with him right now and one of the things that I find is at first if I meet a ton

226
00:12:04.831 --> 00:12:07.980
of people your age,
I'd say the bulk of the people that are coming,

227
00:12:07.981 --> 00:12:10.800
there are young people probably probably right around your age,

228
00:12:10.801 --> 00:12:15.420
1718 into into their probably early thirties and it's male,
female,
gay,

229
00:12:15.421 --> 00:12:17.130
straight,
black,
white,
the whole thing.

230
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:22.080
But it's very obvious to me that he's providing some level of guidance that

231
00:12:22.081 --> 00:12:26.980
somehow it seems that your generation kind of missed.
Now it sounds like your,

232
00:12:26.981 --> 00:12:29.220
your folks are pretty great and your extended family and all that,

233
00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:34.221
but do you sense that there is some missing piece here that partly,

234
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.630
I don't know that there's like some,

235
00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:40.200
I discussed this last week with Peter Teal that there was some disconnect

236
00:12:40.201 --> 00:12:45.180
between the baby boomers,
my parents age and that my guys,
the gen x people,

237
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:46.650
we never had our moment or something.

238
00:12:46.651 --> 00:12:48.720
And then we've sort of handed it off to you guys,

239
00:12:48.721 --> 00:12:52.890
the millennials and that there's,
I'm Gen x,
Gen z actually.

240
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.720
Wow.
Wendy's are three or four years older than I am.
All right.
Oh man,
we're all,

241
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.680
I don't that hit that we handed it off to the,

242
00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:04.530
to the generation of people who grew up with cell phones,

243
00:13:04.531 --> 00:13:07.860
immediate access to knowledge.
Those

244
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.620
<v 2>are the best and worst thing to ever happened to us.</v>

245
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.050
If I wanted to get to a hospital,

246
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.500
I can get to a hospital much easier with a cell phone if I want to look up a

247
00:13:15.501 --> 00:13:16.334
fact,

248
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:20.180
forgetting the fact that facts are difficult right now because it's a fact that

249
00:13:20.181 --> 00:13:24.980
facts are difficult to find.
Um,
that,
you know,
I can do it.

250
00:13:24.981 --> 00:13:29.660
But also I,
I've,
before all of this,
I was very,
very obsessed with my own image.

251
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.420
Not because I thought I had a good one,
but because I wanted it to be good.

252
00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.830
I was posting things online because I wanted people to think I had a cool life.

253
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.690
I mean,
I did.
I was,
I had a great life,
but I wanted people to know that.
And,

254
00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.580
and it,
it the hyperconnectivity of social media,

255
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:47.390
which is a term I stole from many Ben Platt interviews where he's talking about

256
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:48.360
his musical.
Do you have enhancing,

257
00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.640
I don't want him to see this and think I'm stealing from another,

258
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.410
the hyperconnectivity of social media is,
um,
is,

259
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.880
is a good and bad thing.
But I think the problem here,
and I think that,
you know,

260
00:13:58.881 --> 00:14:01.220
folks like Jordan,
I'm a big fan of Jordan and I'm a big fan of yours.

261
00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:04.880
Don't get a big head.
Um,
uh,
people,
people like you guys,

262
00:14:04.881 --> 00:14:09.410
one of the things that you advocate for is his conversation and people on the

263
00:14:09.411 --> 00:14:11.600
right,
young people on the right that I know and I'm friends with,

264
00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:15.020
they want to own the lips.
This is all about proving them wrong and saying like,

265
00:14:15.021 --> 00:14:17.180
facts don't care about your feelings.
I agree.

266
00:14:17.450 --> 00:14:20.960
Facts by definition don't care about your feelings.
But there's also a logic,

267
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:23.210
which is kind of the middle between the two really.

268
00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:27.230
And that's the interpretation and the insight and the fact where w,
you know,

269
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.410
if we,
if we only based everything in fact,

270
00:14:29.411 --> 00:14:32.450
which a lot of young people on the right do,
we're just talking about the past.

271
00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:36.050
You can look at the future and you can assess facts,
but a lot of,

272
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:38.780
a lot of young people on the right one to prove people wrong and a lot of young

273
00:14:38.781 --> 00:14:43.280
people on the left I've seen wants to want to make people want to make people

274
00:14:43.281 --> 00:14:46.400
who disagree with them look worse.
It's all about making the other look worse.

275
00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:49.460
The right wants to show that the left is a bunch of copies and left wants to

276
00:14:49.461 --> 00:14:53.780
show that the rights of bunch of fascists and that's a waste of time.
That is a,

277
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:55.850
that is what is harming our country right now.

278
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.390
I think Donald Trump's rhetoric is dangerous and harms our country,

279
00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:02.120
but Trump is,
is the,

280
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.060
is a symptom of something greater like prison.

281
00:15:05.061 --> 00:15:08.540
Obama said when he made his return that made all of my liberal friends think

282
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:12.050
Jesus came back,
which is,
you know,
Trump.

283
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.250
Trump is the result of a country where the people who love Trump are loving him

284
00:15:16.251 --> 00:15:16.761
more than ever.

285
00:15:16.761 --> 00:15:19.310
And the people who hate Trump or I hated him more than ever because we are

286
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:23.480
divided,
you know,
with our rhetoric is driving these,

287
00:15:23.481 --> 00:15:24.950
driving everybody in different directions.

288
00:15:24.951 --> 00:15:27.050
That's why you see the rise of democratic socialism.

289
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.310
And that's why you see the rise of more and more people coming out and saying

290
00:15:31.311 --> 00:15:34.340
things that are stupid because they have the first man right to do it.
Look,

291
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.610
if you say something I don't like,
I will defend it with my life.

292
00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:41.210
I will defend with my life.
You're right to say it,
but people are mixing,

293
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.240
being not PC and being a jerk and and right now we're driving apart.

294
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:48.710
We need to come together,
stop attacking each other.

295
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.480
Both sides are equally as guilty.

296
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:56.600
Certain sides in certain situations are obviously guiltier.
But it,
it's,

297
00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:58.190
it's,
it's,
it's bullshit.

298
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:03.320
So do you sense a little more flexibility on the ability to talk to people on

299
00:16:04.191 --> 00:16:08.240
the right than on the left?
Because you know that that's been a sort of

300
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.990
<v 1>big part of what's going on with me.</v>

301
00:16:09.991 --> 00:16:14.991
Like I get invited to go to these conservative things and turning point USA and

302
00:16:15.181 --> 00:16:19.260
I talk about being gay married and I'm pro choice and against the death penalty

303
00:16:19.261 --> 00:16:21.810
and all of these things that are thought of as leftist things,

304
00:16:21.811 --> 00:16:23.880
but they invite me,
we have a great time.

305
00:16:23.881 --> 00:16:28.170
I take a zillion selfies with the kids after and all that stuff where there

306
00:16:28.171 --> 00:16:30.240
doesn't seem to be that flexibility over there.

307
00:16:30.241 --> 00:16:32.880
And now I don't want to harp on this because I get your greater point,

308
00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:35.330
which is we got to get past this.
It's where it's what I am.

309
00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:38.580
I do see something on one side,

310
00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:42.060
especially with young people that has become more corroded I would say.

311
00:16:42.061 --> 00:16:42.910
Then a then on the other,

312
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.561
<v 2>here's what I'll say,</v>

313
00:16:43.561 --> 00:16:46.290
I'll say the left cares too much about people in the right doesn't care enough

314
00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:49.050
and I'll tell you what I mean,
cause they're,
they're equally is wrong here.

315
00:16:49.570 --> 00:16:54.240
Young people on the right will attack you with facts and in in either positive

316
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:58.980
or negative ways and they're opening a conversation very often I believe because

317
00:16:58.981 --> 00:17:02.100
they want to prove you wrong.
That's what I've seen from that.
That's not a fact.

318
00:17:02.101 --> 00:17:02.934
It's an opinion.

319
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.020
Whereas people on the left wants to accommodate for everybody so much that if

320
00:17:07.021 --> 00:17:09.690
you say anything negative about anybody that they agree with,

321
00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:14.100
they jump to their defense.
So I'll bring up the Israel argument,

322
00:17:14.101 --> 00:17:16.530
which is an argument that I don't know enough about to form an opinion.

323
00:17:16.531 --> 00:17:19.340
I truly do not.
But if you are a propeller,

324
00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:22.590
that sounds like pretty much everybody to exactly be being pro Palestine doesn't

325
00:17:22.591 --> 00:17:24.090
mean you hate the Jews necessarily.

326
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.130
And being pro Israel doesn't mean that you hate everybody who you hate

327
00:17:29.131 --> 00:17:33.690
Palestinians.
But I'll talk to people on the right and they'll,

328
00:17:33.691 --> 00:17:36.390
they'll be happier to talk about it then people on the left.

329
00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:39.960
But the second I say that,
you know,
Palestine should have land,

330
00:17:39.961 --> 00:17:44.040
which again I don't,
I don't have a firm opinion on,
they'll say,
dude,

331
00:17:44.041 --> 00:17:45.450
you're Jewish.
How could you say that?

332
00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.720
I'll say because people are people and then I'll talk to people on the left

333
00:17:48.721 --> 00:17:50.940
about,
and I'll say there's a,

334
00:17:50.941 --> 00:17:53.190
there are a lot of concerns of terror and they'll say,

335
00:17:53.191 --> 00:17:58.110
don't you dare call everybody everybody who's Palestinian terrorist and on and

336
00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:02.730
on both sides.
Your d so,
so yes,
I think the right is more open to conversation,

337
00:18:02.731 --> 00:18:05.610
but I think that more people on the right are trying to lure you into a cave

338
00:18:05.611 --> 00:18:06.444
where they can prove you wrong.

339
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:10.680
I don't want to be proven right or wrong right now.
I want to discuss,

340
00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:12.360
cause my opinions on things.
I've changed.

341
00:18:12.361 --> 00:18:17.361
My opinions really are not taking a one 80 I have all my opinions,

342
00:18:17.941 --> 00:18:21.320
but my opinion on opinions is changing.
That's,

343
00:18:21.321 --> 00:18:25.250
that's the most important thing I'd like to highlight here.
Yeah,
if I'm talking,

344
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.990
I used to think that,
and we've talked about this,

345
00:18:27.991 --> 00:18:29.610
I used to think that if he didn't agree with me,
you hate it.

346
00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:31.920
But now I've learned a different thing and I'm not.

347
00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:36.300
And what I'm advocating for now is I'm not asking people to change their

348
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:37.140
perspectives.

349
00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:42.560
I'm asking people to stop having your feet so firmly on the ground when you're a

350
00:18:43.471 --> 00:18:46.860
child.
Because I'm a child,
you know,
I can't rent a car.

351
00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:50.490
I can't smoke a cigarette,
nor do I intend to.

352
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:54.180
But at the end of the day,
I can't tell you about,

353
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.600
I can tell you with authority about economics,
I could tell you what I think.

354
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.740
I haven't taken any comm class or finance class and we need it.

355
00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.600
<v 1>Yeah,
you're already doing better than most experts on CNN.
I think</v>

356
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:08.310
<v 2>people on the left and the right.</v>

357
00:19:08.311 --> 00:19:12.540
And you just need to realize that facts are facts.

358
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.610
Feelings are feelings,
logic,
his logic.

359
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:18.090
But the more and more we try to prove each other wrong,

360
00:19:18.091 --> 00:19:22.570
the less progress we're going to make.
Cause I,
I have had the mindset that,

361
00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:24.520
which is why I understand it.
I've had the mindset,
we're,

362
00:19:24.521 --> 00:19:26.730
all I wanted to do is just own the conservatives.

363
00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.940
And I know people who have had the mindset where all they want to do is own the

364
00:19:29.941 --> 00:19:31.510
lips.
Yeah.
Yeah.

365
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:32.121
<v 1>And by the way,</v>

366
00:19:32.121 --> 00:19:35.630
I know you're not just saying this because Kyle cashew who I've gotten to know

367
00:19:35.631 --> 00:19:38.180
well who falls off and on the other side of this and you,

368
00:19:38.181 --> 00:19:41.220
he's now working with turning point and he's,
you know,

369
00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:44.900
trying to strengthen the second amendment and all sorts of other things.

370
00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.540
You guys are friends and you guys are still able to talk about these things and

371
00:19:48.541 --> 00:19:49.251
we are,
you know,

372
00:19:49.251 --> 00:19:51.560
I had originally said maybe we could get both of you guys in here,

373
00:19:51.561 --> 00:19:54.230
but we thought this would be a good opportunity to just to let you do your thing

374
00:19:54.231 --> 00:19:58.250
and I'll have Kyle on separately,
but you guys are,
despite your differences,

375
00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.470
you're,
you're able to talk

376
00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:02.750
<v 2>a lot of things.
Kyle does.
I don't like a lot of,</v>

377
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:06.030
almost everything he says I disagree with are some things he says that I think

378
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.980
are inappropriate.

379
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.940
I've said some inappropriate stuff and,
and you know,

380
00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:17.280
I understand if you don't agree with me and you want to come out and speak,

381
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.170
I,
I'm proud that I was able to speak after the shooting and Kyle did too.

382
00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:25.230
So,
uh,
I haven't understood.
I have a deep understanding of his position.

383
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.880
<v 1>So beyond the podcast,
and I will give you my word that I will do the podcast.
Oh,</v>

384
00:20:29.881 --> 00:20:32.790
please.
No,
I was,
yeah.
Well you asked me to do it.
The email was,

385
00:20:32.791 --> 00:20:35.210
can you do my phone that I'm lucky enough to be here?
Yeah.

386
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:39.010
I'm more than happy to do it.
We'll,
we'll make that happen.
Um,
what,

387
00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.970
what do you want to do?
Have you,

388
00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.340
have you really been able to think about it at this point?

389
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.350
I know it's sort of an annoying question to ask a young person.

390
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:47.650
<v 2>No,
I mean,
you know,</v>

391
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:49.870
<v 1>I can tell you what college I want to go to.</v>

392
00:20:49.871 --> 00:20:52.030
I can't tell you where I want to be in 50 years,

393
00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:55.330
but I can tell you that right now I want to dedicate my time to do and what I

394
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:58.810
think is the best thing I could do with my platform because I have a large

395
00:20:58.811 --> 00:21:00.610
platform for all the worst reasons.

396
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:05.200
And with great platform comes great responsibility.
Biderman exactly.

397
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.690
Uncle Ben said that,
I believe it wasn't uncle Ben,

398
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.580
but when you say uncle Ben on this show,

399
00:21:09.581 --> 00:21:12.100
people might be like kindly talking about Ben Shapiro.

400
00:21:12.610 --> 00:21:15.110
This is all the Ben Parker.
Um,

401
00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.520
and I have a responsibility to do what I think is right and what I think is

402
00:21:18.521 --> 00:21:20.140
right as advocating for what I believe in,

403
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.390
but also making sure that the conversation is,

404
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.790
is mended and healed because who better than the people who are about to become

405
00:21:27.791 --> 00:21:32.080
adults to try and make sure that our next generation of adults knows how to work

406
00:21:32.081 --> 00:21:34.840
together.
I mean you got Nelson and Rubio in Florida.

407
00:21:34.841 --> 00:21:35.800
I'll give you a great example.

408
00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.150
Nelson and Rubio have passed some great bills together because Nelson Rubio

409
00:21:40.151 --> 00:21:44.290
don't see eye to eye to eye,
but they are able to put their differences aside.

410
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:48.290
They get along and I want more of that.
Yeah.
Well man,

411
00:21:48.291 --> 00:21:50.240
I know a lot of people were worried about the future.

412
00:21:50.241 --> 00:21:53.780
But I mean it's clear to me that your future is bright and if we can hand it

413
00:21:53.781 --> 00:21:57.470
over whenever we can hand it over to,
to,
to people like you will be all right.

414
00:21:57.471 --> 00:21:58.304
Cause this is,

415
00:21:58.580 --> 00:22:01.700
this is everything that I've been trying to do here I think is summed up in the

416
00:22:01.701 --> 00:22:05.630
way that you're trying to go forward with life.
It's,
it's pretty awesome really.

417
00:22:05.631 --> 00:22:06.170
It's inspiring.

418
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.220
<v 2>I appreciate that.
Let me ask you something and it's your show.
Oh,
I'm,
I'm,</v>

419
00:22:09.221 --> 00:22:12.470
I'm gonna we're gonna switch to your,
flip it in motion.
You are in theater.

420
00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.040
All right.
Yeah,
exactly.
Yeah.
So,
um,
so

421
00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:18.320
what,

422
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.530
what are the qualities you're looking for in a candidate if you are going to

423
00:22:21.531 --> 00:22:23.570
vote for them over president Trump in 2020.

424
00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:26.940
<v 1>Oh man,
you're really putting me on the spot here.
This is my show.
Look,</v>

425
00:22:26.941 --> 00:22:27.990
I've said this before,

426
00:22:27.991 --> 00:22:32.850
but it seems to me that unfortunately the democratic socialist wing of the

427
00:22:32.851 --> 00:22:37.620
Democrats has gone really far left.
I mean,
look,
the word socialist in the,

428
00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:41.940
in the title now,
[inaudible] Dave Purge,
right?

429
00:22:41.941 --> 00:22:44.100
I guess they're being honest for what they are and they're fighting for what

430
00:22:44.101 --> 00:22:46.710
they believe in.
I happen to disagree with virtually all of it,

431
00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.600
but that they're doing that.
They've basically purged what I think are the,

432
00:22:50.601 --> 00:22:53.940
the remaining liberals,
as you said,
classical liberals before.

433
00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.360
And I think unfortunately that leaves a lot of us.

434
00:22:57.361 --> 00:23:00.810
It's why people watch my show because I've just been honest about what I see

435
00:23:00.811 --> 00:23:01.380
here.

436
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.300
That leaves a lot of us suddenly with allies in places that we didn't think we

437
00:23:06.301 --> 00:23:07.230
were going to have allies.

438
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.260
And it's sort of unfortunate in one way because you want to always think that

439
00:23:10.261 --> 00:23:14.250
you can sort of stay home and fix things.
You've got to pop the bubble.

440
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:18.780
But at the moment I find my allies have certainly are libertarians on the right.

441
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:22.470
I think I can,
you know,
be allies and a lot of ways with Ben Shapiro,

442
00:23:22.471 --> 00:23:24.390
even though we have differences on the margins,

443
00:23:24.391 --> 00:23:27.360
like with abortion and some of that other stuff.
Um,

444
00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.490
but I don't see at the moment when from when we're taping this right now,

445
00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.030
I just don't see any hope in the short term for the Democrats.

446
00:23:36.031 --> 00:23:41.031
My hope is that this thing implodes that they get probably half to get crushed

447
00:23:41.101 --> 00:23:43.230
in the mid terms,
which is not looking likely,

448
00:23:43.231 --> 00:23:47.800
but that they get crushed in the midterms and then they have a major course,
uh,

449
00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:52.250
adjustment where they go,
we've got to return to liberalism.
Sure.

450
00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.820
And that is the answer because I believe liberalism is the answer.

451
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.170
I think it's the only answer.

452
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.290
But if you know somebody that I should be paying attention to,

453
00:24:00.291 --> 00:24:04.130
let me know because I don't see much.
We'll keep in touch and I know,

454
00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.890
I know you've got a list.
I'll send you some liberals.
I,
um,

455
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.350
one more thing.
I know we're about on time.

456
00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.990
What is your favorite musical and with which musical character do you identify

457
00:24:14.991 --> 00:24:16.910
the most?
Oh Man.
Yeah.
And really going for it.

458
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:21.310
I can either do favorite superhero movie or something,
but let's go to that.
Well,

459
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.240
I was telling you during the break that I love,
I mean,

460
00:24:23.241 --> 00:24:27.860
I really felt infinity war was spectacular.
I think it was just done right.

461
00:24:27.861 --> 00:24:31.130
Loki has to be dead though.
That's,
that's the key thing I want.

462
00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.240
But here's the thing,
I loved the Maura.
She's amazing.
She's a Badass.

463
00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.390
But if they bring her back,
which they will bring her back,

464
00:24:38.391 --> 00:24:40.390
she was killed in the process of getting this also.

465
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.100
And so they can say that once they destroy the stones or whatever,

466
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.970
however it may be,

467
00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:47.690
they could bring her back and it'll be nice to see her back because I love her

468
00:24:47.691 --> 00:24:52.480
as an actress.
I love her chemistry with everyone.
But that was a powerful for me.

469
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.290
You can't keep killing people and bringing them back.

470
00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:56.240
That's why Loki has to be dead this time.

471
00:24:56.241 --> 00:25:00.920
Which they basically made it sound like,
yeah,
I infinity war did a good job with,

472
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:04.160
you know,
Tony.
Tony has been in the MCU for what?

473
00:25:04.161 --> 00:25:07.670
Like 20 movies and he didn't die Gomorrah.
This is our third film.

474
00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:12.500
And I felt that I felt that debt.
I hate to tell you,
but she's,
well,

475
00:25:12.501 --> 00:25:14.330
hate to tell her whatever she's going,
she's going to be alive.

476
00:25:14.331 --> 00:25:16.430
But putting that aside against three musical,
you know,

477
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:18.800
I'm not a huge musical guy.
I'm not,

478
00:25:18.801 --> 00:25:21.410
I know you don't want to hear that as well as a theater guy.
No,

479
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.260
not a huge muser girl.
I liked.
I liked Mama Mia.
Okay.

480
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.600
We can,
you can find some common ground.
You got some comments?

481
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.760
See that's what it's about.
Content.
Exactly.
Listen,
man,

482
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:33.230
we could've talked about marvel movies and all these other,

483
00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:36.710
you gave me a lot of funny pop culture references before we started.
You have to,

484
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:40.700
you have to,
you know,
break new ground.
And that's what I was trying to do here.

485
00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.740
That's what it's all about.
I have no doubt.

486
00:25:42.770 --> 00:25:46.070
You have a bright future and you're probably going to be president.

487
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.920
Is that where this is all leading president of Stoneman Douglas High School's

488
00:25:48.921 --> 00:25:51.290
Drama Club?
No,
because my dear friend,
uh,

489
00:25:51.291 --> 00:25:54.710
she ran and she's doing a phenomenal job.
On that note,
guys,

490
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.940
follow Cameron on Twitter.
It's Cameron underscore.
Caskey.
