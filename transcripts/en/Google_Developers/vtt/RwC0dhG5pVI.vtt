ELLIE POWERS: Thanks for
the intro, [? Purnima. ?]

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.560
So I'm Ellie Powers.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.550
I lead product management
for apps on Google Play.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.150
And I'm really
excited to talk to you

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.630
about how to be more successful.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.730
Ever since I joined Google,
this has been a topic

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.380
that I'm hugely passionate
about-- helping developers

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.880
grow new and
exciting businesses.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.130
So why are we really here?

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:20.970
What is it that
we're trying to do?

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.909
Many of us have an
idea or a business

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.700
that we're trying to
get out into the world

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.030
and that we're trying
to make more successful.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.200
And these days, the best
way to reach people globally

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.890
is through building apps,
especially apps on Google Play.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.520
And Michael just talked about
how big that opportunity is.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.840
It's really huge.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.520
And so I want to talk
with you about how

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.380
to make those dreams
into a reality

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.196
of successful businesses, great
user experiences, and a way

00:00:46.196 --> 00:00:48.570
to truly reach people and help
them make their lives more

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.600
successful as well.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.380
So one of the themes
that Michael touched on

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.890
was how your success
depends a lot

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.940
on the quality of
your application.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.810
A great app has
to be functional.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.970
It has to provide
value to a user's life.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.739
It has to solve a real problem
they have, make their day

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.470
a little bit more fun,
or things like that.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.630
But on top of that, the app
itself has to be excellent.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.980
And we find that users
have very high expectations

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.020
for apps on Play.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.530
So today what we're going to do
is walk through the entire app

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.870
development life cycle
and talk about how

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.930
you can bring
quality and success

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.220
at every step of the way.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.260
So first we're going to start
by talking about design.

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.630
And what we've seen from
users on Google Play

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.030
is that they have very, very
high expectations for how apps

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.840
are going to look and
behave on their devices.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.810
And we hear back from
developers that the time

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.140
they spend on optimizing design
pays off many, many times over.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.634
And now with material
design, we're

00:01:47.634 --> 00:01:49.550
seeing that Google is
really becoming a leader

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.740
in thinking about
how to create great,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.710
delightful, and
engaging experiences

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.430
across multiple
types of devices.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.770
So let's get started by digging
deeper into material design.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.150
So what is it, anyway?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.170
It certainly looks
cool, but there's

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.720
something much deeper to it.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.240
It's really about defining
the characteristics of how

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.550
a UI should feel, move,
and adapt to a user.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.530
We provide design patterns
for how to implement this.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.150
And we try to make this easier
by baking in best practices

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.625
for building great touch UIs.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.280
Another theme you'll see coming
up a lot is how to use motion.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.160
But not just for fun--
although for that--

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.410
but also to provide
comprehension,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.520
and really going a step
beyond more static web

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.970
pages into something
where a user can interact

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.430
and understand more deeply.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.760
One of the last
things you'll notice

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.480
is that we can use beautiful
aesthetics to not only delight

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.940
users, but to also help
designs adapt across screens.

00:02:48.722 --> 00:02:50.180
So if you're
interested about this,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.596
I definitely
recommend that you go

00:02:51.596 --> 00:02:54.280
to developer.android.com/design.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.359
And there's a bunch of
materials there, and soon

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.900
to be more and more
coming, about how

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.970
you can start applying
this thinking,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.855
and some technical
concepts to your apps.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.650
So before we dig into the
details of material design,

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.210
let's talk a little bit
about what the benefits are.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.860
So first of all,
material design is

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.780
great for expressing your brand.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.000
Material design emphasizes
a great use of color

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.952
and provides UI patterns that
are sufficiently flexible so

00:03:18.952 --> 00:03:20.410
that you can build
experiences that

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.790
feel authentic to your
users and the design

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.915
that you might have already
across your web, print,

00:03:24.915 --> 00:03:25.675
or other products.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.460
Next, material design is really
an opportunity to delight.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.980
It provides great consistency
with the Android experience

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.880
so that when a user
is using their device

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.150
and using your app as part of
it, it really seems to fit in.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.900
And it also provides
a very strong

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.870
cross-platform experience so
that as a user experiences

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.430
your device on an Android
tablet, their phone, a website,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.170
it's really a great experience.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.930
And they don't feel like they're
starting over again every time.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.066
And there's a real opportunity
for developers here

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:56.315
who want to be early adopters.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.370
We're offering a new collection
called the Beautiful Design

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.194
Collection, and if you're
able to start investing early

00:04:03.194 --> 00:04:05.360
in material design, there's
a great opportunity here

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.495
to get noticed and
be seen as a leader.

00:04:07.495 --> 00:04:09.870
And eventually, material design
will become a requirement

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.161
to get featured on Google Play.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.310
OK, so we're going
to take a look

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.750
at one app that's
using material design.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.679
We're going to walk
through every step of what

00:04:19.679 --> 00:04:20.220
they've done.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.210
All right, so you can see the
old app versus the new app

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.062
here.

00:04:25.062 --> 00:04:26.520
And we're going to
walk through how

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.770
they made each of the changes.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.920
All right, so
here's the old app.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.730
They switched the buddy icons
to the nice circular version.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.700
They added key lines here.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.580
Lots of white space-- it feels
a lot more nicely laid-out.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.379
A bright prop of
color at the top

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.920
makes it look really beautiful
and brings out the new Compose

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.419
button.

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:45.920
You can see a big
difference here.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.900
And then this new
design will scale easily

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:48.850
to the tablet layout.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.130
OK, let's take a look
at a second example.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.690
So one of the tenets of material
design is to focus on content.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.990
So here you can see the use
of album and artist imagery.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:02.770
It's a much more visual,
graphic, compelling version

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.720
than the smaller image
on the left, which

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.480
was the previous design.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.244
We're also making a much
bolder use of color.

00:05:09.244 --> 00:05:10.660
You can see here
the bright yellow

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.780
that comes from the album
art is drawing your eye.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.980
And we're using a
delightful use of motion

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.100
here, not only to make it
feel more fun and interactive,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.700
but also to explain-- as you
kind of dive into one album

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.642
or pull back out of it--
how that one album relates

00:05:25.642 --> 00:05:27.475
to the rest of the items
in your collection.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.880
Next let's take a look
at the Play Store.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.930
So we can see here that
the Play Store is also

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.240
starting to adopt material
design principles.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.610
And one detail I
did want to mention

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.110
is material design
isn't just for L.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.020
It also works for
pre-L devices, too,

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.680
so you can provide a
consistent experience for all

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.930
of your users.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.950
Here the Play Store is
using a bold graphic

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.780
across the top of the page.

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.449
Many of you who've already
gone to the Developer Console

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.240
to update your store
listing have made sure

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.340
that you're using that
bold feature graphic.

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.610
It does a great job of
expressing the brand

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.570
and feeling of the application.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.380
We've also cleaned
up the layout a bunch

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.550
and added a nice
white background

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.080
with lots of white space so
it doesn't feel as cluttered.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.880
And then in the
center, we have a bunch

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.340
of bold, brightly-colored,
geometric icons

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.440
that draw the eye as well.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.240
So now we're going to talk
about four different concepts

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.330
within material
design so that you

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.440
can start thinking about how
to apply them to your apps.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.820
So we're going to talk
about tangible services,

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.770
meaningful and
delightful motion,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.120
bold and beautiful aesthetics,
and adaptive design.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.630
And remember, these can
be done in L, of course,

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.550
as we all know, but
also on pre-L devices.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.050
There are some new
capabilities that

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.480
are coming up in
L that make motion

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.563
a lot easier to implement.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.520
OK, so tangible
surfaces-- the idea here

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.190
is to use different
surfaces and shadows

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:52.400
and think about how your app,
if it were a physical object,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.350
would actually look and behave.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.080
And the way that something
looks in material design

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:58.740
should make it
easier for the user

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.620
to be able to figure out how
the user should interact with it

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:04.080
and how it will respond to them.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.900
Now, these uses of
different surfaces

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.860
can be very valuable to
separate the content-- which,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.330
again, in material
design we want

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.610
to take the focus-- from
the navigation, which

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.040
should be present
but not dominating.

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.810
We want to focus
the user's attention

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.350
on the most important
parts of the screen.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:22.180
And the white framing
that we use so commonly

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:24.680
in the material design
layouts makes it easier

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.630
to allow the content
to shine, and also

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.210
just make the page
look a lot neater.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.600
OK, the second concept
in material design

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.930
here is the bold and
beautiful aesthetic.

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.120
So again, content
is at the center.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.460
And we love content
that is bold, graphic,

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.080
and feels very intentionally
placed on the page.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.530
A lot of material design
examples you'll see as well

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.240
will have one primary color,
and then also an accent color.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.100
And we can see the
content providing color,

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.290
like the pink heart in
this album art here, too.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.590
The use of typography
is particularly

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.390
important in material design.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:00.205
You can use the fonts that
match best with your brand

00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:01.690
and give the right feeling.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.940
And you want to think about
how the fonts fit together

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.610
as well with the iconography.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.090
We like geometric icons
in material design.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.290
Now, one of my favorite
things about material design

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:16.110
is this concept of meaningful
and delightful motion.

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:18.480
Everyone wants
technology to be fun.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.190
We all have our
favorite experiences

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.150
from when we picked
up a new gadget,

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:24.960
and it just did
something that was fun,

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.400
delighted us, and made us laugh.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.770
On the Developer Console,
when you upload new things,

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:31.856
you get a little robot
icon that starts moving,

00:08:31.856 --> 00:08:33.980
and we've gotten a lot of
good feedback about that.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.140
But motion can be so much
more meaningful than that.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.862
When people start
using interfaces,

00:08:38.862 --> 00:08:40.570
we want to make it
really clear about how

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.070
one part of the interface
relates to the next.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.670
And that's what material
design can do with motion.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.300
So when the material
design interface

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:50.960
responds to the user's
touch with motion,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.370
it gives that cue
and that response.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:56.120
And it draws the eye
naturally, because we

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:01.160
know that motion is really great
for drawing the user's focus.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.110
But you don't want to go
overboard with motion.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:06.240
The user's action
should be the thing

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.820
that initiates the motion.

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.817
And also, the motion
should be fast and precise

00:09:09.817 --> 00:09:11.775
so that they don't distract
from the interface.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.680
OK, so if we look at the
material design principles,

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.657
there's one part I
think that sums it

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:20.240
up pretty well about
what we're trying

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.180
to do with adaptive design.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.520
So the idea here is that a
single underlying design system

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.080
should organize
interactions and space.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.420
And every device should
reflect a different view

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.840
of the same underlying system.

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:38.720
So the idea here is that, for
example, as you can see here,

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.440
this is about user's calendar.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.100
And so there's a singular
source of calendar data

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:45.810
from a technical perspective.

00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:48.160
But also, visually, the
idea is that there's

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:50.710
sort of a system of rules for
how you display that calendar

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:51.892
information.

00:09:51.892 --> 00:09:54.350
And when you look at each device
and what should be surface

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.410
there, you should think about
what information and what

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.060
presentation is most relevant
and specific to that device.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.740
And then you can use material
design visual elements

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:06.220
to create continuity.

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.810
And the margins
and the key lines

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:10.190
may change a bit from
device to device,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.610
but it should feel
consistent and predictable.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.870
So that way, if the user
starts using your app

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:18.392
on a new device-- maybe they
get an Android Wear watch--

00:10:18.392 --> 00:10:20.850
they already pretty much have
a good sense of how it should

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.865
behave and what it's
able to do for them,

00:10:22.865 --> 00:10:24.240
although the watch
will certainly

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.040
show a different
view of information

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.000
than maybe their laptop
computer, their phone,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.800
or their tablet might have.

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.510
OK, so that's material design.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.020
Now let's go on
and talk about how

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.274
this applies to certain
types of devices

00:10:36.274 --> 00:10:38.690
and what other design concerns
you should think about when

00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:40.356
you're trying to build
high-quality apps

00:10:40.356 --> 00:10:41.880
across devices.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.670
So last year, we
started a program

00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:47.870
called Design for Tablets.

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.520
And now we're seeing that the
vast majority of our top apps

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.150
already meet all these
Design for Tablets criteria.

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:56.370
And this is fantastic,
because Android tablets

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.720
are selling so well.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.670
And we want to make
sure that every user has

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:01.100
a great experience
with every app

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.350
that they use on their tablet.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:06.140
So the idea of a tablet
is really interesting.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.670
And many developers, when
tablets first came out,

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.640
thought it was
just a small phone.

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.440
But it's so much more than that.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.260
When you have a tablet, you
don't just have more space,

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.820
but you have people using
your app in different ways.

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:20.970
So a common thing that
we'll hear from developers

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:23.690
is that people will use their
phone for kind of-- they

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.900
called it snacking,
frequently going and getting

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:30.320
a little bit of information,
doing one, small, short task.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.220
But with the tablet,
it's not like a snack.

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:33.570
It's more like a meal.

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.840
People will sit down with
their tablet and interact

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.150
much more deeply.

00:11:37.150 --> 00:11:39.890
So in addition to thinking
about what type of visual layout

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:43.280
you want to have-- and you
can use Fragments to build

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.750
flexible UIs that adapt very
easily across different device

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.414
sizes-- you also want to think
about what functionality you

00:11:49.414 --> 00:11:50.955
should offer for
the best experience.

00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:55.690
So then, when you think that
you've designed a great tablet

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.160
app, you want to make sure that
you upload it to the Google

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.660
Play Developer
Console, and that you

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.420
check the Design for
Tablets checklist

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.690
to make sure it's
met all the criteria.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:06.240
And the reason why
this is important

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.350
is that if you want your app to
be fully visible and incredibly

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.070
prominent on Google
Play, it needs

00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:14.680
to make sure that it
meets all these criteria.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.250
If you're browsing
apps on your tablet

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:19.000
and you go to the
top charts, the ones

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.670
that you'll see by
default are the ones

00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.500
that meet the Design
for Tablets criteria.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:23.950
And so you want to make
sure that your app is

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:25.033
going to be visible there.

00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:27.490
So if you check the checklist,
you'll know what to do.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.360
Another great thing to do is
you want to explain to the user

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:32.860
exactly how the app will
work on their device.

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:35.202
And a picture is worth
a thousand words,

00:12:35.202 --> 00:12:36.910
so that's why we give
you the opportunity

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:39.290
to upload seven-inch
and 10-inch tablet

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:41.150
screenshots in the
Developer Console.

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.970
So that way, when
someone browses your app

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.065
in Google Play on
a tablet, they'll

00:12:46.065 --> 00:12:48.690
see the screenshots that really
represent how your app is going

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.426
to look on their device, and any
tablet specifically [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:51.426 --> 00:12:52.550
and features that you have.

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:55.290
So if you want to
then start thinking

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.230
about how to go above and
beyond the basic criteria,

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.367
I definitely recommend that
you go to developer.android.com

00:13:01.367 --> 00:13:03.700
and check out our tablet
quality checklist for some more

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.920
explanations about how to
have a truly great Android

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:06.550
app on tablets.

00:13:07.970 --> 00:13:11.100
OK, so next we're going to
talk more about Android Wear.

00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.121
So if you're not sure
how to get started,

00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:14.995
the most important thing
to think about first

00:13:14.995 --> 00:13:17.030
is there's actually
three possible ways

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:20.420
that your app can
adapt to Android Wear.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.430
First of all, step one,
there's the no work option.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.940
Notifications will just
show up automatically.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:27.710
Step two, you can
spend a bit more work

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:29.610
to enhance these notifications.

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:32.070
Or step three, you
have the option

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.202
of building a much more
complex application.

00:13:34.202 --> 00:13:36.160
We're going to walk
through all three of these.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.420
So first, the most
basic thing to know

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.900
is if your app
creates notifications,

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.250
they'll automatically
just start showing up

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.052
by default on someone's
Android Wear device.

00:13:47.052 --> 00:13:48.760
You'll probably want
to check it out just

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.050
to be sure that you're
happy with the experience.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:53.060
But this shouldn't imply
any extra work for you

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.640
as long as you're using
standard notifications.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.150
So second is the idea of
enhancing these notifications.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.130
And this is a really
great option to consider.

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:04.642
Because usually it'll take
maybe 10 lines of code or so.

00:14:04.642 --> 00:14:06.100
But then you can
make an experience

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.130
that gives really big benefits.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.120
So there's a couple of cool
things you can do here.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.190
By default, if you
have a messaging app,

00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.040
those notifications
with new messages

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.750
will show up on the Wear device.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:18.780
But it's really easy
to add a voice reply

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.250
so that the user can respond
directly from the Wear device

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.750
without having to
unlock their phone

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.182
and take it out of their pocket.

00:14:24.182 --> 00:14:25.640
There are also
other ways to format

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.867
the enhanced notifications,
like pages and stacking,

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.450
that might be worth looking into
depending on what type of app

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:31.910
you have.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:35.490
So for those of you who are
really looking to be innovators

00:14:35.490 --> 00:14:38.310
and to push into
new areas, I want

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.250
to give you a couple tips
for building a full Wear app.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.741
So on the left, we have
kind of the default software

00:14:43.741 --> 00:14:45.240
development schedule
that most of us

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.595
think that we're going to have.

00:14:46.595 --> 00:14:48.970
So for example, we think we'll
spend a little bit of time

00:14:48.970 --> 00:14:50.346
on design, we'll
build the thing,

00:14:50.346 --> 00:14:52.636
and then we'll spend a little
bit of time debugging it.

00:14:52.636 --> 00:14:54.090
But what usually
ends up happening

00:14:54.090 --> 00:14:56.560
is we need more design
time than we thought,

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.540
and the debugging
process isn't so speedy.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.631
Now, specifically for
Android Wear applications,

00:15:03.631 --> 00:15:05.130
the recommendation
that we're seeing

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:07.860
based on some of our
earliest access partners

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.000
is you're going to
probably think about 25%

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.860
of your time for UX iteration.

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.470
And so why is that?

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.150
The old rules don't
apply in Android Wear.

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:19.630
A lot of us have experience
building web pages,

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.360
probably apps for
the phone, maybe

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:23.250
apps for the tablet as well.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:26.300
But Android Wear is totally
new, and a different interaction

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.187
modality may be necessary.

00:15:28.187 --> 00:15:30.520
So if you put in the time,
and you spend time iterating,

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:31.930
it can be really fun to explore.

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.971
And you can end up with
something that's amazing.

00:15:33.971 --> 00:15:37.682
And if someone is carrying your
app around on their wrist 24/7,

00:15:37.682 --> 00:15:39.140
that's a really
unique opportunity.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:40.765
And I think it warrants
the investment.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.900
OK, now we're going to
talk more about Android TV

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:46.700
and how to build great apps.

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.490
So the types of apps
that we see as being

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.150
most promising in the living
room are games and media apps.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.100
And the way to think about
the TV is this, right?

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.650
This is not like putting
a gigantic computer

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.820
in your living room.

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.750
It's not even like putting a
gigantic mobile phone or tablet

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.030
in your living room.

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:05.720
It's really a
different experience.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:08.320
The user wants to lean
back, sit on the sofa,

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.370
and be entertained.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.430
So put content at the center.

00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:13.980
And secondly, you want to create
something that's immersive.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:16.850
So go ahead and use movement,
sound, and visual imagery

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.330
to create something
that has a truly

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:21.740
cinematic experience if you can.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.780
And, perhaps most
importantly, we definitely

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:25.570
recommend that you simplify.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.487
If a person's using a
remote control to interact,

00:16:28.487 --> 00:16:30.070
and they just want
to sit down and put

00:16:30.070 --> 00:16:31.650
on their favorite
program, you don't

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.924
want to send them
through menu after menu.

00:16:33.924 --> 00:16:36.340
You just want to put the fewest
screens and least friction

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.410
between the user and the content
that they want to engage with.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.840
So we offer you some
lean back themes

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.670
and other TV-optimized
layouts to try

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:46.244
to make building a TV
app as easy as possible.

00:16:46.244 --> 00:16:48.660
And if you're interested, we
actually have a program where

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.580
you can go online to
developer.android.com/TV

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.740
and request an
ADT1 developer kit.

00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:58.380
This will help you get
started and actually test

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.170
your TV app on something real.

00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:04.569
OK, so we talked
about how design

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:07.020
is the great first
building block for having

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.010
a high-quality and
successful app.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.609
So now we're going
to talk about how

00:17:10.609 --> 00:17:12.200
to take this same
idea of quality

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.954
and to bring it through next
to the development process.

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:20.140
OK, so Michael mentioned
earlier the Android L release.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.420
We have material design, the
most new APIs of any release,

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.760
and a bunch of cool user
features like better task

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.030
switching, faster app
runtimes, and so forth.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:33.370
I'm really excited about
the improved battery life

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.500
and also how it's designed
to help handle flaky network

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.010
connections.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.450
So those of us who
tend to get dropped

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:41.283
calls are going to have
a better experience.

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:43.974
So I want to walk through
just a couple things

00:17:43.974 --> 00:17:46.390
that you should think about
when you're thinking about how

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.340
to have a high-quality,
engaging, successful experience

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.007
on L. And the first
one is notifications.

00:17:52.007 --> 00:17:54.340
So immediately what you'll
notice about what's different

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.560
for notifications in L
is the background color.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:57.670
It used to be black.

00:17:57.670 --> 00:17:58.900
Now they have a white color.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:04.710
And you actually get to change
the little blue dot color there

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:07.080
that appears next to each
of your notifications.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.130
So if you want to express your
brand there and capitalize

00:18:10.130 --> 00:18:11.630
on your material
design layout, this

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:12.796
is a great place to pick it.

00:18:13.542 --> 00:18:15.750
The second thing that you
should know about and check

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:17.480
in your app is that
we're allowing users

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:22.000
to modify all of their
global notification settings

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.780
through the Android
Settings app.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.060
So just make sure that you
add a notifications flag

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:28.400
to the manifest to make sure
that your app will appear there

00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.540
in the settings so that
users can go there to adjust

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:32.748
notifications for your app
from the central location.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.280
And then finally, one really
cool thing that we're doing

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.905
is we're starting to
show notifications

00:18:37.905 --> 00:18:39.650
on the lock screen.

00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:43.200
So as we all know, once a user
installs your app, that's cool.

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.570
But you want to keep
them engaged over time.

00:18:45.570 --> 00:18:47.340
And the lock screen
is a new area

00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:49.350
to bring up things
that are very critical

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:51.010
and a user needs to notice.

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:54.300
And you also want to be
really sensitive here, too.

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.380
If a user has, let's say, a
messaging app on their phone,

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.337
and you receive a new
message, and you're

00:18:59.337 --> 00:19:00.920
going to show it to
them, they may not

00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.641
want to see the contents of that
message on their lock screen,

00:19:03.641 --> 00:19:04.140
right?

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.500
Someone else might
pick up their phone

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.230
and go, well, that's
very interesting.

00:19:07.230 --> 00:19:10.640
So you need to think about
what sort of private, public,

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.220
and secret views you want to
have of different notifications

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:15.940
to make sure that if things are
showing up on the lock screen,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:18.370
it's meeting users' expectations
and still being helpful.

00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.120
OK, so let's talk
a little bit more

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.370
about how we can take care of
the Android One opportunity

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:26.870
and make the most
of the opportunity

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:28.630
for emerging markets.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.010
So one of the key things
that we hear again and again

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:34.050
about emerging markets is
that data plans are expensive,

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.491
and only lower-end
smartphones may be available.

00:19:37.491 --> 00:19:38.990
So these are the
devices that you're

00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:40.130
going to be dealing with.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.810
And what we find for
most developers who

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:43.690
invest in those areas
is once they learn

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.523
how to build their apps
right, they actually

00:19:45.523 --> 00:19:46.970
get massive benefits today.

00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:49.660
And we forecast only greater and
greater growth tomorrow there.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:51.740
So let's talk about
a couple of things

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:53.620
you can do to optimize your app.

00:19:53.620 --> 00:19:55.040
So first of all,
for the network,

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:58.340
just assume that your user
is going to be on 2G only.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.910
And so what does this mean?

00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:02.340
Longer latency,
slower loading times.

00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:05.280
So you'll want to make
sure that you don't just

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.250
try to load the data and
time out after 10 seconds.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.750
You might need to assume that
some of those attempts to load

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.690
data aren't going to work.

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.510
Make sure that the
user is messaged

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.342
when data is or isn't loading.

00:20:16.342 --> 00:20:17.800
And make sure that
your application

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.710
doesn't have
dependencies on having

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.190
consistent, continuous
network connection.

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:27.530
Second, optimizing for lower
memory on lower-end devices

00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.190
is really important, and
again will pay off hugely.

00:20:30.190 --> 00:20:32.270
So in Android Studio,
we have a new function

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:33.590
called Memory Monitor.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:36.250
And this can help you understand
the memory profile of your app

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:39.120
and identify areas
to improve it.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.210
And third, the thing that I
can't say enough is just test.

00:20:42.210 --> 00:20:43.540
We offer an emulator.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.560
Some people use physical
devices as well.

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.209
And this allows you to do those
memory and network simulations.

00:20:48.209 --> 00:20:50.000
So if you have a physical
device and you're

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.710
trying to test there,
try switching off Wi-Fi,

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.262
setting your device
to use only 2G,

00:20:55.262 --> 00:20:56.720
and try to simulate
the connections

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.761
that your users will see.

00:20:57.761 --> 00:21:00.020
And if you think this
is really exciting--

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.510
because I definitely do-- we
have a recent post from Sundar

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:05.867
Pichai on her official Android
blog talking about some

00:21:05.867 --> 00:21:07.575
of the opportunities
here for developers.

00:21:07.575 --> 00:21:09.616
And I definitely recommend
that you check it out.

00:21:10.650 --> 00:21:15.050
OK, so if there are any
software developers here,

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.570
we hope that you're trying
out new Android Studio Beta.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:19.236
And if you're not, I
wanted to highlight

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:21.870
a couple of the key features
that we've released recently.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:25.190
We talked a ton about how
one of the big pushes right

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.520
now is around supporting
for new device types

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.651
and what the new opportunities
are to be early adopters.

00:21:30.651 --> 00:21:32.900
And Android Studio Beta can
really help you with that.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.440
They provide a bunch of
templates and other support,

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:38.500
so it's not that hard to
take an existing phone app

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.330
and to figure out how to extend
it onto new device types.

00:21:41.330 --> 00:21:42.860
It also offers
the Memory Monitor

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:44.270
that I mentioned earlier.

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.250
And if you're adding Google
Play services or other types

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:49.100
of Google services,
this is the easiest way

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.280
to set up the integration.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.404
So it's no hassle to add
Google Analytics, Maps,

00:21:53.404 --> 00:21:54.320
or other capabilities.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:58.142
It also offers a nice,
rich layout editor.

00:21:58.142 --> 00:21:59.600
So you can set up
different themes,

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.610
and your app will look
much nicer by default.

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.220
And it has a lot of
quality improvement tools

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.110
around usability issues, version
compatibility, and stability.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:11.450
Cool, so definitely recommend
you guys try that out too.

00:22:12.687 --> 00:22:14.645
I also wanted to mention
Google Cloud Platform.

00:22:15.719 --> 00:22:17.260
Today, all of our
apps are definitely

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:20.100
connected to back-end storage.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.740
And I wanted to tell you
about this opportunity here.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:26.090
So whenever you're
launching a new app,

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.590
you want to be ready
for big growth.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.220
But you probably don't have
a huge budget to invest.

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.666
So we have this thing that we
call the mobile starter kit.

00:22:33.666 --> 00:22:35.290
And what it allows
you to do is to have

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.930
a small financial investment.

00:22:36.930 --> 00:22:38.580
But then if your
app goes really big,

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.040
you'll be able to
immediately take

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.081
advantage of all of the
best of Google's network.

00:22:42.081 --> 00:22:45.240
So super-fast for
performance, and it also

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.420
supports cross-platform mobile
apps, as well as the web,

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.050
so that you can use this
across your entire offering.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.900
And Google Play
services launched

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.820
two new functionalities
earlier in the year.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.350
If you're not using
it already, we

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:02.950
want you to know
that this is the best

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:04.805
way to integrate any
APIs from Google,

00:23:04.805 --> 00:23:06.180
whether that's
the In-app Billing

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.594
API, Google Maps, or more.

00:23:09.594 --> 00:23:11.010
And the great thing
about it, too,

00:23:11.010 --> 00:23:13.830
is that this is something
that's kept up-to-date by Google

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:15.280
on the user's device.

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.850
So immediately, without having
to integrate any new SDK,

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.550
the new features are available
across all of your users

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:22.830
immediately.

00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:25.240
So the two new things that
we announced this year

00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:29.110
are the activity
recognition API can now

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.780
recognize running and walking.

00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:32.380
So those of you
with fitness apps

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.170
might be able to
make use of that.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:36.250
And we also
announced Cloud Save.

00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:38.230
So a key user challenge
is to make sure

00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:40.130
that when they have
data in their app,

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:43.120
they can expect it to be saved
and made available across all

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.440
of their devices-- their
phone, their tablet,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.410
maybe the web,
maybe their watch.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.010
And the Cloud Save
API makes this

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:50.970
easy with no
back-end programming.

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:53.420
It also does a really
good job of handling syncs

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.245
when a user transitions between
offline and online modes.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.297
So if you want to make sure
your app works really well,

00:24:01.297 --> 00:24:02.380
definitely check that out.

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.280
OK, so we talked about how
to bring quality and success

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.100
to the development process.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.240
And now we're going to talk
about the final stage--

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.050
distribution-- and
how you can make sure

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.280
that your app has
maximum success on Play

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.180
at this final step.

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.780
So we talked already about
beautiful material design

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.720
in Play and how we've
revamped the storefront.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.250
But rather than focusing
on the visual aspects,

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:28.680
now I want to talk
about the functionality

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.620
that this provides to
you as a developer.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.960
So this store listing
page on the Play Store

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.040
is basically your shop window.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:38.360
And this is how people
evaluate whether or not

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.610
they want to install your app.

00:24:40.630 --> 00:24:42.900
We've tried to make it
optimized so it gives people

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.129
a great experience.

00:24:44.129 --> 00:24:45.670
And also it gives
you the opportunity

00:24:45.670 --> 00:24:47.520
to express your brand.

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.700
So across the top, you see here
there's a big banner graphic.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.290
And it can be really
beautiful and express whatever

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:56.165
you want about your app.

00:24:56.165 --> 00:24:58.540
If you haven't already, make
sure you go to the Developer

00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.670
Console and provide that image.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.230
We also provide a short
summary at the bottom where

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:05.890
you can highlight
some of the key things

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.950
that your app provides,
a summary of it in one

00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:09.082
or two sentences.

00:25:09.082 --> 00:25:10.540
And then in the
middle of the page,

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.290
we tell the user about
different reasons

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:16.510
to install their app, like the
number of ratings that it has,

00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:19.960
if it's a high rating, a lot
of installs, their friends

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.560
have recommended it, perhaps.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.270
And we're also thinking
about other ways

00:25:23.270 --> 00:25:27.100
that maybe we can allow
developers to share more

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:27.850
in the Play Store.

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.760
So one of the most
important things

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.130
we hear developers talk
about is app ratings.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:39.120
And we find in the
Play Store that users

00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:41.400
use this as a huge
tool for evaluating

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.754
which app to install.

00:25:42.754 --> 00:25:44.670
If I'm picking between
two different apps that

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.360
do basically the same thing,
the one with the better ratings

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.020
will obviously get more traffic.

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.850
So this is a great tool for
making users compare the apps

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:54.960
and pick your app favorably.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.770
So as you see the quality
of your app increase,

00:25:57.770 --> 00:25:59.270
the ratings should
increase as well.

00:26:00.452 --> 00:26:02.160
But in addition,
there's actions that you

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:04.784
can take as a developer to make
sure that your ratings are even

00:26:04.784 --> 00:26:07.380
more successful, and to also
use this as an opportunity

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.144
to reach out to your users.

00:26:09.144 --> 00:26:10.810
So you can go into
the Developer Console

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:13.069
today and reply
to user comments.

00:26:13.069 --> 00:26:15.360
So what happens when you
reply to one of these comments

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:17.360
is that user receives
an email message,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:18.810
unless they've opted out.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:21.510
And also, your response is
displayed in the Play Store.

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:23.324
And what we found
from developers

00:26:23.324 --> 00:26:25.490
who have been using this
feature for the past couple

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:28.310
years is they get great
feedback from users.

00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:30.370
A user didn't expect
to receive a response.

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.530
But they're delighted when
a developer says, hey,

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:34.570
thanks for reporting that issue.

00:26:34.570 --> 00:26:36.650
We're going to fix it
in the next version.

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:38.210
And sometimes
developers even find

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:39.626
that users say,
wow, you're right.

00:26:39.626 --> 00:26:41.000
You did actually fix my bug.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.516
Or you explained to me how
that feature in your app works.

00:26:45.516 --> 00:26:47.390
And so they'll actually
go back and sometimes

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:49.740
end up improving their review
and improving their opinion

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:50.250
over time.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.140
So now we're going to talk about
why we launched beta testing

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:58.530
and staged rollouts.

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:00.020
So developers
would often tell us

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.130
that when you make your
debut on the Play Store,

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:05.000
it's critical to make sure that
it's working great on day one.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.120
Otherwise, users will
leave bad reviews,

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.180
and it's hard to
recover from that.

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:12.360
So we wanted to make sure that
you can integrate quality user

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.550
feedback from the beginning, so
that when you make your debut,

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.770
it's not the first time
anyone's tried your app.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.260
But rather, your app has been
well tested throughout time.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:24.510
So we want you to first
launch strong, and then

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.500
be able to keep
your momentum going.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.940
We've been overwhelmed by
the response to beta testing

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.120
and staged rollout over
the past year and a half.

00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.350
We've had now over 80,000
apps using these features,

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.120
getting an average
rating of 4.2 stars.

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:39.970
And we've also seen that
over 1/3 of our top apps

00:27:39.970 --> 00:27:41.810
are using beta testing today.

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:43.880
And many of them are using
staged rollouts, too.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.660
So we're recommending
beta testing

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:49.130
and staged rollouts as a best
practice for all developers.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:50.880
So let's go through
each of these concepts

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.004
and how you can apply them.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:55.060
So the purpose of
beta testing is

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.270
to be able to
release your app just

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:01.129
to a small, select group of
power users who you choose.

00:28:01.129 --> 00:28:03.170
So what this means is you
can control the access,

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:04.710
and you can also
keep it private so

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:07.400
that your super-stealth app
doesn't end up in the press

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.820
before you expect it.

00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:10.960
And users who want to
participate in beta tests

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.116
need to opt in.

00:28:12.116 --> 00:28:13.990
And they're also blocked
from leaving reviews

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:16.170
so that you don't end up
leaking any new features

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:19.145
or end up with low reviews as a
result of buggy beta software.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.620
We also now give you
statistics so you can easily

00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.590
compare how your new
beta and alpha versions

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:27.055
are doing against your
production versions.

00:28:27.055 --> 00:28:28.430
And so that way
you can make sure

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.480
that things are trending up
and to the right over time.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.660
We found best practice
was from developers

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.490
to solicit as much user
feedback as possible.

00:28:36.490 --> 00:28:38.210
Sometimes they do
this within the app.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:41.880
Sometimes the users use a Google
group or Google+ community

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:42.894
to get this feedback.

00:28:42.894 --> 00:28:44.560
But either way, we
found that developers

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:46.740
who are most open and
responsive to this feedback

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.310
end up with the best results.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:49.880
And some developers
have also told us

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:51.780
that they use this
as an early preview

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.730
to get metrics about how their
users might perform in the app

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:55.455
and production.

00:28:55.455 --> 00:28:56.830
Although you have
to keep in mind

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:58.600
that a group of power
users may or may not

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.050
represent your full user base.

00:29:01.450 --> 00:29:03.980
So after you've done an
alpha test, a beta test,

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:06.170
and you're feeling
confident, you're

00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:07.860
able to release your
app to production.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.294
And when you push new versions
of your app to production,

00:29:10.294 --> 00:29:11.710
you're able to
control the rollout

00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:13.660
to just a percentage of users.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:16.040
And these users are
randomly selected, including

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.020
both new users and
existing users who

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.150
might receive the
staged rollout version.

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.610
And staged rollouts
are visible publicly,

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.394
and users can also
leave reviews.

00:29:24.394 --> 00:29:26.810
The purpose of a staged rollout
is that you should already

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:28.800
be pretty confident in
what you're pushing,

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:31.200
but it just gives you
that extra level of safety

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.560
where if something unexpected
happens-- like maybe a bug that

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.740
didn't show up in
earlier testing-- then

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.210
it doesn't impact all the users.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:41.820
And it ends up having a
positive impact on reviews.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.015
Because you can catch this
before it hits everybody.

00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:50.480
OK, so as developers, we
don't have a lot of time.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.700
And something that I hear
frequently time and time

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.470
again is, well, what
should I focus on?

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:56.670
There's like 100
things I can do.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.590
They all might improve my
app, but I'm not really sure.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:02.270
We also want to go from
offering a bunch of data

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:07.080
to developers to offering
clear, highly-tailored insights,

00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.770
things that were going
to help your app.

00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:12.870
So the idea behind
optimization tips and alerts

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.420
is to do exactly this.

00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.210
We offer a wide variety of
optimization tips and alerts.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.960
So they cover
everything from how

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:22.050
to design your app for tablets,
when and how to localize

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.690
your app, and to make sure
you're upgrading to the latest

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:26.900
version of APIs, like
the In-app Billing API.

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.890
We also got some good feedback
from developers earlier

00:30:30.890 --> 00:30:33.930
when we started offering alerts
for when something goes wrong.

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.650
So for example, maybe you pushed
out a new version of your app.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:39.900
But actually, the reviews are a
lot worse than the old version.

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:41.190
So we'll let you know.

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:43.721
And developers told us,
well, that's really helpful.

00:30:43.721 --> 00:30:45.720
But couldn't you just get
that information to me

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.250
as soon as possible?

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:49.030
And so that's why
this year we made it

00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.960
so that you can now sign up to
receive these alerts via email

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.570
so that you find out right
away and can fix the problem

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:56.410
before more users
have a bad experience.

00:30:58.347 --> 00:31:00.680
So once you understand kind
of how your app is generally

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.679
doing, you want to start
looking inside your app

00:31:02.679 --> 00:31:04.800
and see what users
are doing inside.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.610
And so Google Analytics is a
really easy way to do this.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.170
And it also allows you to
compare behavior and see

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:15.030
how users move between the web
and also different mobile apps,

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:17.460
even on cross-platforms
outside of Android.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:22.430
So Google Analytics is actually
available through Google Play

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:23.440
Services.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.920
So this has a few benefits.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.465
First of all, you don't have
to add another SDK to your APK

00:31:28.465 --> 00:31:30.030
and bloat its size.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.927
You only have to add
a few lines of code.

00:31:31.927 --> 00:31:33.760
And it also comes for
free if you're already

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.320
using AdMob in your app.

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:39.210
And so once you
understand what users

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:40.660
are doing inside your
app, the next step

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.243
is to start running
experiments to see

00:31:42.243 --> 00:31:46.490
how you can get users to engage
more, spend more, and have more

00:31:46.490 --> 00:31:47.230
fun.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.035
So Google Tag Manager is an
easy way of running experiments.

00:31:50.035 --> 00:31:52.340
And it integrates
with Google Analytics.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.817
So the idea is that you set
up a goal-- maybe the amount

00:31:54.817 --> 00:31:57.150
of money that a user spends,
or maybe the amount of time

00:31:57.150 --> 00:32:00.280
that a user spends in an app,
or the number of videos watched.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.880
And then you set up multiple
versions of your app.

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.390
Maybe one version has
a the blue background,

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:06.490
one has a red background.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.570
Or maybe it's more
sophisticated than that.

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:11.030
And then you say, optimize
these different versions

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.090
towards the goal.

00:32:12.090 --> 00:32:14.372
So over time, it'll run
these different versions,

00:32:14.372 --> 00:32:16.330
see what the user behavior
is towards the goal,

00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:18.830
and automatically move
users over to whatever

00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:19.880
version ends up winning.

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:21.330
So it's a really
easy way to make sure

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:23.550
that you have an optimal
experience inside your app.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:27.260
So another question
we get from developers

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.550
a lot is, how can I understand
the whole conversion funnel?

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.920
If I'm running a particular
marketing campaign,

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:36.750
how do I understand how many
people are looking at my app

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:39.000
in the Play Store, how many
people are installing it,

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.200
and then how many people
are actually running it?

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:44.040
So last year, we announced
the Google Play Referral Flow

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:44.540
Report.

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.650
This is available
in Google Analytics.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.930
And so it helps you
do exactly that.

00:32:48.930 --> 00:32:51.290
And the purpose here is to
be able to understand which

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:53.140
user acquisition
channels-- like maybe which

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:56.270
ad campaigns or other
things-- are most effective.

00:32:56.270 --> 00:32:59.699
Because again, you might
have some installs happening,

00:32:59.699 --> 00:33:01.490
but you really care
about which users go on

00:33:01.490 --> 00:33:02.710
to become users of the app.

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.490
So we've seen now, as
developers are becoming

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:11.240
more sophisticated in
how the currency of apps

00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.880
is really engagement over the
long term rather than just

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.110
a one-time install,
developers are focusing more

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.200
on tracking the most
meaningful segments of users,

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.510
whatever users are most
engaged with their business.

00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:25.520
So for example,
if I had a game, I

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.040
would be able to use Google
Analytics to track user

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.816
segments to maybe
say, let me look

00:33:29.816 --> 00:33:31.815
at users who came in
through a certain campaign.

00:33:32.872 --> 00:33:34.830
Maybe they've gotten to
level seven in my game,

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:36.210
and they've spent more than $5.

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.880
OK, and then one of the things
we've seen on businesses

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.410
is that more and
more developers are

00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:52.616
running hugely successful, very
profitable businesses on Play.

00:33:52.616 --> 00:33:53.990
And we're trying
to do everything

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:56.970
that we can to scale their
expertise to everybody,

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.159
and to make it easier to
measure your businesses,

00:33:59.159 --> 00:34:01.450
whether you're a small startup
or a much larger company

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:03.020
with a dedicated analytics team.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.780
So we offer the Google
Play Revenue Report,

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.010
which offers not only
your total revenue,

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.100
but has been recently
updated to include

00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:13.949
the average revenue per paying
user, the number of buyers.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:15.550
And you can even
see easy breakdowns

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.360
by different countries.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.139
So you can see how your
business is growing

00:34:18.139 --> 00:34:19.680
into each of those
different markets.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:27.540
In response to feedback from
a bunch of our developers

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.679
who had a lot of apps
or published their apps

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:32.239
in a lot of
countries, we're also

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:33.934
offering the developer
publishing API.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.040
So if you're a developer
with, let's say,

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.219
100 apps, and each of those
apps is offered in 50 languages,

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:42.770
and you've uploaded
all of the text,

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:45.050
and all of the
tablet screenshots,

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.500
and all the banners, for all
those different languages,

00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.335
it becomes kind of a
multiplicative problem.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.290
And so we thought, we
can do better than that.

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:56.420
So we now have an API that you
can use to manage your APKs,

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.582
the text for your store
listing, the graphics

00:34:58.582 --> 00:34:59.540
for your store listing.

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:02.850
And you can also manage
your in-app product

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.560
catalog and alpha
and beta tests.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.930
You're able to integrate this
with whatever build system

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:11.120
that your company
has so that you

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.320
can take those assets directly
from where they are already

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.750
on your servers and in
your development process

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.960
and push them directly
into the Developer Console

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:22.070
and into Google Play without
a bunch of copy and paste.

00:35:22.070 --> 00:35:24.840
So if you have a really
big operation like this,

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.577
we definitely recommend
that you check this out,

00:35:27.577 --> 00:35:29.660
although we definitely
want to see you coming back

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.450
to the Developer Console to
get a lot more of the analytics

00:35:32.450 --> 00:35:34.520
and insights and see
how your app is doing.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:40.540
OK, so today, we had
an overview of how

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:42.900
we can make our app
more successful,

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:45.810
and how to build high quality
across all the different stages

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.720
of the software
development process.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.850
So in the area of design, we
looked into material design

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.050
and how to adapt to new devices.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:54.730
We looked then at development.

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.990
We talked about how
the L release offers

00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:59.956
some new, beautiful
experiences for users

00:35:59.956 --> 00:36:01.830
and what you'll need to
do to update your app

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.450
to make it ready for L.

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.440
There's new tools
available at Android Studio

00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:06.840
to help you do that.

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:09.410
And also, if you're looking
at building a lot of success

00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:13.350
in emerging markets, Android
One and network and battery

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.120
optimizations are
a great way to go.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:18.120
And then finally, we looked
at how you can make sure

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.810
your app is high
quality as you get

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:21.880
started in distribution
through beta testing

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.430
and staged rollouts.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.710
And then we also looked at
how to bring more analytics

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:28.630
and insight into your users
through the optimization tips

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:30.720
and Google Analytics
integration.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:34.280
So I hope that this will
be a good day for you

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.690
as we go on into later
sessions to understand more

00:36:36.690 --> 00:36:38.510
about business and localization.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.680
And thanks again for
being part of Google Play.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.504
When someone gets a
new device, yes, they

00:36:45.504 --> 00:36:46.420
want to have a device.

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:47.950
But what they really
are looking for

00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:50.710
is great software,
great apps that

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:52.390
really bring the device to life.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:55.220
So thanks again for building
such fantastic, beautiful,

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.331
high-quality apps.

00:36:56.331 --> 00:36:58.080
And we wish you luck
with material design,

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.810
and the L, and all the
next chapters on Play.

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.360
Thanks.
