00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.810
&gt;&gt; Okay, so, inspired by 20 questions let's try to write down

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.000
exactly what it is that you did in going through your 20

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.690
questions to get your answer to discover Michael Jackson was the person

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.950
I was thinking about. So, what is the very first thing you did?

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.040
&gt;&gt; I tried to imagine a bunch of possible

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.020
answers that you could be, could have in mind.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.790
And, I tried to think of a question that

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.050
would help separate them into two roughly equal chunks.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.582
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what's the way of putting that in the

00:00:28.582 --> 00:00:30.700
language that we've been using for

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.630
supervised learning and classification so far?

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.420
&gt;&gt; Oh I see. So if I had known in advance, here's here's 200 things that

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.248
you might ask me about. And what their,

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:43.010
what their attribute values are. What would be a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.450
question that would split that set in half,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.240
right? So, instead of just imagining a bunch of

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.220
things, if I actually had a list, which I do in the case of a training set.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.090
&gt;&gt; Alright,

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.820
so the first thing you did is you picked the best

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.850
attribute that you could think of. And, by the way, you said

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.830
something very particular here. You actually defined what best is. You said,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.850
that best is the same thing as splitting things roughly in half.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.310
So let's revisit that in a moment. Okay, so the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.735
first thing you did is you picked the best atribute. You

00:01:14.735 --> 00:01:19.130
asked a question about it and then, depending upon the answer,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.470
you went and picked another attribute right? Does that seem fair

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.100
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.010
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.950
So, we think about decision trees, a way of talking about that is that

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:40.530
you follow the path of the answer, and then lather, rinse and repeat. [LAUGH].

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.770
You went back and pick the best attribute, asked the question, followed the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.520
answer path, so on, and so on, and you kept doing that until what?

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.950
&gt;&gt; Until, I narrowed the space of possibilities to,

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.470
in this case, just one item.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.280
&gt;&gt; Right, so until you got to the answer. All right.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.600
And that is an algorithm. So you pick the best attribute,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.770
and you actually define what best attribute was. You want to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.270
pick one that would somehow eliminate at least half of the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.710
things which you might worry about and keep the other half

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:15.840
in play. You asked a specific question. You followed the path

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.850
to that and then you went back and you picked another

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.170
attribute and so on and so forth until you got an answer

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.120
that you wanted to. That's an algorithm and that's an

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.330
algorithm that we might use to actually build a decision tree.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.300
And the only difference between what you did and what you

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.540
would do with learning a decision a tree is that, since

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.620
you don't know in advance what the answer actually is going

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.030
to be, because you don't know what specific object I might

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.460
be thinking of, you have to actually follow all possible paths

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.600
at each time and think of all possible best next attributes

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.850
until you completely can answer any question. Does that make sense?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.380
&gt;&gt; I see. So, right, so instead of

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.700
just playing the game interactively, I kind of

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.640
imagine all possible ways it could go and

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.500
build that whole flow chart, that whole tree.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.010
&gt;&gt; Right, so, let's see if we can do that with some pictures

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.500
and I actually want to decide rather I really believe your definition of best.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.410
Okay?

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.770
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.640
&gt;&gt; Alright, so, let's do that.
