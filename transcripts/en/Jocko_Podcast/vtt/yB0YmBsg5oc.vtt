1
00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:04.620
I'm a young warehouse manager that takes ownership for anything and everything

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.640
that goes wrong.
This seems to offend by coworkers.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.890
How can I fix it?
Um,
okay.

4
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.870
Classic Dichotomy.
Leadership question right there.
You've gone too far.

5
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.670
That's what's happened.
You've gone too far.
So what you have to be do,

6
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:28.200
what you have to do is don't be offensive.
When you take ownership,

7
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.890
when you take ownership,
you can't be offensive.

8
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.980
When you take ownership.
Some people get offended by that.
So when you say,
Hey,

9
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.890
you know what?
This is mine,
I got this.
That bothers some people

10
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.470
when you say,
you know what,
this is my fault.
I'm going to fix it.

11
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.420
That even that offend some people.
What the tone?
Just the tone of like,

12
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.190
no,
this is my fault.
I got this.
And you do that three dot three times,
four times,

13
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:57.900
five times and all of a sudden because,
oh,
what?

14
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.600
Everything's his fault now as he's got to fix everything they,

15
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:04.380
he doesn't think I can fix it.
You can offend people with,
with,

16
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.550
with all kinds of stuff.
You don't have to work very hard to offend people.

17
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.310
I mean there's people get offended when you say something nice to them,

18
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.770
you know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
I was watching,
uh,

19
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:18.743
I met,

20
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.180
I met the University of the yoga dude that does like yoga videos.

21
00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:26.460
He's got red hair.
His name's spears.
Yeah.

22
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.680
I met him just randomly getting off a plane.
But he's,
he what?
I,

23
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.750
I've spears or Sears?
Sears,
I think it's Sears.
Maybe speak what I say spears.

24
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.160
I don't know.
I know the guy though.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

25
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:47.460
Very funny guy.
Very cool guy.
And I was,
once I met him,
I was laughing.

26
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:49.710
I was checking out a couple of videos,
but one of them was,

27
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.800
you know how to be offended at all things and it's,
it's,

28
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.600
it's hilarious because that's exactly what people do.

29
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.140
People,
some people can get offended by anything.
Yeah.

30
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.210
So that's what you've got to watch out for it.

31
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.120
Even when you're taking ownership,

32
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.740
people can actually be offended by that if you go too far.

33
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.970
So instead of overtly stepping up and taking ownership in this particular case,

34
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.010
then you can tell what's going on here.
My brother here,
young warehouse manager,

35
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.530
he's fired up.
He wants to make things happen.

36
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.640
He wants to get after it and so what does he do?
He's like,
Oh,

37
00:02:26.641 --> 00:02:28.500
I read extreme ownership.
I'm going to take ownership of everything.

38
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:32.010
And that's a great attitude to have except for you can offend people when you go

39
00:02:32.011 --> 00:02:32.490
too far,

40
00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.370
cause you've got to read the second book that I got into leadership so that you

41
00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:39.210
can,
you can balance that out a little bit.
So instead of saying like,
Hey,

42
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.430
this is mine,
I'm going to take ownership of this and make it happen.

43
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.750
Instead you look at someone,
you say,
Hey,
you know what?

44
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.140
Do you want me to take care of this?
Oh Hey,
you know what?

45
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:51.420
That's probably in my department.
You want me to take care of that?

46
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.900
So that way or like,
hey,

47
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:57.080
it seems like this should be something I should take care of.

48
00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.420
You want me to handle that instead of me,
me,
me,
me.

49
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.200
I got asked a question the other day at a Q and a in the court.

50
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.250
The question started off with the person started the question with,

51
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.770
I've got the moat,
what was it?

52
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.880
I've got the question that everyone in here needs answered.
So,
so,

53
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:19.600
so out of the gate I was like,
okay,
so we have a situation here,
right?

54
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.500
Because that immediately tells you that in that person's head they've got,

55
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.120
they've got the question that everyone needs answering.

56
00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.880
So there's already an ego scenario happening like out of the gate.

57
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.280
So same thing here.
You don't know if you're going to touch someone's Egos,
right?

58
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.160
So when you say,
look,
this is my ideal and I'm going to fix it.

59
00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.860
Like some people will take offense to that.
So again,

60
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:46.540
you soften those a little bit.
Try and give credit up the chain of command,

61
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.330
right?
Try and give it credit down the chain of command.

62
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.420
Instead of all take ownership.
It's like,
hey,
we got,

63
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.080
what if you say we win when credit gets doled out,

64
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.830
get past that credit on,
pass it to your peers passage,
your subordinates,

65
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:04.180
pass it to your boss.
So that's it.

66
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.200
Take ownership.
What you need to do at this point,
young man,

67
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.150
is take ownership of being offensive you.
And when you do that,

68
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.900
you're going to be less offensive.
If you're going to be milk more covert.
Hey,

69
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.620
guess what?
Remember I said earlier,
like you don't get to pick the boss.
You,

70
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.640
you don't get to pick your boss,
you,

71
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.540
but you get to pick the relationship you have with them.

72
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.870
You don't get to pick your,
your peers.
You don't get to pick your subordinates.

73
00:04:28.871 --> 00:04:33.630
You get your team,
hey,
can you pick them?
Yes,

74
00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:35.700
you can quit your job.
Can you hire the right people?
Yes you can,

75
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.220
but look what you got is what you've got.
You've got to work with it.

76
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.340
You don't everyone up,
man.
I wish everyone was more fired up.
Like I am.
Like,

77
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.170
that's not gonna go.
Well,
you know it does.
It's great that you wish that,
yeah,

78
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.290
that's not going to go well.

79
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.920
What you have to do is you gotta you gotta you gotta.

80
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:58.980
Here's another one.
This is similar,
right?
Millennials.

81
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.320
Well,
Hey,
one of the things that,
what are the things,
this is a very simple,

82
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.801
you know,
I've done,

83
00:05:04.801 --> 00:05:07.770
I've done the millennium questions a thousand times and you know,

84
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.770
the Vietnam veterans,
the Vietnam draft,
these compared to them like,
hey,

85
00:05:10.771 --> 00:05:14.040
we can talk about that again.
We don't need to.
But if you've got a,

86
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.720
if you're in charge of millennials and you think to yourself,

87
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.320
millennials thinks everything's,
they think everything centers around them.

88
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.590
What do you do as a leader?
You know what I do as leader?

89
00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:29.010
I make everything centered around them and they perform and then they get after

90
00:05:29.011 --> 00:05:31.770
it.
And as they grow up,
they learn that everything doesn't send around them.

91
00:05:31.771 --> 00:05:35.160
But I bring them there.
Why?
Because I formed a relationship.
Why?

92
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:38.030
Because I listened to him.
Why?
Because I understand them.
Hm.
Hm.

93
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.380
So you don't get the team that you want.
You don't get the boss that you want.

94
00:05:43.381 --> 00:05:47.160
What you do is you play the game up and down the chain of command and form

95
00:05:47.161 --> 00:05:50.370
relationships up and down the chain of command that you want.

96
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.850
What relationships do you want from up the chain of command?

97
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:55.890
You want them to listen to you.
You want them to give you what you need.

98
00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.510
Do you want them to get out of way and let you do the mission?

99
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.110
What about down the chain of command?
You want them to support what's happening.

100
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.900
You want them to get after their job.
You want them to step up and lead.

101
00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:07.603
That's what you want.

102
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.130
If you have an antagonistic relationship because your millennials think

103
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.500
everything's about them,
well then guess what?

104
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.530
You're not going to be able to have any influence on them.
Any real influence.

105
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:20.540
You can have the imposed will on them,

106
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.690
but the imposed will is a is a paper tiger,
right?

107
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.710
It's not real.
It only lasts when you're there and guess what they're doing.

108
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:31.730
They're looking for another job.

109
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:39.440
So take ownership of being offensive and be less offensive and more covert and

110
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:40.370
can,
you know what bro?

111
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.410
Young warehouse manager keep getting after it and it will pay off and the fact

112
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:47.540
that you're fired up and you're crushing it,

113
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.980
crushing it with a little bit more tact and you're going to one day you're going

114
00:06:51.981 --> 00:06:53.790
to be making it happen.
Yeah.

115
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.610
We got time for one more question.
Yeah.
Yeah.

116
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.140
<v 1>To add though,
a little tip,
I think that,
I think you taught this too actually.</v>

117
00:07:03.141 --> 00:07:07.910
I realized this one I embraced extreme ownership.
You can't say,
Hey,

118
00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:11.270
I'm going to take extreme ownership of this.
Like it's,
it's one of those things,

119
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:13.190
it's like just like taking the high ground,
right?

120
00:07:13.191 --> 00:07:16.220
You get in like a thing with somebody.
You can't say,

121
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.580
I'm going to try to take the high ground and then it doesn't work like that.

122
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:22.070
Like it really just gave up the high ground when you announced that you were

123
00:07:22.071 --> 00:07:23.720
taking the higher ground,
gave it up.
Exactly right.

124
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.550
Same thing with extreme ownership like in this situation.

125
00:07:26.551 --> 00:07:29.960
So if you're a very good point thing is I get it man,
when you're like,
you know,

126
00:07:29.961 --> 00:07:31.160
I'm taking,
and he even said,

127
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:33.950
I take ownership of anything and everything that goes wrong.

128
00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.580
Anything like straight up,
he's your guy.
Right?
Solely it might indicate,

129
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:41.150
I'm not saying he's doing this,
but he could be going,
hey guys,
no worries.

130
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.640
I'm taking extreme ownership of this situation.
You know,

131
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:46.850
like if you say that kind of stuff.
Yeah,
I could see that would rub some.

132
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:51.350
<v 0>What's odd,
and this is a very good thing to understand about human nature.</v>

133
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.490
Everyone's jealous of you.
Everyone's jealous of each other.

134
00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.870
Everyone's jealous of everyone else.
No one wants you to win.
Right.

135
00:07:59.871 --> 00:08:00.680
It's just like,

136
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.680
so when this guy is stepping up and the crowd starts to pick at them,

137
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.000
they start to pick at them and they want to pick them.

138
00:08:08.001 --> 00:08:09.420
They want to pull them apart.
Yeah.

139
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.400
That's generally what the crowd wants to do to you.
When you step up,

140
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:14.750
when you elevate yourself,

141
00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.930
generally the crowd wants to pick it you and pull you back down.

142
00:08:17.931 --> 00:08:22.250
Does he think he is?
Yeah,
exactly.
Exactly.
So if you're aware of that,

143
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.580
then you can combat it by when instead of elevating yourself in an overt manner

144
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:30.350
where everyone can see you saying,

145
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.010
I'm going to take ownership this right now and get it solved.
No,

146
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.490
you sit back and say,
hey,
you know what?
This is probably my fault.

147
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:40.250
Do you want me to let me,
let me try and take some time to get it fixed?

148
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.640
Everyone goes there actually kind of happy.
They're like,
yeah,
it was your fault.

149
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:46.010
They kind of,
they're kind of like,
it's okay with them,

150
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.420
whereas opposed to I'm going to take ownership and there's this dichotomy.

151
00:08:50.421 --> 00:08:54.020
Leadership.
You read extreme ownership.
Awesome.
You gotta read dichotomy too.
