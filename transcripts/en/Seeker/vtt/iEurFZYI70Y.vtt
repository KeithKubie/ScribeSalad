00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.239
There’s one big difference between humans
and animals.

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:05.580
No, it’s not our brains.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.580
Think lower.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:07.580
Much lower.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.129
Nope, the other side.

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.879
Butts.

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.400
Bonjour callipygian cuties, Jules here for
DNews.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.680
As the contemporary poet, Anthony Ray once
said: “I like big butts and I cannot lie”.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.730
But Mr. Mix-A-Lot never quite delineates why
he is such a proponent of the posterior, and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.340
personally, I think it has to do why we have
butts in the first place.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.090
Almost every single multicellular organism
does have some sort of “anus”, that is,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.720
an area where waste is excreted.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.780
But butts themselves, specifically the big
meaty, fatty bits that hang out in the back,

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.420
those are pretty special, and the human booty
is different than any other in the animal

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.420
kingdom.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.150
Even when we look at our closest genetic neighbors,
bonobos and chimpanzees, their butts are,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.070
what we in the scientific community call “puny”.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.850
For a while, researchers have tried to figure
out: why did humans, specifically, evolve

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.450
to have such big booties?

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.030
To find out, let’s take a look at what a
butt actually is.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.700
The most important and visible part is the
Gluteus Maximus, one of three gluteal muscles,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.450
including the gluteus medius and minimus.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.960
Their primary existence is to provide extension
for the hip and thigh, allowing us to bend

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.250
over while also keeping everything securely
in place.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.250
Standing up, walking up stairs, and even standing
still are all extremely dependent on the gluteal

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.250
muscles.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.780
Just like humans, all primates have the same
three gluteal muscles.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.890
On chimps, the gluteus maximus connects to
the ischium, the lower portion of the pelvis.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.440
This relatively short and tight muscle makes
it easier for chimps to stick their butts

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.650
out, which is really useful for maneuvering
up a tree.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.240
But humans aren’t as interested in climbing
trees; unlike our genetic ancestors, we’re

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.820
a bit more preoccupied with staying on two
legs, and anthropologists believe that may

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.830
be the key to our badonks.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.360
On humans, the gluteus maximus attaches to
a part of the hip called the “ilium”,

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.270
which is the highest and largest bone of the
pelvis.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.369
This relatively high placement allows for
trunk stability, since the amount of area

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.150
it covers, and the size of the muscle itself
keeps us balanced.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.950
Most researchers believe that we have big
butts because it helps us stay upright, and

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.870
it helps balance us when running.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.110
But now another question emerges: which came
first?

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.740
Were we first sprung, that is, upright, or
was there a round thing in our face?

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.200
Well, in 2002, a paper in the journal Human
Evolution used an evolutionary simulator to

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.120
reveal how changes in the shape of our bones
affected our muscles.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.260
The computer model showed early hominids would
have HAD to start walking upright BEFORE developing

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.390
large butts.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.050
If the butts had developed first, it would
have been more difficult for apes to walk

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.050
upright.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.349
The paper concluded that our big butts are
actually a consequence of walking on two feet.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.190
This means that early human-primates first
had some incentive to walk upright before

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.480
their bodies could evolve to catch up, at
the divergence of chimps and humans around

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.450
5 to 7 million years ago.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.940
Long story short: we have big butts so we
can walk upright.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.360
Also for twerking.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.090
Butts are great for standing, but they’re
also good for sitting and binge watching your

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.740
favorite shows - I like How It’s Made.

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.370

other Science Channel shows on the Science

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.360
So why exactly did we develop the ability
to walk upright in the first place?

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.670
And why do baby humans take SO long to start
walking compared to our animal counterparts?

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:45.800
Find out answers to both, and more, in this
episode of DNews!

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:54.489
