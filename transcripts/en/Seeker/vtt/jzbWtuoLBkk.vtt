00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:11.020
You might see the world in terms of black
and white, but HOW black and HOW white?

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.620
Howdy friends, Trace here for DNews, thanks
for tuning in!

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.460
You probably remember from grade school that
black paint is a mixture of all the colors…

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.840
red, yellow, blue, green, orange, and purple
equals black.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.120
White paint though, is a little more technical.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.359
It's made using a variety of natural materials
like chalk or lime dust mixed with viscous

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.359
liquid.

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.610
But the mistake comes when assuming we've
made the whitest white or the blackest black

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.300
around -- we haven't!

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300
Until now.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.559
The scales of the cyphochilus beetle from
South-East Asia reflect more light than a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.409
piece of white paper due to specialized ultra-thin
scales that cover its beetley-body.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:51.549
In fact, according to research in Scientific
Reports, this beetle is the whitest thing

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:53.030
in nature!

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.949
The beetle's scales are made of chitin -- found
throughout the animal kingdom in exoskeletons

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.920
and shells, it's similar to cellulose.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.580
The chitin scales are only a few nanometers
thick, which is beyond our comprehension to

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.580
make.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.690
They're so complex, they reflect the maximum
amount of white with the most minimum material!

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.280
Thin and light is important for flying insects,
but difficult for manufacturing, for now.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.860
Exploring these scales might help humans make
a biomimetic copy, creating brighter papers,

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.280
plastics, paints and more reflective display
materials for computing making more with less!

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.530
Light reflection and absorption is big business
in space technology too.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.310
Black paint is black because it absorbs all
the light shone on it.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.880
Most black paint isn't very good, reflecting
about two and a half percent of the light

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.570
shone on it, but SUPER black materials, they
reflect only half-a-percent of light, or less!!

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.820
IT'S SO BLACK!

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.940
It reflects so much light that you can't even
SEE it when it's folded!

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.600
Look at this pictur[a][b]e, see those four
rectangles that look like holes in the frame?

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.660
THAT'S CALLED "SUPER BLACK!"

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.830
I know it sounds like a 1970s film, but it's
not…

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.020
Super black is so dark that even in this well-lit
photo it just looks like a hole!

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.509
It's made of carbon nanotubes arranged on
an adhesive material and titanium, ideal for

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.040
use in space; again it's lightweight and strong,
not unlike chitin.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.480
The tubes are a few nanometers in diameter,
and are grown in an arrangement sort of like

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.499
a shag carpet.

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:24.870
The web of tiny nanotubes traps light absorbing
10 times the energy of their normal black

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.870
coating.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.880
NASA created the material for use in the space
program to coat cameras and absorb stray light

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.319
that can bounce off the satellite and mess
up cameras or other optics.

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.209
Sometimes, the source of light in space is
so faint, any unwanted light can mess up a

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.209
whole mission!

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.489
They've sent it to the ISS for testing -- space
is pretty harsh with the temperature changes,

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.420
radiation and energy particles -- but if it
performs well, they'll use it for future sensor

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.420
missions.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.909
As technology improves, the whitest and blackest
materials are getting better by tiny fractions,

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.860
but each step can provide a benefit in any
number of industries!

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.810
There's already a company in the UK that's
created something even BLACKER than SUPER

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.810
BLACK!

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.810
What do you think of technology like this?

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:06.810
Awesome or a waste of time?

opinions, check out my new show TestTube!

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:15.790
In this episode we're exploring the politics
of why the US and China are competing over

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.829
Africa.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.659
It's SUPER interesting.
