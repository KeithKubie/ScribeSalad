00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.432
There are three main
communication skills

00:00:07.432 --> 00:00:09.640
that students will learn
through the process of doing

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.650
lab work in Junior Lab.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.357
The main one is doing
oral presentations,

00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:17.815
the type of talks that somebody
would give at a conference.

00:00:17.815 --> 00:00:21.550
A typically 12 to 15 minute
type, professional level

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.790
talk, with some sort of--
usually with electronic slides,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.560
like a PowerPoint or
something like that.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.050
The second one is
we write papers.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.560
They write papers in the
style of the Physical Review

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.500
Letters, which is more or less
the most important journal

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.550
in physics.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.200
It's a very constrained format.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.080
It's a maximum of four
pages, two columns.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.240
It's written for a generalist
physicist audience.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.330
So it's somebody who's
your professional peer,

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.200
but may not be working in
your direct research field.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.040
So writing a Physical
Review letter is a--

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.719
it's a challenge both as a
writer and as a researcher.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.260
So the students get
a lot of practice

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.569
in that over the course of 8.13.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:06.940
The third mode of
communication which students

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.850
will get a lot of practice
with in the course of doing

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.440
lab work in 8.13 is just
communicating with a peer.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.360
Working as part of
a team, learning

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.740
to listen to what
your partner is saying

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.890
and understand what
they mean by that.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.800
Learning to be patient
with people, learning

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.950
to explain yourself in
live time with somebody

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.640
that you're trying to cooperate
with to achieve some goal.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.380
Having to make decisions.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.570
Having to negotiate
decisions, when

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.910
you think the most important
measurement to make is this

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.285
and your partner thinks the
important measurement to make

00:01:42.285 --> 00:01:43.300
is that.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.820
Working through those sort
of interpersonal types

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.500
of communication.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.090
They get lots of
practice for that,

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.180
whether they like it or not.
