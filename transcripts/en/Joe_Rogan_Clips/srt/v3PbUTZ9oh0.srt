1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,450
There's a sense in which as
we create those environments,

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,080
we actually change ourselves as a species.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,940
There's this a set of ideas that's known
as gene culture coevolution and the

4
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,790
idea is that we create certain
kinds of cultural environments.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,870
Those kinds of cultural environments
advantage certain ones of us making those

6
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,790
of us that are born with
certain abilities better off,

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,820
which then leads to those
environments being created even more.

8
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,410
Let me give you some eggs,
an example of that.

9
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:32,100
The most famous example of this is
something known as lactase persistence.

10
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,990
So many people,

11
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:38,250
not about half the world can adults can
drink milk and the other half cannot.

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,720
They get lactose intolerant. Well,
why can you drink milk as an adult?

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,970
Have you ever thought about that?
Like why?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,840
Why are you capable of drinking milk
as and adult? In our ancestral state,

15
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,940
actually up til about 10,000 years ago,

16
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,870
only babies could address to digest
milk because only babies had milk.

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,810
Babies would suckle at their mother's
breast and have milk and then they'd be

18
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:01,680
weaned and then they would never drink
milk again. There'd be no milk to drink.

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,060
There was therefore no reason for any
adult to be able to digest lactose,

20
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:10,560
which is the principle sugar in milk
because there was no lactose in your diet.

21
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,790
It didn't encounter milk,

22
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:15,210
so human beings were able to digest
lactose when they were babies.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,580
They lost that capacity.
All human beings,

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,370
when they got to about two or three
or four or five, when they wean,

25
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,890
they no longer were able to just
milk to the enzymes in their body.

26
00:01:22,891 --> 00:01:27,720
We're programmed as it were, to only
work when they were infants. Well,

27
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,580
about between three and 9,000 years
ago in multiple places in Africa and in

28
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:35,580
Europe,
human beings suddenly domesticate animals.

29
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:40,710
We domesticate milk producing animals like
cattle and sheep and goats and camels,

30
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,940
and now all of a sudden there's a
supply of milk around us because of our

31
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:47,430
cultural innovation,
because of the thing we invented,

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,500
we created the domestic
breeds. Now we have milk. Now,

33
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:54,420
therefore those among us who are mutants,

34
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:57,690
who are born with the
ability to have our lactase,

35
00:01:57,691 --> 00:02:01,080
the enzyme that to just
lactose persist into adulthood.

36
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,820
This is known as lactase persistence.

37
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,860
Those of us who had that would have a
survival advantage because we could have

38
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,800
another source of calories that the
rest of the people in our group couldn't

39
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:12,870
consume that couldn't
drink milk like we could.

40
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,590
And we had a source of unspoiled
water during times of drought.

41
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,640
We could drink milk.

42
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,730
Everyone else had to drink this filthy
water that they didn't have access to.

43
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,940
So those among us who had these qualities
could reproduce better survive at a

44
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,830
survival advantage. It turns out
that this has happened several times.

45
00:02:28,831 --> 00:02:29,940
This is when well documented.

46
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,520
The genetics of this has all been worked
out several times in the last three to

47
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:36,420
9,000 years because of a
human cultural product.

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,200
We have evolved to be a slightly different
genetically and it doesn't stop with

49
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,403
cows.

50
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,130
I think that when we invent cities about,
uh,

51
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,560
over 5,000 years ago, we, so we did, we
invent agriculture about 10,000 years ago.

52
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,330
It's debated exactly
when we invent cities,

53
00:02:54,331 --> 00:02:57,030
but between five and 10,000 years ago,
we started having fixed settlements.

54
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,950
Earlier you and I were talking about
population density and having to live with

55
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:02,170
other people,
which is not our ancestral state,

56
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,440
not packed and not with other people.
We always lived as a group, as socially.

57
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,780
I think that as we invent cities,

58
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,800
people with different kinds of brains
are better able to survive in cities.

59
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:16,540
So now that we've invented cities where
advantaging people with certain kinds of

60
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,560
brains, and therefore I think in
a thousand or 2000 or 5,000 years,

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,060
just like the milk example,

62
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:26,350
there'll be different people as a result
of something we humans manufactured

63
00:03:26,351 --> 00:03:30,880
that we made. And I could keep giving you
examples of this. There's a, in the book,

64
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:34,390
I have an example, another example of
a, they're called the sea nomads. They,

65
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,920
they live in the Philippines. These
are people who, uh, don't live on land.

66
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,430
They live on houseboats that sail around
the Pacific for thousands of years.

67
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:46,030
They've had this lifestyle and
they die for their food dive.

68
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,350
So they forage on the seabed.
They are the world's best free divers.

69
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,640
They spend hours per day underwater.

70
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,800
They can hold their breath longer than
anyone else. Uh, and they, they do do it.

71
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,410
Nothing except with
weights and wooden goggles.

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,470
They dive down into the seabed
and forage and they hunt.

73
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,250
They hunt underwater with spears.
Okay.

74
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,720
They hunt underwater would spirits.
It's mind boggling. Wow. And, uh,

75
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:13,480
but they, uh, have evolved,

76
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:16,600
have different spleens and different
oxygen metabolism than you and I

77
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,920
[inaudible] so those,
among them that could survive the dives,

78
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,170
fed their families,
made more babies.

79
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:26,770
And now we think this happened 2000
years ago. There are different,

80
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:29,050
the ones that couldn't died.

81
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,590
So their invention of a
seafaring way of life,

82
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,570
their invention of a way of living at sea,
the boat technology,

83
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,240
the spear fishing technology,

84
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,960
the intervention of those
technologies creates an environment,

85
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,940
cultural environment around them,

86
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,890
which modifies natural
selection and changes the kind
of genes that those people

87
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:51,130
have.
