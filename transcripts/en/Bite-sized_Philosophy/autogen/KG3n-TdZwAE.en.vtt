00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 The concept is that if you sink into a chaotic state of being, and everything falls apart, 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.500
 then there is the possibility that you can get things back on track, 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 including what you have just learned, 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.700
 in a new capacity. 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:31.280
 You can imagine that symbolically as the existence of the deceased father at the bottom of the Landscape of Chaos, 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.480
 That is the right way, as far as I am aware, to think about it. 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.000
 It is as if there is something down there that has the capacity to recover and rise again. 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.500
 It is as if this entity incorporates the previous state of affairs and takes it further. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 And you will not find that unless you descend to the chaotic valley, 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.780
 where the feeling comes over you that all order is gone. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.620
 If you generate order, it will be similar to the order you had before 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.700
 but it will also have new aspects. 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.800
 It is ergo: 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.600
 down to the bottom of the chaotic permutation of circumstances to bring up what you miss. 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.700
 And that is one analytical level. 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.200
 You think: a different analytical level ... 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.700
 That is also what you do ... 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.700
 What you should do when you are in college ... 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.080
 You come to the university in roughly the same capacity as Pinocchio; 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.600
 you're a bit of a puppet, and kind of a minkukel, 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.620
 and what the hell do you know? 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.500
 It is chaotic because you have not yet completely found your place in the world. 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
 And I don't just mean career, 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.600
 - not that it is completely irrelevant, because it is indeed important - 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.960
 but it is more important than just the fact that you have not yet achieved a career; 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.620
 since you are a historical creature, for you are a result of history. 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.300
 Unless you are properly cultured, 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.700
 which means that you have a deep understanding of your past, 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.540
 in the sense that the humanities can arm you with that understanding, 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:02:01.060
 then you have failed to incorporate the wisdom of your ancestors into your daily activities. 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.420
 And that is going to make you weak. 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 At least that's the idea. 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.560
 So when you come to college ... 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.400
 This is the purpose of the university: 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.580
 it exists so that you can throw yourself in the chaos and extrapolate something valuable from it. 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.020
 And you can incorporate that into your own personality, 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.720
 and that makes you immensely more unruly. 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.300
 "More unmanageable" than in literally more uncomfortable, not simply "higher educated". 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.080
 It is not that you know more facts, it is that you are literally a better person. 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.380
 'Better' means: you can do many more things, you can articulate yourself better ... 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.680
 That is something that is crucial, that you can properly articulate yourself. 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.260
 That is more convenient than anything that you could possibly achieve. 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.300
 If you have earned your Bachelor / Master, 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:49.240
 with the skills to formulate coherent arguments and use language correctly, 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.160
 then you own the toolbox to be so influential that it is bizarre. 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.100
 Regardless of the circumstances ... 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.200
 You can always prepare a strategy and execute it successfully. 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.640
 And perhaps the strategy is oriented towards something good, something that will seriously work. 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.800
 Work for you and at the same time work for others. 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.840
 I don't really understand why this is not being told to people when they come to college. 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.560
 Your goal is to make yourself as eloquent in writing, and thinking, and speaking as you can. 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.560
 Because that opens the door to everything you want to do in the future, regardless of what it is. 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.140
 The better-discussed individual always rises up. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.860
 Always. 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.000
 Because ... that visualizes strategies more effectively, 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.600
 it deconstructs the reasons for doing something or not in a more specific way, 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.600
 it convinces people. 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.000
 Moreover, it does not convince people thoroughly. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.900
 He can effectively deal with potential that lies in the perspective. 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.640
 He can defend himself against criticism. 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:03.580
 That all goes to the past - to the chaos of the past, you could even say - 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.600
 and it pulls the Esprit that lives in it up from the bottom, and becomes one with it. 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.000
 And if you don't ... Well ... 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.500
 then you stand powerless against the Tragedy of Life. 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.340
 And that is not so good, because if powerless is confronted with the Tragedy of Life, 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.400
 then you will be harmed much more than you would have if it had turned out differently, 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.260
 and ditto for the people around you. 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.900
 And then the probability that you will be resentful and bitter about it is very high, 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.560
 because nobody likes to fail successively. 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.800
 And then you become bitter and resentful. 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:46.000
 From the moment you are bitter and resentful, the next step is to be revengeful and mean. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.520
 It does not require much transformation to move from one phase to the next.
