00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.080
As an actor, I get scripts

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.176
and it's my job to stay on script,

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.816
to say my lines

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.640
and bring to life a character
that someone else wrote.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.256
Over the course of my career,

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:26.976
I've had the great honor

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.056
playing some of the greatest
male role models ever

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.560
represented on television.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.336
You might recognize me
as "Male Escort #1."

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.856
(Laughter)

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.960
"Photographer Date Rapist,"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.296
"Shirtless Date Rapist"

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.976
from the award-winning
"Spring Break Shark Attack."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.096
(Laughter)

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.496
"Shirtless Medical Student,"

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.456
"Shirtless Steroid-Using Con Man"

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.376
and, in my most
well-known role, as Rafael.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.576
(Applause)

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.216
A brooding, reformed playboy

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.120
who falls for, of all things, a virgin,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.016
and who is only occasionally shirtless.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.576
(Laughter)

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.896
Now, these roles don't represent
the kind of man I am in my real life,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.736
but that's what I love about acting.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.160
I get to live inside characters
very different than myself.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.256
But every time I got
one of these roles, I was surprised,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.216
because most of the men
I play ooze machismo,

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.976
charisma and power,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.456
and when I look in the mirror,
that's just not how I see myself.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.416
But it was how Hollywood saw me,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.736
and over time, I noticed a parallel

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.856
between the roles I would play as a man

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.320
both on-screen and off.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.520
I've been pretending to be
a man that I'm not my entire life.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.560
I've been pretending
to be strong when I felt weak,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.040
confident when I felt insecure

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.000
and tough when really I was hurting.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.320
I think for the most part
I've just been kind of putting on a show,

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.440
but I'm tired of performing.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.056
And I can tell you right now

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.400
that it is exhausting trying to be
man enough for everyone all the time.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.776
Now -- right?

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.976
(Laughter)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.096
My brother heard that.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.936
Now, for as long
as I can remember, I've been told

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.039
the kind of man
that I should grow up to be.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.016
As a boy, all I wanted was to be
accepted and liked by the other boys,

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.096
but that acceptance meant I had to acquire

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.576
this almost disgusted view
of the feminine,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.736
and since we were told that feminine
is the opposite of masculine,

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.936
I either had to reject
embodying any of these qualities

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.560
or face rejection myself.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.720
This is the script that we've been given.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.120
Right? Girls are weak,
and boys are strong.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.376
This is what's being
subconsciously communicated

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.640
to hundreds of millions of young boys
and girls all over the world,

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.400
just like it was with me.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.840
Well, I came here today to say, as a man

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.936
that this is wrong, this is toxic,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.376
and it has to end.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.040
(Applause)

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.136
Now, I'm not here
to give a history lesson.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.856
We likely all know how we got here, OK?

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.696
But I'm just a guy that woke up
after 30 years and realized

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.696
that I was living in a state of conflict,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.136
conflict with who I feel I am in my core

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.160
and conflict with who the world
tells me as a man I should be.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.576
But I don't have a desire

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.680
to fit into the current
broken definition of masculinity,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.880
because I don't just want
to be a good man.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.120
I want to be a good human.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.296
And I believe the only way that can happen

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.816
is if men learn to not only
embrace the qualities

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.136
that we were told
are feminine in ourselves

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.176
but to be willing to stand up,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.480
to champion and learn
from the women who embody them.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.336
Now, men --

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.976
(Laughter)

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.656
I am not saying that everything
we have learned is toxic. OK?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.696
I'm not saying there's anything
inherently wrong with you or me,

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.120
and men, I'm not saying
we have to stop being men.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.920
But we need balance, right?

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.976
We need balance,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.136
and the only way things will change
is if we take a real honest look

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.376
at the scripts that have been
passed down to us

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.216
from generation to generation

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.456
and the roles that,
as men, we choose to take on

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.760
in our everyday lives.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.576
So speaking of scripts,

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.560
the first script I ever got
came from my dad.

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.279
My dad is awesome.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.960
He's loving, he's kind,
he's sensitive, he's nurturing,

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.016
he's here.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.000
(Applause)

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.816
He's crying.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.576
(Laughter)

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.776
But, sorry, Dad,
as a kid I resented him for it,

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.416
because I blamed him for making me soft,

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.776
which wasn't welcomed
in the small town in Oregon

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.136
that we had moved to.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.208
Because being soft
meant that I was bullied.

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.296
See, my dad wasn't
traditionally masculine,

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.936
so he didn't teach me how to use my hands.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.320
He didn't teach me
how to hunt, how to fight,

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.200
you know, man stuff.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.136
Instead he taught me what he knew:

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.440
that being a man was about sacrifice

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.496
and doing whatever you can

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.600
to take care of
and provide for your family.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.936
But there was another role
I learned how to play from my dad,

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.016
who, I discovered,
learned it from his dad,

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.896
a state senator

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.616
who later in life

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.440
had to work nights as a janitor
to support his family,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.560
and he never told a soul.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.896
That role was to suffer in secret.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.336
And now three generations later,

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.400
I find myself playing that role, too.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.976
So why couldn't my grandfather
just reach out to another man

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.200
and ask for help?

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.576
Why does my dad to this day still think
he's got to do it all on his own?

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.400
I know a man who would rather die

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.440
than tell another man
that they're hurting.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.400
But it's not because we're just all,
like, strong silent types.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.200
It's not. A lot of us men are really good
at making friends, and talking,

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.136
just not about anything real.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.016
(Laughter)

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.536
If it's about work or sports
or politics or women,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.560
we have no problem sharing our opinions,

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.200
but if it's about
our insecurities or our struggles,

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:29.280
our fear of failure,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.600
then it's almost like we become paralyzed.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.120
At least, I do.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.976
So some of the ways
that I have been practicing

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.456
breaking free of this behavior

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.200
are by creating experiences
that force me to be vulnerable.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.136
So if there's something
I'm experiencing shame around in my life,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.160
I practice diving straight into it,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.176
no matter how scary it is --

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.536
and sometimes, even publicly.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.616
Because then in doing so

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.496
I take away its power,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.856
and my display of vulnerability

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:08.080
can in some cases give other men
permission to do the same.

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.856
As an example, a little while ago

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.816
I was wrestling with an issue in my life

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.840
that I knew I needed
to talk to my guy friends about,

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.216
but I was so paralyzed by fear

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.296
that they would judge me
and see me as weak

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.680
and I would lose my standing as a leader

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.456
that I knew I had to take them
out of town on a three-day guys trip --

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.496
(Laughter)

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.136
Just to open up. And guess what?

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.776
It wasn't until the end of the third day

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.936
that I finally found
the strength to talk to them

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.440
about what I was going through.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.536
But when I did,
something amazing happened.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.040
I realized that I wasn't alone,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.200
because my guys had also been struggling.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:57.256
And as soon as I found the strength
and the courage to share my shame,

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.480
it was gone.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.016
Now, I've learned over time

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.056
that if I want to practice vulnerability,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.840
then I need to build myself
a system of accountability.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.400
So I've been really blessed as an actor.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.416
I've built a really wonderful fan base,

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.696
really, really sweet and engaged,

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.136
and so I decided to use my social platform

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.216
as kind of this Trojan horse

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.240
wherein I could create a daily practice
of authenticity and vulnerability.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.000
The response has been incredible.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.096
It's been affirming,
it's been heartwarming.

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.800
I get tons of love and press
and positive messages daily.

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.440
But it's all from a certain demographic:

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.416
women.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.135
(Laughter)

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:45.360
This is real.

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:50.496
Why are only women following me?

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:51.816
Where are the men?

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.456
(Laughter)

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.480
About a year ago, I posted this photo.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.256
Now, afterwards, I was scrolling
through some of the comments,

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:05.136
and I noticed that one of my female fans
had tagged her boyfriend in the picture,

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.336
and her boyfriend responded by saying,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:11.256
"Please stop tagging me in gay shit.

00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:12.496
Thx."

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.536
(Laughter)

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.120
As if being gay makes you
less of a man, right?

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.720
So I took a deep breath,

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.400
and I responded.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.256
I said,

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.176
very politely, that I was just curious,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.416
because I'm on an exploration
of masculinity,

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.736
and I wanted to know
why my love for my wife

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.856
qualified as gay shit.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.536
And then I said,
honestly I just wanted to learn.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.536
(Laughter)

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:45.696
Now, he immediately wrote me back.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.960
I thought he was going to go off on me,
but instead he apologized.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.776
He told me how, growing up,

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.256
public displays of affection
were looked down on.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.560
He told me that he was wrestling
and struggling with his ego,

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:03.296
and how much he loved his girlfriend

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.000
and how thankful he was for her patience.

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.256
And then a few weeks later,

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.600
he messaged me again.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.640
This time he sent me a photo

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.856
of him on one knee proposing.

00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.016
(Applause)

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.640
And all he said was, "Thank you."

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.640
I've been this guy.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.656
I get it.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.776
See, publicly,
he was just playing his role,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:32.896
rejecting the feminine, right?

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.976
But secretly he was waiting
for permission to express himself,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.216
to be seen, to be heard,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.856
and all he needed was another man

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.016
holding him accountable
and creating a safe space for him to feel,

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.416
and the transformation was instant.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.536
I loved this experience,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.056
because it showed me
that transformation is possible,

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.840
even over direct messages.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.536
So I wanted to figure out
how I could reach more men,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.696
but of course none of them
were following me.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.576
(Laughter)

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.776
So I tried an experiment.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.136
I started posting more
stereotypically masculine things --

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.336
(Laughter)

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.056
Like my challenging workouts,
my meal plans,

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:14.496
my journey to heal my body
after an injury.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.760
And guess what happened?

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.760
Men started to write me.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:22.776
And then, out of the blue,
for the first time in my entire career,

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.720
a male fitness magazine called me,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.040
and they said they wanted to honor me
as one of their game-changers.

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.056
(Laughter)

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.560
Was that really game-changing?

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.200
Or is it just conforming?

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.256
And see, that's the problem.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.136
It's totally cool for men to follow me

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.296
when I talk about guy stuff

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.040
and I conform to gender norms.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.296
But if I talk about
how much I love my wife

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.200
or my daughter or my 10-day-old son,

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.736
how I believe that marriage
is challenging but beautiful,

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.016
or how as a man
I struggle with body dysmorphia,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.920
or if I promote gender equality,
then only the women show up.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.400
Where are the men?

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.760
So men, men, men,

00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.176
men!

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.800
(Applause)

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.056
I understand.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.240
Growing up, we tend
to challenge each other.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.576
We've got to be the toughest,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.760
the strongest, the bravest
men that we can be.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.656
And for many of us, myself included,
our identities are wrapped up

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.000
in whether or not at the end of the day
we feel like we're man enough.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.696
But I've got a challenge for all the guys,

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.776
because men love challenges.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:51.360
(Laughter)

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.976
I challenge you to see
if you can use the same qualities

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.056
that you feel make you a man

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.720
to go deeper into yourself.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.776
Your strength, your bravery,
your toughness:

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:07.920
Can we redefine what those mean
and use them to explore our hearts?

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.336
Are you brave enough

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:13.720
to be vulnerable?

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.240
To reach out to another man
when you need help?

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.920
To dive headfirst into your shame?

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.200
Are you strong enough to be sensitive,

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.456
to cry whether you are hurting

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.816
or you're happy,

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.360
even if it makes you look weak?

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.216
Are you confident enough

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.200
to listen to the women in your life?

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.696
To hear their ideas and their solutions?

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.696
To hold their anguish

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.016
and actually believe them,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.360
even if what they're saying
is against you?

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:49.360
And will you be man enough

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.456
to stand up to other men
when you hear "locker room talk,"

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.816
when you hear stories
of sexual harassment?

00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.256
When you hear your boys talking
about grabbing ass or getting her drunk,

00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.336
will you actually stand up
and do something

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.616
so that one day
we don't have to live in a world

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.376
where a woman has to risk everything

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.456
and come forward
to say the words "me too?"

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.440
(Applause)

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.800
This is serious stuff.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.896
I've had to take a real, honest look

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:27.560
at the ways that I've unconsciously
been hurting the women in my life,

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.080
and it's ugly.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:36.896
My wife told me that I had been
acting in a certain way that hurt her

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.360
and not correcting it.

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.960
Basically, sometimes
when she would go to speak,

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.096
at home or in public,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.480
I would just cut her off mid-sentence
and finish her thought for her.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.720
It's awful.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.656
The worst part was that I was completely
unaware when I was doing it.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.096
It was unconscious.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.136
So here I am doing my part,

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.696
trying to be a feminist,

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.976
amplifying the voices
of women around the world,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.616
and yet at home,

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.400
I am using my louder voice
to silence the woman I love the most.

00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.680
So I had to ask myself a tough question:

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.856
am I man enough

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.616
to just shut the hell up and listen?

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.576
(Laughter)

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.336
(Applause)

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.096
I've got to be honest.
I wish that didn't get an applause.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.480
(Laughter)

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.736
Guys,

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.960
this is real.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.816
And I'm just scratching the surface here,

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.776
because the deeper we go,
the uglier it gets, I guarantee you.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.696
I don't have time to get into porn
and violence against women

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.976
or the split of domestic duties

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.680
or the gender pay gap.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.056
But I believe that as men,

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.536
it's time we start to see
past our privilege

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.176
and recognize that we are
not just part of the problem.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.896
Fellas, we are the problem.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:00.096
The glass ceiling exists
because we put it there,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.216
and if we want to be
a part of the solution,

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.800
then words are no longer enough.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:09.440
There's a quote that I love that
I grew up with from the Bahá'í writings.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.640
It says that "the world of humanity
is possessed of two wings,

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:15.960
the male and the female.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.176
So long as these two wings
are not equivalent in strength,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:22.880
the bird will not fly."

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.640
So women,

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.496
on behalf of men all over the world

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.800
who feel similar to me,

00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:35.880
please forgive us

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.600
for all the ways that we have not
relied on your strength.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.216
And now I would like
to ask you to formally help us,

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.336
because we cannot do this alone.

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.096
We are men. We're going to mess up.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.136
We're going to say the wrong thing.
We're going to be tone-deaf.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.736
We're more than likely, probably,
going to offend you.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:55.280
But don't lose hope.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.360
We're only here because of you,

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.616
and like you, as men, we need
to stand up and become your allies

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.256
as you fight against

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.600
pretty much everything.

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.536
We need your help
in celebrating our vulnerability

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:13.296
and being patient with us

00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.256
as we make this very, very long journey

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.560
from our heads to our hearts.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.760
And finally to parents:

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.720
instead of teaching our children

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.839
to be brave boys or pretty girls,

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:35.520
can we maybe just teach them
how to be good humans?

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:39.359
So back to my dad.

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.696
Growing up, yeah, like every boy,
I had my fair share of issues,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.856
but now I realize that it was
even thanks to his sensitivity

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.616
and emotional intelligence

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.080
that I am able to stand here right now
talking to you in the first place.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.696
The resentment I had for my dad
I now realize had nothing to do with him.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.016
It had everything to do with me
and my longing to be accepted

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.240
and to play a role
that was never meant for me.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.080
So while my dad may have not taught me
how to use my hands,

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.280
he did teach me how to use my heart,

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.920
and to me that makes him
more a man than anything.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.016
Thank you.

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.600
(Applause)
