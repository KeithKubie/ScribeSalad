00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.160
- Good morning, I hope
you're having an amazing day.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.600
It's Mark Wiens, I'm in Trat, Thailand

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.200
and this is day four of
our eastern provinces

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.730
of Thailand food and travel tour.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.660
Today I have a very special day for you.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.330
We are on our way to Baan Huai Raeng,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.710
which is a community
in the forests in Trat,

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.400
and they are gonna cook for us some local,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.630
very seasonal dishes, using some

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.030
of the local ingredients from this area.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.590
I'm not sure what
they're gonna cook for us

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.470
but I know it's gonna be
delicious and I'm gonna share

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.720
it all with you in this video right now.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.470
(engaging music)

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.030
It was about a 25 minute
drive to get here from

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.505
the center of Trat Town and we are at

00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:45.320
Wat Plai Klong, which is
a temple where someone

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.840
from the community is about to pick us up

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.700
and then we're gonna get started cooking

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.993
and eating, they should
be here any minute.

00:00:54.222 --> 00:00:58.270
(upbeat tropical music)

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.410
They came to pick us up.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.133
We are following them
into the village now.

00:01:03.102 --> 00:01:06.435
(upbeat tropical music)

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.270
Okay and here we are.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.363
Oh wow, this place,
this place is gorgeous.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.270
(conversing in foreign language)

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.460
- Lots of friendly dogs, we
have met up with the family;

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.920
this is where we're gonna cook, this is

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.550
where we're gonna eat, it's gorgeous.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.393
They're fruit trees; it's lush.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.230
Oh wow, this house is absolutely gorgeous.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:36.950
You gotta love that doormat:
an old pair of jeans

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.740
but you walk up to this
platform, it's elevated,

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.430
it's a huge communal platform,

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.050
this is traditional Trat
style and it's gorgeous.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.400
I mean you have the open air breeze;

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.290
you have this whole
community section here.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.370
I think the kitchen is back
there and then over on this side

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.580
you have more of the room
section where you can sleep,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.780
and they have the mosquito
nets over there as well.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.373
I'm loving it already.

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:07.945
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:07.945 --> 00:02:10.445
(pan scrapes)

00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:32.804
(upbeat tropical music)

00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:41.360
(speaking in foreign language)

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.450
- It's actually gonna be a
very, it's not just fried rice,

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.500
it's gonna be combined
with a bunch of ingredients

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.570
and wrapped up in some
time of leaf wrapper

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.920
but also a banana leaf, so we're

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.470
gonna go get a banana leaf too.

00:02:55.855 --> 00:02:58.855
(adventurous music)

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.900
Oh, this is a tropical paradise,
there are durian trees,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.480
bananas, mangosteen,
rambutan, and it's not

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.190
quite there in season yet, so
you can see the little dirt;

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.820
oh I just got bit by an ant.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.448
Oh yeah look at that ant.

00:03:14.448 --> 00:03:16.816
(foot smashes)

00:03:16.816 --> 00:03:20.316
(speaks foreign language)

00:03:25.152 --> 00:03:28.336
- You remember the dish
it's called chamuang

00:03:28.336 --> 00:03:31.310
which in English it's
called cowa garcinia.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.070
Oh I'm so getting bit by ants.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.640
Cowa garcinia leaves, this
is the tree right here,

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.180
these are the leaves; I know
it's an evergreen type of tree

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.480
but it's very, very commonly eaten

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.130
in this region of eastern Thailand.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.970
They literally have
everything that you need

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.200
for a Trat Thai feast within their yard,

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.773
within this jungle, it's
gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

00:04:02.476 --> 00:04:05.809
(upbeat tropical music)

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.263
What's the actual name of it?

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.400
(speaks foreign language)

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.230
- It's like a little purse,
(speaks foreign language),

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.890
and that's the official
name of it; so she took some

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.250
of the fried rice stirred
fried with that numb pig

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.590
and the she adds in all the
components of ingredients,

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.100
specifically quite a lot
of pineapple, a cucumber,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.100
a salted egg, and a handful
of cashews, and fried fish.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.250
And that all gets wrapped
up first into a banana leaf

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.990
and then into that extra giant leaf,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.853
and she makes a pear-shape,
that's, that's cool.

00:05:10.175 --> 00:05:12.925
(utensils clank)

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.533
- [Presenter] Michael
can you show your haul?

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:24.120
So that's like a little lunch box purse

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.090
that's all everything you need for

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.100
a complete meal wrapped up in that leaf.

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.250
Something else that's very
cool, and I didn't know this

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:34.290
from the start is that
this is a little spoon,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.420
all-natural, and that she
includes in this packet.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.190
And even this string, this is all natural,

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:43.530
this is made from the same
wrapper, the greater wrapper.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.963
It's absolutely beautiful.

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.890
A little packet, the spoon
is particularly cool,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.880
this is what I'm most excited to use.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.220
I'm gonna get a little
bit of that salted egg.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.490
I'm gonna get a little
bit of that pineapple,

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.090
that fish, and oh I have a cashew,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:06.200
I gotta have a cashew on this bite too.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.590
Scoop up a little bit
and there's also a purple

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.673
sweet potato in the rice
as well, oh what a bite!

00:06:19.293 --> 00:06:23.530
(speaking foreign language)

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:24.820
- Oh that's delicious.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.600
I mean the rice has a little
bit of a shrimp paste flavor

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.560
to it, I think there's some
shrimp paste in that nam phrik,

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.570
and then you've got the
starchy pieces of sweet potato;

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.800
you've got that sweet
balance of acidic pineapple,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.880
and then the crunchy fish, that's awesome.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:41.893
That's such like a soothing mix.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.190
(speaking in foreign language)

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.690
- It's really, awesomely good.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:56.060
Yeah, it's just such a
harmony of ingredients

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.016
and so many different things going on.

00:06:58.016 --> 00:07:01.516
(speaks foreign language)

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.210
- She's getting me immediately
started on the next dish

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.030
and she's making a curry with
this fruit called kradom,

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.960
and if I were just to guess,
I've never seen it before

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.670
in Thailand, I've never
seen it before in my life,

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:23.970
but if I were to guess
it looks pretty sour,

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.880
with little green fruits
like that, but the first step

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.761
is that I could be totally
wrong, the first step is

00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:30.630
she added some salt and she's just mixing

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:33.933
that around and then they're
gonna cook it with shrimp.

00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:37.542
(pan rushes)

00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.080
Back in the kitchen they are
squeezing the coconut milk

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.900
by hand that you know it's gonna
be that that ups the notch,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.003
fresh coconut milk that
makes all the difference.

00:07:57.181 --> 00:08:01.098
(speaking in foreign language)

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:31.872
(upbeat tropical music)

00:08:43.203 --> 00:08:45.040
- While the curry was cooking
we headed out to forage

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.670
a seasonal ingredient along
the banks of the water.

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.230
We are now going off into a
boat to get an ingredient;

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.080
it's a leaf, I'm not
totally sure what it is,

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.720
I've never had it before,
we're gonna get the leaf;

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.880
we're gonna bring it back
and they're gonna make

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:57.370
one more dish and then we're gonna eat.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.050
I can't wait to try that
other curry with the shrimp

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:03.093
and then the other dish
that she's gonna make.

00:09:04.491 --> 00:09:05.400
(leaves rustle)

00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:07.750
So the house is actually
right next to a river.

00:09:13.073 --> 00:09:17.156
(conversing in foreign language)

00:09:20.534 --> 00:09:23.034
(engine revs)

00:09:24.972 --> 00:09:28.305
(upbeat tropical music)

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:32.580
- And again he told me
this was brackish water

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:35.120
and that's part of the
reason why the fruit

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.510
and the ingredients in
this area are so good;

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.380
they say because of the brackish water

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:42.323
the mangoes are extremely sweet.

00:09:44.372 --> 00:09:47.122
(engaging music)

00:09:53.755 --> 00:09:57.255
(speaks foreign language)

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.930
- And this is the type of
leaf, I think it's a vine

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:05.873
actually, it's the red vine,
it has a red color to it.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.850
It looks like it's kinda tangled with

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.203
some bamboo and that's
what we're gonna get.

00:10:15.368 --> 00:10:17.370
(leafs crunch)

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.483
Wow, the whole vine.

00:10:20.707 --> 00:10:24.207
(speaks foreign language)

00:10:26.546 --> 00:10:27.950
- He's pulled that vine off, that

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.290
is straight forage to leaves, vines, from

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.113
the jungle for the dish he's gonna make.

00:10:35.494 --> 00:10:38.827
(upbeat tropical music)

00:10:50.764 --> 00:10:54.740
(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.750
- We're back at the house now,

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.060
with that leaf, with that vine,

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.585
they're gonna make gaeng
som which is a sour curry.

00:11:00.585 --> 00:11:01.683
Gaeng som by Son Don.

00:11:04.856 --> 00:11:06.160
- [Presenter Voiceover] While
the menu is being prepared

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.870
we took another break
to eat another pre-meal.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.130
This time a royal Thai dish
called Kanom Jeen Sao Nam

00:11:12.130 --> 00:11:14.710
Uncle had made it himself
for the family and we

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:17.880
just happened to have honor
to be there for the occasion.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.000
- This was a surprise I
didn't even know they were

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.380
making this dish but it's
called Kanom Jeen Sao Nam,

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:27.470
and this is a really old,
traditional Thai dish,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.850
very hard to find, but it's a summer dish

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:33.000
in the hot weather you eat
with the khao kan chin,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.040
which is the soft rice
noodles and you have all

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.830
the different components, with the curry,

00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.150
yeah, it's fantastic, and we're all

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:41.800
sitting down to eat it right now.

00:11:43.627 --> 00:11:46.294
(plates scrape)

00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:51.706
(speaks foreign language)

00:12:12.969 --> 00:12:14.070
- There are so many ingredients.

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.053
This is an exciting dish to eat.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:19.070
(uptempo music)

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:19.903
- [Presenter] Pineapple?

00:12:19.903 --> 00:12:20.736
- [Male] Yeah.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.250
- [Presenter] This is ginger?

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:24.083
- [Male] Yes.

00:12:26.660 --> 00:12:27.910
- [Presenter] Raw garlic.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:35.420
(people converse in foreign language)

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.210
- [Presenter] I got all the components

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:46.100
and now it's time to add
the real, actual curry

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.100
with the fish meatballs in here.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.853
I'm gonna add it to the side there.

00:12:52.666 --> 00:12:53.499
(woman speaks foreign language)

00:12:53.499 --> 00:12:54.340
- [Presenter] The fish balls are fresh

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.540
and they are very spongy; oh the garlic

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.323
and the ginger down there too.

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.623
I need a little bit of all of this.

00:13:03.718 --> 00:13:07.801
(conversing in foreign language)

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:13.403
- Oh wow.

00:13:14.799 --> 00:13:18.716
(speaking in foreign language)

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:25.660
- And uncle is telling us
that he made this special,

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.200
very special, it was completely unplanned.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.510
The sum of all the ingredients together

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.740
that makes it spectacular;
you've got the coconut milk

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:35.400
with the fish balls,
you've got what I like

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.500
is the ginger and garlic
but paired with that salty

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.410
fish sauce and then the sweet pineapple.

00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.780
What a contrast.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.260
What a delicious mix in your
mouth and this is actually

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:48.263
a traditional Royal Palace Thai dish.

00:13:49.478 --> 00:13:52.978
(speaks foreign language)

00:13:57.793 --> 00:13:59.232
- [Presenter] So I can get a half?

00:13:59.232 --> 00:14:00.197
- Yeah.

00:14:00.197 --> 00:14:03.243
- Okay it's so good, I need
some more, a little bit more.

00:14:04.972 --> 00:14:08.889
(speaking in foreign language)

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:14.720
- There's no way you'll
not have a re-fill of this.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.890
The entire sum of the
ingredients, but these fish balls

00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:23.120
are notable, they are
stunning, that springy texture,

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.627
all-natural, all-fish,
he just pounds it with

00:14:26.627 --> 00:14:30.520
salt he said, and he pounded
it by hand, the fish balls;

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:33.380
that's why they're all
random shapes and sizes,

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:36.080
and those are some of the
fish balls you'll ever have.

00:14:41.738 --> 00:14:46.738
It's awesome and I really
don't know what we're doing;

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:50.200
the day has sort of
shifted, we're just kind

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:55.200
of hanging around eating and
I'm loving every moment of it.

00:14:56.247 --> 00:14:59.580
(upbeat tropical music)

00:15:07.358 --> 00:15:11.275
(speaking in foreign language)

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.083
(pot whirs)

00:15:47.811 --> 00:15:50.500
- At first I can see he
added the chili paste,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.440
he added some extra chilies, and then

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.613
he just added in some sour tamarind.

00:15:56.971 --> 00:16:01.187
(speaking in foreign language)

00:16:01.187 --> 00:16:04.437
(pot clinks and stews)

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:15.310
- It's barracuda, very fresh
barracuda, and he said:

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:18.370
once you add in the fish and
the shrimp you don't wanna

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.620
stir it very much or it
will get a bad smell.

00:16:22.937 --> 00:16:26.270
(upbeat tropical music)

00:16:28.289 --> 00:16:31.430
(speaks in foreign language)

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.317
- He put in the entire
heap of those leaves

00:16:34.317 --> 00:16:37.370
and that was a mound of leaves,
and they immediately turn

00:16:37.370 --> 00:16:40.363
from a bright green color to
a kind of brown-green color.

00:16:42.192 --> 00:16:45.942
(speaks in foreign language)

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.660
- And final step is to
add in a bunch of shrimp.

00:16:51.952 --> 00:16:55.702
(speaks in foreign language)

00:16:59.693 --> 00:17:03.110
- Mm, mm, okay should have three flavors,

00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:07.300
sour, salty, sweet.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:08.133
- Yes.

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:11.746
Switzerland, bye.

00:17:11.746 --> 00:17:15.246
(speaks foreign language)

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:23.730
- Sourness coming from the
leaves and the tamarind.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.393
Oh, that's beautifully sour.

00:17:28.651 --> 00:17:32.568
(speaking in foreign language)

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.900
- We are sitting down yet
again to eat but these are

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.750
the two dishes that are
specifically the seasonal

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:53.020
dishes from this region in
Trat; these are ingredients

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:55.420
the forage divines and then that other

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:58.170
little fruit with the shrimp curry,

00:17:58.170 --> 00:18:01.980
it looks delicious and I
can't wait to taste it.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.860
So this one is the gaeng
kradom with the little fruits,

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:07.060
they're all below here,
all of that coconut milk,

00:18:07.060 --> 00:18:10.029
and then the shrimp; I
have to just taste some

00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:11.583
of that fruit first
with some of that curry.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.830
- Wow, I like. I like.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:29.050
(speaks foreign language)

00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:32.360
- Okay that's exactly right,
he's telling me you get

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.210
the bitter first taste and
then as you keep on chewing

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.790
it's starts to get a little
sweeter as it goes down.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.750
But yeah, I was totally
expecting it to be sour,

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:44.030
not really sour; but yeah
it is bitter, kind of like

00:18:44.030 --> 00:18:47.076
bitter corn, but a more subtle bitter;

00:18:47.076 --> 00:18:49.910
then it's wrapped up in
that fresh coconut milk

00:18:50.768 --> 00:18:53.018
and then it's a little
bit spicy, you've got

00:18:53.018 --> 00:18:54.973
that shrimp inside of there,
oh, that's spectacular.

00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.930
That's fantastic. I love that bitterness.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.600
Okay and next up is the
gaeng som by Son Don,

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.410
which again is that leaf
and there's fish in here,

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:10.717
and we saw him make the
whole thing in these

00:19:10.717 --> 00:19:13.400
giant prawn shrimp, ah but that leaf;

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.050
I'm most excited about that leaf.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:21.230
Those leaves are outstanding,
such a sour flavor,

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.950
when you cook them, they
really are more soft

00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:26.910
and more silky than
spinach; they require almost

00:19:26.910 --> 00:19:28.890
no chewing, they just sort
of dissolve in your mouth.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.153
And he was very careful
not to overcook the shrimp;

00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.120
oh wow, these are very
soft though, the shell.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.070
First eat the shrimp then I'll chase it

00:19:38.215 --> 00:19:39.473
with this bite of rice
with some of the leaves.

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.894
(speaking in foreign language)

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:50.316
- Oh, that shrimp is incredible.

00:19:50.316 --> 00:19:54.160
It's so tender and then the
mangoun which is the tamale,

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:58.023
the head and butter juices,
it's so creamy and so rich.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.900
What a fantastic leaf
and doesn't get better

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:04.710
than foraged leaves and vegetables.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:06.960
Just wild, natural supreme, that's one

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:09.727
of those leaves that's
so sour it immediately

00:20:09.727 --> 00:20:12.523
leaves that sour sour
chalkiness on your teeth.

00:20:13.841 --> 00:20:17.174
(upbeat tropical music)

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.430
And that one is spectacular too.

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:26.180
You know they're both really good.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:30.253
Both totally, completely
opposite in flavors.

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:35.130
(tropical upbeat music)

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.150
And on our way out the
family graciously gave us

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:44.853
an entire bagful of bananas
right from their garden.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:50.740
What a fantastic day. What delicious food.

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:54.920
And a little insight
into the village life,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:59.130
community life in Trat; a
big thank you to the family

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.540

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:03.650
and uncle also those special dishes.

00:21:03.650 --> 00:21:06.290
We didn't really plan much
of what we we were gonna do

00:21:06.290 --> 00:21:08.280
and it just unfolded as it did.

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.350
