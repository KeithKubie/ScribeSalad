00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.620
&gt;&gt; So, Michael, I know we said that was the

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.400
last quiz but I think we should do one more

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.110
quiz. So the quiz is going to be on convex polygons.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.580
And X is going to be an R squared. And

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.780
the hypothesis is going to be points inside some convex holygo-,

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.420
polygon. And, and inside means the same thing as we

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.430
meant with circles. So, if you're on the polygon or

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.440
on the perimeter of the polygon, then you're inside the polygon

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.050
for the purpose of this discussion. So, here's my question

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.040
to you Michael. What is the VC dimension of convex polygons?

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.820
&gt;&gt; Well, if I had to.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.020
&gt;&gt; Ask someone else, you would say it was a quiz and you'd let them do it.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.690
&gt;&gt; Is this a quiz? Oh, it's a quiz for me.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.426
&gt;&gt; Well, I dunno, do you want to let the students get a, get a try?

00:00:41.426 --> 00:00:43.190
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, and then we can answer it by simply

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.411
going to the quiz if we actually go to the quiz [LAUGH].

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.490
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, so let's go to a quiz. Go.
