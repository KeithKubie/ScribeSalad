00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.570
In the Blue Ridge Mountains--

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.070
Oh, the belt broke.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.770
Eustace has recently
restored century

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.970
old band saws on the fritz.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.600
Just ripped that off.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.400
I'm glad it wasn't the
blade that came flying off.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.100
One of us would
be missing a finger.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.900
The problem is a tear
in the 10 foot belt.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.170
Who knows where the pin went?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.470
The belt has connectors,
and they're kind

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.100
of like interwoven fingers.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.100
And then there's a pin
that slides through.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.230
You can't really just run out
to your local hardware store

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.430
and buy another flat belt.
They're kind of antiquated,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430
and I'm going to go
try to find something

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.470
that we can fix it with.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.130
Some fence wire.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.170
Oh, yeah.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.600
That'll do it.
Don't you think?

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.070
That'll work good.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.000
This belt was crucial, because
I was depending on this band saw

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.400
to finish the rest of the bed.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.370
Keep it lined up.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.900
Really pay attention
to that side.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.830
There it went.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.370
There we go.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.370
I wouldn't call it good as
new, but I'd say it'll sure do.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.700
I think it's gonna work.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.570
Well, there's one way to
find out how good our fix is.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.770
Yep.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.200
Well, right now I'm gonna
keep my fingers crossed,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.900
but I think it's
going to work here.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.270
Here we go.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.130
All right.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.570
We'll see what it does.
- OK.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.600
Yeah!

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.970
Ha ha!
Woo!

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.630
Well, we got the band
saw back up and running.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.300
We're gonna finish our
last few little cuts,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.600
and then we'll be ready to
start assembling this bed.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.630
If we've measured and cut, and
done all our [inaudible] joints

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.530
right, and everything, it
will just kind of go together

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.570
like a set of Lincoln Logs.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.570
No nails, no screws.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.900
Yep.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.600
It's pretty neat.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.830
Well, that looks
good there, Joseph.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.500
Let's stand it up, and--

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.870
Check it up.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.330
One, two, three.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.430
The closer this thing
is to getting finished,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.100
it's starting to take shape.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.730
And Joseph and I are just really
getting excited about seeing

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.930
it come to life.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.430
Well, what do you think?

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.170
I think that's a bed.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.530
It's pretty cool.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.000
A mixture of beeswax
and linseed oil

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.170
seals and protects the raw wood.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.670
Man, I like this.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.730
Look at that.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.130
This bed is a good
example of the way

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.470
mountain people in this area
have been living forever.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.570
You know, like, make something
beautiful with what's

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.830
around you.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.470
And so I think that's a
pretty prime example of that.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.030
Hopefully a buyer is going
to think that, as well.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.530
But the only way to find
out if the bed will sell

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.670
is to head to town.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.830
I'm really hoping
this bed will sell,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.430
and get us some
cash in our hands,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.270
so we can go make
that downpayment.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.300
Hello, Eustace.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.070
Hey, Gary.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.470
What you got here for us?

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.670
Well, this is that bed
I've been telling you about.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.570
It's the moment of
truth for Eustace's

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.630
plan to make a fast buck from
a handcrafted rustic bed frame.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.900
I'm really hoping this
bed will sell, and bring me

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.100
a good price, and
help me get closer

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.330
to getting my downpayment done.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.200
Look at the joinery.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.830
So you've got
dovetail right here?

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:19.670
Yeah.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.530
Dovetail on the center there.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.700
That is beautiful.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.170
And this is white pine?
- Yep.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.530
White pine.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.970
I could see it in his face,
that he liked it as soon as I

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.730
saw him looking at the bed.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:31.970
How beautiful.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.270
Gary sees what we've done.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.270
He understands
what goes into it.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.930
This is a real old timey way
of putting stuff together.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.400
Well, I'll tell
you something--

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.500
I think for something
of this nature--

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.670
I mean, you're probably
looking at $3,500,

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.730
maybe $4,000 on
something like this.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.030
Woo!

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.230
That sounds pretty good.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.800
This fits right up our alley.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.870
These type of things bring
a large dollar amount,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.100
because of the care
that's put into it,

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.200
and the time that goes into it.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.500
And this is the type
of product that people

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.270
are looking for nowadays.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.430
We could write you a check, and
we could take this one today.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.700
That's what we need to do.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.500
We need to get some
money pretty fast.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.500
We gotta make a
payment on some land.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.100
Heavy duty.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.430
All right.

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.370
We'll bring it around here
and put it in the showroom.

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.730
Cool.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:28.970
The sale brings Eustace's
downpayment to $29,000,

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.970
about 20% of the land price.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.030
But he won't know if it's
enough until he makes his bid.

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.600
They say you can see the
light at the end of the tunnel.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.170
That's where I feel like I am.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.930
Can you believe that?

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.900
Felt pretty sweet, man.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.800
I'm loving it.
