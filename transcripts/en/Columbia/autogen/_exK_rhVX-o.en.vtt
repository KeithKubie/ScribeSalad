well first the city is a place that's

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
well first the city is a place that's
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.899
well first the city is a place that's
not designed to be in harmony with

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909
not designed to be in harmony with
 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.449
not designed to be in harmony with
natural ecosystems but it's a place

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459
natural ecosystems but it's a place
 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.300

the city in its the concept of the city
is actually to bring people together and

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170
is actually to bring people together and
 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.720
is actually to bring people together and
in a sense keep nature out that's why we

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730
in a sense keep nature out that's why we
 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.420
in a sense keep nature out that's why we
built cities in the first place to keep

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430
built cities in the first place to keep
 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.960
built cities in the first place to keep
nature out so it's a kind of interesting

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970
nature out so it's a kind of interesting
 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.430
nature out so it's a kind of interesting
concept when you think about

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440
concept when you think about
 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.890
concept when you think about
sustainability so what do I mean by

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900
sustainability so what do I mean by
 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.930
sustainability so what do I mean by
sustainability when I think about cities

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940
sustainability when I think about cities
 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.250
sustainability when I think about cities
well first a city that uses as few

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260
well first a city that uses as few
 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.960
well first a city that uses as few
non-renewable resources as possible and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970
non-renewable resources as possible and
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.780
non-renewable resources as possible and
then has the least possible damaging

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790
then has the least possible damaging
 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.930
then has the least possible damaging
impact on the rest of the environment so

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
impact on the rest of the environment so
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.300
impact on the rest of the environment so
it's part of the question here is how do

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310
it's part of the question here is how do
 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.580
it's part of the question here is how do

without destroying the planet by
minimizing the impact on the planet

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359
minimizing the impact on the planet
 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.869

metropolitan urban areas in different
 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.039
metropolitan urban areas in different
ways but it's always about population in

over the place and so that's an
 

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:29.480
over the place and so that's an
advantage the United States has China

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:29.490
advantage the United States has China
 

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.490

doesn't have that and Africa doesn't

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.500
doesn't have that and Africa doesn't
 

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.839
doesn't have that and Africa doesn't
have that they're gonna have to build

00:08:32.839 --> 00:08:32.849
have that they're gonna have to build
 

00:08:32.849 --> 00:08:35.390
have that they're gonna have to build
new cities in those places now there has

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:35.400
new cities in those places now there has
 

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.100
new cities in those places now there has
some advantages actually if they build

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:37.110
some advantages actually if they build
 

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.949
some advantages actually if they build
them correctly but much of the world new

00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959
them correctly but much of the world new
 

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:41.480

cities and settlements are going to have

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:41.490
cities and settlements are going to have
 

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.750
cities and settlements are going to have
to be built so there's a need to develop

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760
to be built so there's a need to develop
 

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:48.110
to be built so there's a need to develop
all of these with the least possible

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120
all of these with the least possible
 

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.480
all of these with the least possible
environmental impact and that requires a

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:50.490
environmental impact and that requires a
 

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.390
environmental impact and that requires a
great care in designing human settlement

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:53.400
great care in designing human settlement
 

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.090

that's really what has to happen and
 

00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:04.300
that's really what has to happen and
that is a design question we actually

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:04.310
that is a design question we actually
 

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:08.139
that is a design question we actually
can do more development more population

00:09:08.139 --> 00:09:08.149
can do more development more population

you know you don't need that much space

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:32.570
you know you don't need that much space
 

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.449
you know you don't need that much space
no matter and you could have a family of

no matter and you could have a family of
 

00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:37.389

forty you probably don't need that much

forty you probably don't need that much
 

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:39.069
forty you probably don't need that much
space and most people are there by

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079
space and most people are there by
 

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:40.540

I think people are getting a little
 

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:06.190
I think people are getting a little
tired of it at least some people are

highway system was built now the they

00:17:07.419 --> 00:17:07.429
highway system was built now the they
 

00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:08.500

and then we discovered something you

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:30.500
and then we discovered something you
 

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.620
and then we discovered something you
know you build a two-lane interstate it

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:32.630
know you build a two-lane interstate it
 

00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:35.260
know you build a two-lane interstate it
got after a certain amount of time the

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:35.270
got after a certain amount of time the
 

00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:36.850
got after a certain amount of time the
real estate in the outer areas gets

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:36.860
real estate in the outer areas gets
 

00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:38.830
real estate in the outer areas gets
filled up and then the roads get filled

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:38.840
filled up and then the roads get filled
 

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.110
filled up and then the roads get filled
up so you build a three lane it takes a

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120
up so you build a three lane it takes a
 

00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.250
up so you build a three lane it takes a
little less time they go a little

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:42.260
little less time they go a little
 

00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:45.400
little less time they go a little
further till it gets clogged up and then

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:45.410
further till it gets clogged up and then
 

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.530
further till it gets clogged up and then
you build a four-link and transportation

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:47.540
you build a four-link and transportation
 

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.280

there's no end to this and it's what
 

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.360
there's no end to this and it's what
happens is if I reduce the amount of

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:52.370
happens is if I reduce the amount of
 

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.890
happens is if I reduce the amount of
time from my job to the place I'm living

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:55.900
time from my job to the place I'm living
 

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.480

then it makes the land a little further

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:58.490
then it makes the land a little further
 

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:00.760
then it makes the land a little further
cheaper so I go out there and I build

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:00.770

00:38:48.250 --> 00:38:48.260
the people that have to build the
 

00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:49.960
the people that have to build the
infrastructure are not the same people

is that some of these systems are

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:01.370
is that some of these systems are
 

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:03.280
is that some of these systems are
getting more complicated and cost more

00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:03.290
getting more complicated and cost more
 

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:05.880

so water is probably the best example

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:05.890
so water is probably the best example
 

00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:09.490
so water is probably the best example
the price of water used to be hidden in

your property taxes now it's become a

00:39:12.910 --> 00:39:12.920
your property taxes now it's become a
 

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.700
your property taxes now it's become a
separate charge that you pay in addition

00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:15.710
separate charge that you pay in addition
 

00:39:15.710 --> 00:39:18.220
separate charge that you pay in addition
to your property taxes and the reason

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:18.230
to your property taxes and the reason
 

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:19.840
to your property taxes and the reason
for that is that the cost of water is

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:19.850
for that is that the cost of water is
 

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:22.060
for that is that the cost of water is
gonna filtrations gotten more expensive

00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:22.070

sewage treatment gotten more expensive

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:23.870
sewage treatment gotten more expensive
 

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.990
sewage treatment gotten more expensive
and transmission has gotten more

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:26.000
and transmission has gotten more
 

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.360
and transmission has gotten more
expensive and so we're paying more for

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:28.370
expensive and so we're paying more for
 

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:32.200
expensive and so we're paying more for
now I think people can handle the idea I
