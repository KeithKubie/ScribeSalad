00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.010
This is CHRISTMAS, the season of perpetual
HOPE.

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.540
I don't care if I have to get out there and
hitchhike!

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.560
I'm going to work at the soup kitchen this
season!

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.160
Howdy philanthropists, Trace here giving you
some DNews for free.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.090
Today, is Christmas Eve-eve.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.140
During the holiday season some people wanna
come out to the coast... have a few laughs,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.500
and others want to take an old blanket out
of the closet and say 'Here!' -- but, what

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.710
makes people want to do the second one?

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.239
In 2014, Americans gave 258 billion 510 million
dollars to charities -- that's 72 percent

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.260
of all charitable US giving according to the
National Center for Charitable Statistics.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.489
All foundations, corporations, and bequests,
when combined --bequests by the way are when

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.070
someone dies and leaves their money to charity
-- that didn't even hit 100 billion dollars!

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.129
People who made between 5 and 10 million dollars
gave away 3.7 percent of their gross income,

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.459
on average, and people who made 45 to 50-thousand:
4 percent!

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:04.830
Sure, they gave less money, but 4 percent
of 50,000 has way more impact on them relative

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.280
to the amount of disposable income they require
to meet their basic needs like rent, transportation,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.940
groceries and so on.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.320
In 1989, economics professor Alvaro Sandroni
created the "warm glow" theory of giving -- people

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.220
who give feel warm inside.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.721
It sounds touchy-feely, but he studied economics,
so he grabbed his graph paper and he and a

00:01:22.721 --> 00:01:26.420
partner wrote a mathematical proof in 2009.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.080
The idea being we donate to charity because
it helps them, but also: it helps us!

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.160
It makes us feel better.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.650
Also in 2009, a Harvard Business School study
looked at why people give their hard-earned

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:39.920
money to charity…

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.900
Groups of students were prompted to recall
happy or sad memories, then told they could

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.000
give money to other students.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.160
Those who'd been prompted with happy memories,
they gave more, and they felt happier!

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.830
In other words: happy people give more to
others and giving to charity causes happiness

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.830
in the giver!

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:01.340
When people are happy, they pay it forward,
they try to make other people happy (perhaps

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.430
by giving to charity), but they'll also be
more charitable in their day-to-day life.

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.229
Another study from the Harvard Business Review
claimed if you want the "biggest payoff" from

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.680
an unexpected windfall of 20-dollars, you
should give it away.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.090
You'll feel better about it.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.010
And this is reflected in our physiology!

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.120
Using fMRI scans, research published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.129
found the orbitofrontal, subgenual and lateral
orbitofrontal areas of the brain get a lot

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:28.579
of blood flow when people are being charitable.

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.389
And another study in Nature Neuroscience identified
the right posterior superior temporal cortex

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:35.560
as an active region during charity!

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.360
These areas are associated with [quote] "primitive
mechanisms of social attachment and aversion!"

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.390
and [quote] "perception of agency," the idea
that you can guess the intent of another's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.390
action.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.700
Basically, altruism helps we social advanced
apes work and stick together, and it's reinforced

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.170
by making us feel good -- that "warm glow"
that Sandroni identified!

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.439
And, numerous studies seem to show that when
one person behaves generously, it inspires

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.450
others to behave generously later; to pass
it on.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.079
But to bring it all back, why does this happen
during the holidays?

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:09.069
According to that same National Center for
Charitable Statistics review, a quarter to

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.599
half of all giving happens between October
and December!

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.870
Prosaically, it is the end of a tax year,
but that alone can't explain all the giving!

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.019
Some sociologists think it's because there
are simply an "abundance of opportunities,"

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.909
to give or because people tend to ask for
charity at that time of year.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.930
But, it could also be a charitable arms race…
if you see someone benefiting others, it makes

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.959
you want to pay it forward too.

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.680
Our social ape past is still there, under
the surface, making us want to help our fellow

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.680
apes.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.760
So, go out and give an advanced primate some
love this season, you'll feel better for it.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.159
We would like to thank our sponsor, Kay Jewelers,
for helping us make this episode.

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:47.849
For 100 years, every kiss begins with Kay.

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.260
Altruism, or being charitable, is a strange
behavior to see in animals.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.279
It might not make evolutionary sense to help
your fellow whale, or shark, or whatever--

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:56.279
but it's important!

00:03:56.279 --> 00:03:57.279
Jules looks into it here…

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.099
Do you give to charity? or Volunteer?

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.650
Help out at church, school, or Scouts?

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.650
Anything?

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.469
Let us know in the comments and take a sec
please and subscribe.

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:03.849
Thank you.
