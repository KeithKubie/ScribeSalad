I've always thought that you can have

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369
I've always thought that you can have
 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.070
I've always thought that you can have
one of two things you can have quality

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080
one of two things you can have quality
 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.560
one of two things you can have quality
over quantity or quantity over quality

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570
over quantity or quantity over quality
 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.240
over quantity or quantity over quality
and I've always felt that I like to sit

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250
and I've always felt that I like to sit
 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.590
and I've always felt that I like to sit
on the side of quality you know I want

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600
on the side of quality you know I want
 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.179
on the side of quality you know I want
to be making the best stuff that I

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:07.189
to be making the best stuff that I
 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:09.580
to be making the best stuff that I
possibly can and I don't mind the idea

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590
possibly can and I don't mind the idea
 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.770
possibly can and I don't mind the idea
that I won't be making as much stuff as

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780
that I won't be making as much stuff as
 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.630
that I won't be making as much stuff as
a result of that but the revelation that

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640
a result of that but the revelation that
 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.710
a result of that but the revelation that
and this week which has sort of been

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720
and this week which has sort of been
 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.350
and this week which has sort of been
like a really crazy realization for me

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360
like a really crazy realization for me
 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.380
like a really crazy realization for me
is that you can have both quality and

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390
is that you can have both quality and
 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.720
is that you can have both quality and
quantity and by that I don't mean that I

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730
quantity and by that I don't mean that I
 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.160
quantity and by that I don't mean that I
think it's possible for people to make

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170
think it's possible for people to make
 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.140
think it's possible for people to make
really high quality stuff all the time

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150
really high quality stuff all the time
 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.480
really high quality stuff all the time
but I mean that now I don't think it

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490
but I mean that now I don't think it
 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.949
but I mean that now I don't think it
would be a problem for me to be trying

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959
would be a problem for me to be trying
 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.630
would be a problem for me to be trying
to make the best quality stuff that I

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640
to make the best quality stuff that I
 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.130
to make the best quality stuff that I
can you know stuff that I put weeks of

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140
