BRETT SLATKIN: Hi, I'm Brett
Slatkin, software engineer

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.390
here at Google.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.320
You're watching Google
Developers Live.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.480
Today, we're with
Dalton Caldwell, who's

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.470
the CEO and
co-founder of App.net,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.240
and we're here in the App.net
office in San Francisco.

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.750
So welcome to the show, here.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.000
DALTON CALDWELL: Yeah, thanks.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.110
Thanks for coming by.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.207
BRETT SLATKIN: To fully
disclose my situation,

00:00:25.207 --> 00:00:26.290
I'm an App.net subscriber.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.410
I actually pay money to App.net
every year for the services

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.010
you provide, so
I know the answer

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.680
to a lot of the questions I'm
going to be asking during this.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.080
But I want to sort of start
from the beginning, so tell me,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.240
what is App.net?

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.360
DALTON CALDWELL: App.net
is a social platform.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.170
You have an identity as
a user that you create,

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.400
and once you have
that identity created,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.280
you can log into a manner
of different applications

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.860
that have been built by
third party developers.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.640
BRETT SLATKIN: OK, and so
that's from the consumer

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.265
side of things.

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:55.620
DALTON CALDWELL: Sure.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.328
BRETT SLATKIN: What
about as a developer?

00:00:57.328 --> 00:00:59.005
What is App.net for developers?

00:00:59.005 --> 00:01:00.630
DALTON CALDWELL:
App.net for developers

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.310
is a social platform.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.360
So if you go look at
our API documentation,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.320
it looks a lot like what you've
seen with other social APIs,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.840
like a Facebook or a Twitter.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.970
Additionally, there's a bit more
in terms of file persistence

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.960
and key value stores
and things like that,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.770
so it's almost like a
platform as a service.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.470
So call it a summation
of a platform

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.842
as a service and a social API.

00:01:23.842 --> 00:01:25.550
That's what it looks
like to a developer.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:26.508
BRETT SLATKIN: Got you.

00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:30.100
And how is it different
than, say, Twitter, Facebook,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.852
or Google+ and the
APIs they provide?

00:01:31.852 --> 00:01:33.560
I mean, that's social
infrastructure too.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.480
They have login and
messages and buttons

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.605
and all that kind of stuff.

00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:40.550
What makes App.net different
than what else is out there?

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.520
DALTON CALDWELL:
We approach this

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.972
from a conceptual perspective.

00:01:43.972 --> 00:01:44.930
Let me talk about that.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:45.763
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah.

00:01:45.763 --> 00:01:48.490
DALTON CALDWELL: The issue with
existing social infrastructure

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.970
is those are all
ad-supported services.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.440
And so the companies
that provide those APIs

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.680
are really focused on trying
to get users in a situation

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.974
where they can display ads
and target ads, which is fair.

00:02:02.974 --> 00:02:03.640
It's a business.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.490
It's a good business.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.540
I guess that's Google business.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.240
And therefore, if you're
a third party developer,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.110
there's a number of
encumbrances that you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.900
tend to run up into
if the eyeballs start

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.920
going to your
application that's using

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.900
the data of that
social platform.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.730
And so we don't need to
enumerate all the ways

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.832
that you can kind
of run into trouble.

00:02:23.832 --> 00:02:25.290
The difference with
App.net is it's

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.392
made to look like infrastructure
and feel like infrastructure,

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:29.850
so the business
model is a lot more

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.040
like Dropbox or Evernote or
GitHub, where its freemium.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.750
There is a free
tier for consumers,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.970
but there's a paid tier as
well for consumer power users.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.530
And the idea here is that
the more applications

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.180
that third party developers
build, the more attractive

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.820
the platform is to consumers,
and the more likely

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.770
we are to make more money.

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.360
And therefore, we
are financially

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.960
incentivized to have as
many third party apps built

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.370
as possible, to identify
as many niches as possible,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.320
to expand the value of
the platform instead of,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.020
oh, yeah, I guess
we have an API.

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.270
I hope people don't
use it too much.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.010
We want our first
party app, which

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.630
is what's serving
all the advertising,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.190
to be what people
interface with.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.165
And so from a business
model perspective,

00:03:15.165 --> 00:03:16.540
that's what's
different about it.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.081
And so it's caused us to make
a number of different decisions

00:03:19.081 --> 00:03:21.170
in the API itself, and in
our relationship for how

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.575
third parties integrate with it.

00:03:22.575 --> 00:03:24.750
BRETT SLATKIN: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.260
So that sounds like the value
of App.net to a developer,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.100
and so presumably
there's a bunch

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.550
of developers using App.net
to build their products.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.047
I thought maybe you could step
us through or explain to us

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:36.880
some of the apps out
there that are building

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.614
on top of App.net's social API.

00:03:38.614 --> 00:03:39.530
DALTON CALDWELL: Sure.

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.745
So there's a number of
different verticals,

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:43.620
I guess, is one way--

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.080
BRETT SLATKIN: Oh, why don't
we start with Passport, though.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.288
So Passport's your app, yeah.

00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:49.159
So what is Passport, and what
does Passport do for the user?

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.200
DALTON CALDWELL: So we do
have a first party app.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.540
It's called Passport.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.180
Right now, it's live on
iOS and Android both,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.250
and the advantage of Passport,
if you have it installed,

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.932
is you can do single
sign-on to any App.net app

00:04:02.932 --> 00:04:04.295
on that platform.

00:04:04.295 --> 00:04:05.920
So if you're a third
party dev, and you

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.849
launch the menu that
integrates with App.net,

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.640
the user will be able
to do single sign-on.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.430
Additionally,
there's a directory

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.250
of all the applications
on that platform,

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.519
so users can easily
discover your application

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.110
if you integrate with us.

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.130
And so the user goes in.

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.380
They can manage their account.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.690
They can change their settings.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.273
They can see what applications
they can do single sign-on are.

00:04:27.273 --> 00:04:30.066
They can be prompted to download
that application to the device,

00:04:30.066 --> 00:04:31.190
and then do single sign-on.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:32.630
Bam, they're in.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.870
So it's a really smooth
user experience for users.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.020
And again, the idea of
having this platform exist,

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.270
of having Passport exist, is to
streamline the user experience

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.380
for any third party dev
that builds a new app.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.622
BRETT SLATKIN: Got you.

00:04:45.622 --> 00:04:47.580
OK, so now I've installed
Passport on my phone.

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.082
I go in there as a
discovery platform.

00:04:50.082 --> 00:04:51.040
I find a bunch of apps.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.220
I install them.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.800
So what are some the apps that
users are using out there?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.960
You said verticals.

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.440
DALTON CALDWELL: Yeah, so one
of them is micro blogging.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.782
And so that's something like
a Twitter like experience

00:05:00.782 --> 00:05:02.490
or a Facebook news
feed experience, where

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.730
you put public
status updates there,

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.010
and people can reply
to them and all that.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.060
The most notable application
in that vertical--

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.200
one of them is called Riposte,
R-I-P-O-S-T-E, on iOS.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.640
There's also Felix.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.847
There's also NetBot.

00:05:15.847 --> 00:05:17.430
Those have all been
featured by Apple.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.230
These aren't just little toys.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.570
These are good enough for Apple
editorial to feature them.

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:26.850
On Android, I think Robin is
definitely the most famous

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.920
of those micro blogging
style services.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.880
BRETT SLATKIN: Got you.

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.180
DALTON CALDWELL: So
that's app vertical.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.140
BRETT SLATKIN: And then, so
the other ones were, I saw,

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.440
photo sharing's
another vertical.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.170
DALTON CALDWELL: Yeah, there's
photo sharing applications.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.711
Again, you can use
the infrastructure

00:05:38.711 --> 00:05:41.530
to build a full photo-only
feed to post photos.

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.877
Because we have
file persistence,

00:05:43.877 --> 00:05:46.210
the files that are updated
are stored in the user's file

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.570
bucket, so users can still
own their own content.

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.480
And so there's Climber
and Sprinter on iOS side.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.112
And I don't think there's a
pure play Android photo client.

00:05:55.112 --> 00:05:56.070
BRETT SLATKIN: Not yet.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.855
DALTON CALDWELL: But
someone should build that.

00:05:56.855 --> 00:05:57.200
BRETT SLATKIN: Someone
should build that.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.770
Sounds good.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.690
And then the other thing,
strong part of App.net

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.430
is kind of messaging
and group messaging.

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.240
So what are some of the
apps that are doing that?

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.700
DALTON CALDWELL: From a
developer's perspective,

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.475
in addition to the public post
API, that's what it's called,

00:06:09.475 --> 00:06:13.350
there's something called
the channels/messages API.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.430
And the idea from
that is you can

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:18.990
send private or
non-private messages

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.740
to a selected group
of people, rather than

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.050
posting it to your feed.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.050
And from this, you can
build what's basically

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.930
group messaging apps, so
imagine WhatsApp or Kik

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.650
or something like that.

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.790
Any third party developer can
use App.net's infrastructure

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:37.380
to build their own group
messaging application,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.560
and all of the back-end
is taken care of.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.410
And we actively
embrace and want people

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.134
to build these as opposed to
having unofficial APIs, which

00:06:45.134 --> 00:06:47.050
is different than some
of those other services

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.430
I just mentioned.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.240
And so if you want to build a
new UI paradigm for doing group

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.012
messaging or doing group photo
messaging or you name it,

00:06:56.012 --> 00:06:56.720
people can do it.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.610
So the most popular
in that vertical right

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.440
now is something called Whisper
on iOS, and it's got stickers.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.940
Yeah.

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.280
BRETT SLATKIN: Like Path.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:05.620
Right?

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.210
DALTON CALDWELL: Yeah, exactly,
it's a lot like Path, actually,

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.084
so it's got stickers.

00:07:09.084 --> 00:07:11.310
You can broadcast your
location to friends.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:12.920
You can do check-ins
with friends

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.530
because we have a location API.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.485
And again, it interoperates
with any other App.net app.

00:07:17.485 --> 00:07:19.110
So if an Android
developer, say, wanted

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.410
to build a group
messaging application,

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:23.160
anyone using Whisper
would be able to talk

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.760
to people using their
application, which

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.384
is pretty cool.

00:07:25.384 --> 00:07:27.080
So given how popular
group messaging is,

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.413
I think there's a lot of
opportunity for developers that

00:07:29.413 --> 00:07:31.570
want to build group
messaging applications.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:32.550
BRETT SLATKIN: Great.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:34.440
So let's move on.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.534
I think that you've shown some
examples of these great apps,

00:07:37.534 --> 00:07:39.950
and we've talked a little bit
about the particulars of why

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.460
developers choose
to use App.net.

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.810
I wanted to get into the
nitty-gritty of the APIs

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:44.310
themselves.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.070
You mentioned a little bit
about channels and the file

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.790
persistency API,
and that's great.

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.240
But I think that,
as a developer,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.602
I'm considering using App.net,
and when I think about that,

00:07:55.602 --> 00:07:57.310
I say, well, what is
it going to save me?

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.780
What do I not have
to do anymore?

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.140
If I choose to use App.net,
where am I starting?

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.214
What's the value that I
get from using your APIs?

00:08:04.214 --> 00:08:05.130
DALTON CALDWELL: Sure.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:07.046
Well, let's talk about
it from the perspective

00:08:07.046 --> 00:08:08.470
of, say, a client developer.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.750
If you're an iOS or Android
developer, right out

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.630
of the gate, there's extremely
high quality, open source,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:18.800
SDKs that wrap all of
our infrastructure,

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.530
so you just drag that right into
your respective text editor.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:27.020
So you get authentication,
so it uses OAuth.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:29.470
And also, you'll get the
single sign-on from Passport.

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:32.250
So authentication is simple.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.610
You get Social
Graph, too, once you

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:35.860
have a user identity set up.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.123
Follows, following,
recommendations,

00:08:38.123 --> 00:08:39.539
all that good stuff
that you would

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.270
get from a standard social API,
you get right out of the box,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:44.087
so you don't have the
blank app problem.

00:08:44.087 --> 00:08:45.920
That's pretty scary
when you're a developer.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.080
And maybe you get all the
technical infrastructure

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.810
working, but you have
a blank database.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:52.365
That's not a-- we've
all been there.

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:52.865
Right?

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:53.940
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah, this
is the new app problem.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:54.560
You get a new app.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:54.905
You install it.

00:08:54.905 --> 00:08:55.800
You don't have any friends.

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.380
You have to send out
emails or something.

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:58.060
DALTON CALDWELL:
It's pretty tough.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:58.400
Right?

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:58.770
BRETT SLATKIN: Right.

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.369
So as a developer,
I spend all my time

00:09:00.369 --> 00:09:01.910
trying to just get
people in the door

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.868
as opposed to focusing
on the actual experience

00:09:03.868 --> 00:09:06.022
that I want to provide to users.

00:09:06.022 --> 00:09:07.480
DALTON CALDWELL:
And that's exactly

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.896
the reason I think
the world needs

00:09:08.896 --> 00:09:12.320
this kind of infrastructure, is
that users should have the best

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:15.230
apps that serve their needs
and choose between those,

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:17.750
as opposed to, oh, this
app has all the network

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.460
effects, this one company, even
though their products aren't

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:21.220
quite as good.

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:23.240
And there's all these
really talented designers

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.610
or talented innovative
UIs being built,

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.810
but because they can't tap
into the large user base,

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:28.730
they're just going
to get squashed.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:29.780
I think that's a shame.

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:30.790
I don't think it's
good for users.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.870
BRETT SLATKIN: Right.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:34.250
OK, so that's the
libraries for iPhone.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.990
You also have a
bunch of libraries

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:38.410
for all the major languages
that are out here.

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:39.560
I saw that.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.210
And then like a RESTful API and
the Cores API for JavaScript

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.850
and the browsers,
so cross domain.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.632
In terms of like the
nitty-gritty specifics-- so

00:09:48.632 --> 00:09:50.132
maybe I can round
these off, and you

00:09:50.132 --> 00:09:51.130
can tell me what each
one of them does.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.290
So there's an account
and authentication APIs.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:54.860
We talked about Password
and single sign-on.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:55.310
DALTON CALDWELL: Yes.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:56.675
BRETT SLATKIN: I also know
there's a two-factor thing that

00:09:56.675 --> 00:09:57.130
you guys--

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.430
DALTON CALDWELL: Yeah, we
have two-factor factor off,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.660
so without you the developer
having to do anything,

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.960
two-factor off on your
App.net account just works.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.420
And it uses the
standard standards,

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.317
so Google Authenticator,
all the-- what is that, OTA?

00:10:08.317 --> 00:10:09.650
What's the name of the standard?

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:10.194
BRETT SLATKIN: OTP, yeah.

00:10:10.194 --> 00:10:11.777
DALTON CALDWELL:
OTP, that just works.

00:10:11.777 --> 00:10:14.220
So any user with
an App.net account,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.335
if they want to turn
on 2FA, they got it.

00:10:16.335 --> 00:10:18.293
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah, and
that's important to me

00:10:18.293 --> 00:10:19.740
because I feel
like I don't trust

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.031
other people with my passwords.

00:10:21.031 --> 00:10:22.830
I'm always very
worried about that.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.580
So when I install a
new app, I'm thinking,

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.538
OK, well, I have to make
up a password for them

00:10:26.538 --> 00:10:28.730
because they probably aren't
managing it correctly,

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:29.813
and that worries me a lot.

00:10:29.813 --> 00:10:32.720
And so it seems like, just
from a user's perspective,

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.710
I like that more that
I can trust maybe

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.220
App.net in the same
way that I trust

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.000
Google with my single sign-on.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:38.450
DALTON CALDWELL: Correct.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.340
BRETT SLATKIN: That's great,
but you guys are providing that.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:41.965
DALTON CALDWELL:
Yeah, so the developer

00:10:41.965 --> 00:10:44.196
doesn't have to do anything,
and 2FA just works.

00:10:44.196 --> 00:10:45.070
BRETT SLATKIN: Great.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.920
And then the other one I saw
was the user streams API,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.260
and that's really interesting.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.520
What does that do
for developers?

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.061
DALTON CALDWELL: So
the streaming API

00:10:52.061 --> 00:10:53.310
is quite powerful.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:56.024
Basically, you get call backs
when different events happen,

00:10:56.024 --> 00:10:57.440
and so you can get
call backs when

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.956
things in the global
stream happen.

00:10:59.956 --> 00:11:01.830
For the user streaming
API, you get call back

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:04.790
events when something
happens on a user's object,

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.140
so if they star something,
if they follow someone,

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.680
if a channel that they're
in-- it's like a group chat.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.830
Like if you ran
group chat client,

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.350
you can have it be very
performant by actually getting

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.830
streams back instead of having
to poll it for new messages.

00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.621
BRETT SLATKIN: And this
is into the browser

00:11:21.621 --> 00:11:24.090
or into the clients, or where
do I get the user streams?

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.465
DALTON CALDWELL: It depends
on what library you're using.

00:11:26.465 --> 00:11:29.402
I mean, if you're using
that iOS SDK, you've got it.

00:11:29.402 --> 00:11:31.860
BRETT SLATKIN: So it'll push
right down to the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:32.550
Yeah.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:33.950
DALTON CALDWELL: It
works out of the box.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:36.116
BRETT SLATKIN: One of the
things that most interests

00:11:36.116 --> 00:11:37.940
me about App.net that
I want to talk about

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:42.210
was how you guys support
open standards and all

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:43.030
the open formats.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:44.840
I was going to go through
the list of all the things

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:46.400
that you support because
it's a laundry list, which

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.840
is really impressive.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.435
So RSS, really simple
syndication feeds, activity

00:11:51.435 --> 00:11:53.560
streams which are kind of
a social version of that.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.472
You support both, I think,
the XML and JSON versions

00:11:56.472 --> 00:11:58.680
of that, which I think nobody
else actually supports,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.675
which is interesting.

00:11:59.675 --> 00:12:02.050
PubSubHubbub, which is something
I worked on, which makes

00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:04.210
feeds real time, which
is great, WebFinger

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.930
for decentralized discovery.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.560
You have microformats built
into all the different pages,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.790
profile pages.

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:13.670
You support Media
RSS and Geo RSS,

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:16.580
and then you also support
IndieAuth and the rel-me auth

00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.390
through some of the link
relations on sites you have.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.332
So you can interoperate
with almost all

00:12:22.332 --> 00:12:24.290
the open standards that
are out there that I've

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.420
heard of that actually
have any kind of usage.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.610
That's awesome, but
why did you do it?

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.380
What's the value in
providing open standards

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:33.957
for App.net users
and developers?

00:12:33.957 --> 00:12:35.790
DALTON CALDWELL: We're
doing it because it's

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:38.020
entirely consistent
with why we're here.

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:41.110
The goal of App.net is to
be a really useful platform

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.820
for users.

00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.892
And the more existing
data, the more ways

00:12:44.892 --> 00:12:47.350
that it can interoperate with
other things in the workflow,

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:50.070
the more valuable we
become to end users

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.280
as well as to developers.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.850
So to just be really
concrete, on the RSS case,

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.380
we built an open source thing
called PourOver-- it also

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:59.520
supports PubSubHubbub-- that
made it really, really simple

00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.420
for any RSS feed to
get ported into posts.

00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.650
That was nice.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:05.820
We supported open standards.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.990
It was open source, so you
can go find it on GitHub.

00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:09.640
But it also provided
tremendous value

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.650
for the users and
developers of App.net

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.440
because a whole lot of RSS
feed started pouring in,

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.190
which made the service
more viable for end users

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:20.090
and for developers.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.530
And so we're doing it because
it's consistent with our goals,

00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.000
our mission, as well as
our business model, which

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.212
is going into the workflow
as much as possible.

00:13:29.212 --> 00:13:30.920
BRETT SLATKIN: And
how does that contrast

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.490
to some of the other
companies out there that

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.864
aren't supporting
open standards.

00:13:33.864 --> 00:13:36.550
I think we talk
about them a lot,

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:39.980
but even Twitter has reduced
the number of RSS feeds.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.200
Google+ still has
no RSS feeds at all.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.660
What's the contrast there?

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:46.390
It's in line with
your principles,

00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:51.010
but at the end of the day,
why isn't everyone adopting

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:52.187
open standards like you are?

00:13:52.187 --> 00:13:54.770
DALTON CALDWELL: I think it has
to come down to business model

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:56.769
motivations, like I know
many of the people that

00:13:56.769 --> 00:13:59.196
work at those other companies,
and I respect them deeply,

00:13:59.196 --> 00:14:00.570
and I've learned
a lot from them.

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:03.029
And when you talk to them,
especially behind closed doors,

00:14:03.029 --> 00:14:05.070
they admit that it's
difficult to make a business

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.160
case for supporting
many of these standards.

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.110
They're not necessarily widely
adopted by their user base.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.920
And if you have
100 million users,

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.370
and your business is to throw
as many interruptive ads

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.910
as you can at people inside
of a first party client,

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.660
it's really hard to
make a business case

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:26.010
for developing and supporting
those particular open

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.010
standards.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:28.946
And in our case, we're
not doing this, again,

00:14:28.946 --> 00:14:30.320
because we think
it's going to be

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.380
great to appeal to people
and then in six months,

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:35.450
change our mind and
deprecate all this stuff.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.160
This is really entirely
consistent with our business

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.700
value, which is
just having as much

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.380
content flow-in and content
flow-out as possible,

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:46.800
to be pipes for more and more
apps to be developed on it.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.900
And so I think it's the business
case argument that, really, we

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:52.069
can tie this stuff back to.

00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:53.985
And I'd love to know if
you agree or disagree.

00:14:53.985 --> 00:14:55.630
BRETT SLATKIN: No, that
makes perfect sense to me.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:56.930
I just want to highlight that.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:57.350
DALTON CALDWELL: Yeah, I know.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.390
I mean, like I said, I've
talked to many people

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:00.181
at those companies.

00:15:00.181 --> 00:15:03.000
And it's very difficult
to make a business case

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.890
to senior management about
why some of those standards

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.090
are going to move the
needle in a financial sense.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:11.530
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah.

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:14.609
So you recently celebrated
a year of App.net,

00:15:14.609 --> 00:15:15.400
so congratulations.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:15.490
DALTON CALDWELL: Thanks.

00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:16.770
BRETT SLATKIN: That's great.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.270
So we've gone over
a ton of features

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.080
already that have
either been at launch

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.715
or been launched
since then, but what

00:15:23.715 --> 00:15:25.090
are some of the
other things that

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.220
have changed over the
last year of App.net?

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.690
DALTON CALDWELL: Well, I
think the most important thing

00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:31.370
from a consumer perspective
is we added the free tier.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.020
We did not have a
free tier at first

00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:36.090
because the service,
essentially, didn't exist.

00:15:36.090 --> 00:15:38.720
And so it was very rough, and we
didn't want a lot of consumers

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.260
to sign up for a service
that's all about third party

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:43.110
apps with no third party apps.

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:46.270
That's definitely the oxymoron
of all time, right there.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:50.230
So we gave developers the API.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.511
They built a bunch of stuff.

00:15:52.511 --> 00:15:53.510
It's quite high quality.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.490
They iterated on it.

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:56.115
Then we launched the
free tier to start

00:15:56.115 --> 00:15:57.580
working on user distribution.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.570
Additionally, we built out the
channels API and the files API.

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.069
Many of the things
we just mentioned

00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:05.740
were launched not at day
one, but every month or two,

00:16:05.740 --> 00:16:07.781
we added more and more things.

00:16:07.781 --> 00:16:09.530
And then finally, the
most important thing

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:12.300
we've been working on is out of
the box experience and new user

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:13.690
experience.

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.310
We realize that, for this to be
very valuable for developers,

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:18.075
we need lots and lots
and lots of users.

00:16:18.075 --> 00:16:20.700
And we need to make it seamless
so that if you build an App.net

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:24.274
app, the users can sign up
and create an account, that

00:16:24.274 --> 00:16:25.940
don't already have
one, without it being

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.880
this complicated,
laborious, painful process.

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.460
So we've been really optimizing
our flows and our marking in

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:36.090
and the power of our engine
to drive people to sign up

00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:38.610
so that the whole ecosystem
can benefit from that.

00:16:38.610 --> 00:16:40.110
And so we've been
spending, frankly,

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.292
a lot of cycles on that
out of the box experience.

00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:44.250
That's why we built
Passport, because we wanted

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:45.624
to make it really
simple and have

00:16:45.624 --> 00:16:47.970
a great experience for just
normal users that aren't

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:52.380
technical, that don't care
about APIs, just to be like,

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:54.460
oh, someone launched a
new group messaging app.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.540
I want to try this out.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.490
Oh, click, click,
click, they're in.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:59.740
We've got to get that right
for this to be successful,

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:01.282
so we've been focusing
on that a lot.

00:17:01.282 --> 00:17:02.698
BRETT SLATKIN: The
other one I saw

00:17:02.698 --> 00:17:04.422
that you launched
over the past year

00:17:04.422 --> 00:17:05.599
was the developer incentive.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:06.140
DALTON CALDWELL:
Oh, that's right.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.181
BRETT SLATKIN: So what is
the developer-- I mean,

00:17:08.181 --> 00:17:09.040
that sounds awesome.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:09.581
What is that?

00:17:09.581 --> 00:17:10.797
What does it mean?

00:17:10.797 --> 00:17:11.380
What do I get?

00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:13.921
DALTON CALDWELL: Sure, well,
the developer incentive program,

00:17:13.921 --> 00:17:17.420
we're paying out $30,000 per
month, no strings attached.

00:17:17.420 --> 00:17:19.079
It's not an investment
or anything.

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.349
It's just a check to
the developers that

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:25.919
build applications that
provide most value to users.

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:28.210
And so the idea is that's a
pool of money that goes out

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.690
every month, and it gets
sliced and diced to go

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:32.690
to different developers
in the incentive program

00:17:32.690 --> 00:17:36.380
depending on how users
rate their apps for how

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.692
much utility they get from it.

00:17:37.692 --> 00:17:38.900
So you can't game the system.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.420
You can't show up and
build some crappy port

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:44.230
and throw it in the store and
expect to make money from it.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:46.350
People have to actually
use it and like it.

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:48.542
But if you build something
that people use and like,

00:17:48.542 --> 00:17:50.500
it means you're going to
have an income stream.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.610
And we did this to help
solve the cold start problem.

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:54.700
We know we're brand new.

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.210
We know we aren't the size of
some of these other platforms,

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.520
but this gives you a huge
leg up out of the gate

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:06.380
to make this worth your
while, worth a shot

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.677
to build application staging.

00:18:07.677 --> 00:18:09.010
Frankly, it's worked quite well.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:09.670
BRETT SLATKIN: What
are you looking forward

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.124
to in the next year of App.net?

00:18:11.124 --> 00:18:12.040
DALTON CALDWELL: Sure.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.210
So we're really focusing
on new user experience,

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:17.290
out of the box experience.

00:18:17.290 --> 00:18:19.960
There's just over
160,000 users right now

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:23.060
as we're recording this,
which is a really solid place

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:23.680
to be at.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.419
It's much bigger than a
lot of companies make it.

00:18:26.419 --> 00:18:27.960
But we're really
focused on what it's

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.990
going to take to get an order
of magnitude more usage out

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:33.160
of the thing and to
take those channels,

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.560
and so that's a really
important piece.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:38.074
Additionally, developers,
now that all the

00:18:38.074 --> 00:18:39.490
Hello, World stuff
has been built,

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:41.770
and now we have high level
APIs that have been built,

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.290
and there's all these
verticals have been populated,

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:47.540
we're supporting developers
that are building more rich,

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.350
deep apps that are
pushing the limits of what

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.790
you can do with a social API.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:56.329
It's, again, what I think the
benefit of our business model

00:18:56.329 --> 00:18:58.870
is, is that we want developers
to push the limits of what you

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:03.090
can do instead of the
lowest common denominator.

00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.565
Like do you know
when a startup is

00:19:04.565 --> 00:19:06.450
on its-- they innovate,
innovative, innovate,

00:19:06.450 --> 00:19:08.380
and then when you get
to a certain size,

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.485
most of your innovation is like
new ad targeting and things.

00:19:10.485 --> 00:19:11.650
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah, you're
like this is good enough.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:12.250
This works in our system.

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:13.150
DALTON CALDWELL: Let's monetize.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:13.630
BRETT SLATKIN: Yes, monetize it.

00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.840
Yeah.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:15.540
DALTON CALDWELL: So
now, what we want to see

00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:18.170
is that developers are using all
of the basics that we have up

00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:20.336
and running, and you can
take that stuff for granted

00:19:20.336 --> 00:19:23.370
and start to push the limits
of what kinds of social apps

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:24.055
you can build.

00:19:24.055 --> 00:19:25.430
Like I never, in
a million years,

00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:27.310
would have thought of Snapchat.

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.900
Would you?

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.640
It's not something--
but someone did,

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:31.690
and clearly there was
big demand for it.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:36.100
So we want to see developers
coming up with mixes and mashes

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.950
for all the-- it's
like Taco Bell.

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.150
You have five ingredients.

00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.200
You can make lots
of things with it.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:40.710
BRETT SLATKIN: Yeah.

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.830
Hopefully, it's more
tasty than that.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:42.330
Yeah.

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:45.020
DALTON CALDWELL: Yeah, so we
have all the Lego building

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:46.940
blocks, and so we want
to support developers

00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.760
that want to push the limits
of what they can do with it.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.110
And I'm really excited.

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.680
I've seen stuff
that it's even hard

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.580
to describe in terms of
personal journaling apps

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:56.515
that the developers
are starting to build.

00:19:56.515 --> 00:19:58.710
It does not neatly fit
into an existing vertical,

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.310
and that's really
exciting to me.

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.726
BRETT SLATKIN:
That's interesting.

00:20:01.726 --> 00:20:03.120
So the API's kind
of enabled them

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.890
to build things that
didn't exist before.

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:05.370
DALTON CALDWELL:
Right, because you're

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:06.700
starting it at this level.

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.600
You're not starting
down here, like oh, it

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:10.542
took me a month of
developing just to get--

00:20:10.542 --> 00:20:11.500
BRETT SLATKIN: Sign-in.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.890
DALTON CALDWELL: Yeah, all this
stuff works out of the box,

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.520
so you can really focus on
taking advantage of, OK, I

00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.390
have a social graph.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:19.700
I have a user base.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.070
I have a file storage API.

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.180
I have geolocation.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.430
It just works, so how can
I glue this stuff together

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.425
to make really compelling
user experiences?

00:20:28.425 --> 00:20:30.550
And I think that's what
this era of apps are about,

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.055
is that the app store--
the gold rush over.

00:20:33.055 --> 00:20:34.430
If developers want
to learn more,

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:36.730
they can go to
developers.app.net.

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:39.849
And because it's a social
service, we're all on it,

00:20:39.849 --> 00:20:40.890
so we're easy to talk to.

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:42.760
If you want to ask me
a question directly,

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.495
my username on App.net
is dalton, D-A-L-T-O-N,

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.010
and I'd love to hear from you.

00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:48.650
BRETT SLATKIN: That's all
the time we have today.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.108
Thanks for joining
us with App.net,

00:20:50.108 --> 00:20:52.140
and we'll see you next time.
