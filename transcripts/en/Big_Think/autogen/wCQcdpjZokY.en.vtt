so 500 years ago Galileo said that the

so 500 years ago Galileo said that the
 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:07.889
so 500 years ago Galileo said that the
book of nature is written in a language

00:00:07.889 --> 00:00:07.899
book of nature is written in a language
 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.619
book of nature is written in a language
of mathematics and this really turned

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:10.629
of mathematics and this really turned
 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:12.749
of mathematics and this really turned
out to be true for for physics it was

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:12.759
out to be true for for physics it was
 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.299
out to be true for for physics it was
really incredibly powerful in

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309
really incredibly powerful in
 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.540
really incredibly powerful in
understanding physical phenomena and for

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550
understanding physical phenomena and for
 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.640
understanding physical phenomena and for
some strange reason and it really nobody

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650
some strange reason and it really nobody
 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.530
some strange reason and it really nobody
understands it just turned out to be not

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:22.540
understands it just turned out to be not
 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.500

very powerful at describing biological

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:25.510
very powerful at describing biological
 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.730
very powerful at describing biological
phenomenon and in fact we have a lot of

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740
phenomenon and in fact we have a lot of
 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.350
phenomenon and in fact we have a lot of
mathematical tools now we use to

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:31.360
mathematical tools now we use to
 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.389

language and I think that our study

language and I think that our study
 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.090
language and I think that our study
really adds to a growing body of

really adds to a growing body of
 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.639
really adds to a growing body of
evidence that the language of the brain

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649
evidence that the language of the brain
 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.209
evidence that the language of the brain
is statistics that the brain operates as

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219
is statistics that the brain operates as
 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.849
is statistics that the brain operates as
a statistical engine it's not a logical

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:53.859
a statistical engine it's not a logical
 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.750
a statistical engine it's not a logical
engine based on reason but a statistical

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760
engine based on reason but a statistical
 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.189
engine based on reason but a statistical
engine based on evidence and if you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199
engine based on evidence and if you
 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.039
engine based on evidence and if you
think about it your legs couldn't tell

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049
think about it your legs couldn't tell
 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:08.969
think about it your legs couldn't tell
you

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979
you
 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.789
you
Newton's laws but they still obey them

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:11.799
Newton's laws but they still obey them
 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.969
Newton's laws but they still obey them
and of course your brain

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979
and of course your brain
 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.050
and of course your brain
might not be able to explain the laws of

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060
might not be able to explain the laws of
 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.430
might not be able to explain the laws of
statistics but it's still based on

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440
 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.270

what's relevant about it that we need to

you simulate the brain but can you
