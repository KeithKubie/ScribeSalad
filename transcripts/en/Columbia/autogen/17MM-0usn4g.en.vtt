aspirations higher ambition and there
 

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.199
aspirations higher ambition and there
are a lot of good effects but the other

00:16:06.199 --> 00:16:06.209
are a lot of good effects but the other
 

00:16:06.209 --> 00:16:09.829
are a lot of good effects but the other
thing that we see is if your aspirations

00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839
thing that we see is if your aspirations
 

00:16:09.839 --> 00:16:11.960
thing that we see is if your aspirations
start to rise but then there is no

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:11.970
start to rise but then there is no
 

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:14.570
start to rise but then there is no
opportunity it can lead to fragility

we're going down this is that this is
 

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:40.430
we're going down this is that this is
the collision that we we're seeing high

views and in fact when I was in graduate
 

00:24:14.769 --> 00:24:16.529

organized one of the things that struck
me and this was in teaching the

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:40.750
me and this was in teaching the
 

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:43.320
me and this was in teaching the
introductory anthropology course as a

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:43.330
introductory anthropology course as a
 

00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.360
introductory anthropology course as a
graduate student one of the things that

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:45.370
graduate student one of the things that
 

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:48.509
graduate student one of the things that
struck me is that the the drive toward

00:24:48.509 --> 00:24:48.519
struck me is that the the drive toward
 

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:51.360

I remember stories that we were telling
 

00:25:02.169 --> 00:25:07.440
I remember stories that we were telling
about about the bones of of ancient

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:07.450
about about the bones of of ancient
 

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.119

peoples I mean tens of thousands of

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:09.129
peoples I mean tens of thousands of
 

00:25:09.129 --> 00:25:12.509
peoples I mean tens of thousands of
years prior where you could tell that

00:25:12.509 --> 00:25:12.519
years prior where you could tell that
 

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:14.970
years prior where you could tell that
there was an older gentleman who had a

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:14.980
there was an older gentleman who had a
 

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:17.970
there was an older gentleman who had a
handicap his entire life and so

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:17.980
handicap his entire life and so
 

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:19.590
handicap his entire life and so
literally would have had to be carried

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600

so this the sense that human solidarity

00:25:24.629 --> 00:25:24.639
so this the sense that human solidarity
 

00:25:24.639 --> 00:25:26.999

survive all these years as a species was
 

00:25:31.629 --> 00:25:35.970
survive all these years as a species was
core now at that time you know for me I

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:35.980
core now at that time you know for me I
 

00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:37.860
core now at that time you know for me I
remember graduate school it's just like

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:37.870
remember graduate school it's just like
 

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.619
remember graduate school it's just like
an idyllic experience where I could

00:25:40.619 --> 00:25:40.629
an idyllic experience where I could
 

00:25:40.629 --> 00:25:42.419
an idyllic experience where I could
spend a whole day reading a book and

00:25:42.419 --> 00:25:42.429
spend a whole day reading a book and
 

00:25:42.429 --> 00:25:44.879

sitting in cafeterias talking to people

00:25:44.879 --> 00:25:44.889
sitting in cafeterias talking to people
 

00:25:44.889 --> 00:25:49.019
sitting in cafeterias talking to people
but eventually as I finished I asked

00:25:49.019 --> 00:25:49.029
but eventually as I finished I asked
 

00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:50.519
but eventually as I finished I asked
myself the question so what do I do

00:25:50.519 --> 00:25:50.529
myself the question so what do I do
 

00:25:50.529 --> 00:25:53.039
myself the question so what do I do
what what is what is my responsibility

going to do it on the basis of a
 

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:24.190
going to do it on the basis of a
philosophy and the philosophy that we

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200
philosophy and the philosophy that we
 

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:28.390
philosophy and the philosophy that we
adopted came from liberation theologians

00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400
adopted came from liberation theologians
 

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.390
adopted came from liberation theologians
and many of those ideas were were

00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:31.400

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:38.150
a preferential option for the poor and
 

00:26:38.150 --> 00:26:40.000

the poor in health care and we felt that

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:42.830
the poor in health care and we felt that
 

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.940
the poor in health care and we felt that
it was a much more powerful idea than

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:45.950
it was a much more powerful idea than
 

00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:47.620

found so the dark blue is human capital

00:51:20.079 --> 00:51:20.089
found so the dark blue is human capital
 

00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:23.079
found so the dark blue is human capital
the lighter blue is produced capital

00:51:23.079 --> 00:51:23.089
the lighter blue is produced capital
 

00:51:23.089 --> 00:51:25.329
the lighter blue is produced capital
meaning you know factories and things

00:51:25.329 --> 00:51:25.339
meaning you know factories and things
 

00:51:25.339 --> 00:51:27.309

you know the natural resources energy
resources and what we found is that

00:51:39.849 --> 00:51:39.859
resources and what we found is that
 

00:51:39.859 --> 00:51:42.459
resources and what we found is that
human capital is so much more important

00:51:42.459 --> 00:51:42.469
human capital is so much more important
 

00:51:42.469 --> 00:51:44.259
human capital is so much more important
as part of the overall wealth of nations

now some of you may say why you keep

00:51:53.799 --> 00:51:53.809
now some of you may say why you keep
 

00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:55.059
now some of you may say why you keep
saying human capital they're human

so human capital is huge now this is

00:52:16.239 --> 00:52:16.249
so human capital is huge now this is
 

00:52:16.249 --> 00:52:20.219
so human capital is huge now this is
huge this is overall wealth this is

00:52:20.219 --> 00:52:20.229
huge this is overall wealth this is
 

00:52:20.229 --> 00:52:23.469

natural produced and human capital per
 

00:52:23.479 --> 00:52:25.719
natural produced and human capital per
capita so you can see the high income

00:52:25.719 --> 00:52:25.729

is human capital the middle-income

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:32.690
is human capital the middle-income

is human capital the middle-income
countries have a lot less at look at the

00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:34.130
countries have a lot less at look at the
 

00:52:34.130 --> 00:52:36.279
countries have a lot less at look at the
low income countries this is how much

00:52:36.279 --> 00:52:36.289
low income countries this is how much
 

00:52:36.289 --> 00:52:37.930
low income countries this is how much
the low income countries have to catch

00:52:37.930 --> 00:52:37.940
the low income countries have to catch
 

00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:40.599
the low income countries have to catch
up in terms of human capital if they

00:52:40.599 --> 00:52:40.609
up in terms of human capital if they
 

00:52:40.609 --> 00:52:42.359
up in terms of human capital if they
want to compete in the digital economy

now
 

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.030
now
the question then is how do we change

00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040
the question then is how do we change
 

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.460
the question then is how do we change

overcome in many many developing
 

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:26.179
overcome in many many developing
countries and so that's why we created

01:22:26.179 --> 01:22:26.189
countries and so that's why we created
 

01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:29.600
