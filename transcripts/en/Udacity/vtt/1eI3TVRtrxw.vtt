00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.404
So now we know how to read
the intercepts off of the graph.

00:00:03.404 --> 00:00:09.046
But we also learned something else
interesting here, at the x-intercept,

00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:14.625
the y value is always 0, and at the
y-intercept, the x value is always 0.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:17.300
I think we can use that to do
something pretty interesting.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.690
What these facts are going to let us
do is find the intercepts of a graph

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.580
without actually seeing the graph,
just by looking at the equation.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.350
Let's say we had this equation.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.329
I can find the x-intercept of this
equation by setting the y value to 0 and

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:33.705
then solving for x.

00:00:33.705 --> 00:00:41.600
So in this case 2x + 0 = 6,
divide both sides by 2, and x = 3.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.970
So it looks like
the x-intercept would be at 3,0.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.450
And to find the y-intercept, well,
I know the x values going to be 0.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.205
So I'm going to start
in my same equation.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:55.184
But now I'm going to set x = 0 and
solve for y.

00:00:55.184 --> 00:00:57.238
Well, 2 times 0 is just 0,

00:00:57.238 --> 00:01:01.945
this tells me that y = 6 which
means the y-intercept is at 0,6.

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:04.876
Then once I have my points, I can draw
a line to connect them, and there,

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:05.940
I have my graph.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.614
Maybe you can answer a question for
me now.

00:01:07.614 --> 00:01:10.938
What are the intercepts of 3x- 2y = 12?

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:14.768
Enter the x and y-intercept as x,
y coordinate pairs.

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:16.039
