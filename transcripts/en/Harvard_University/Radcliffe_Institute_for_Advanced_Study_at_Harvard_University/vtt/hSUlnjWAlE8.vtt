00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.270
- Good morning, everyone.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.290
It's great to see you all here.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.259
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.550
I'm Dean of the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.270
And I am so pleased to welcome
you to our annual science

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.140
symposium which focuses
our attention this year

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.240
on modern epidemics.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.480
Radcliffe is Harvard's
Institute for advanced study,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.730
and we have a two-fold mission.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.630
We are dedicated to advancing
deep inquiry and pathbreaking

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.810
research that cuts
across the boundaries

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.270
of traditional
academic disciplines.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.910
And we are also
committed to sharing

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.270
this multi-disciplinary
work with a broad public

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.360
through a full calendar of free
events like today's symposium.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.520
I am especially glad to
have science teacher John

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.850
Ruggiero and his students
from Eugene Wright Science

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.750
and Technology Academy in
Chelsea here with us today.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.480
If they're here,
would they wave?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.110
Have they come?

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.734
There they are.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:05.220
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.140
It's never too soon to
come to an event like this.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.970
Epidemics is an ideal topic for
interdisciplinary exploration.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.950
Today, we will probe challenges
and innovations in epidemiology

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.080
with the help of
epidemiologists,

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.430
data scientists, physicians,
journalists, public officials,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.820
infectious disease
researchers, and sociologists

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.170
from across the United
States and around the world.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.690
We at the Radcliffe
Institute are particularly

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.770
proud of our long tradition
of supporting programming

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.470
and research in
the sciences, not

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.320
only at an annual
symposium like this one,

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.520
but throughout the year.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.970
For example, we have an
ongoing lecture series

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.930
on epidemics that complements
today's symposium.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.750
Last week, Dean Sandro
Galea of the School

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.090
of Public Health at
Boston University

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.410
delivered the first installment
to a standing-room-only crowd.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.830
In the spring, we will continue
the series with lectures

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.120
on fibromyalgia, poverty,
obesity, and Alzheimer's.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.910
For more information on these
and other upcoming events,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.690
please visit the Radcliffe
Institute website

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.520
or take one of
our calendar cards

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.520
which are available at the
back of the room or downstairs

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.920
at the registration table.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.830
All of Radcliffe's
events are made possible

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.010
by our supporters, many of
whom are here with us today.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.010
And I'm particularly
happy to see members

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.650
of the Radcliffe Institute's
Dean's Advisory Council

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.920
this morning.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.190
Thank you all for
your generosity

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.780
which ensures that
we can continue

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.480
to make our lectures,
our exhibitions,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.780
our conferences like today,
and many other aspects

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.920
of our programming free
and open to the public.

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.120
Now, today's topic
is urgent and timely.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.300
Our panelists will offer
insight into the science

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.760
and the social roots
behind the epidemics

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.370
that we read about
on a regular basis,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:09.680
from Ebola, Zika, HIV/AIDS,
malaria, and Lyme disease,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.940
to gun violence, opioid
addiction, and depression.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.440
We all come to this subject
with our own perspective.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.200
As an historian,
my orientation is

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.670
to locate events in the larger
social and historical context

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.590
in which they arise.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.550
Whether an epidemic unfolds
during China's Tang dynasty

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.930
or amid preparations for the
Rio Olympics just last year,

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.710
a society's response to
a fast-spreading illness

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.280
is shaped not just by the
capabilities and limitations

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.550
of medical science at that
particular moment in time,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.460
but also by complex social
factors such as race,

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.180
class, gender, and religion.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.320
For an historian, epidemics
can provide a revealing window

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.010
into a society at a
particular moment in history.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.280
Let me give you one example
from our own backyard here

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.370
in Boston, the smallpox
epidemic in Boston of 1721.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.820
By the 1700s,
smallpox inoculation

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.269
had been practiced for
centuries in parts of Africa,

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.120
as well as in
China and in India.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.940
In colonial Boston,
however, the practice

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.220
was virtually unheard of.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.270
That changed when an enslaved
man, called Onesimus,

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.360
told the Puritan religious
leader, Cotton Mather,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.740
about a practice common among
his tribe in North Africa,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.190
a procedure that protected
him against smallpox, leaving

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.190
only a small scar on his arm.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.280
A few years later, when
a smallpox epidemic

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.850
broke out in Boston
in 1721, Mather

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:52.370
recalled Onesimus's words.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.660
And he became an outspoken
advocate for inoculation.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.080
Many white Christians
in Boston mocked Mather

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.410
for relying on the
testimony of an enslaved man

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.730
and denounced inoculation for
its roots in Africa and Asia,

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.280
calling it a heathen practice.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.310
Other Bostonians simply
rejected the idea

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.600
of deliberately infecting
healthy people with a disease.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.020
By August of 1721,
the controversy

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.500
had become so heated that
someone threw a grenade

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.180
through Mather's window.

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.250
The grenade didn't
detonate, but Mather

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.590
found a note attached
to it, which read,

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.050
and I quote, "I'll inoculate you
with this with a pox to you,"

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.440
end quote.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.650
A few Bostonians did
support immunizations,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.980
including Dr.
Zabdiel Boylston, who

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.340
would go on to perform
America's first inoculations

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.030
on his own child and
two enslaved people.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.550
But Mather's appeals
were largely ignored.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.150
Smallpox spread unchecked.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:00.470
And by the end of the
epidemic in 1722, over half

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.650
of Boston's population
had fallen ill.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:06.090
More than 800 died.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.880
The story of Boston's
smallpox outbreak

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.810
reveals much more than
the spread of a pathogen.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.590
It is a story about racial
prejudices in colonial New

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.520
England, about the rigidities
of Boston's society,

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.740
and about the
forgotten contributions

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:26.850
of enslaved Africans to
American medical practice.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.550
Still today, how
epidemics unfold around

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.150
the world is shaped by
complicated interactions

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:36.540
between medical advancements
and the social and political

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.720
factors that inform
and complicate

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.410
the work of epidemiology.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.260
50 years ago, many
scientists considered

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.740
the age of infectious
disease to be over.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.320
The rise of antibiotics
and vaccines

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.800
was considered a triumph
of modern medicine.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.440
But today, diseases
we thought were gone

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.270
seem to be reappearing.

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.490
For example, mumps
went from being

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.000
common to being unheard
of after the introduction

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.900
of the measles, mumps, and
rubella vaccine in 1971.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.370
But it has returned to Harvard
and elsewhere in recent years.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.550
Other contagious diseases
are also on the rise,

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:20.000
thanks in part to globalization
and global travel,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.010
environmental change, population
growth, and many other factors.

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:29.480
In addition, we are increasingly
aware of non-infectious disease

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.380
epidemics, often with
complicated social roots.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:36.800
We will explore these topics
during our afternoon session

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:42.290
today with experts on guns,
opioids, and mental health.

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:44.810
With all of that
in mind, I am very

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.830
grateful that today's symposium
will offer us a chance

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.800
to wrestle with these
complex issues which

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.980
are no less urgent and
less challenging today

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.830
than they were in 1721.

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:00.830
Today, however, we are
armed with big data,

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:06.200
new analytical tools, new
technology, and new expertise,

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.920
which our distinguished
panelists, I am sure,

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.760
will bring to bear.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.420
Here's how the day
is going to work.

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:17.810
Professor Janet Rich-Edwards,
the symposium's organizer,

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.700
will offer framing
remarks in just a moment.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.660
And then we will dive
right into the first panel.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.290
After each panel or
individual speaker,

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.350
we will open the floor
to your questions.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.890
We'll put a microphone
in the center aisle.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.770
We invite you to step
up to introduce yourself

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.460
and then to ask your question.

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.500
During the lunch
break, I invite you

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.720
to pick up a bag lunch, which
we will have available for you

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.370
downstairs, and then to
join us for a student poster

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:48.070
session next door in Fay House.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:51.910
Students from the Harvard TH
Chan School of Public Health,

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.360
Harvard Medical School, the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences,

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.750
and the Division of
Continuing Education

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.680
will be present to
share their research

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.160
with you, with our speakers,
and with other guests.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.050
The poster session
will be open as well

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.870
during the reception, which
will also be in Fay House

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.570
at the conclusion of
today's symposium.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.610
And I very much hope you
will stay and join us

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.510
for that as well.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.990
Finally, I want to
express my deep thanks

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.360
to Janet Rich-Edwards
for organizing

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.880
such an outstanding symposium.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.540
Janet is Radcliffe's Faculty
Director for the Life Sciences,

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.930
as well as an alum of Harvard
and Radcliffe colleges.

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:32.170
She is an epidemiologist with
dual faculty appointments

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.750
at Harvard's Medical School
and the Harvard TH Chan

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.250
School of Public Health.

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.880
She also serves as director
of developmental epidemiology

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:42.190
at the Connors Center for
Women's Health and Gender

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:45.050
Biology at Brigham
and Women's Hospital.

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:48.437
So, please join me now in
warmly welcoming Janet.

00:09:48.437 --> 00:09:52.333
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.430
- Thank you, Liz.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.860
I am so thrilled to
see a full house today

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.867
because this is going to be
a really exciting program.

00:10:03.867 --> 00:10:06.200
I'm going to take just a few
minutes to frame the agenda

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.810
and give you some context
for our young science

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.540
of epidemiology.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:14.210
Chances are when you
think of epidemics,

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.220
you think of infectious disease.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:18.950
And indeed, you'd be correct
that the roots of epidemiology

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:22.220
lie in concerns about diseases
like the bubonic plague,

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.200
cholera, and the flu.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.240
These diseases
have long captured

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.520
our imagination and our fears.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.970
Here is a 17th century
painting by Flemish artist,

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:36.530
Michael Sweerts of one of the
first epidemics ever recorded

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.640
in history.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.390
The date is 430 BC,
and we're in Athens,

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.880
in the middle of the
Peloponnesian War.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:46.610
1/3 to 2/3 of the
city of Athens was

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:48.860
struck by a strange disease.

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.440
And most who became ill died.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.960
Thucydides, the
historian, himself

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.790
survived to describe
the epidemic,

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:58.670
a disease so severe and
deadly that no one could

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:00.940
recall anywhere it's like.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:03.200
And naive physicians were
the first to contract

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.420
the disease due to their
contact with the sick.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:10.030
Thucydides recounted tales of
terrifying social upheaval,

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.160
of the disappearance
of social morals,

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.100
because people felt they were
living under a death sentence.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:17.950
Citizens started spending
money indiscriminately.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:19.690
Plus, some of the
poor, he noted,

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:22.300
unexpectedly became wealthy
by inheriting the property

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:23.580
of their relatives.

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.570
Got to watch out for
those nouveau riche.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.394
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.410
In fact, the disease
changed history.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:35.080
Although the Spartans,
seeing the funeral pyres

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.810
burning in Athens,
retreated rather than

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.580
come in contact
with the disease,

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.520
Athens itself was weakened.

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.960
Pericles, the general,
succumbed, and was followed

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.920
by a series of weak leaders.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.000
The next offensive Athens
launched was a disaster.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.940
But Thucydides was
no epidemiologist.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.600
So the cause of the plague
of Athens was, and still is,

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.980
a medical mystery.

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.920
Epidemiologists today debate
what caused the epidemic,

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.720
whether it was the
bubonic plague,

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.040
typhoid fever, or
perhaps even Ebola.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.050
It wasn't until the
mid-18th century

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:13.620
before Westerners began to take
a systematic look at epidemics.

00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:16.290
John Graunt, here, the
son of a London draper,

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.989
had a native curiosity and
a knack for statistics,

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:21.030
and made his way into the
Fellowship of the Royal

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:23.370
Society.

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.110
He published the first analyses
of the bills of mortality,

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.890
London's death registry.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:34.440
Here's what he recorded for
December 1742 to December 1743.

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:39.750
The leading causes of death, you
can see here, are convulsions,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:42.270
which I'm wondering if
that might be heart disease

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:46.170
because it's so prevalent;
consumption, which, of course,

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.980
we know of as tuberculosis--
see if I can see this here--

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:56.320
fever, no surprise,
old age, smallpox--

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.440
they apparently hadn't
heard of the vaccine yet--

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.240
and, horribly, teeth.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.740
I think that must be a
terrible way to go, frankly.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.800
Conspicuously absent are our
modern diseases-- cancer,

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.500
only 61 deaths, and
diabetes, one death.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.604
In fact, you were more
likely to die from evil

00:13:14.604 --> 00:13:15.770
than you were from diabetes.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:19.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:23.480
Some exotic
diseases, including--

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:25.130
I can't read that from here--

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:29.410
headmold shot, horseshoe
head, and water in the head.

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.097
And my favorite, I
think the only way to go

00:13:32.097 --> 00:13:33.180
is a rising of the lights.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:36.404
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:40.500
John Graunt made these
lists in an attempt

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.380
to predict waves of the
plague, which he didn't quite

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.430
manage to do.

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:46.470
But he's the father of
the most fundamental

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:49.590
of epidemiologic tasks,
the classification

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:53.290
and counting of disease.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.690
Some hundred years later
in London, John Graunt

00:13:55.690 --> 00:13:58.760
would be followed by one
John Snow, a physician.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.850
Now, the epidemiologists
in the audience

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.160
would be permitted
a collective groan

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.920
because this story is the
equivalent of our Washington

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.050
and the cherry trees.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.990
This is our first known
use of medical statistics

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:13.690
to actually resolve the
cause of an epidemic.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.810
It focuses on a particular
neighborhood of London

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:20.530
which was experiencing
an outbreak of cholera.

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.840
At the time, the advice
of the Medical Council

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.450
was to avoid vegetables
and unripe fruit

00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:29.680
and to abstain from cold water
when heated and ardent spirits,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:33.080
unless, of course, habit
made that impossible.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.647
In fact, boiled water
and ardent spirits

00:14:35.647 --> 00:14:37.480
may have been the safest
beverages in London

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:40.100
to drink at the time.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:44.150
But the prevailing theory
among the people of London

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.210
was that cholera arose
from miasma, or vapors

00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.710
from the Thames.

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:50.960
This is 1854 London.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.610
And although the
concept of germ theory

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:56.240
had been proposed by Wu Youke
at the turn of the 16th century

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.510
in Ming Dynasty
China, in 1854 London,

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.850
the germ theory of
disease wouldn't grab hold

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.670
for another 50 years.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.250
John Snow took it
upon himself to obtain

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.400
a map of the effected district
and to plot every cholera death

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.660
on that map.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:14.300
This is what we call
shoe-leather epidemiology,

00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.570
the close, geographic
investigation of outbreaks.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:19.940
The basic principle of
shoe-leather epidemiology

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:21.680
is one we still
use, whether we're

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.770
tracing syphilis contacts,
the spread of Ebola,

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.060
or investigating the
quintessential foodborne

00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:31.010
illness we classically call
the church picnic problem.

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.250
John Snow went one step further
than just mapping the cases.

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:37.220
He also mapped the lines that
supplied London's drinking

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:39.484
water through
neighborhood pumps.

00:15:39.484 --> 00:15:41.150
There were two companies
supplying water

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:42.380
to the neighborhood.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.510
The Lambeth Waterworks,
here in blue,

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.780
drew its water upstream from
the London sewage effluent

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.000
in the Thames, while the
Southwark and Vauxhall

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.020
Company, shown here in gold,
drew its water downstream

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:55.580
from the Thames sewage.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.830
Snow traced the source
of cholera to the latter,

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.550
and in particular, to a
hand pump on Broad Street.

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.132
Now, you might ask
about the women

00:16:04.132 --> 00:16:06.590
who died from cholera-- those
who lived next door to a pump

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:08.480
from the cleaner Lambeth line.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.270
Turns out she had just moved
there from Broad Street

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.972
and sent for water daily from
the old Broad Street pump

00:16:13.972 --> 00:16:15.305
because she preferred its taste.

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:22.050
Famously, John Snow removed the
handle of the Broad Street pump

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:23.640
and cured London of cholera.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.560
He's considered
by most Westerners

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.610
to be the father of
modern epidemiology.

00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:31.240
Here is a map of modern London.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.280
And you could still visit
the old Broad Street pump--

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.810
it's now Broadwick Street--

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:38.900
which is located right between
the Anthropologie store

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.430
and Chipotle Mexican Grill.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:43.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.142
But the second greatest
plague the world has ever

00:16:47.142 --> 00:16:49.100
known-- the first was
actually the Black Death,

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:52.580
the plague itself, bubonic
plague in the 14th century.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:56.780
The second greatest plague
is the influenza of 1918,

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:00.170
also known as the Spanish flu
It swept the globe, infecting

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.500
nearly a third of all people
and killing between 20 and 50

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.400
million, more than died
in all of World War I.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.859
Downton Abbey fans
will recall that

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:13.040
the Spanish flu with the
demise of Miss Lavinia Swire.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.770
Critics of the show complained
that the entire household

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.200
of Lord Grantham would
have been gripped in fear

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.480
of catching the disease.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.440
And dear Matthew
would probably not

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.599
have been quite as
attentive as pictured here.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:29.630
In fact, the decline of
infectious disease mortality

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.940
due to the advent of
antibiotics and vaccines

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.550
in the mid-20th century
is one of public health's

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.110
great triumphs.

00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:39.620
You can see here that
diphtheria, typhoid,

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.080
and whooping cough,
also known as pertussis,

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:45.860
declined quickly due to the
DPT vaccine we give children.

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:48.500
Measles, too, is
prevented by vaccine,

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:52.620
and scarlet fever is
treated by antibiotics.

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:54.950
But we are still in
the grip of contagion,

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:58.340
including some new diseases
and modern causes of mortality.

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.590
Can anyone guess
which one this is?

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.840
Feel free to call out.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:03.660
And if you have a--

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:04.159
Zika.

00:18:04.159 --> 00:18:04.920
Very good.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.970
This is Zika.

00:18:05.970 --> 00:18:07.830
We'll be hearing today
about the Zika virus

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:11.670
from Dr. Celina Turchi
Martelli in the first panel.

00:18:11.670 --> 00:18:13.479
How about this one?

00:18:13.479 --> 00:18:15.270
No fair calling it out
if you have funding.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.230
- Lyme.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:18.470
- Lyme, exactly.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:19.550
Lyme disease.

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.560
Dr. Kevin Esfelt
of MIT will tell us

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:25.150
about Lyme and some
provocative ways to combat it.

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:28.850
This one, which
has local issues--

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:32.750
here is our dear commonwealth
2011 to 2013, 2014

00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:35.090
to 2016-- exactly, opiates.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:38.790
These are deaths
from drug overdose.

00:18:38.790 --> 00:18:40.290
We'll be talking about that.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:43.170
Dr. Andrew Kolodny will
join us in the afternoon

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:47.240
in a session devoted to
epidemics with social roots.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:47.800
And this one.

00:18:52.165 --> 00:18:52.790
- Gun violence.

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.050
- Good guess, gun violence.

00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:55.150
This his gun ownership.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:19:00.430
But owning a gun does not mean
you will be injured by a gun.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.820
Here, you can see homicides by
firearms per 1 million people.

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.820
We really-- oh, bad choice
of words-- trump everybody

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.620
else in this arena.

00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:12.490
Dr. Andrew Papachristos,
a sociologist from Yale,

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:15.340
will address the application
of epidemiologic principles

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.300
to understand and combat
the spread of gun violence.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.200
The good news is that we have
new tools as epidemiologists.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.090
Through our understandings
of pathogens and DNA,

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:29.380
we now use techniques with names
like molecular epidemiology

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.630
and genetic epidemiology,
about which you'll

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:33.460
hear throughout the day.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.160
We also have new
techniques of manipulating

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.360
the genome of disease vectors
like mosquitoes and mice.

00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.510
You'll hear about the concept
of gene drive before lunch.

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:46.070
And after lunch,
the panel will--

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:49.720
well, after lunch, a panel
will address the exciting gains

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:51.640
and the analytic
challenges of big data

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.420
epidemiology, where everything
from the legions of bacteria

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:58.930
in the microbiome of your
gut to cell phone records

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.690
can be used to trace,
understand, and predict

00:20:01.690 --> 00:20:03.680
epidemics.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.770
We'll also discuss
the tension between

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:09.190
private and public sector
data and the concept

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:10.909
of open science.

00:20:10.909 --> 00:20:12.700
At the end of the day,
our keynote speaker,

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:14.860
Laurie Garrett, author
of The Coming Plague

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:17.080
and member of the Council
on Foreign Relations,

00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.510
will address the role of
international politics,

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:25.180
of globalization and isolation
in the role of countries

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:28.000
responding to epidemics.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.940
This is CDC's list of
the top 10 public health

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:32.880
victories of the 20th century.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.040
Epidemiology, the young
science, played a central role

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.940
in achieving all 10 of them.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.051
After all, epidemiology is
the science of public health,

00:20:41.051 --> 00:20:42.550
whether we're talking
about diseases

00:20:42.550 --> 00:20:47.290
caused by pathogens or diseases
with pathogenic social causes.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:49.540
I'm excited about the chance
to learn about the coming

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.990
challenges, and hopefully
victories, of epidemiology

00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:55.500
in the 21st century.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.900
And now, it's my pleasure
to invite our first panel

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.380
to the stage.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:00.630
Why don't you guys come on up?

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:03.582
And I will introduce to
you Dr. Marcia Castro.

00:21:03.582 --> 00:21:05.040
Throughout the day,
we'll just give

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:06.210
really quick introductions.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:09.960
You've got in your program
full bios for each speaker.

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.784
So, Marcia Castro is
an Associate Professor

00:21:11.784 --> 00:21:13.200
in the Department
of Global Health

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:17.070
and Population at the Harvard
TH Chan School of Public Health,

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:19.650
and a Faculty Associate
at the Harvard University

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.580
Center for the Environment.

00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:24.270
She's published extensively on
the epidemiology and control

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.420
of infectious diseases,
environment and health,

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.600
spatial methods, and health,
particularly in Brazil.

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.868
Please join me in
welcoming Marcia Castro.

00:21:32.868 --> 00:21:36.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.040
- Thanks, Janet.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.570
Good morning, everybody.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.570
Once again, thank you so
much for putting together

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:49.210
an event with such an
incredible and important topic.

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:51.420
And our first panel
we will go straight

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.600
into infectious diseases in
this new era of epidemics.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.590
And I think what really makes
it a new era is that we're not

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.060
discussing anymore of if we're
going to have another outbreak.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:02.970
We know we will.

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.520
It's just a matter of
when and what pathogen is

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.730
going to be this new outbreak.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.040
We live in a time that
everything moves faster--

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:15.500
people, information,
goods, but also pathogens.

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.580
And that makes it
really challenge when

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:19.560
we have one of those outbreaks.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:23.370
And in the very first
moment of an epidemic when

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:26.560
cases are going up and
everything is under chaos,

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.280
we have many challenges
that we have to address.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.970
How do you find those cases?

00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:32.190
How do you contain?

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.980
Do you have tools to
be able to treat them?

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.780
How do you deliver
this treatment?

00:22:36.780 --> 00:22:39.360
Do you have health systems
that are strong enough

00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:42.240
to be able to be in the
field finding the people

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.270
and delivering the response?

00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:47.280
We can't forget
all the challenges

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:51.000
of blending the different
institutions in the government.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.720
But also different bodies,
national and international--

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.330
they're going to be in the field
of responding to this epidemic.

00:22:58.330 --> 00:23:01.560
Let's not forget also
about the ethical

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.580
and the legal challenges
in prioritizing responses

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:09.190
depending on the epidemic
we are talking about.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.080
So there are also another
phase that comes afterwards,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:17.130
which is when people basically
say the outbreak is over,

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:20.490
which raises the
question, when is it over?

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.290
Is it ever over?

00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:23.820
Which is an important one--

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.610
tends to be neglected, which
is to look at the aftermath.

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:31.500
So what happens after
the epidemic is not

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.120
in the spotlight anymore?

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.600
What are the consequences?

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.690
What are the sequela
of the disease?

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:40.380
But above all, let's look
at the social, the economic,

00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:44.910
and the broad, demographic
impacts of the epidemic.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.290
We don't have much
attention to that,

00:23:47.290 --> 00:23:50.370
but we are lucky that we do
have some research groups that

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:52.950
stay on the ground and
try to bring information

00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:56.340
about this aftermath when
everybody thinks it's over,

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:58.740
but we're not quite there yet.

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:02.070
So, our panel has
three stellar speakers

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.020
that will talk a
little bit about this.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.740
I'm not going to read their
bios you have in your program.

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.120
And you should read
because they are terrific.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.550
But I'll give you
an overview of what

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.109
they are going to touch
upon in those issues

00:24:14.109 --> 00:24:15.150
that I briefly mentioned.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.780
So, we're going to start
with Dr. Christian Happi.

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:23.580
And he's going to bring how this
top-notch technology that we

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:26.430
have now can help us
in those epidemics.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.980
So, he's going to talk
about how genomics

00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:32.940
can be used for
pathogen discovery,

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:35.430
but also for surveillance.

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:38.250
Then we're going to move
to Dr. Anne Rimoin, who

00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:40.030
has one of those
research groups that

00:24:40.030 --> 00:24:43.350
actually stay on the ground when
everybody is saying, it's over.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:47.310
And she's going to talk to
us about her phenomenal work

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:52.560
of tracking the survivors of the
1976 Ebola outbreak in the DRC

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.620
and share with us
some of the findings

00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:59.910
that she had about the
long-term effects of the Ebola

00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.820
outbreak, the long-term
sequela that those people are

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.830
experiencing.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:07.810
Then we are going to
have Dr. Celina Turchi

00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.480
Martelli from Brazil,
who played a really

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.960
important role in the
Brazilian response to Zika.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:17.100
And in the middle
of all the chaos,

00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:21.160
she is going to tell us how you
can actually design and conduct

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.390
epidemiological studies, how
you can foster collaborations

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.670
between many different
bodies of research--

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.220
and everybody wants to come
first and be the first one

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.750
to say something new--

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.630
and how you actually
promote sharing of data.

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:38.230
All those three issues are hard
to do in normal conditions.

00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:40.960
Under an epidemic, they
are way much harder.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.650
So Celina is going to tell us
how she managed to do this.

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.980
So together, those
three different talks,

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:51.400
we're going to walk us through
three different aspects.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.120
So the first one is how we
can mobilize researchers

00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.790
to do the right thing
at the right time

00:25:57.790 --> 00:26:01.690
and generate much-needed
evidence to be able to respond

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:03.550
with the right policies.

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:08.140
Second, we're going to
see how we can better

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.080
track new and
re-emerging pathogens,

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.370
leveraging on the very best
technology we have available.

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:17.620
And last but not
least, we're going

00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:21.220
to see how we can assess
the long-term consequences

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.090
of epidemic, largely neglected,
but extremely important.

00:26:25.090 --> 00:26:27.820
So without further
ado, let's get started.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:28.728
Dr. Happi.

00:26:28.728 --> 00:26:32.004
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.976
- Thank you, Marcia.

00:26:36.976 --> 00:26:38.600
And also, I want to
use the opportunity

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:43.420
to thank the Radcliffe College
Institute for this invitation.

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.420
So basically, I will
be talking about how

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.380
we use genomics to characterize
and set up a surveillance

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:54.850
system in West Africa and
how this has helped us

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:56.920
and especially in
Nigeria dramatically

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.480
to contain the last
Ebola outbreak in 2014.

00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.236
So, and we do this
within a framework.

00:27:04.236 --> 00:27:06.610
And that is the African Center
of Excellence for Genomics

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:07.630
of Infectious Diseases.

00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:11.290
And the center is a consortium
of academic and clinical

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:12.730
studies in Africa.

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.430
But in addition to that, we
have partners here, especially

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:18.150
at Harvard at Broad Institute,
Tulane University, and then

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.690
also partnering in the industry.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:21.640
And we work together
with these partners

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.700
in order to not only
develop genomic technology,

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:28.150
but also translate those high
court technologies into tools

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:31.810
that enable us to develop
rapid diagnostic tests to track

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:35.640
these outbreaks, to track
diseases in the field.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.820
So this partnership
is actually built

00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:40.100
on a very solid foundation
on the strong long-term

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:41.605
collaboration between partners.

00:27:41.605 --> 00:27:44.230
And this partnership, because
of its success as a [INAUDIBLE],,

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:47.030
it has attracted
new collaborations

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:49.530
within the region.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:51.510
So, and why do we
focus on genomics?

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.360
Basically because
of one single thing.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.780
It's the fact that the genome--
the whole genome project,

00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:03.780
and then the sequencing
of various organisms

00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.990
has brought tremendous progress
in the field of health,

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.980
for instance.

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.095
And Africa, you know,
really is not participating.

00:28:11.095 --> 00:28:12.720
And the lack of
participation of Africa

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.910
is basically due to the
fact that there's no scale.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.220
There's no know-how.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.935
And there's a huge divide
between the West and Africa.

00:28:18.935 --> 00:28:20.310
And that's the
reason why we just

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.143
decided to use the
genomic approach in order

00:28:22.143 --> 00:28:24.140
to narrow down the
gap, and also provide

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:28.260
a needed knowledge in order
for African scientists

00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:32.020
to participate in the
genomic revolution.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:34.070
So our mission
actually is twofold.

00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:37.270
One is educational,
as I mentioned.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:43.300
And that is actually to
create a vibrant environment

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:46.350
that is free of
external influence

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.090
and that transcends
national boundaries

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:53.200
in order to ensure relevant,
responsive, ethical, and

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.510
high-quality genomic
research in Africa.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.080
And the specific
aims of the program

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.730
is actually to develop--

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.370
you know, train a critical
mass of well-trained African

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.230
scientists to use
genomic knowledge

00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:09.910
to address important issues such
as elimination or eradication

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:13.840
of infectious disease, and also
to create genomic curricula

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.920
on the continent to address the
issue of infectious diseases,

00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.090
and also to engage communities
in prevention and public health

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:23.770
education.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:25.520
And this particular
aspect of this program

00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:27.978
that I'm going to be presenting
[INAUDIBLE] the achievement

00:29:27.978 --> 00:29:29.980
is actually supported
by the World Bank.

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:33.040
But the research
component of this program

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.930
is supported by NIH.

00:29:34.930 --> 00:29:37.600
And the goal is actually
to use field-deployable,

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.940
state-of-the-art technology
to identify pathogens driving

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.447
febrile illnesses.

00:29:43.447 --> 00:29:45.280
The reason why we talk
about febrile illness

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.920
is that fever is
actually the denominator

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.090
for pretty much all infectious
diseases in the continent.

00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:54.730
In Africa, most of the time,
when you go down to hospital

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:57.390
with a fever, the first
culprit is malaria.

00:29:57.390 --> 00:29:59.390
And after malaria, if
you're not getting better,

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:00.909
they say it's typhoid.

00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:02.450
And when you go
through that process,

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:04.991
if you have any other infection,
then the disease progresses,

00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:07.310
and eventually, you end
up in a very bad situation

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:08.607
or you end up dead.

00:30:08.607 --> 00:30:10.190
And we've just
realized over the years

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:13.790
that malaria is what
I call over-diagnosed

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:16.340
and also anti-malaria
drugs are over-prescribed.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:18.200
And that actually
drive the whole process

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.145
of drug resistance
on the continent.

00:30:21.145 --> 00:30:23.270
And we've heard that there
are many other pathogens

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.140
circulating around that are
truly responsible for fevers

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.560
that we see in 60% or 70%
of African patients that

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.720
find themselves in hospitals.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.610
So and as such, this
goal is actually

00:30:34.610 --> 00:30:36.190
to create a foundation
for Africans

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:40.130
to actually carry out
very [INAUDIBLE] research

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:41.457
on the African continent.

00:30:41.457 --> 00:30:43.040
The reason for
creating the foundation

00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.081
is basically because we've
noticed over the years

00:30:45.081 --> 00:30:46.600
that not--

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.620
I mean, Africans are
really not participating

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:52.410
on the research involving
diseases on the continent.

00:30:52.410 --> 00:30:54.770
Samples are often
shipped out of Africa.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:55.812
And then they lose track.

00:30:55.812 --> 00:30:58.145
They have no idea of what's
going on with a sample band.

00:30:58.145 --> 00:31:00.770
And then the next thing they see
is actually publications out.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:04.030
So, and it is high time
that we can actually

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:08.090
set up on the continent facility
to enable diagnosis and enable

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.490
research so that
Africans can start

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:12.620
addressing their problems.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.260
These two programs that I
just mentioned, if you see,

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:19.090
actually cross in
one particular area,

00:31:19.090 --> 00:31:21.560
and that is the area
of capacity building

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.792
in the field of genomics.

00:31:22.792 --> 00:31:24.375
And what we do with
these two programs

00:31:24.375 --> 00:31:27.890
is basically to just ensure that
we have genomic teaching labs

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:30.290
that we've set up
on the continent.

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:32.060
Develop that core
diagnostic facility

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:34.730
to track infectious
diseases, and then

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.190
also encourage
sustainable careers

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:38.930
among African scientists.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.120
Through this program,
with our [INAUDIBLE],,

00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:43.130
we've made some major progress.

00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:45.620
We've been able to add value
to what happens in Africa

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:47.410
by reversing the brain drain.

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:49.640
I also make what
I call brain gain.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:52.730
We've been able to track some
from young Africans in diaspora

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:55.010
returning back and then
working together to address

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:57.476
these major challenges.

00:31:57.476 --> 00:32:00.060
So overall, the overall goal
is actually to develop--

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:02.440
I mean, to build the next
generation of African pathogen

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.272
hunters.

00:32:03.272 --> 00:32:04.730
The reason being
that because we've

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:06.340
been playing defense in Africa.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.810
And I think it's high time
to start playing offense.

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:11.450
We've always been at
the receiving end.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.650
We've heard about it.

00:32:12.650 --> 00:32:18.110
Zika, malaria, typhoid, Lassa
fever, Ebola virus disease--

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.130
name it.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:20.990
We're always at
the receiving end.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:22.640
I believe that now
it is high time

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:24.556
to use the knowledge and
the technologies that

00:32:24.556 --> 00:32:27.980
are available to go down in
the dead bushes of Africa

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.370
and hunt these pathogens,
characterize them,

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.870
and of lab diagnosis
against them

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:34.760
before they come hunting us.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.070
I think it is high time.

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:37.820
And that is one of--
that is a major goal,

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:40.740
and the ultimate
goal, of our program.

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:42.880
So, what are our achievements?

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.030
I will take you back as just
the 2014 Ebola outbreak.

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:51.740
As far back as March
2014 when Ebola

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:55.470
was brewing in the [INAUDIBLE]
confinement of Guinea.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.340
And the world was looking away.

00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.790
The major health organization
were not bothered about this.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:03.050
We're very ambitious.

00:33:03.050 --> 00:33:05.330
I invited a group
of friends of mine

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.950
from Harvard from
the Broad Institute,

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:08.960
from Tulane, and some
other institution.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.340
You can see the picture here.

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.835
We sat in my lab.

00:33:11.835 --> 00:33:17.300
And we thought that we could
solve the Ebola problem

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:20.220
if it ever spread.

00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:21.402
We were very ambitious.

00:33:21.402 --> 00:33:22.860
We thought that
with a little skill

00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:24.630
and knowledge that
we have, we could

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:26.470
address that major problem.

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.740
But there was something that
came out of that meeting.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:32.040
And that thing was we had
a premonition that Ebola

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:33.240
was going to spill over.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.625
And if Ebola spilled
over, what could we do?

00:33:36.625 --> 00:33:39.716
We identified diagnosis
as one of the major gaps.

00:33:39.716 --> 00:33:41.340
And what we did was
actually to go back

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.440
on the side of
developing diagnostics--

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.200
better diagnosis
for Ebola, and then

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:49.290
train people in Nigeria,
Sierra Leone, and Senegal

00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.670
to diagnose Ebola.

00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:54.269
And as we rightly predicted, by
May 20, one of the technicians

00:33:54.269 --> 00:33:56.310
that we trained diagnosed
the first case of Ebola

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.920
in Sierra Leone.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:02.780
And subsequently,
on July 22, I led

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.620
a team in [INAUDIBLE] that
knew the first case of Ebola

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.240
in Nigeria.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.199
The fact that we were
prepared and the fact

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:13.420
that we were ready, for the case
of Nigeria, that single act,

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:15.610
or that single fact
that we had this,

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:19.414
was very critical to avert
one of the major health

00:34:19.414 --> 00:34:20.830
disasters that
could have happened

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:22.449
in the history of mankind.

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:25.090
That is preventing
the spread of Ebola

00:34:25.090 --> 00:34:28.989
in the city of 20 million,
22 million individuals

00:34:28.989 --> 00:34:31.190
in Lagos, Nigeria.

00:34:31.190 --> 00:34:32.870
We provided a
result within hours.

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:37.070
And then we activated what I
call an emergency operation

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.969
center.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:39.730
I worked with the
government for isolation

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:42.620
and the containment
of individuals.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:44.823
And that alone
was very critical.

00:34:44.823 --> 00:34:46.489
The other thing that
we did was actually

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:49.489
what I call
[INAUDIBLE] because we

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:52.560
had the technology, because
we believed in ourselves.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.590
So when the agencies that
were parachuted in Nigeria--

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.570
you know [INAUDIBLE]
had control--

00:34:57.570 --> 00:35:00.074
arrived, we told them that
we knew what we were doing.

00:35:00.074 --> 00:35:01.990
And then we were able
to contain the outbreak.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:05.822
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:07.737 --> 00:35:09.570
Interestingly, we went
on in the first three

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:10.609
weeks of the outbreak.

00:35:10.609 --> 00:35:12.150
But we were able to
do this basically

00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:14.691
because we've been able to-- we
achieved this feat in Nigeria

00:35:14.691 --> 00:35:17.670
because we were working on
a pathogen, a Category A

00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:19.530
agent like Lassa fever.

00:35:19.530 --> 00:35:22.740
And this agent is also supposed
to be as deadly as Ebola.

00:35:22.740 --> 00:35:26.430
But we were actually doing
this in [INAUDIBLE] facilities

00:35:26.430 --> 00:35:28.050
because we devised
ways of working

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.200
with these pathogens in very
poor and limited-resource

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.271
cities.

00:35:32.271 --> 00:35:34.770
And this is what you'll see
what we're doing in Sierra Leone

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:35.821
and in Nigeria.

00:35:35.821 --> 00:35:37.320
What we did in
Sierra Leone that was

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:39.510
unique was the fact that because
we've been working on Lassa

00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:41.218
fever, when we identified
our first case,

00:35:41.218 --> 00:35:45.030
we also activated what we call
a contact-tracing mechanism

00:35:45.030 --> 00:35:47.460
that we used Lassa fever.

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.860
And they were able to trace
the first case of Ebola

00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.830
in Sierra Leone to a
traditional healer who

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:55.950
thought that he had all the
power to do to cure Lassa,

00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:58.080
not to cure Ebola, and
through that process,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:01.582
was spreading that
across the region.

00:36:01.582 --> 00:36:03.540
But what we did in the
process was for the fact

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:06.240
that we were actually
using-- doing some research

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.750
and then understand use
metagenomics, for instance,

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:11.580
as a way to understand what
was responsible for fevers

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:12.414
during the outbreak.

00:36:12.414 --> 00:36:13.663
As you can see, one of those--

00:36:13.663 --> 00:36:15.840
I mean, as you can see
that in the diagram below,

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.430
you see many of
the cases that used

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:18.971
to come to the Ebola
treatment center

00:36:18.971 --> 00:36:20.310
were not necessarily Ebola.

00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:23.380
But they were things like
malaria, HIV, and everything.

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.380
So what happened in the
outbreak is that there's

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.280
a lot of sense of panic.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.990
And everybody that
comes down with fever

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.870
actually is sent to the
Ebola treatment center.

00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:33.509
What happened-- I mean, and then
the danger and the consequence

00:36:33.509 --> 00:36:35.550
of that is that you leave
your home very healthy,

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.450
but then you come back.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:38.160
You're actually
infected with the virus,

00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:40.706
and then spread an outbreak.

00:36:40.706 --> 00:36:42.330
So what we also did
during the outbreak

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:43.950
was actually to
convert a process that

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:46.885
used to take a very long time
in a laboratory that would take

00:36:46.885 --> 00:36:48.010
a few months in laboratory.

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:48.990
We did that in 10 days.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:51.630
That is basically from
collecting the sample

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:55.070
to generate sequence data.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:58.570
And we were be able to
achieve this in 10 days.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:00.960
So we generated about
99 sequence data.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.610
Within 10 days, and within the
first few days of the outbreak,

00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:06.500
I made these sequences available
to international community.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.430
We're not concerned
about generating data

00:37:08.430 --> 00:37:09.180
for publication.

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.540
We're not concerned about fame.

00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:14.124
We're more concerned
about making information

00:37:14.124 --> 00:37:15.790
available to the
international community

00:37:15.790 --> 00:37:17.560
so that they can
use the sequence

00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.310
data to generate drugs,
develop vaccines, or develop

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:21.480
diagnostics.

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:26.710
And the publication
came back months after.

00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:28.990
We're also in the process--

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:32.350
you know, went on and then
work on developing methods

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.516
to sequence Ebola
and then Lassa fever.

00:37:34.516 --> 00:37:35.890
I mean, this was
in collaboration

00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:38.620
with colleagues at Harvard
and at the Broad Institute.

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.410
And this method will actually
publish more or less like SOPs

00:37:41.410 --> 00:37:43.630
where anybody could
actually use it actively

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:45.040
to repeat or
replicate what would

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.660
we were doing in the laboratory.

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:48.880
And that was also
very important.

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:51.672
We use genomics
actually to understand

00:37:51.672 --> 00:37:55.570
the spread and the transmission
of Ebola in Sierra Leone

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:56.410
during the outbreak.

00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:59.294
And as you can
see in this chart,

00:37:59.294 --> 00:38:01.710
you could see that you have
two different strains of Ebola

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:08.210
entering Sierra Leone in-between
March and June 20, 2014.

00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:11.320
And I could see it through
the process by June 2013,

00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.620
the third strain that actually
entered, SL3, has taken over.

00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.830
So this was a strain
that was better adapted

00:38:16.830 --> 00:38:19.750
and had a better
transmission efficiency.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.080
We identified multiple
snips the strains.

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.610
And they [INAUDIBLE]
confirmed from

00:38:24.610 --> 00:38:27.640
human-to-human transmission,
and also confirmed the fact

00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:33.910
that there was no sources
outside the human-to-human

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:35.799
transmission.

00:38:35.799 --> 00:38:37.590
Over time, we were able
to use genomic data

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:41.380
to actually reconstitute
transmission in the region.

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:43.650
And I don't know this
map will show it,

00:38:43.650 --> 00:38:45.370
but this was just
a video actually

00:38:45.370 --> 00:38:46.630
to show how this happened.

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:48.760
The outbreak in Nigeria
was a little bit smaller--

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.432
four months.

00:38:49.432 --> 00:38:50.890
But within the four
months, we were

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.460
able to actually
use genomic data

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:53.830
and then use contact tracing.

00:38:53.830 --> 00:38:56.680
As you can see in those
two panels, A and B,

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.350
you can actually
superimpose very well

00:38:59.350 --> 00:39:01.960
the genetic data and then
the contact-tracing data.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:05.500
And that actually
shows the power

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.600
of genomics,
actually, in the field

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:10.330
in order to understand
epidemiology and transmission

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:12.220
of disease.

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.680
So what we've been
doing over the years

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:16.920
is actually to identify a
pathogen based on sequences

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.461
and then use these
sequences as a way

00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:22.270
to develop new
tools for diagnosis.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.157
And that also was
being very helpful.

00:39:24.157 --> 00:39:26.240
During the four months of
the outbreak in Nigeria,

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.050
we worked with partners, having
these sequences, in Africa,

00:39:29.050 --> 00:39:31.540
having the Ebola
sequences to generate

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:34.710
a rapid diagnostic
test that could

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:36.815
diagnose Ebola in 10 minutes.

00:39:36.815 --> 00:39:39.190
The reason why we actually
spent a lot of time developing

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:41.860
that test is basically
because during an outbreak,

00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:44.500
we need to two main
things, speed and accuracy.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.080
We realized that it would
have taken about four hours

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.520
to do one single diagnostics.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.140
And then we have
to think about--

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.060
be creative about
ways of actually

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.900
producing diagnostic
data almost in real time.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:57.687
And that-- when we actually did
that, we actually realized--

00:39:57.687 --> 00:39:59.770
I told them it was major
game changer in the field

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:01.310
because clinicians
could actually

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:05.660
have this information
in near real time.

00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.471
We also used the--

00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:08.970
I mean, what we're also doing
is basically use genomic data,

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.500
actually, to understand and
then discover pathogens.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.570
And in this case,
for instance, we're

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:15.430
looking at patients
with febrile illness.

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:17.889
And as you can see
in these two panels,

00:40:17.889 --> 00:40:19.930
you see healthy patients
and in febrile patients,

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:24.220
you could see that you have
more in febrile patients

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.380
in terms of viruses, 8%--

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:28.270
you know, 2% in people
that are healthy.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.210
So that shows that
viruses actually also

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:33.370
could be very responsible for
many other febrile illness

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:34.870
that I would see.

00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:37.630
And in the process, because
we also see some pathogen

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:38.950
that have no heat.

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:41.610
In this study, this is just
to illustrate how it's really

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:43.780
what you use [INAUDIBLE]
to make a major discovery,

00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:45.074
for instance, Nigeria.

00:40:45.074 --> 00:40:46.990
And in this case, control
study, for instance,

00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:49.690
we discovered two new
viruses in Nigeria.

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.910
And these two new
viruses, we actually

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.860
called them the
ipomovirus 1, it's

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.140
a rhabdovirus that's
similar to rabies.

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:58.750
And these viruses share
some very strong similarity

00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:00.640
to the [INAUDIBLE] virus
that was discovered

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.860
in DRC Congo in 2012.

00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:04.480
And that is all--
that was shown to be

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.004
responsible for some kind
of viral hemorrhagic fevers.

00:41:08.004 --> 00:41:09.670
But then that shows,
actually, the power

00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:12.010
behind the public
discovery platform that we

00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:14.170
have because having
discovered these viruses,

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.380
we also went on and then
developed new diagnostics

00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.234
for them.

00:41:18.234 --> 00:41:19.900
But what is interesting
about this story

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.400
is basically that when we went
back to develop the diagnosis

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.050
and went back to the community,
even though these viruses were

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:29.020
new, 80% of people in those
communities were highly exposed

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:31.720
and had a lot of antibodies
against this virus.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:33.970
So it shows clearly that
there are many pathogens that

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:36.053
are circulating in our
community-- are circulating

00:41:36.053 --> 00:41:37.480
around that we don't know about.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.680
But then we need
to use technology

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.290
to actually discover them and
see how we can actually develop

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.580
diagnostics and [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:46.590
So using, again,
genomic technology,

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.100
we are able to understand--

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.141
I mean, the origin and the
spread of a very old virus

00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:51.640
in Nigeria--

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:53.830
not very old, but a
Lassa fever virus that

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:57.250
is very similar to
Ebola in many ways.

00:41:57.250 --> 00:41:59.670
And this diagram
actually shows you--

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:02.590
and this is a study
by Kristian Andersen,

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:03.910
a friend, a colleague of mine.

00:42:03.910 --> 00:42:06.720
So, and here, we could show
you that this virus that we'll

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.380
call Lassa fever
has been circulating

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:12.030
in present-day Nigeria
about 1,600 years ago,

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:14.654
and circulating within
Nigeria for 600 years,

00:42:14.654 --> 00:42:16.570
and then moved out of
Nigeria about 400 years,

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:17.867
moving westward.

00:42:17.867 --> 00:42:19.450
And then in the
field, we can actually

00:42:19.450 --> 00:42:22.750
see the differences
between an old virus that

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:25.339
is very old in one country,
and then moved freshly

00:42:25.339 --> 00:42:26.130
into a new country.

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:27.815
When you look at the
pathogenesis of--

00:42:27.815 --> 00:42:32.290
or philosophy between
Sierra Leone and Nigeria,

00:42:32.290 --> 00:42:34.114
they are very different.

00:42:34.114 --> 00:42:36.030
We also used that to
develop new technologies.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:40.572
But then we use the epitome that
we sequenced in those viruses

00:42:40.572 --> 00:42:42.030
to develop a rapid
diagnostic test.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.180
We called it [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.920
And that-- we use that now
as a way to help the Nigerian

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.340
government to look at--

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:51.602
to set up a surveillance system.

00:42:51.602 --> 00:42:54.060
What we've done over the years
is not just only do science,

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.476
but also to train the next
generation of pathogen hunters.

00:42:56.476 --> 00:42:58.635
So we set up with a
genomic training program.

00:42:58.635 --> 00:43:00.510
And we do this in
collaboration with Harvard.

00:43:00.510 --> 00:43:03.630
And then we started in 2014 with
11 students from two countries.

00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:06.240
As you can see, the list
is growing over the years.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.420
And this year, we're
actually at 23 students

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:10.740
from eight different countries.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:12.690
And here, you can
see, for instance,

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:15.630
the training programs, the
kind of topics the we cover.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:17.430
And pictures here could
show you very young

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:18.680
Africans that we're training.

00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:21.360
But apart from just training
them, what we train them to do

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:23.960
is-- we worked with
the Derek Bok Center

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.450
here at Harvard to enable
them to use videos.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.260
And it is videos
I actually posted.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.120
And then they serve as
MOOCs so that people

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.774
that are not privileged
to be in a place

00:43:32.774 --> 00:43:35.190
in like Harvard at least could
have access to those videos

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.464
and then learn and
educate themselves.

00:43:38.464 --> 00:43:40.380
So, what we've done is
actually training them.

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:42.629
But not just training them,
but we also accompany them

00:43:42.629 --> 00:43:43.470
with infrastructure.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.510
So we've set up
next-generation sequencing

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:49.260
in Nigeria, in Senegal, and in
Sierra Leone early this year.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.240
So the trainings
actually have facilities

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.510
that they can go back and use.

00:43:52.510 --> 00:43:56.900
We also organize workshops
and genomics workshop series

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.860
in Nigeria or in Africa.

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:01.350
And we've trained over 600
students over the past three

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:02.220
years.

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:04.860
And then we have 21
doctoral students and then

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.950
46 master's degree students
within the program.

00:44:07.950 --> 00:44:10.350
The whole idea is actually to
translate genomic sciences,

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:13.956
for instance, into tools that
will enable us in the future.

00:44:13.956 --> 00:44:15.580
As you could see
here, that it's coming

00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.460
from a high court,
high-tech technology,

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.460
and then bring it
down to a level

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.130
that we can actually
use in the field

00:44:23.130 --> 00:44:25.080
with small, portable
equipment that

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.400
enable diagnosis in the field.

00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.910
So, whatever we're doing
actually is not stopping.

00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:38.429
What we've also done is actually
to set up an outreach program.

00:44:38.429 --> 00:44:40.220
And this outreach
program that we've set up

00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:42.320
is actually to take it
outside the university

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.790
and outside the ivory tower.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.380
As you can see here,
we have a program

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.080
where we take it in high
school and inspire the kids

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.192
at a high-school level.

00:44:49.192 --> 00:44:51.650
But what we also do is actually
to educate science teachers

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:53.960
in Africa because you can't
give what you don't have.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.772
So we spent time
training these kids,

00:44:55.772 --> 00:44:57.230
bringing them in
our labs, and then

00:44:57.230 --> 00:44:59.790
inspire them at that tender
age, and work with their teacher

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:02.720
so they can go back with
biology, DNA, RNA, and protein

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.935
models so that they
can use that to teach.

00:45:04.935 --> 00:45:07.310
And the students will also
have a summer training program

00:45:07.310 --> 00:45:08.810
that student comes
in, and then have

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:10.160
training in our laboratories.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:14.550
We've received support from
many institutions for the work

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.390
that we're doing.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.300
But this-- what we've
done is actually--

00:45:17.300 --> 00:45:18.759
I mean, it has a
lot of challenges.

00:45:18.759 --> 00:45:20.924
And one of those things,
one of the major challenges

00:45:20.924 --> 00:45:22.147
in the world is supply chain.

00:45:22.147 --> 00:45:23.480
Supply chain is a major problem.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.080
We're doing this kind of work in
Africa and we produce nothing.

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.704
So how do we maintain
the supply chain?

00:45:27.704 --> 00:45:30.440
So what we do basically to
maintain our supply chain

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.130
is actually to
convert our trainees

00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.296
that come to Harvard for
the summer training program

00:45:34.296 --> 00:45:36.120
into courier.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.930
So we load them with
[INAUDIBLE] and then

00:45:37.930 --> 00:45:39.680
with supplies and [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.784
And then when they get back,
then they can take them.

00:45:42.784 --> 00:45:44.200
But then we'll
also have problems.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.304
When you get back, then you
have an issue with customs.

00:45:47.304 --> 00:45:49.220
So, and customs will not
allow you to come in.

00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:51.675
So what we did in 2014
was actually to enable--

00:45:51.675 --> 00:45:53.050
we'd print them
a T-shirt, and it

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:55.700
would say Ebola diagnostic
trainee is coming back.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.260
When they got to the border
and they were disturbing them,

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.040
they all just saw Ebola.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.373
And then eventually, customs
asked them to [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:01.373 --> 00:46:03.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.954
So I just want to
end this presentation

00:46:04.954 --> 00:46:07.370
to thank all my colleagues and
my partners here at Harvard

00:46:07.370 --> 00:46:09.294
and all over the world.

00:46:09.294 --> 00:46:11.210
And eventually, I just
want to thank you again

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:12.530
for give me the opportunity.

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:13.060
Thanks.

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:13.560
- Very good.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.239
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:16.239 --> 00:46:17.213
Thank you.

00:46:20.122 --> 00:46:20.622
OK.

00:46:23.544 --> 00:46:24.900
Thank you so much, Christian.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:25.870
This was phenomenal.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:28.270
So now we're going to
move to the following

00:46:28.270 --> 00:46:30.972
up after the epidemic
with Dr. Rimoin.

00:46:30.972 --> 00:46:31.472
- Thanks.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:35.400
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.382
- Thank you.

00:46:36.382 --> 00:46:38.840
- Great.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:40.940
Perfect.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:41.690
All right.

00:46:41.690 --> 00:46:43.700
Well, thank you very much.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:46.040
I am here to tell you a
little bit about the work

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.770
that I've been doing in
the Democratic Republic

00:46:48.770 --> 00:46:50.979
of the Congo.

00:46:50.979 --> 00:46:52.520
The Democratic
Republic of the Congo,

00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.310
for those of you
who are not aware,

00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:58.400
is the largest country
in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.410
I spent the last
15 years of my life

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:04.340
working on emerging viruses
and doing what many people have

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.290
told me over and over
again was impossible,

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:09.170
which was to do really good
science in one of the most

00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:12.050
difficult places in the world.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.300
DRC, as you can see
from this slide here,

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:17.060
just to give you some
context, is really big.

00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.760
It's a third of the size
of the United States.

00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:22.520
But unlike the United
States, there's

00:47:22.520 --> 00:47:25.580
only about a thousand miles
of road in the entire country,

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:29.630
which can make it very, very
difficult to get much done.

00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:34.850
The DRC is also a place
where we've seen Ebola,

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:41.030
not just in 2014, but all the
way back to 1976, 40 plus years

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:45.440
ago, when the very
first outbreak

00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:52.100
of Ebola that occurred both on
the DRC side and in Sudan right

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:57.080
across the border happened.

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:03.050
Now, we all know today
that between December 2013

00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:07.730
and April 2016, the largest
epidemic of Ebola to date

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:12.590
generated more than 28,000
cases that we know of and more

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:18.000
than 11,000 deaths in the large
mobile populations of Guinea,

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:25.190
Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and
just barely in Nigeria as well.

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:29.090
This outbreak was very
important and provided

00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:34.310
a lot of opportunity to track
and understand survivors

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.680
and generated a lot
of new insights.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:40.200
And that's very, very important.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:45.470
And it's very, very important
because the outbreak

00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:51.620
was able to end and did not
create more cases than we

00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:54.200
originally were worried about.

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:59.060
Now, we were all thrilled when
the outbreak was declared over.

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.880
And we-- but we've
heard this before--

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.200
the outbreak is over.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.230
The outbreak was over in
Liberia, and all of a sudden,

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:09.630
there were several
cases that reemerged.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:13.490
And since that
outbreak has been over,

00:49:13.490 --> 00:49:15.080
there was actually
another outbreak

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.590
in the Democratic Republic
of the Congo just in May.

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:21.050
So just because the
outbreak ended--

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:22.520
this very large
one-- doesn't mean

00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:25.490
that Ebola isn't still there.

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:28.225
So, let's see here.

00:49:28.225 --> 00:49:29.096
How do I do this?

00:49:29.096 --> 00:49:30.440
OK, here we go.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:35.180
But what we do know now is
that for Ebola survivors,

00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:38.720
the outbreak isn't really over.

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.240
We now know that
more than 50% or so

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:47.570
of the infected who pull through
still have long term effects.

00:49:47.570 --> 00:49:49.950
Many of these people have
resumed their normal lives,

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:51.680
but many of them are
still traumatized.

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.380
They're struggling to process
the horrors they've seen,

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.940
rejoin societies that
have shunned them.

00:49:56.940 --> 00:49:59.540
And the after-effects are
not just psychological.

00:49:59.540 --> 00:50:03.650
We know that there are many,
many after-effects of Ebola.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:07.970
We just don't know
exactly what they are.

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:12.710
The studies that have been
ongoing in West Africa

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:16.640
have showed us just a few
years after the outbreak

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.650
that there are
ocular side effects.

00:50:19.650 --> 00:50:21.660
There are neurological
side effects,

00:50:21.660 --> 00:50:24.620
that people are actually
able to carry the virus

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.680
and potentially shed the virus
from immune-protected sites

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.230
for much longer than
anybody ever anticipated.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:34.190
And it's interesting that
nobody ever anticipated this

00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:39.530
because it turns out there are
a lot of survivors to study.

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:44.360
What we know about right now
from these studies from 2014

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:49.470
going forward is there a lot
of things that can happen.

00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:53.250
But the question is, what else?

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:56.220
I think that it's
important for me

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.110
to invoke a little
bit of baseball

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:00.290
since the Dodgers are
actually in the World Series.

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:03.870
But it's really true that
what we've learned about Ebola

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.870
is that it really-- it
isn't over until it's over.

00:51:06.870 --> 00:51:11.830
And the big question
is, when is it over?

00:51:11.830 --> 00:51:17.570
Well, and there are a lot
more questions about Ebola

00:51:17.570 --> 00:51:19.860
that we still have to answer.

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:24.600
We don't know how long can
somebody transmit Ebola virus.

00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:27.210
How long does it
stay in these sites?

00:51:27.210 --> 00:51:29.190
For example, if
we can still find

00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:32.820
Ebola in the fluids
of the eye, are

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:35.790
ophthalmologists at risk
for acquiring infection long

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:38.940
after survival from infection?

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:41.180
Are survivors protected
from long term--

00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:43.050
from future outbreaks?

00:51:43.050 --> 00:51:46.380
How long does the immunity last?

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.030
Is there anything
that can be done

00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:50.970
to reduce these after-effects?

00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:55.170
And what aside from the
clinical effects are there?

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:57.610
We know that there
are economic effects.

00:51:57.610 --> 00:52:00.090
We know that there
are societal effects.

00:52:00.090 --> 00:52:02.490
None of these things do
we have any information

00:52:02.490 --> 00:52:06.660
about further than four
years after this outbreak.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:12.400
Now, one would think there
have been outbreaks since 1976.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:15.540
So we ought to have
a lot of information.

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:19.230
But actually, until this
recent Ebola outbreak,

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:21.570
the longest study
looking at survivorship

00:52:21.570 --> 00:52:26.420
was only 2 and 1/2
years after an outbreak.

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:29.690
And that was done in 1995.

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:32.240
The 1995 outbreak--
there were studies

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.740
that were done 2 and
1/2 years afterwards.

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:37.970
And much like what we've
been hearing about,

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:40.190
the outbreak happens,
we think it's over,

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.060
and we move onto the next thing.

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:48.450
Well, we do have cohorts
in the Democratic Republic

00:52:48.450 --> 00:52:52.440
of the Congo that are there
and can provide very, very

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.780
important information.

00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.690
In DRC, we've had
eight outbreaks--

00:52:57.690 --> 00:53:04.270
1976 all the way
through now, to 2017.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.310
So what my program
is doing is we're

00:53:06.310 --> 00:53:08.410
going back and looking
at these survivors

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:12.850
from 1976, 1995, and 2014.

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:15.040
So we have three really
unique groups that

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.200
are roughly 20 years apart.

00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.960
And what we hope is to better
understand the long-term health

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:24.010
consequences of infection to
determine if survivors develop

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.500
immunity that will protect
them from future infections,

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.200
assess whether previously
infected people can transmit

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.830
the virus still, to
understand all of these things

00:53:32.830 --> 00:53:34.270
that I just brought up.

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:38.470
We really don't have
any information.

00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:41.300
So we think, great, no problem.

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:41.970
You just go.

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:42.945
You're going to find
these survivors.

00:53:42.945 --> 00:53:44.174
You get their phone number.

00:53:44.174 --> 00:53:45.090
You get their address.

00:53:45.090 --> 00:53:47.820
Maybe you send them an email.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:49.520
No problem.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.150
Well, it's not so easy in DRC.

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:57.890
The '76 survivors and
the 1995 survivors

00:53:57.890 --> 00:54:00.780
happened before the
civil war in DRC.

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:02.940
And so, all of the
records were lost.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:04.020
There were no records.

00:54:04.020 --> 00:54:07.680
So I went back to the
original investigators

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:12.600
from the '76 and '95 outbreaks
and asked them for their notes.

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.600
Well, for especially
from the '76 outbreak,

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.430
there were no
electronic records.

00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:22.290
And so, I had some
very, very nice help

00:54:22.290 --> 00:54:25.110
from people like Peter
Piot and David Heymann who

00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:27.630
went into their garages
and their basements

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:30.900
and their attics and found
their handwritten notes.

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.390
And with this
information and the map

00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:37.170
that you can see
up here, which was

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:40.590
about the same as the
map that still existed

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:44.250
in Yambuku in this site,
I went about the business

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.930
of finding survivors.

00:54:46.930 --> 00:54:49.510
And to my surprise and
to everybody else's,

00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:56.530
we found of 38 people that we
knew were infected in 1976,

00:54:56.530 --> 00:55:02.200
we found 14 of them still alive
in these very small villages.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:04.900
And so one by one, we
went through the forest,

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.760
found these people,
and asked if we

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:10.090
can study them and understand
their experience a little bit

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:11.860
better.

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.540
Well, but finding
them is one thing.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:16.300
But then you have to take
some samples from them.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.120
And we're not just talking
about taking some blood

00:55:19.120 --> 00:55:22.510
and putting it on a
dried blood spot card

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:24.790
or taking a couple
tubes of blood

00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:27.140
and putting it in
my refrigerator.

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:31.390
You know, it takes a
little bit more than that.

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:34.120
And what I think our
study site has proven

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:38.150
is that it is possible to do
really good science in very,

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:39.550
very difficult situations.

00:55:39.550 --> 00:55:44.620
So this here is our
nice, little lab

00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:49.600
that we were offered by the
Ministry of Health in Yambuku.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:54.240
And so we brought all of these
supplies in this nice hut.

00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:56.800
We cleaned it up a
little bit and made

00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:03.630
sure that the goats and the
chickens were out of the room.

00:56:03.630 --> 00:56:06.400
And so that it was really
possible to do great science,

00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.530
to be able to isolate
B cells and T cells,

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:10.990
which might be able to lead
to vaccines and therapeutics

00:56:10.990 --> 00:56:13.370
in these conditions.

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:17.510
And we only have the
preliminary data at this point.

00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:18.770
There's a lot more to do.

00:56:18.770 --> 00:56:21.470
But thus far, one of the
very interesting things

00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:25.190
that we've found is that these
survivors from 40 years ago

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.580
still have strong
antibody responses--

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.890
every single one of them.

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:33.470
And not only that,
50% of these people

00:56:33.470 --> 00:56:37.580
had the ability to
neutralize Ebola virus

00:56:37.580 --> 00:56:40.630
all of these years later.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:44.500
We've also found that there are
evidence of long-term effects.

00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:47.280
There's a lot more
work to be done.

00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.510
But we have just
started to find out

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:53.060
all of this very
important information that

00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:58.550
has the opportunity to shed
light on what these 16,000

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:01.970
plus survivors in West
Africa may be facing,

00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:05.850
and all the other survivors
from all the other outbreaks.

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:11.830
So, once we started
that work, we also

00:57:11.830 --> 00:57:15.190
realized that there
was a lot of questions

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:17.650
about asymptomatic
infection-- about people that

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:20.890
might get infected but never
show any signs or symptoms

00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:23.170
and how many of them existed.

00:57:23.170 --> 00:57:26.260
And over the last couple of
years with the Ebola outbreak

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:29.680
in West Africa, we've
now gotten good evidence

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:36.370
that people who get Ebola
don't always show symptoms.

00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:40.020
So I thought, well, health
care workers are a really good

00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:42.270
population to look at.

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:44.080
They're on the front lines.

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:46.860
They're at greatest
risk for infection, in

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:48.450
particular in the
kind of conditions

00:57:48.450 --> 00:57:50.400
that they're working
in, without the kind

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:55.260
of personal protective equipment
that people in this room

00:57:55.260 --> 00:57:59.150
may be used to when
they go into a hospital.

00:57:59.150 --> 00:58:01.750
So we started taking samples
from health care workers in all

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:03.280
of these sites
where there had been

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.040
Ebola outbreaks and a few
sites where there hadn't been,

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:08.920
just to compare.

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:12.590
And we found some very,
very interesting results.

00:58:12.590 --> 00:58:16.200
We found that health
care workers had very,

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:21.020
very high rates of Ebola,
surprisingly high rates

00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.470
of Ebola antibody evidence
that they had been previously

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:31.340
exposed to Ebola, and much, much
more so than in the sites where

00:58:31.340 --> 00:58:35.030
there had never been
an outbreak reported,

00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:38.900
suggesting that not only
did these people have

00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:42.110
the opportunity to get
infected more often--

00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:44.300
which isn't really surprising--

00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:49.200
but that there is
something going on.

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.290
Now, "health care worker"
is a very broad term,

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:54.500
and can mean many, many things.

00:58:54.500 --> 00:58:57.470
To most of us here, you
think of a doctor or a nurse

00:58:57.470 --> 00:58:59.960
or a midwife or a lab tech.

00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:05.720
But in places like
Central and West Africa,

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.320
those are not necessarily
the most common providers.

00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:11.930
We really, really
see a lot more people

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:13.870
going to informal
health care workers--

00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:16.490
to what we would consider
traditional healers,

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:23.750
to pastors, to local figures who
can go and help them in a way

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:25.770
that people understand
much better.

00:59:25.770 --> 00:59:26.990
They're more accessible.

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:29.480
They're less expensive.

00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:33.170
They may take for
payment instead of money

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:34.760
you could work in their fields.

00:59:34.760 --> 00:59:39.950
You can give them food
that you grow yourself.

00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:42.230
So those are-- those
informal health

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:44.340
care workers are actually
very, very important.

00:59:44.340 --> 00:59:46.250
And once again,
interestingly, we

00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:49.460
found that these informal,
traditional health

00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:54.020
care providers were also
people who were highly exposed.

00:59:57.490 --> 00:59:59.860
What's interesting is you
think, OK, well, fine.

00:59:59.860 --> 01:00:01.900
There have been Ebola
outbreaks in these sites.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.275
So it makes sense
that people who

01:00:03.275 --> 01:00:07.810
were in that area at the time
might have been infected.

01:00:07.810 --> 01:00:11.140
But interestingly, in
Yambuku, where the outbreak

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:14.680
happened in 1976,
those people who

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:19.397
were born after 1977, after the
outbreak was declared over--

01:00:19.397 --> 01:00:20.980
and I know now we
all know that "over"

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.440
doesn't necessarily mean over--

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:26.110
but "over."

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:30.640
Those people that were
born after the outbreak--

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:36.940
we found almost as high rates
of antibody in those people

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.760
as the people who had been
alive during the outbreak, which

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:43.330
suggests that Ebola
is still circulating

01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:50.880
in these populations long
after it disappears from view.

01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:55.500
So of course, now there are
more questions than answers.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.880
We wonder is Ebola virus
circulating silently in DRC?

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.740
Well, our preliminary
results suggest

01:01:01.740 --> 01:01:03.940
that that may be the case.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:07.620
How are asymptomatically
infected people

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:08.945
acquiring infection?

01:01:08.945 --> 01:01:10.320
Are there certain
groups that are

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.120
more likely to be
infected than others?

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.330
Can asymptomatically
infected individuals

01:01:15.330 --> 01:01:17.700
transmit the virus as well?

01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:21.980
What role do they play
in Ebola transmission?

01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:25.790
And do these people also
have long-term after-effects?

01:01:25.790 --> 01:01:28.220
We really have no idea.

01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:32.140
And although we have known about
Ebola for a very long time,

01:01:32.140 --> 01:01:36.350
we've not gotten to the
bottom of these questions.

01:01:36.350 --> 01:01:39.620
The thing is is we're
really running out of time.

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.890
The aperture for doing
these studies is closing.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:46.730
The populations that we're
working with are aging.

01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:52.610
And the natural life expectancy
for a Congolese person is 57.

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:55.550
The outbreak now
happened 42 years ago.

01:01:55.550 --> 01:01:57.540
And many of these
people were adults.

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:59.300
In fact, when I started
doing this study,

01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.690
I said I found 14 survivors.

01:02:00.690 --> 01:02:02.240
Those were the 14
survivors that we

01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.247
were able to collect
samples from,

01:02:04.247 --> 01:02:06.080
where there were two
other survivors that we

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.020
found and made contact
with, but were not

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:11.570
able to get back to in time
before they passed away.

01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:15.740
One was 95 and one was 59.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.570
So the aperture
really is closing

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:20.630
to do these kinds
of studies, not just

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:23.430
for the survivors
that we know about,

01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:26.600
but for those asymptomatically
infected survivors

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:30.350
from these very,
very early outbreaks.

01:02:30.350 --> 01:02:32.980
And so, this is the
kind of work that we

01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.650
are trying to move forward
with as quickly as we possibly

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:38.430
can to gather as
much information

01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:42.250
and to be able to capture
samples in history

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:45.580
and epidemiologic data--

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:48.160
everything that we
possibly can and archive it

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:52.630
so that as technologies
improve, as we understand more

01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:55.736
about Ebola in general, not only
can we make use of the samples

01:02:55.736 --> 01:02:57.610
that we're collecting
now and the information

01:02:57.610 --> 01:02:59.443
we're collecting now,
but that we're banking

01:02:59.443 --> 01:03:01.000
it for the future
so we don't again

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.590
have this problem of forgetting
to look at what we should

01:03:05.590 --> 01:03:07.784
have looked at a long time ago.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:08.748
Thank you.

01:03:08.748 --> 01:03:12.604
[APPLAUSE]

01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.170
- Terrific, Anne.

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:23.260
So now, we're going to move
to our last speaker, Celina

01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:25.950
Turchi, who is really
going to talk about how

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:28.290
you respond to a
major epidemic when

01:03:28.290 --> 01:03:29.480
you are in the middle of it.

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.250
- Good morning.

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:39.150
What a challenge to
talk after those two.

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:43.360
But I would like to first
thank the organizers

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:47.475
for this opportunity, To name
a few, crews in Pernambuco,

01:03:47.475 --> 01:03:52.560
Brazil, and the Microcephaly
Epidemic Research Group.

01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:56.760
I'm here to present some
insights of the public house

01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.430
response in the
recent Zika outbreak.

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:05.280
And I love the title of
this symposium, "Contagion--

01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.740
Exploring Modern Epidemics."

01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.580
Because I think that Zika
was a very good example.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:16.110
So first, I would like
to have a brief context.

01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:20.270
What are vector-borne diseases
in complex, urban areas?

01:04:20.270 --> 01:04:26.340
So, in 2015, dengue
was considered

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.280
a major problem in Brazil.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:36.000
1.5 million cases, 900 deaths
for dengue in one year.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.560
Since the '80s, we have been
having dengue epidemics.

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.710
And Brazil was one of the
most affected countries

01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:48.150
in Latin America, with the
four circulating serotypes

01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:50.960
from DEN-1 to DEN-4.

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:55.280
So what we could say that
urban environments, climate--

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:59.400
and favors all-way
around transmission

01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.600
of dengue with marked
seasonal patterns

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:08.190
and explosive epidemics in
different areas of the country.

01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:10.230
That was the
scenario for dengue,

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:16.110
and was the public
health's concern in 2015.

01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:19.050
But there was an alert
about the introduction

01:05:19.050 --> 01:05:22.510
of another virus that were
coming from the Caribbean.

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:26.430
That was the chikungunya
virus that's an alpha virus.

01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:33.060
But this alert was just that
this disease was important

01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.260
because it gave--

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:39.570
it brings this ability and could
cause these large epidemics.

01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:41.280
That was really known.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:45.120
And then something comes
as a mystery disease that

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:50.690
was called by the public and by
the media, a mysterious disease

01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:52.680
that was a benign disease.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:56.580
It was a fever like most
of infectious disease.

01:05:56.580 --> 01:06:02.090
People didn't feel ill, so
it was considered kind of,

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:04.080
don't worry about this disease.

01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:07.020
Let's call it
dengue-like illness.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:10.260
That's how doctors were
taught by the public house

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:13.230
at the moment because
we knew nothing

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:19.020
about the neurologic
context of the effects.

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.960
So, that what happens.

01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:27.030
I need to go to this
map just to show you.

01:06:27.030 --> 01:06:30.220
Actually what we had--

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.270
the green circles
is chikungunya.

01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:36.210
And red circles is Zika.

01:06:36.210 --> 01:06:44.430
And imagine in 2015, there was
The Lancet journal just wrote,

01:06:44.430 --> 01:06:47.760
Zika virus with a
question mark, following

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.890
dengue and chikungunya.

01:06:49.890 --> 01:06:52.260
There was still
this question mark.

01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.460
Was it going to occur?

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.300
And if we look at
the map, the alert

01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.940
was for chikungunya,
not for dengue.

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.080
The big circles in
Brazil and elsewhere

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.540
was for chikungunya
in the Americas,

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.060
not for the dengue epidemics.

01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:11.560
But here, it is very
important to say

01:07:11.560 --> 01:07:16.670
that we've been hearing the
last speakers about Africa.

01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:21.810
Zika was known to be
in Africa since 1947.

01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:25.440
But for 60 years, the
epidemiology world

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:29.540
just knew very little about it.

01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:34.220
I may say that we had
14 cases in humans

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.500
published for 60 years.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:39.800
That was really a
medical curiosity.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.950
I imagine that moves
think infectious disease

01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:46.010
and trained
epidemiologists never

01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:48.350
heard about Zika, like myself.

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:51.160
I had never heard about Zika.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:53.630
And virologists, the book--

01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:56.090
virologists had
just one paragraph

01:07:56.090 --> 01:07:58.180
saying about the zoonoses.

01:07:58.180 --> 01:07:59.690
But the first epidemic--

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:03.160
the history of the
epidemic is started

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:10.380
in [INAUDIBLE] of Ireland
and French Polynesia Islands.

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:13.640
But they were a small
population areas.

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:14.870
There were cases.

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:15.890
There were cases.

01:08:15.890 --> 01:08:18.620
There were a lot of
asymptomatic cases.

01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.470
And the French
Polynesia reported

01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:25.460
the first neurologic
effect of Guillain-Barre.

01:08:25.460 --> 01:08:29.060
So if we go to that
dark spot here,

01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.859
that's Recife, the
northeast of Brazil.

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:35.330
That's where we were at the
beginning of the epidemic.

01:08:35.330 --> 01:08:38.430
It was August.

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:41.240
So, what was going on?

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:47.660
The capital of
Recife in Pernambuco,

01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:51.109
northeast of Brazil,
was the epicenter

01:08:51.109 --> 01:08:53.990
of this microcephalic epidemic.

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:55.819
We were at the front line.

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:58.520
And what-- there
was a microcephaly

01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.649
with unknown etiology.

01:09:00.649 --> 01:09:03.684
We didn't know what to
look for because all

01:09:03.684 --> 01:09:09.080
the infectious disease and all
of the genetic disease supposed

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.260
to cause microcephaly
were negative

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:15.149
and didn't test positive
among these babies.

01:09:15.149 --> 01:09:18.800
So for that time, it
was an unknown cause.

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:21.880
And remember when
those babies are born,

01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.939
and when the mothers were
affected several months before.

01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:29.600
So we couldn't get genetic
proofs at the moment

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.140
to find it, nor we
did have lab tests

01:09:33.140 --> 01:09:35.330
so we could test immediately.

01:09:35.330 --> 01:09:37.370
Lab-- they weren't lab tests.

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:42.350
There were lab tests in the CDC
that would take weeks to get.

01:09:42.350 --> 01:09:47.990
And even if we get
them, IGM and RTPCR

01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:51.930
aren't always positive
after such a long time.

01:09:51.930 --> 01:09:55.310
So looking back
in retrospective,

01:09:55.310 --> 01:10:00.950
we may say that Zika virus found
a large pool of susceptible

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:06.460
individuals, abundant
presence of Aedes,

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:11.440
good environmental conditions
in a densely urban population.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.980
This is good enough,
OK, to make it

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.630
possible a range of possible
neurological outcomes,

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:22.500
including Guillain-Barre
[INAUDIBLE] syndrome

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:26.890
and also microcephaly in babies.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:31.660
So, the timeline is almost
like an old epidemic.

01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:37.000
Good doctors spot something
that they see that's not usual.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.840
They contact health
authorities, there's

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.690
something very
important going on.

01:10:43.690 --> 01:10:50.180
And in November 2015, the
Brazilian Ministry of Health

01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:55.300
declared a situation of national
public health emergency.

01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:58.950
We saw very few evidence.

01:10:58.950 --> 01:11:05.490
We just have short evidence,
some cases, some stillbirths

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:08.030
with virus in their brain.

01:11:08.030 --> 01:11:11.430
But there was a no
epidemiological study

01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:12.990
to think about causality.

01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:16.140
Causality is very important
for us epidemiologists.

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:18.250
It's a very serious business.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:26.670
So, what I want to say is
that the emergency in Brazil

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:30.510
was a turning point for
the public health response.

01:11:30.510 --> 01:11:32.970
It really was a turning point.

01:11:32.970 --> 01:11:37.860
Researchers and health care
workers working together,

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:41.250
they developed new protocols
and research instruments

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:42.930
for field work.

01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:45.420
The magnitude of the
event to put attention

01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.670
on this [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:51.390
I mean, it was so
important that broke

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:54.490
personal and
institutional barriers,

01:11:54.490 --> 01:11:59.430
creating a collective
solidarity feeling, a commitment

01:11:59.430 --> 01:12:02.550
of sharing data and knowledge.

01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:04.110
That was the status.

01:12:04.110 --> 01:12:07.680
Nobody wanted to publish a
paper first like said before.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.270
We want to have a group.

01:12:09.270 --> 01:12:13.650
We want to be known as a group
that just could do things

01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:16.890
as a group, as a team,
independently in which

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:18.520
institution [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.300
So, I think here that I have to
say the intense collaboration

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:28.070
of several institutions around
the world and within Brazil.

01:12:28.070 --> 01:12:32.840
And this morning, I had some
very nice thoughts like,

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.720
epidemiology is a sign of
[INAUDIBLE] public health.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:37.820
And I fully agree.

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:42.770
And that's what we saw on the
field exactly where we were,

01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:46.970
trying to do good
epidemiology in the situation.

01:12:46.970 --> 01:12:49.370
And I always learn
a term-- yesterday,

01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:51.680
a terminology that
I found it very

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.650
appropriate for this moment.

01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:57.150
We were not doing
peacetime research.

01:12:57.150 --> 01:12:59.900
We were doing wartime research.

01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:02.600
So time was so important.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:05.360
Collaboration was so important.

01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:09.290
So I wanted to just briefly
to show that was the features.

01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:11.400
We had almost like a phenotype.

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:13.120
I can't go into details.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:16.430
But you can see the
disproportional face

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:17.540
and how bad--

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:22.400
how small these children,
and how bad it was.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.720
Here, you can see the
tomography of these children,

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.490
it's so easy to see the
calcification and the damage

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.460
of the brain and how
important and how

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:38.000
would be the developing of
these children considering

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.350
this situation.

01:13:39.350 --> 01:13:41.480
So we entered this--

01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:44.780
the Ministry of Health
proposed for the group--

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.715
for our group to design
and do a case-control study

01:13:49.715 --> 01:13:54.230
that was funded by the Brazilian
Ministry of Health and Pan

01:13:54.230 --> 01:13:56.270
American Health Organization.

01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:59.360
The idea is that
epidemiologists,

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.680
in our toolbox, we have
the case control as one

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:09.700
of the first options because
we can get from the outcome

01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:10.930
to the exposure.

01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:15.410
It means almost doing
like research in reverse.

01:14:15.410 --> 01:14:18.080
You don't expect
things to happen.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.220
But you just go from
back to going to--

01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:22.900
next page.

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:25.450
So we had many hypotheses.

01:14:25.450 --> 01:14:29.380
And two of these
hypotheses were very--

01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:35.140
let's see-- very important
considering public health.

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:38.530
One was that a larvicide
that the government had

01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:42.910
put in the tank water that
was called pyriproxyfen

01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:45.700
was the cause of
the microcephaly.

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:47.920
So this was a very
important issue

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.990
because during an
epidemic, you would

01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:53.320
have to take out
the control measure

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:58.150
because it was supposed to be
the cause of the microcephaly.

01:14:58.150 --> 01:15:02.620
And the other very important
[INAUDIBLE] hypothesis

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:05.890
that came about
was about vaccine.

01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:11.110
So it got really in the media
that vaccine, like the rubella

01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:16.630
vaccine, was something
that was doing again--

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:20.920
kind of having an epitome.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:26.410
Like, say, we have an outbreak
due to the vaccination.

01:15:26.410 --> 01:15:29.380
So you can imagine
what the panic

01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:32.300
and the what the amount
of confusion and rumor

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:33.670
that was going on.

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:36.820
So those pipe waters
had to be tested.

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:43.900
Of course, our main hypothesis
was really the Zika virus

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:45.011
infection.

01:15:45.011 --> 01:15:45.510
Why?

01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:51.310
Because it had been proven to
be very neurotrophic in animals,

01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:55.400
we had the right temporal
sequence, and so on.

01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:58.450
So we designed a
case-control study

01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:01.450
that was the first
case-control study we designed.

01:16:01.450 --> 01:16:04.480
We couldn't get
retrospective [INAUDIBLE]

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:09.760
because we had to be sure that
they were congenitally infected

01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:12.220
and we choose the
right controls.

01:16:12.220 --> 01:16:15.370
And laboratory confirmation--
it just brought it here

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:17.600
because it was so important.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:20.050
We didn't have good lab tests.

01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:22.960
We still don't have
a good lab test.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:29.380
And what do I mean is that
Zika and dengue, being

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:33.610
from the same virus,
like the same flavivirus,

01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:35.200
they cross-react.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:39.700
So remember that this population
had been exposed to virus

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.860
for 30 years for dengue.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:44.630
So when you get a positive
serological result,

01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:47.830
you don't know if it
was dengue or not.

01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:51.010
But we are very lucky to
have in our institutions--

01:16:51.010 --> 01:16:53.020
like you said before--

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:55.600
preparedness, like
with this lab,

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:59.290
it was a reference
lab for flavivirus,

01:16:59.290 --> 01:17:03.970
and could do more lab
[INAUDIBLE] tests like PRNT

01:17:03.970 --> 01:17:06.910
Just for Zika and
for dengue in order

01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:10.900
to know for sure if we're
having a Zika-positive case

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.940
or a dengue-positive case.

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:16.870
I'm just going to show
that these factors--

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:20.320
I just made a big jump and I
excuse the epidemiologists.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:24.580
So you can see the odds one
doesn't have any difference

01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:26.810
between cases and controls.

01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:31.870
So you can see here
smoking was a confounder--

01:17:31.870 --> 01:17:33.550
actually was a confounder.

01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:36.490
Alcohol, vaccine,
and larvicide had

01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:40.160
nothing to do with
this epidemic at least.

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:42.760
And when we have
this cartoon here,

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.100
what we see in
this case-control--

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:50.200
it's something very strong,
a very, very powerful

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:55.930
association-- only
cases had been infected

01:17:55.930 --> 01:18:00.000
or had been congenitally
infected with microcephaly.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:03.880
So we're talking about in that
day's epidemic of microcephaly

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.940
and not all microcephalies.

01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:10.840
And another very important
result from this case-control

01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.740
study--

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:18.580
then we measured the past
exposure of this Zika

01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:21.280
in the mothers of
control that will be

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.430
kind of our population control.

01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:27.590
Even if it's not such
a large sample size,

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:31.330
60% of these mothers
had been exposed.

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:32.780
What does it mean?

01:18:32.780 --> 01:18:36.700
It means that in the
first wave of Zika virus,

01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:39.340
there was these huge exposures.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:45.310
I mean, we did have a naive
population, a huge population,

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:49.750
that were struck by
this wave of Zika

01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:54.100
and become infected
and were infected

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:56.540
and had an antibody response.

01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.930
So those are published papers.

01:18:58.930 --> 01:19:05.810
The ones who work in research
know this is very fast.

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:08.920
I mean, we did it in
a fast-track approval

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.480
that went under the emergency.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.360
And so, that's
the situation now.

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:15.800
And what now?

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:19.280
You'll see the first map
shows the first wave.

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:24.140
When you see the first,
very focused point,

01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:29.840
the epitome just in the first
in the northeast in two very

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:32.240
spots in the south.

01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:35.450
And later on in
the next year, you

01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:38.300
can see that it's not
too much transmission.

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.420
It doesn't look like
too much transmission.

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:44.180
If we think about
surveillance, we just

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:48.470
have surveillance data for 2016.

01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:52.280
That's the red line that
means the Zika infection.

01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:58.370
And we can see in this pic what
we see is seasonal epidemics,

01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:00.650
and you have a flat plateau.

01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:04.530
That transmission-- we don't
see too much transmission there.

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:06.740
Now it's chikungunya time.

01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:08.750
It's not Zika time anymore.

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:11.450
But what we see now--

01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:13.200
is it going?

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:14.450
This is what I found.

01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:17.500
It was more surprising
of the epidemic

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:21.215
was the use of WhatsApp
for good and for bad.

01:20:21.215 --> 01:20:23.150
I mean, for good,
for communication

01:20:23.150 --> 01:20:25.040
between the doctors
and patients,

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:28.310
and for bad, for
rumors, for fake news,

01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:30.240
for everything you can imagine.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.630
So this was kind of a nightmare.

01:20:33.630 --> 01:20:37.040
So, just brief remarks here.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.960
What were the challenges?

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:43.130
I think there are now ongoing
cohorts all over the world

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:46.880
monitoring pregnant
women and newborn babies.

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.940
We know very little
about the risks.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:54.440
I mean, if the risk is a
stable or we have varying risks

01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:56.870
according to
different populations.

01:20:56.870 --> 01:21:00.890
We don't know very little about
this fraction of the disease

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.090
we're talking about.

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:06.290
We don't know how these
children are going to develop.

01:21:06.290 --> 01:21:07.740
There are a lot--

01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:10.510
there's much, much
room to improve

01:21:10.510 --> 01:21:14.540
in diagnostics for management
and also for research.

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:18.440
I think that we are in a point
that we really need improvement

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.720
in this kind of diagnosis.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:25.700
And there are other
very important research

01:21:25.700 --> 01:21:27.770
being carried on.

01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:31.880
Now, I want really to
thank our group here

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.380
and to present our group.

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:36.620
That's Microcephaly
Epidemic Research Groups.

01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:40.550
I mean, a lot of people
from many institutions,

01:21:40.550 --> 01:21:44.490
many public institutions,
from all over the world,

01:21:44.490 --> 01:21:46.370
and especially from Brazil.

01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:49.070
A special thanks to
Dr. Laura Rodrigues

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:52.490
from London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine.

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:54.800
And here are all
the institutions.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:01.195
And here are all
of our supporters--

01:22:01.195 --> 01:22:05.640
NIH, there is a cohort of
pregnant women with NIH

01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:10.110
and a lot to work with
ZikaPLAN in many fields.

01:22:10.110 --> 01:22:11.935
Thank you very much
for your attention.

01:22:11.935 --> 01:22:15.895
[APPLAUSE]

01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:27.510
- OK, so we're going to have
just a brief discussion.

01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:30.470
And then we're going to open
the floor for questions.

01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:32.830
So please start thinking
about your question

01:22:32.830 --> 01:22:36.190
because we're going to need
your participation in a moment.

01:22:36.190 --> 01:22:39.340
So, I think there are
sort of three things that

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:42.510
became pretty obvious across
the three presentations.

01:22:42.510 --> 01:22:46.300
One is really the importance
of local capacity.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.280
That's absolutely crucial.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:50.740
And it's not that we are
solving all the problems

01:22:50.740 --> 01:22:54.130
for the next outbreak, but as
you build up the local capacity

01:22:54.130 --> 01:22:56.230
to respond, to
have the knowledge,

01:22:56.230 --> 01:22:59.860
to have the tools, that's
absolutely crucial.

01:22:59.860 --> 01:23:04.840
The second one is each one
of this work is basically

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:07.400
about overcoming challenges.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:08.620
And they are many.

01:23:08.620 --> 01:23:12.070
either because everybody tells
you you can't work in the DRC

01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:14.080
or because you are in
the middle of an outbreak

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:18.730
when nobody knows what to do,
but you have to do something.

01:23:18.730 --> 01:23:20.590
And I think, to me, the
most important thing

01:23:20.590 --> 01:23:21.650
that comes across--

01:23:21.650 --> 01:23:24.700
and fortunately, this
is true for many of us--

01:23:24.700 --> 01:23:27.640
is that if you really want to
do the right thing in the middle

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:31.330
of an outbreak, you really have
to go against the brutal tenure

01:23:31.330 --> 01:23:35.420
system and focus about saving
lives and not writing papers.

01:23:35.420 --> 01:23:36.730
And this is crucial.

01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:38.140
And some of us do that.

01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:39.484
We may get--

01:23:39.484 --> 01:23:40.900
I'm not saying
what I'm going to--

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:41.400
anyway.

01:23:41.400 --> 01:23:42.340
[LAUGHTER]

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.380
We may not be very
successful at the end,

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:46.930
but at least we can
sleep well at night

01:23:46.930 --> 01:23:48.630
with our head on the
pillow because we

01:23:48.630 --> 01:23:51.640
are trying to save lives, not
to get a paper in [INAUDIBLE]..

01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:52.430
This is crucial.

01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:57.280
And I cannot thank you
enough for bringing that up.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.580
So, I'm just going to have
one question for each speaker

01:24:00.580 --> 01:24:02.020
just to warm us
up, and then we're

01:24:02.020 --> 01:24:03.145
going to open to the floor.

01:24:03.145 --> 01:24:06.430
So, Happi, I want to
ask you a question.

01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:07.480
You do all this training.

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:10.600
You have people coming from
all those different countries.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.530
Training there, training here
and abroad, then those people

01:24:14.530 --> 01:24:15.830
go back to their countries.

01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:18.430
You can guarantee
what goes to Nigeria.

01:24:18.430 --> 01:24:22.180
Are they able to actually build
the same kind of infrastructure

01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:24.700
and have the same
kind of response

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:27.560
fast as you can
provide in Nigeria?

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.730
So, is this training
that you're providing

01:24:30.730 --> 01:24:34.810
being translated into really
resources in the countries

01:24:34.810 --> 01:24:36.632
when they go back?

01:24:36.632 --> 01:24:40.690
Anne, I wonder if
you've found something

01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:43.050
on sort of the social side.

01:24:43.050 --> 01:24:44.410
So how about stigma?

01:24:44.410 --> 01:24:47.470
How about social consequences
in the lives of those people?

01:24:47.470 --> 01:24:49.450
And many of them
have been surviving

01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:50.840
for more than four years.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.140
So were you able to learn
something about this?

01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:55.630
And one thing that
got me curious

01:24:55.630 --> 01:24:59.890
is, do we know anything if
the asymptomatic infections--

01:24:59.890 --> 01:25:01.810
if those people are infectious?

01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:04.840
Because if we do have
so many transmission

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.660
is still going on although
everybody think it's over,

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:10.590
why don't we have
another outbreak?

01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:14.140
And Celina, I'm kind of
going to put you on the spot,

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.660
but we are both Brazilian
so I think I can do that.

01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:17.620
- Friendly fire.

01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:19.220
[LAUGHTER]

01:25:19.220 --> 01:25:22.090
- So, I think another
thing that is obvious

01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:24.840
is context matters always.

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.100
We are never going to
have two outbreaks that

01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.610
are going to be the same in the
way they happen and in the way

01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:32.390
we respond to them.

01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:34.450
So, I think you
highlighted the importance

01:25:34.450 --> 01:25:38.020
of the front-line workers,
of the government declaring

01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.110
an emergency even not
with so much evidence,

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:44.620
but he did, and
in supporting you

01:25:44.620 --> 01:25:48.900
to lead this incredible work,
this epidemiological work,

01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.740
to respond to the epidemic.

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:54.640
The context now, 2017,
is very different.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.850
The leadership, both in the
government and in the ministry

01:25:57.850 --> 01:25:58.840
is different.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:04.460
So I would like you to reflect
how this whole crisis would

01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:07.840
unfold if Zika had
arrived in Brazil not

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:10.754
in 2015, but in 2017.

01:26:10.754 --> 01:26:12.670
I told you I was going
to put you on the spot.

01:26:12.670 --> 01:26:14.950
[LAUGHTER]

01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:15.980
So, Christian.

01:26:15.980 --> 01:26:18.470
- All right.

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:19.394
I don't--

01:26:19.394 --> 01:26:22.970
- Oh, you have your
microphone, so go for it.

01:26:22.970 --> 01:26:23.680
- Yeah.

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.570
I think one of the
questions was are there

01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:30.590
facilities for trainees
to use after training

01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:35.330
so that they can respond as fast
as we did in Nigeria in 2014?

01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:37.010
The answer is yes.

01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:39.560
In [INAUDIBLE],,
you saw we ensured

01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:42.925
that the trainees actually
get back and use facilities.

01:26:42.925 --> 01:26:45.050
So one thing that we did
basically in the countries

01:26:45.050 --> 01:26:48.310
where we have this [INAUDIBLE]
network across a region.

01:26:48.310 --> 01:26:51.500
We've set up a
reference laboratory

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:54.080
with state-of-art
facility, for instance.

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.750
In Nigeria, we have
next-generation sequences

01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:57.320
installed.

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.945
We have the same in
Sierra Leone and we

01:26:58.945 --> 01:27:02.450
have the same in Senegal.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:04.965
And those operating
those systems

01:27:04.965 --> 01:27:06.090
received the same training.

01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:10.190
And we use the same protocol
for any eventuality.

01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:13.250
So [INAUDIBLE] apart from
using those high-end equipment,

01:27:13.250 --> 01:27:17.750
we've also translated this
into middle-end and low-end

01:27:17.750 --> 01:27:19.380
facilities that it can use.

01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:22.180
For instance, for the
rapid diagnostic tests,

01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:26.240
we've done extensive training
for high-tech workers that

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:28.416
can use those for diagnosis.

01:27:28.416 --> 01:27:30.040
And we also have the
medial [INAUDIBLE]

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:31.940
that can use that
qPCR for diagnosis,

01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:33.470
for confirmational purposes.

01:27:33.470 --> 01:27:35.350
And in [INAUDIBLE],, for
instance, or Nigeria

01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:39.570
or in Dakar, you'll see
the very high-end equipment

01:27:39.570 --> 01:27:41.362
where we can actually
do confirmation.

01:27:41.362 --> 01:27:43.070
And that is the reason
why, for instance,

01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:44.810
because we have that--

01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:49.150
we've had cases in [INAUDIBLE]
suspected cases of Lassa fever

01:27:49.150 --> 01:27:50.740
in [INAUDIBLE] weeks back.

01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:53.920
Those were sent to those
facilities in Senegal.

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.370
And actually, we confirm
it wasn't Lassa fever.

01:27:56.370 --> 01:27:59.640
Presently in my lab, we're
dealing with monkeypox outbreak

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.590
in Nigeria.

01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:02.930
So, and we're basically
confirming cases

01:28:02.930 --> 01:28:04.880
and also responding
to the outbreak

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.625
and facilitating
government intervention

01:28:06.625 --> 01:28:07.940
in all those areas.

01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:08.690
I think in a way--

01:28:08.690 --> 01:28:10.860
I think in a way, we've
kind of addressed that.

01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:14.681
And that's one of the reasons
why we're not just framing,

01:28:14.681 --> 01:28:16.930
but we're also ensuring that
there are facilities that

01:28:16.930 --> 01:28:18.060
will accompany the trainees.

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:18.555
- Wonderful.

01:28:18.555 --> 01:28:19.055
Thank you.

01:28:19.055 --> 01:28:20.414
Anne?

01:28:20.414 --> 01:28:22.513
- OK, so you asked me
two different questions.

01:28:22.513 --> 01:28:23.770
Is this mic-- OK.

01:28:23.770 --> 01:28:26.282
I think this mic's on.

01:28:26.282 --> 01:28:27.990
So, you asked me two
different questions.

01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:32.810
The first one was about the
social effects of Ebola.

01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:37.170
And I just recently came
back from the 1995 outbreak.

01:28:37.170 --> 01:28:39.500
So this is something that's
very, very fresh in my mind

01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:41.390
right now.

01:28:41.390 --> 01:28:44.420
I spend a lot of
time doing interviews

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:49.240
and talking to these people
about their experience.

01:28:49.240 --> 01:28:53.250
And I think it's very,
very interesting.

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:56.270
First of all,
meeting these people

01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:59.810
and giving them the opportunity
to talk in this case just 22

01:28:59.810 --> 01:29:02.720
years later, it's the
first time anybody

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:06.980
had come to them in
20 years to ask them.

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.990
You know, in West Africa--
and this was a point

01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:13.730
that they made and really
was driven home to me.

01:29:13.730 --> 01:29:16.100
In West Africa
after the outbreak,

01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:19.400
there are 16,000 survivors.

01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:21.320
And so, there are
support groups.

01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:24.560
There are social services.

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:27.500
There is a huge investment
on the part of the US

01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:31.250
and other governments to study
them, to enroll them in trials,

01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:34.250
to enroll them in studies,
which also gives them

01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:38.780
the benefit of having quality
of care, whereas people

01:29:38.780 --> 01:29:44.010
in West or in Congo,
all of these cohorts--

01:29:44.010 --> 01:29:45.196
there's nothing.

01:29:45.196 --> 01:29:46.070
There are no studies.

01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:47.450
There are no trials.

01:29:47.450 --> 01:29:49.310
There's no support.

01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:53.510
And even to go to these
sites and to do these studies

01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:56.630
in '76 and '95 outbreaks,
we needed to have labs.

01:29:56.630 --> 01:29:59.600
And we had big negotiations
with the hospitals

01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.810
and the local government because
they didn't want the survivors

01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:04.460
all in the same place.

01:30:04.460 --> 01:30:06.320
And they were worried
about what happens

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:07.666
when the survivors come.

01:30:07.666 --> 01:30:10.040
And in fact, the survivors
were very nervous about coming

01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:10.706
to the hospital.

01:30:10.706 --> 01:30:15.860
They felt the issue of
stigma is so great even

01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:20.670
in trying to do
studies with them.

01:30:20.670 --> 01:30:22.740
It's something that's
very, very important.

01:30:22.740 --> 01:30:26.450
And so even just the fact of how
hard doing these studies were

01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:29.000
is all attributable to
this issue of stigma.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.540
And the stories that
still need to be

01:30:32.540 --> 01:30:34.160
understood in greater detail--

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:37.280
and we hope to do much more
with ethnographic studies

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:41.750
and really delving
into their experiences

01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:44.220
so it doesn't happen again.

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:46.670
So yes, stigma is
very, very important

01:30:46.670 --> 01:30:49.977
and not explored at all.

01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:51.560
The second question
you asked me about

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:52.970
was asymptomatic infections.

01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:55.610
And you asked a very
important question

01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:58.160
which is something that we
hoped to be able to answer,

01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:01.490
which is do people are still--
what role do these people play

01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:02.430
in transmission.

01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:04.390
And we don't know
the answer yet.

01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:05.671
But we hope to learn.

01:31:05.671 --> 01:31:06.170
- Thank you.

01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:08.180
Celina?

01:31:08.180 --> 01:31:14.630
- Well, you asked me a
very difficult question

01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:16.640
because prediction
what's going--

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:20.450
what could have happened if you
have a different government.

01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:23.900
But it gives me the
opportunity to say

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:28.070
that when the Zika
epidemic started,

01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:34.160
we were in an intense
economic and political crisis.

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.200
I don't know if you remember.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:39.500
It was under Dilma
Rousseff's impeachment.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:42.320
So it was right to--

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:47.510
and of a period and
starting a new government.

01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:55.100
And at that time, it was such in
intense scientist mobilization.

01:31:55.100 --> 01:31:58.430
I mean, we were asked
to write reports

01:31:58.430 --> 01:32:03.890
and to look and go to the front
line to see what was going on.

01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:06.380
So it just got to
the point that I

01:32:06.380 --> 01:32:10.380
think the scientists
influence when they can.

01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:13.250
And when the situation--

01:32:13.250 --> 01:32:15.020
to take responsibility.

01:32:15.020 --> 01:32:16.730
There is nothing
that you can call

01:32:16.730 --> 01:32:18.950
for in a situation like this.

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:22.620
But I think we must be concerned
about the next government

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:26.620
that's cutting the
public health--

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:29.870
I mean, support and
research funding.

01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:32.930
So we must be concerned
because we're just

01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:37.490
starting to understand
the full development

01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:42.210
and the full spectrum
of the disease now.

01:32:42.210 --> 01:32:47.150
And I don't think that we could
say that transmissions stopped

01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:49.980
and it shouldn't worry
about it any longer.

01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:55.400
I think we must watch out
because arbovirus epidemiology

01:32:55.400 --> 01:33:00.380
arbovirus is changing,
and is changing fast.

01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:04.500
So, the first maps
we saw in the world,

01:33:04.500 --> 01:33:07.850
we just have the tropical
areas saying the vector-borne

01:33:07.850 --> 01:33:09.620
with population.

01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:11.360
Now it's much wider.

01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:15.380
I mean, we have different
things, which just give me

01:33:15.380 --> 01:33:21.350
the opportunity also to see what
range of intervention actions

01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:24.770
were proposed since the
first, and were very

01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:27.200
hard to keep for a long time.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:30.800
The range of interventions
for the epidemic

01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:38.570
was mosquito control strategies,
postponing pregnancy,

01:33:38.570 --> 01:33:42.530
travels recommendations,
safe sex, and so on.

01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:45.080
So, you really need
to build knowledge

01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:49.710
to make these recommendations
in long term possible.

01:33:49.710 --> 01:33:53.600
So thank you for giving me
this opportunity to complete.

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:55.040
- OK, so the floor is open.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:57.595
Please state your name
and frame your question.

01:33:57.595 --> 01:33:58.430
- Thank you, yes.

01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:59.300
Paul Beninger.

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:01.940
I'm at Tufts.

01:34:01.940 --> 01:34:04.520
And I want to thank you for
your groundbreaking work

01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:09.440
with regard to the
lookbacks in '76 in '95.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:12.200
In both the groups
that you looked at--

01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.490
the survivors as well as
the health care workers--

01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:20.660
what do you know about the
families of the survivors

01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:22.190
and health care workers?

01:34:22.190 --> 01:34:23.600
Do they have titers?

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.700
Do they have any
histories that are

01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:29.930
suggestive of any type
of communicability,

01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:33.470
particularly with close families
and the intimacy and the food

01:34:33.470 --> 01:34:35.960
preparation and all the
other types of activities?

01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:39.740
And of course, sex with
spouses and the like.

01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:42.710
So the question is,
is there anything

01:34:42.710 --> 01:34:45.640
that you know about
those close contacts

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:48.710
and families of the survivors--

01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:51.900
children, grandchildren,
and health care workers?

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:52.430
- Thank you.

01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:54.710
Let's take three questions
and then we'll answer.

01:34:54.710 --> 01:34:56.490
So the next one.

01:34:56.490 --> 01:34:59.060
We'll take another question
from the person behind you.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.321
Thank you.

01:35:00.321 --> 01:35:01.070
- Just real quick.

01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.290
- Got it noted.

01:35:01.290 --> 01:35:02.081
- I'm James Wilson.

01:35:02.081 --> 01:35:05.360
I'm one of the speakers
in the next panel.

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:07.400
Christian, we talked
about the differences

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:10.040
between the Nigerian
experience with Ebola,

01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:15.170
which was superlative and
the Guinea experience, right?

01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:16.089
And so, I want--

01:35:16.089 --> 01:35:17.630
I think it's important
to maybe raise

01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:19.912
that with the audience
as to why were there

01:35:19.912 --> 01:35:20.870
tremendous differences.

01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:24.140
Because obviously the gaps
in diagnostics and response

01:35:24.140 --> 01:35:27.300
and the intelligence failures
that we observed in Guinea

01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:29.750
were very important to
precipitate all the outcomes

01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:31.340
we saw in West Africa.

01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:35.270
And then Celina, we talked about
the intelligence out of Tahiti

01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:37.214
and the emergence of Zika there.

01:35:37.214 --> 01:35:38.630
And could have,
should have, would

01:35:38.630 --> 01:35:40.296
have-- if we had known
what was going on

01:35:40.296 --> 01:35:42.260
in Tahiti before the
experience in Brazil,

01:35:42.260 --> 01:35:44.240
how could that have
changed the outcomes?

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:47.720
So again, focusing your
comments on how can we

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:49.230
improve our intel?

01:35:49.230 --> 01:35:51.710
How can we improve our
ability to anticipate

01:35:51.710 --> 01:35:53.100
these kinds of problems?

01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.031
Thank you.

01:35:54.031 --> 01:35:54.530
- Thanks.

01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:57.260
So, one more question, and
then we'll have answers.

01:35:57.260 --> 01:36:01.490
- How would your
role of a researcher

01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:06.260
change if you were to
propose to the folks

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:11.030
that you're trying to get the
information a stipend to combat

01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:12.630
this war?

01:36:12.630 --> 01:36:15.860
In other words,
you would pay them

01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:24.757
to enter the area without
being harassed or freely--

01:36:24.757 --> 01:36:26.090
- Can you say your name, please?

01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.840
- Oh, sure.

01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:27.877
I'm not a clinician.

01:36:27.877 --> 01:36:28.460
- That's fine.

01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.150
- My name is
[? Gladiver ?] Santiago.

01:36:30.150 --> 01:36:30.650
- Thank you.

01:36:30.650 --> 01:36:31.376
- OK.

01:36:31.376 --> 01:36:33.250
- All right, so Christian,
you want to start?

01:36:33.250 --> 01:36:34.070
- OK.

01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:38.910
Yeah, the question is
what was the difference

01:36:38.910 --> 01:36:46.640
between the Nigeria and the
Guinea experience in terms

01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.950
of Ebola response.

01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:51.630
Well, there are
two major things.

01:36:51.630 --> 01:36:55.470
One was yes, we understand
that in the case of--

01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:58.320
I mean, infrastructure was one.

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:03.120
But then I think what I
saw there as most important

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.980
in that was in the case of
Nigeria, there were two things.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:12.970
One was probably an element
of luck in the sense

01:37:12.970 --> 01:37:17.570
that when the [INAUDIBLE]
case arrived at the airport

01:37:17.570 --> 01:37:24.000
in Lagos, he was already sick
and he stumbled at the airport.

01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.540
Then at that moment and at that
time, he was probably a VIP.

01:37:27.540 --> 01:37:31.370
He was taken to one of the
best hospitals in Nigeria.

01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:32.990
It also happened
that at that time,

01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:34.770
the health sector
in Nigeria was--

01:37:34.770 --> 01:37:37.810
public sector was paralyzed
because the doctors

01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:39.990
were on strike.

01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:43.870
So he had no choice but to
go to a private hospital.

01:37:43.870 --> 01:37:45.930
And he received treatment there.

01:37:45.930 --> 01:37:51.600
But the difference
though, is the fact

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.280
that in Nigeria,
we had that ability

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:55.260
to diagnose on the ground.

01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:57.040
In Guinea, it was
the other way around.

01:37:57.040 --> 01:38:01.740
In Guinea, the samples
were from over to France

01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:05.460
and diagnosed in France
and result turned down

01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:06.900
to Conakry, and
then from Conakry

01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:09.040
down to the
confinements of Guinea.

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:12.720
And that on the average,
was taking 10 to 14 days.

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.980
So within that period, then
the disease was spreading.

01:38:16.980 --> 01:38:21.990
But in the case of Nigeria, we
had all that it took on-site.

01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:28.730
But then most importantly,
it was self-reliance.

01:38:28.730 --> 01:38:31.740
The Nigerian health authority
believed in themselves,

01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:33.730
unlike happened in
Guinea, where they

01:38:33.730 --> 01:38:36.700
were pretty much dictated upon.

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:38.560
In Nigeria, for
instance, when we

01:38:38.560 --> 01:38:43.150
did our diagnosis and many of
the international organizations

01:38:43.150 --> 01:38:47.430
came in with their
views and their opinions

01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:51.330
with their suggestion that
they need to confirm first

01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:57.080
before we decide what to
do, the Nigerian government

01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:00.800
told them we do things
the way we want.

01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:03.350
And that was a major
game changer because

01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:05.600
for a long time, if you
went to WHO website,

01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:07.970
it was still unconfirmed.

01:39:07.970 --> 01:39:09.800
But if you were
going by WHO rule,

01:39:09.800 --> 01:39:11.730
we'd have been in big trouble.

01:39:11.730 --> 01:39:13.760
So we're very,
very self-reliant,

01:39:13.760 --> 01:39:15.900
very confident about
what we're doing.

01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:18.950
And we went and then
took the bull by the horn

01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:21.410
and addressed those
things immediately.

01:39:21.410 --> 01:39:23.030
And eventually we
were vindicated.

01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:24.162
Thank you.

01:39:24.162 --> 01:39:24.994
- Anne?

01:39:24.994 --> 01:39:26.600
- Thank you.

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:28.160
So, the question
that you asked was

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:33.320
about what do we know about
long-term sequelae in family

01:39:33.320 --> 01:39:37.370
members, in health care
workers, and what do we

01:39:37.370 --> 01:39:39.980
know about transmission,
essentially.

01:39:39.980 --> 01:39:43.850
And the answer is not much yet.

01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:45.890
And I hope you're
on my study section

01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:51.680
for the grant I've submitted
to be able to really understand

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.900
in greater detail about this.

01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:57.140
You know, one of
the big issues is

01:39:57.140 --> 01:40:01.850
when you talk about asymptomatic
infection is what does that

01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:02.360
really mean?

01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.610
I mean, asymptomatic
infection means

01:40:04.610 --> 01:40:07.039
that we've found that
there were seroreactive.

01:40:07.039 --> 01:40:09.580
But one of the questions that
we did ask these people as well

01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:11.630
is, did you have signs
or symptoms of anything

01:40:11.630 --> 01:40:15.245
during that time period
or at any point later?

01:40:15.245 --> 01:40:16.870
Some people would
remember some things.

01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:18.540
Some people might not.

01:40:18.540 --> 01:40:21.110
And so the question is, were
they symptomatically infected?

01:40:21.110 --> 01:40:24.092
Did they truly
not have symptoms,

01:40:24.092 --> 01:40:25.550
or were they
minimally symptomatic,

01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:27.508
or was it just something
that was unrecognized?

01:40:27.508 --> 01:40:30.030
Because what we now know
about the Ebola outbreak

01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:32.780
or about Ebola as a disease
is that it can manifest itself

01:40:32.780 --> 01:40:34.710
in a variety of ways.

01:40:34.710 --> 01:40:41.950
It's not just the apocalyptic,
hemorrhagic version that

01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:43.820
has been so well publicized.

01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:46.230
So there's a lot to
understand, first of all,

01:40:46.230 --> 01:40:49.790
whether or not people actually
were symptomatic, minimally

01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:51.950
symptomatic, asymptomatic,
or unrecognized,

01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:53.912
and then what that will mean.

01:40:53.912 --> 01:40:55.370
- Celina?

01:40:55.370 --> 01:41:03.570
- OK, I was just about improved
ability of seeing or detecting

01:41:03.570 --> 01:41:05.890
an outbreak.

01:41:05.890 --> 01:41:10.415
If you think about very
urbanized places that

01:41:10.415 --> 01:41:13.440
were environmental,
in Brazil, we

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:17.140
do have quite a
public health system,

01:41:17.140 --> 01:41:24.500
and with family practitioners
and there was a structure.

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:30.400
So if you have those people
at the front line, well aware

01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.210
and knowing that if
they report something,

01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:35.350
it's going to be looked--

01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:38.540
[INAUDIBLE] something that's
going to be investigated.

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:40.510
I think that's the
beginning of everything

01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:42.850
of what community approach.

01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:47.800
Maybe there are some now with
big data or things like this.

01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:50.680
I think I'm going to
join your section just

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.500
to see what you're
going to say about it.

01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:55.990
But normally, what
we tend to see

01:41:55.990 --> 01:42:00.180
is the patient when he
comes to, and someone just

01:42:00.180 --> 01:42:04.360
spots that something different
or unusual in large numbers,

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.560
or whatever.

01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:09.460
So, I feel that training and
having good house workers

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.470
and good community support--

01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:14.770
all those things
are essential for--

01:42:14.770 --> 01:42:18.820
I mean, if we can
improve this ability

01:42:18.820 --> 01:42:23.690
to see the outbreaks
in a shorter time.

01:42:23.690 --> 01:42:26.290
- Universal health care, primary
health care, the backbone

01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:28.090
of the SDGs?

01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:32.360
So, let's get two or
three more questions.

01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:35.260
- Hi, I'm John [? Rigero. ?] I'm
representing the Eugene Wright

01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:37.990
Science and Technology Academy
in Chelsea, Massachusetts

01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:39.880
and Northeastern University.

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:43.630
My question is you talked about
a plethora of transmission

01:42:43.630 --> 01:42:47.200
factors, both environmental
and genetic, in your respected

01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:48.920
epidemics.

01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.610
What my question is is
that is there any research

01:42:51.610 --> 01:42:54.220
or is there any research
you're aware of being

01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:58.720
done on the epigenomic factors
in these disease transmissions?

01:42:58.720 --> 01:42:59.510
Thank you.

01:42:59.510 --> 01:43:00.010
- Thank you.

01:43:00.010 --> 01:43:00.958
The next one?

01:43:06.172 --> 01:43:09.190
- If Zika virus
creates complications

01:43:09.190 --> 01:43:12.910
for pregnant women and birth
defects for their children,

01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:19.985
what are some ways mothers can
prevent this from happening?

01:43:19.985 --> 01:43:21.350
- OK.

01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:23.450
One more and then I'll
go to the answers.

01:43:23.450 --> 01:43:25.160
- My name is Ethel Jackson.

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:28.970
And I just have to say
I've had a 40-year career

01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:32.210
in molecular
genetics of microbes

01:43:32.210 --> 01:43:34.700
in university and in
industrial settings.

01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:39.110
And I am awed and humbled by
what I've heard from this panel

01:43:39.110 --> 01:43:40.130
this morning.

01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:42.560
I congratulate
you and thank you.

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:44.390
A quick question
though going forward

01:43:44.390 --> 01:43:47.840
about how technology might help.

01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:51.920
Is there work ongoing
to develop vaccines

01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.900
against Ebola and Zika?

01:43:53.900 --> 01:43:58.100
Do you think that is
a promising approach,

01:43:58.100 --> 01:44:02.330
or do you think that it
will be in the future solely

01:44:02.330 --> 01:44:06.020
up to public health
and epidemiology

01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:08.700
to protect us from
these diseases?

01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:09.380
- Thank you.

01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:11.920
So, folks, we have three
minutes when you [INAUDIBLE]----

01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:14.980
if you want to answer.

01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:20.460
- Well, as far as the epigenomic
factors involving transmission

01:44:20.460 --> 01:44:24.980
of disease is concerned, there
may be some work out there,

01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:28.110
but not that I am aware of.

01:44:28.110 --> 01:44:30.450
But it's very possible that
there is work going on.

01:44:30.450 --> 01:44:34.640
But often, I think, in the
context in which we're working,

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:38.540
the context of outbreak, it's
very difficult at that time

01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:42.020
to sit down and then design an
experiment that will actually

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:44.000
take into account all of this--

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:46.970
I mean, investigate
the epigenomic--

01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:49.827
especially in the context of
an Ebola or Lassa outbreak.

01:44:49.827 --> 01:44:52.160
But it's very possible that
there is some work out there

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.366
that I'm not aware of.

01:44:54.366 --> 01:44:56.240
- I'll respond to the
question about vaccines

01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.990
and therapeutics.

01:44:57.990 --> 01:45:00.520
Certainly, there have
been major strides

01:45:00.520 --> 01:45:03.760
in the last several years
with vaccines of therapeutics

01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:05.230
with regard to Ebola.

01:45:05.230 --> 01:45:09.280
And certainly there are
candidates out there.

01:45:09.280 --> 01:45:11.702
We also believe that the
people that we're working with

01:45:11.702 --> 01:45:13.660
may have very, very
interesting antibodies that

01:45:13.660 --> 01:45:15.820
are developed long over time.

01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:18.610
But the bigger question
that you asked was,

01:45:18.610 --> 01:45:20.680
do you think that this
is the way forward?

01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.930
And we had a long discussion
about this yesterday.

01:45:22.930 --> 01:45:26.350
And I think that while
vaccines and therapeutics are

01:45:26.350 --> 01:45:29.050
very important and something
that does need to be pursued,

01:45:29.050 --> 01:45:32.140
the real issue is
lack of infrastructure

01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:34.330
in these countries and
the ability of the people

01:45:34.330 --> 01:45:37.570
in these countries to be able
to have infrastructure required

01:45:37.570 --> 01:45:39.790
to have adequate disease
reporting so that people

01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:42.730
understand what's going on
in real time in the places

01:45:42.730 --> 01:45:44.830
where you need to
understand it most, and have

01:45:44.830 --> 01:45:48.670
the well-trained and equipped
people on the ground who have

01:45:48.670 --> 01:45:51.030
the ability to respond quickly.

01:45:51.030 --> 01:45:53.260
And if you have those
things, then the vaccines

01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:56.120
and therapeutics are a
nice secondary response,

01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:59.070
but they are not the primary
thing that will save us.

01:45:59.070 --> 01:45:59.570
- OK.

01:45:59.570 --> 01:46:00.070
- Thank you.

01:46:00.070 --> 01:46:01.030
Celina?

01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:02.020
- OK.

01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:06.120
Prevention-- I think that from
now we have recommendations

01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:07.200
for pregnant women.

01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:11.160
If you go to a CDC--

01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.390
I mean, all sites.

01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:14.610
I mean, there are preventions.

01:46:14.610 --> 01:46:17.160
And you should not--

01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:19.170
if you want to be--

01:46:19.170 --> 01:46:21.750
if you're planning
to be pregnant,

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:25.800
you shouldn't visit areas
with the virus circulation.

01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:28.960
Without a vaccine,
that's what we can do.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:34.170
Think about transmission by
vector-borne, by a vector,

01:46:34.170 --> 01:46:37.840
by a mosquito, and by
sexual transmission.

01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:41.790
So if you have a partner
that visits an endemic area--

01:46:41.790 --> 01:46:47.700
so, you have to have safe sex
for six months, whatever--

01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:49.530
we don't know
exactly for how long.

01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:52.360
[LAUGHTER]

01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:56.250
So, I think that vaccine
is something to look for

01:46:56.250 --> 01:47:01.800
and to see how transmission
is going to progress

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:04.110
during the following years.

01:47:04.110 --> 01:47:04.890
- Thank you.

01:47:04.890 --> 01:47:07.200
So, I want to thank
all the speakers

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.580
because we are right on time.

01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:12.060
So we're not going to get a
red card from the organizers.

01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:12.720
Look at that.

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:16.020
So, thank you for
your participation.

01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.670
And please join me in thanking
all the speakers for really

01:47:18.670 --> 01:47:19.420
a phenomenal discussion.

01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:20.170
[APPLAUSE]

01:47:20.170 --> 01:47:23.820
