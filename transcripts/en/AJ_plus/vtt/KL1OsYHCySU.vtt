00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.507
Lately it’s been 3 to 4 hours.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:11.845
Not having a paper changes everything.

00:00:19.561 --> 00:00:22.105
Who's going to want to wake up at 3:30 in the morning?

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:25.400
I've got a full-time job and I volunteer in the morning.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.862
Before work, I drop the refugees at the airport

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.448
and do this over again every day.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:32.449
Monday to Sunday.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.535
Just barely woke up from a nap.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.912
I'm going to work right now.

00:00:45.128 --> 00:00:47.213
I live in Juárez, but I cross every day because

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:51.801
I'm studying my major of journalism
in the University of Texas at El Paso. 

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.804
If President Trump did decide to close the border,

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:57.265
I think it would affect a lot this community. 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.184
I'm not going to be able to finish my studies.

00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.979
I usually drive every day back and forth to go to school.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:04.689
There's more migrants and

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:08.193
with President Trump saying that he was going to close the border

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.111
and everything being like uncertain ...

00:01:10.111 --> 00:01:14.157
and then when he started taking
some of the CBPs away for the lines,

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.826
that's when we really started to see a difference.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:23.666
We’re at the bridge.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:25.710
I’m doing the line to cross to El Paso.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:28.171
Lately it’s been 3 to 4 hours.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:30.632
Two hours.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:39.933
The officers that work here at the border, 

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:43.645
they’re being transferred to other parts of the country.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.898
Suddenly we see this change in the border.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.030
We basically receive a text from ICE

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.242
letting us know how many refugees are going to be released. 

00:01:57.242 --> 00:02:00.245
Like today they were released 721.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:04.624
We receive daily 60 refugees.

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:09.629
They're either sick due to the fact that
they're in a place that is kind of cold,

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.424
running fevers, a cold, or they have stomach problems.

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:16.427
From Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador ...

00:02:16.427 --> 00:02:19.764
people that they come here to our church with

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:23.601
legal documents from immigration. Where they've been through

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:26.396
a process to make sure that they're not criminals,

00:02:26.396 --> 00:02:30.942
for they could come into the states temporarily,
for they could each their family members.

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:51.981
Currently I'm working for Borderzine.

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:55.401
Borderzine allows you to do stories either in Spanish or in English.

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:57.528
We get to see like both sides of the border.

00:03:57.528 --> 00:04:02.158
I've been here living 20, 21 years and
I've never seen so many immigrants coming.

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.953
A lot of people here in the community, especially from Juárez,

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:10.375
are little bit more aggressive toward the immigrants
because they're disrupting the city

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:14.587
because we don't have the infrastructure to kind of
support the amount of people that's coming in. 

00:04:14.587 --> 00:04:19.676
I think that when someone like migrates,
there needs to be something really bad happening back home

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:24.097
because of the travel they do.
They don't have water, there's a load of heat. 

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:26.307
You need to walk for days, for weeks, for months.

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.935
Not having a paper changes everything.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:32.981
A sock.

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:37.819
Currently in the El Paso sector,

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:44.409
we are averaging approximately
700 individuals being detained on a daily basis.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:49.372
Oh, look!

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:50.999
Did they walk up to you?

00:04:59.841 --> 00:05:02.885
They just crossed and turned themselves
in to this Border Patrol agent.

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:04.721
Father, daughter, father, son.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:12.228
Our facilities, Border Patrol, we were never built
to house family units as we're seeing now. 

00:05:12.395 --> 00:05:14.689
So it's a huge challenge for us, 

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:20.320
not only as in our facilities, but as far as
the agents and the supplies and the care.

00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:25.700
My name is Cynthia Pompa and

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.871
I work as the advocacy manager at the Border Rights Center.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:33.791
We simply walk across to Juárez, to Mexico 

00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:35.918
and observe what is happening.

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:41.716
Are there migrants or asylum seekers arriving
and are being told to turn away? 

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.302
Who is telling them? What are they being told?

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:51.225
This is a new stretch of the border wall
that was funded during the Trump administration. 

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:07.200
A young migrant girl showed up
to present herself at a port of entry

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.871
and was told by a CBP official that she needed to go back

00:06:11.871 --> 00:06:15.958
and find a Mexican agent, and get herself on a list. 

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.002
She was really confused and lost. 

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:22.423
I saw a young boy who showed up to request asylum. 

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:28.137
What is unlawful is how CBP is standing
in the middle of the international bridges, 

00:06:28.137 --> 00:06:31.349
right on the international line, and turning away asylum seekers.

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.480
I want to help the people out

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:47.068
because the things that I see, things that I hear from them

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:49.487
is like, ah, I don't like it.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.113
They're going to different places. 

00:08:51.781 --> 00:08:58.204
All depends. They go to Miami, New York, Boston, Kansas City, Dallas ... 

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:01.457
all depends, you know, where the family lives.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:03.834
I dunno when the job will end.

00:09:07.088 --> 00:09:10.841
I'll be there until it finishes, you know?

00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:13.302
And to be honest, I don't know what's the day. 

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:16.222
It could take a year, two years, I'm not sure.
