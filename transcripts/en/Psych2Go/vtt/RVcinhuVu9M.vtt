We want to make psychology come alive for you!

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.360
Many of us want to be in happy, and meaningful relationships,

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.420
But nowadays, in a dating scene plagued with superficiality

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.240
and an abundance of choice.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.000
making a relationship long term, while staying sane

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.020
is much easier said. Than done.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.300
The initial spark is great! But it takes alot more than attraction to sustain a relationship...

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.240
What are some ways we can keep a healthy relationship?

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.740
and ensure long happiness with our partners? you may ask

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.820
Here are 12 signs you're in a healthy relationship!

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.560
1. You communicate openly

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.660
A great relationship starts with transparency

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.580
Do you feel like you could communicate about anything with your partner?

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.880
From personal needs to taboo topics?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.980
Do the both of you take the time to listen and empathize with each other?

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.720
Good communication means using a sort of techniques,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.860
Which includes: welcoming body language, concentrated listening, and respectful language

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.360
2. You argue

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.180
This might sound strange, but arguing sometimes is actually healthy in a relationship

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.460
Otherwise, you're probably just bottling up your feelings and letting them turn into resentment

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.440
Couples who communicate well can argue affectively,

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.780
Both parties can state their opinions whilst trying to understand where the other person is coming from

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.100
The also know when to apologize if they are wrong

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.600
This point, however shouldn't be confused with destructive fighting.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.440
In which couples use aggressive behavior and language to hurt each other when they disagree about an issue

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.640
3. You keep relationship details private

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.880
It's normal to turn to close friends and family for relationship advice when you run into conflict with your partner.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.340
But making your problems public, on social media is 'passive aggressive'

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.700
and can damage the trust you've built with them...

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.740
Everyone needs a sense of privacy to feel safe, including relationships!

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.920
4. You don't hold grudges.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.900

Can hurt your relationship in the long run,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.340

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.480
