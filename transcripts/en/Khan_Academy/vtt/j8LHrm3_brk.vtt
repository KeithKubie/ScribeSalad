00:00:02.153 --> 00:00:03.639
- [Voiceover] Now we're
gonna discuss the second

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.730
of two popular ways to analyze circuits,

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.614
and this one is called
the mesh current method.

00:00:09.614 --> 00:00:11.526
This is actually one of my favorite.

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:13.828
There's a fun spot here
where we make up currents

00:00:13.828 --> 00:00:17.035
flowing around in circles
inside the circuit,

00:00:17.035 --> 00:00:18.785
and it's interesting.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.078
In the mesh current method,
what we do is we define

00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:26.579
mesh currents, so we
need to define that word.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.614
A mesh current.

00:00:27.614 --> 00:00:30.814
A mesh current is a current
that flows in a mesh.

00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:34.349
And a mesh is the open
windows of the circuit.

00:00:34.349 --> 00:00:36.546
Here's one of the meshes in our circuit.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:39.673
There's another mesh
here, it's an open window,

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:43.502
and this third one here is another one.

00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:45.588
And this will be our
mesh current number one.

00:00:45.588 --> 00:00:47.816
We'll call it i1, and we can define these

00:00:47.816 --> 00:00:50.399
other mesh currents, like this.

00:00:52.855 --> 00:00:54.891
And I'm gonna define them all to go around

00:00:54.891 --> 00:00:55.858
the same direction.

00:00:55.858 --> 00:00:57.617
They're all going clockwise,

00:00:57.617 --> 00:00:59.200
around our circuit.

00:01:03.644 --> 00:01:05.248
Now let me take a second
to label the other

00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:07.045
components in our circuit here.

00:01:07.045 --> 00:01:10.212
We'll call this V, we'll call this R1,

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:12.434
R2,

00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:15.154
R3,

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:18.339
R4,

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:20.114
and this has a current source in it.

00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:22.225
We'll call that I.

00:01:22.225 --> 00:01:23.872
Makes it a little bit more interesting,

00:01:23.872 --> 00:01:25.436
and this is one of the reasons we use

00:01:25.436 --> 00:01:27.642
the mesh current method.

00:01:27.642 --> 00:01:30.713
The word mesh actually
comes from like screen doors

00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:33.753
or window screens where
there's wires and there's

00:01:33.753 --> 00:01:37.868
spaces between the wires,
so a space in a wire network

00:01:37.868 --> 00:01:39.096
is called a mesh.

00:01:39.096 --> 00:01:41.712
That's where the name comes from.

00:01:41.712 --> 00:01:45.017
These mesh currents are
kind of interesting.

00:01:45.017 --> 00:01:46.768
In some sense they exist, and then,

00:01:46.768 --> 00:01:48.901
but it doesn't seem like they really do.

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.715
How can these currents be
flowing around in circles?

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:53.407
Let's look a little closely.

00:01:53.407 --> 00:01:55.816
It's pretty clear that the
current flowing through

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:59.983
our voltage source, V, is
equal to mesh current i1.

00:02:00.884 --> 00:02:04.267
And also, when we get up
here to R1, mesh current i1

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:08.017
is flowing through R1
in this direction here.

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:10.610
What happens when we get to R2?

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.924
We have one mesh current
flowing down through R2,

00:02:13.924 --> 00:02:16.563
and another mesh current
flowing up through R2.

00:02:16.563 --> 00:02:18.757
How can this make sense?

00:02:18.757 --> 00:02:22.674
Let me go over here, and
we'll draw, redraw R2.

00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:28.317
Here's R2, and now I'll
redraw the mesh currents.

00:02:28.317 --> 00:02:32.433
So we have a mesh current,
i1 going down like that,

00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:34.909
and we have a mesh current,

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.076
i2, like that.

00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:41.538
And I'll label on here, I'll
label the element current,

00:02:41.538 --> 00:02:43.871
for R2, we'll call that iR2.

00:02:47.697 --> 00:02:49.721
And what's gonna happen,
this is a really wonderful

00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:52.955
application of the
principle of superposition.

00:02:52.955 --> 00:02:56.872
i1 and i2 superimposed
inside R2 to create iR2.

00:03:01.066 --> 00:03:03.483
So if we wanted to know iR2,

00:03:05.803 --> 00:03:07.614
it would be the sum of these two currents.

00:03:07.614 --> 00:03:12.167
Now i1 is flowing in the
same direction as iR2,

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:16.097
so this equals i1, and i2
is going in the opposite

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:19.014
direction, so it gets a minus sign.

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:23.392
And if we somehow knew
i1 and i2, this is how

00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:25.707
we would compute the actually current

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:28.147
that's flowing in R2.

00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:30.159
Next, since this is a
method, I want to list out

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:32.159
the steps of the method.

00:03:33.364 --> 00:03:35.700
The mesh current method is the first thing

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.533
is to draw the meshes.

00:03:43.632 --> 00:03:47.799
And we did that over here,
when we drew i1, i2, and i3.

00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:52.944
And the second step is
to solve the easy ones.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.349
When we say an easy one, here's
an example of an easy one.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.516
The current source I, right
here, defines what i3 is.

00:04:07.656 --> 00:04:12.014
So i3 is an example of an
easy current to solve for.

00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:16.157
And then the third step in the method is

00:04:16.157 --> 00:04:16.990
to write

00:04:19.552 --> 00:04:21.434
Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:04:21.434 --> 00:04:22.267
KVL.

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:25.379
Write Kirchoff's voltage law equations,

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:28.840
for the two remaining mesh currents.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.257
And the fourth step is solve.

00:04:34.597 --> 00:04:36.859
So in this video we're gonna
do the first three steps,

00:04:36.859 --> 00:04:40.681
and then in the next video,
we'll go the full solve.

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:43.661
Okay, so let's run our
mesh current method.

00:04:43.661 --> 00:04:45.363
Number one, draw the meshes.

00:04:45.363 --> 00:04:48.521
Here's step one, happening right here.

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:50.641
So we could check off, we did step one.

00:04:50.641 --> 00:04:52.462
Step two is solve for the easy ones.

00:04:52.462 --> 00:04:55.922
And with think, i3 counts as an easy one.

00:04:55.922 --> 00:04:59.422
i3 flows down, through the current source,

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.390
and so, step number two,

00:05:05.213 --> 00:05:06.213
so step two,

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.069
is i3 equals negative I,

00:05:14.275 --> 00:05:16.919
because they're pointing
in opposite directions.

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.029
But that's it, that's the easy one.

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.316
We've done that.

00:05:20.316 --> 00:05:22.649
Now we get to the next step.

00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:27.332
So now let's start step three.

00:05:27.332 --> 00:05:31.733
We're gonna write KVL equations
on each of these meshes.

00:05:31.733 --> 00:05:34.733
We'll start here, and we're
gonna go around this mesh

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:37.804
in this direction and write
Kirchhoff's voltage law.

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.727
So the first thing we
come to is a voltage rise.

00:05:40.727 --> 00:05:43.516
We go in the minus side and out the plus.

00:05:43.516 --> 00:05:46.266
That's a voltage rise of V volts.

00:05:49.028 --> 00:05:51.918
Next we get to R1, and R1 has
a current flowing through it,

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:56.241
a mesh current, and it will
have a voltage on it like that,

00:05:56.241 --> 00:05:59.384
because the current's
coming in from this side.

00:05:59.384 --> 00:06:02.067
And that will give us a
voltage, we go in the plus,

00:06:02.067 --> 00:06:03.227
out the minus, so that's
gonna give us a voltage drop

00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:04.060
of...

00:06:06.914 --> 00:06:08.747
a drop of R1 times i1.

00:06:14.914 --> 00:06:15.837
Right.

00:06:15.837 --> 00:06:17.937
Now we're over to here,
we go around the corner,

00:06:17.937 --> 00:06:19.779
and we go through R2.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:23.029
Now, R2 is odd because it has i1 and i2

00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:26.322
flowing into it, so what are we gonna do?

00:06:26.322 --> 00:06:30.781
Well we already figured
out this element current

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:33.870
is written down right over here.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.652
There it is right there.

00:06:35.652 --> 00:06:39.283
So if I label the current going down here,

00:06:39.283 --> 00:06:41.212
I have a plus and a minus,

00:06:41.212 --> 00:06:43.419
this is gonna be another voltage drop

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:45.987
going around the loop.

00:06:45.987 --> 00:06:48.654
So it's gonna have a value of R2

00:06:51.045 --> 00:06:52.878
times this value here.

00:06:54.595 --> 00:06:55.595
i1 minus i2.

00:07:01.104 --> 00:07:03.239
And now we've made it
all the way back to home,

00:07:03.239 --> 00:07:04.594
to where we started from,

00:07:04.594 --> 00:07:06.704
and so that's our KVL equation,

00:07:06.704 --> 00:07:08.954
which we set equal to zero.

00:07:10.544 --> 00:07:11.966
All right.

00:07:11.966 --> 00:07:14.585
Next step, let's do the other mesh.

00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:16.119
We're gonna go start
here, and we're gonna go

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:18.952
around this mesh, in the same way.

00:07:20.454 --> 00:07:23.713
First, the first term,
we're gonna see a voltage,

00:07:23.713 --> 00:07:26.130
oh look, it's a voltage rise,

00:07:27.247 --> 00:07:29.229
so I'll have a plus here.

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.589
A voltage rise, and it's the same term

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:33.364
that we had in the previous equation.

00:07:33.364 --> 00:07:34.197
It'll be plus R2

00:07:34.197 --> 00:07:35.697
times i1 minus i2.

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:46.155
That's the voltage rise
going from here to here.

00:07:46.155 --> 00:07:47.441
Now we go through R3.

00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:49.210
Now R3 just has one mesh current.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.463
It just has i2 flowing through it.

00:07:51.463 --> 00:07:53.714
So we could put that there.

00:07:53.714 --> 00:07:55.989
So that counts as a voltage drop,

00:07:55.989 --> 00:08:00.072
gets a minus sign, and
it's value is R3 times i2.

00:08:04.854 --> 00:08:06.187
That's that one.

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.423
Now we go over to R4.

00:08:09.423 --> 00:08:11.955
R4, this is the same
thing with two currents

00:08:11.955 --> 00:08:14.459
that we had over here with R2.

00:08:14.459 --> 00:08:16.445
So we do the same thing again.

00:08:16.445 --> 00:08:18.177
This is gonna be a... we'll define this

00:08:18.177 --> 00:08:19.677
as a voltage drop,

00:08:22.474 --> 00:08:25.225
there's the element current.

00:08:25.225 --> 00:08:28.347
And it's the same form as we had here

00:08:28.347 --> 00:08:30.766
when we calculated the current for R2.

00:08:30.766 --> 00:08:32.559
So this is gonna be a voltage drop,

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:36.059
give it a minus sign, and it's gonna be R4

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:41.116
times, this time it's i2 going down.

00:08:42.617 --> 00:08:43.617
i2 minus i3.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.467
And do we get home?

00:08:52.467 --> 00:08:54.398
Now we're all the way home,

00:08:54.398 --> 00:08:58.231
so our KVL equation is
all that equal to zero.

00:09:03.137 --> 00:09:05.095
So these are our two
simultaneous equations

00:09:05.095 --> 00:09:07.020
that represent our
current, and we wrote them

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.090
using the mesh current method, so we get

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.090
to check off step three.

00:09:11.977 --> 00:09:15.046
And in the next video, we'll
solve these two equations.
