00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.248
So now, let's talk a little bit about digital image formats.

00:00:03.248 --> 00:00:05.370
Basically again, raster image formats, again,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.690
the ones that as I said on a matrix, representation scan, row,

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.460
column lies down to rows, well each and every one of those elements is a pixel.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.540
And basically in each and every image is nothing else but

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.780
a se, series of colored dots with intensity values.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.480
In the last slide, I kind of started getting into this whole concept of

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.620
number of bits for each pixel represents the depth of color.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.650
Well, again, one bit per pixel would just be a two color image where black or

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.700
white would be represented.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.110
Four bits would be 16 colors, eight bits would be 256 different colors.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.200
And again if you keep on scaling this,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.646
remember, the equation that we looked at was where n.

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:49.020
n would be 8 for a regular 0 to 255 image.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.930
And just reviewing from last one again, images can be 16, 24 bit,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.258
and 32 bits-per-pixel.

00:00:57.258 --> 00:01:01.700
A 24-bit pixel is usually the one that has 8 bits per color.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.670
At the highest levels, the pixels themselves can carry up

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.020
to 16 million different types of colors depending on again how,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.020
what bits of pixels which we're ta, trying to use.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.840
Common raster image formats and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.440
this is some things which again you've seen from your cameras a lot,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.200
is basically allowing you to be able to look at images in various formats.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.890
GIF or GIF is one more prominent one.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.380
JPG and PPM, TIF, bpm, BMP, many variety of things exist.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.400
I'm not today discussing the camera RAW format.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.950
We will talk about that later because that's a special format that's coming in.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.850
That actually captures the information directly from the sensor and

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.425
stores that into a file for later pre-processing kinds of stuff or

00:01:45.425 --> 00:01:46.810
post-processing kinds of stuff.
