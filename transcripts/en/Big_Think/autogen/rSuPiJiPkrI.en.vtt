biological aspect of biological science
we need science for everything but what

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:08.129
we need science for everything but what
 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:11.420
we need science for everything but what
we want is our politicians to understand

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430
we want is our politicians to understand
 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.390
we want is our politicians to understand
that and appreciate it and celebrate it

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400
that and appreciate it and celebrate it
 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.420
that and appreciate it and celebrate it
and so move science forward there's a

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430
and so move science forward there's a
 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.280
and so move science forward there's a
great question but I will tell you in my

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
great question but I will tell you in my
 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.860
great question but I will tell you in my
opinion having a bunch of engineer and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870
opinion having a bunch of engineer and
 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.710
opinion having a bunch of engineer and
I'm an engineer don't get me wrong man

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720
I'm an engineer don't get me wrong man
 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.649
I'm an engineer don't get me wrong man
having a bunch of engineers run things

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659
having a bunch of engineers run things
 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:30.289
having a bunch of engineers run things
it's probably not what you want because

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299
it's probably not what you want because
 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.409
it's probably not what you want because
the systems are created engineering

systems are generally created from the
 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.849
systems are generally created from the
top down and there's just a good chance

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859
top down and there's just a good chance
 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.740
top down and there's just a good chance
you'll miss things you'll make mistakes

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750
you'll miss things you'll make mistakes
 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.929
you'll miss things you'll make mistakes
and they're harder to correct once

00:03:41.929 --> 00:03:41.939
and they're harder to correct once
 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:44.409

want to the extent possible decisions to
 

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.710
want to the extent possible decisions to
be made from the bottom up and the

be made from the bottom up and the
 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.509
be made from the bottom up and the
expression we often hear in the u.s. is

expression we often hear in the u.s. is
 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.780

organically from the bottom up good luck

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790
organically from the bottom up good luck
 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.959

to both of our governments we all have

00:03:59.959 --> 00:03:59.969
to both of our governments we all have
 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.789
to both of our governments we all have
to address climate change and I'm glad

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799
to address climate change and I'm glad
 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.550
to address climate change and I'm glad
that we were able to that our

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560
that we were able to that our
 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.990
that we were able to that our
governments were able to assign a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000
governments were able to assign a
 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.879
governments were able to assign a
climate change agreement last year and

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889
climate change agreement last year and
 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:10.550
climate change agreement last year and
I'm very much hoping we can stick to it

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560
I'm very much hoping we can stick to it
 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.309
I'm very much hoping we can stick to it
because we are going to need everybody

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319
because we are going to need everybody
 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.140
because we are going to need everybody
working together to address climate

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150
working together to address climate
 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.330
working together to address climate
change and we are especially going to

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340
change and we are especially going to
 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.360
change and we are especially going to
need scientists and engineers to create

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370
need scientists and engineers to create
 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.730
