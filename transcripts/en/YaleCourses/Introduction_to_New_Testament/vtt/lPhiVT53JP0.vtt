1
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.960
Turn to the beginning of the gospel of Luke.

2
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.020
We're going to go through a lot of Luke and acts today.

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.920
Uh,
today.
Uh,
I sort of lied on the syllabus.

4
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.160
You know how untrustworthy I am by now.

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.020
I sit on the syllabus that we're going to talk about Luke today and have

6
00:00:25.021 --> 00:00:27.600
electron acts on Wednesday.

7
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.850
That's not quite true because you can't really talk about Luke without also

8
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:33.900
talking about acts.

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.470
And you can't much talk about acts that talking about Luke because they're

10
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:38.580
written by the same person,

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.870
almost no scholar doubts that they're written by the same person.

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.830
There are some scholars who actually argue that you shouldn't read them as two

13
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:48.510
volumes of the same work.

14
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.680
Some people even say they think acts was written a good bit after the gospel of

15
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:57.210
Luke.
Uh,
but I'm going to treat them as basically two volumes of the same work.

16
00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.590
So part part of the lecture today,
we'll focus on acts,

17
00:01:01.591 --> 00:01:03.960
but a whole lot of electrical also focus on,
uh,

18
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:08.540
I mean part of Luke but also on ax.
And the next time also,
uh,

19
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.670
though talking about acts,
I'll go back and talk about Luke.

20
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.650
Did everyone get a handout of the outline of Luke and acts?
If he might,

21
00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:18.930
it doesn't get,
didn't get a handout.
Hold up your hands and uh,

22
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.990
we'll get the teaching fellows to hand them around.

23
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:24.330
So look at the beginning of Luke.

24
00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.860
Since many have undertaken to sit down an orderly account.

25
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.453
Now,

26
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.520
what will orderly account mean of the events that have been fulfilled among us

27
00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.280
just as they were handed onto us by those who are from the beginning,

28
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.370
I witnesses and servants of the word.

29
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.660
So when he tells you that he's gotten some things from handed down traditions,

30
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.190
accounts from eyewitnesses,

31
00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.700
what's the first thing that that tells you about this author?

32
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.910
He's not an eye witness.
Precisely.

33
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.160
I too decided after investigating everything carefully from the very first to

34
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:09.900
write an orderly account,

35
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.040
they are again for you most excellent Theopolis so that you may know the truth

36
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:19.130
concerning the things about which you have been instructed.

37
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.870
There are several things at this prologue to the gospel of Luke tells us one of

38
00:02:24.871 --> 00:02:25.111
the things,

39
00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:28.470
of course it is you just noticed it's not written by someone who was there.

40
00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.980
Some people will say that when we get to acts,

41
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.580
at least part of ax seems to been written by a person who was actually there

42
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:38.880
because about halfway through the book of acts he starts talking about we,

43
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.120
we did this and we did this rather than just Paul or other people in the third

44
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:44.970
person.
I don't believe that's the case.

45
00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:49.971
I believe he may have used some kind of a written document that was used the

46
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:52.410
term we are sometimes in ancient texts.

47
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.410
I think sometimes a person would just insert themselves into the narrative to

48
00:02:58.021 --> 00:03:02.500
give it a more directness,
but so I'm not going to teach that.

49
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.730
This author was an eye witness of any of the stuff that he writes about,

50
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.910
but certainly he's not an eye witness of the stuff that happens in the gospels

51
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.640
as he also says.
So that's one thing that it tells us.

52
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.450
This also tells us that this is a compilation of sources.

53
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.440
Now already when you've been working on the synoptic problem in the and how to

54
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.490
write an x Jesus paper,

55
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.790
you figured out that the gospel writers used other sources.

56
00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.160
Some of them were written sources,
some of them were oral sources.

57
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.410
This is guy actually admits it up front.

58
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.350
So it sounds like using both written sources in oral sources.

59
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.540
So what's one of the written sources?
We know he used mark exactly,

60
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.960
and we think that there's another written source that we call queue that he may

61
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:44.020
have used.
But what does he mean by orderly account?

62
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.730
Does it mean that mark kind of wrote things in one order and this guy knows a

63
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:51.400
better chronological order,
a historical order?

64
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.890
Is he talking about I'm writing Q and account.

65
00:03:53.891 --> 00:03:56.950
That's more like what actually happened when it happened.

66
00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.970
That's the way this is sometimes been interpreted by people as we'll see today.

67
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.230
That's not likely,
right,

68
00:04:02.231 --> 00:04:07.231
because we can even tell when this author is creatively shifting events around

69
00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:11.830
for his own purposes.
So he's claiming to write an orderly account,

70
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.640
but if he is claiming that he's giving us a more chronologically accurate

71
00:04:15.641 --> 00:04:18.520
account,
then he's wrong.
As we'll see.

72
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.540
Probably he doesn't even mean that probably this has no claim to historicity.

73
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.800
He probably just saying that the way I tell this is better than the way that

74
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:28.960
mark or Q or some other sources tell it.

75
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.650
He's thought about the order in which he puts it and he's thought about it,

76
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.240
how he wants to ride as Gospel.

77
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.870
This also tells you what literary form this is.

78
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.830
He knows he's writing something that's like other literature in the ancient

79
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:46.570
world.
So the,
the gospel of acts is not a biography,

80
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.220
but it could have been thought of as a life.

81
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.820
That's the Greek word for life is be US

82
00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.180
wherever we get biology

83
00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.310
B oss is uh,
could be called,

84
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.360
could be the name of a genre of literature that talked about some great man.

85
00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.540
We separated from biography because it doesn't have the same kind of concerns

86
00:05:07.541 --> 00:05:08.770
that a modern biography does.

87
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:12.250
So He seems like he knows that for the gospel of Luke.
Anyway,

88
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:17.110
he's riding a B oss of Jesus,
a life of Jesus and how do we know that?

89
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:21.310
Because he starts off later in the gospel with the same kind of stuff that you

90
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:24.010
would see if you rate it.
If you read a book about Augustus,

91
00:05:24.011 --> 00:05:28.390
the emperor or a Plato,
the great philosopher that is,

92
00:05:28.391 --> 00:05:33.391
he starts off it with narratives about a miraculous birth to telling stories

93
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:38.641
about a great man in his miraculous birth was a not uncommon way to start a life

94
00:05:38.651 --> 00:05:40.450
of someone.
Then an ax.

95
00:05:40.451 --> 00:05:43.090
It also looks like he knows he's writing something that would look something

96
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:47.050
like a history and we have histories also from the ancient world,

97
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.270
so this guy is is much more than mark.

98
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.530
This author is much more self conscious in setting himself forward and setting

99
00:05:53.531 --> 00:05:55.300
his workup as a literary work.

100
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.840
It has literary form who the author list though some people would think,

101
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:02.630
well maybe this is the guy's patron.
Because often in the ancient world,

102
00:06:02.631 --> 00:06:06.890
when you wrote a book,
when you started off with the dedication,
the dedication,

103
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.730
you didn't say dedicated to so and so what you said was,

104
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:15.230
dear Theopolis,
I'm writing this because you've asked me to set down my thoughts.

105
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.850
In other words,
you give a fiction.
It's a fiction that the patron,

106
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:23.930
maybe the person who supports you financially or socially or whatever,

107
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.830
that person has asked you to set down an account or something.

108
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.160
So you would start off.
Uh,
dear.
Mr. Smith,

109
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.580
you've asked me repeatedly when we had lunch at Morrie's,
uh,

110
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.510
to describe my recent trip to Africa.
So I'm writing this down at your request.

111
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.320
That's a dedication to your patron.
Who is the office though?

112
00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.620
Some people say maybe he's an actually historic person.

113
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.330
He calls him most excellent.

114
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.590
The Greek word would seem to imply that this guy is a fairly high class,

115
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.700
or at least our author wants us to believe that he's high class.
Uh,

116
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:56.960
it's also though possible,

117
00:06:56.961 --> 00:07:01.460
some people said maybe he's a fiction because Theopolis comes from two Greek

118
00:07:01.461 --> 00:07:05.480
words,
meaning say Oss,
which is God and fill oss.

119
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:10.280
Beloved or friend.
So some people have said he's making up a name that sort of a,

120
00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:14.990
a fictive name for any God loving are beloved by God reader.

121
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.780
We really don't know.
So scholars are completely at sea as far as,

122
00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:21.080
is this the outfit as a real person or is he not?

123
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.310
So those are several things about that that um,
we need to notice.

124
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:29.990
He sets himself up as writing a history by the ancient standards of history.

125
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.890
But is it history by our standards of history?

126
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:37.700
And the only way to figure that out is to analyze the text itself.

127
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:41.330
So that's what we're going to do on your outline.
You have on your handout,

128
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:44.960
you have an outline of Luke and an outline of acts.

129
00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.830
I think I'm didn't get one.
I gave mine away.
Can I have one?

130
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.083
<v 1>Thank you Michael.</v>

131
00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:00.280
<v 0>So notice how it's divided up.
First you get</v>

132
00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.070
the beginning of the Gospel,
which actually starts off,
um,

133
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:10.150
with the birth and childhood narratives and Jesus and John the Baptist in

134
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.080
chapter one.
And then in chapter three,
you get Jesus meeting,
uh,

135
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.030
with Jesus' relationship to John The baptist.

136
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.350
All of this starts off partly in Galilee,
but also partly in Judea.

137
00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:23.320
The birth of John Happens to Judea.
The birth of Jesus according to Luke,

138
00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.630
happens in Galilee.
Uh,

139
00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:30.660
Luke also though has Jesus family go from Judea to Galilee for the birth.

140
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.130
Now that's different from Matthew.

141
00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:36.610
Matthew just started off with the holy family living in Bethlehem.

142
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:42.060
Luke has the idea that this family is living in Galilee and because of a census,

143
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.170
the family is required to go to Bethlehem,
which is in Judea.

144
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.210
So the family is from Galilee,
but,

145
00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:52.690
but Luke really starts the action of his Gospel,

146
00:08:52.691 --> 00:08:56.490
both for John the Baptist birth and for the birth of Jesus and Judea.

147
00:08:56.940 --> 00:09:01.830
That's going to be important.
Then you have starting in chapter three,
verse 23,

148
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.190
the beginning of Jesus's Galilean Ministry,

149
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.060
and that goes all the way to nine 50.
So you had the beginning of the ministry,

150
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:10.830
there's an announcement in three 23.

151
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.430
This is Jesus began to in the 15th year of the reign of Tiberius.

152
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:18.840
Then you have a genealogy.
Then you have the temptation story in chapter four,

153
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:23.850
and then you have uh,
Jesus's inaugural address,
which we'll talk about,
uh,

154
00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:28.250
both this time and next time in chapter four verses 14 through 30 is Jesus'

155
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.160
first sermon.

156
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:33.510
It's very clearly Luke wants to set this up as Jesus' first sermon and we'll

157
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:38.070
talk about why later.
And then you have four 30,
one to eight 56,

158
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:43.020
the Galilean ministry proper.
That is,
this is Jesus going around Galilee,

159
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.750
healing people,
preaching,
teaching.

160
00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:50.640
Now look in chapter nine though,
then you'd get a transition period.

161
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.350
All of them,

162
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:59.350
most of chapter nine is a transition from the Galilean ministry to the other

163
00:10:00.411 --> 00:10:05.250
main part of Jesus's,
of Luke's a passage in the gospel,
which is Jesus,

164
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:09.790
his trip to Jerusalem,
chapter nine,
verse one.

165
00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:12.910
Then Jesus called the 12 together and gave them power and authority over demons

166
00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:13.750
and cure diseases.

167
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.590
Notice now he's not really doing the Galilean ministry anymore.

168
00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.480
He's setting up other things to happen on a look at.
Um,

169
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.300
now look all the way at the end of that chapter at nine 51.

170
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.143
<v 2>Yes,</v>

171
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.850
<v 0>this is a very big verse in Luke,
although,</v>

172
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.940
but you'd never know it unless you had a scholar kind of pointed out to you.

173
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:42.800
Nine 51 when the days drew near for him to be taken up,

174
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:47.510
he set his face to go to Jerusalem.
What does that taken up?

175
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:51.850
Probably does that refer to Jesus' ascension into heaven does a of his

176
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.280
crucifixion because you put somebody up on a cross,
whatever it is.

177
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:57.950
But notice we're not even toward the end of the Gospel here.

178
00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:59.080
We're only about halfway through.

179
00:10:59.110 --> 00:11:02.840
We're not even halfway through the Gospel where it's still very early in the

180
00:11:02.841 --> 00:11:06.060
gospel compared to what the rest of it is.
And yet,
uh,

181
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.920
what Luke is doing is turning your attention as a reader now to Jerusalem.

182
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.070
So when the days drew near for him to take an up,

183
00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:14.960
he set his face to go to Jerusalem.

184
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.720
He sent messengers ahead of him and they go through the villages.

185
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.450
So all the rest of the 10 next 10 chapters,

186
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:25.190
Jesus on the road on the road,
again,
it's on the road to Jerusalem.

187
00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:28.730
Now this big 10 chapter on the road trip,

188
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.660
Jesus is road trip to Jerusalem,
is not found in the other gospels.

189
00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.330
It's only in Luke.
So what is it?
What does it therefore?

190
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.060
And then in 1945 Jesus finally gets to Jerusalem and from 1945 until the end of

191
00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:48.860
Luke,
you have Jesus in Jerusalem.
Then acts starts out,

192
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.150
and as I've said before,

193
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:55.420
the next volume acts starts by retelling a bit of what happened at the end of

194
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:56.110
Luke.

195
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.650
So you know you're in the second volume of a two volume work here because he

196
00:11:59.651 --> 00:12:01.750
rehashes from the at the beginning of acts.

197
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:07.380
So first you get the time from one acts one one to nine 43 I've designated as

198
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:13.300
the time before the gentiles.
The church is all a Jewish community.

199
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.320
They all live mainly in Judea and Jerusalem.
They worshiped together.

200
00:12:17.321 --> 00:12:19.600
They even spend a lot of time in the temple and the Jewish temple.

201
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:24.310
So this is very much a Jewish organization.
The gentiles haven't been brought in.

202
00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:26.620
And then you have another transition period.

203
00:12:26.621 --> 00:12:30.400
Just like we had a transition period in chapter nine of Luke in chapter 10 of

204
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:34.630
acts,
you have a transition period from ten one to 1225.

205
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:38.290
So first you have the conversion of the first gentile convert.

206
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:40.420
He's a Roman Centurion Cornelius,

207
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.430
and you have Peter Defending his conversion of Cornelius because this is

208
00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:49.300
controversial to bring someone into the church without them being circumcised at

209
00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:54.280
this point,
according to Luke's narrative.
And then you have 11,
19 through 30.

210
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.700
Look,
look at that.
Uh,
acts 11,
19 through 30.

211
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.110
Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that took place over

212
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:08.560
Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia,
Cyprus and Antioch.

213
00:13:08.561 --> 00:13:10.450
And they spoke the word to know him,
but Jews.

214
00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:14.680
But among them were some men from Cypress and cy Reni who on coming to Antioch

215
00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:18.070
spoke to the Hellenistic also proclaiming the Lord Jesus.

216
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.570
Now you may have a footnote after the word Hellenistic.

217
00:13:23.050 --> 00:13:25.650
Does anybody have a footnote after the word hell on us there?
And your doc?
When,

218
00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.920
what?
What is it your footnote?
Say Greeks.

219
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:34.090
So some texts have Helen this which would be sort of Greek speaking,

220
00:13:34.091 --> 00:13:38.080
Jews and other manuscripts have just the word Greeks.
And in fact,

221
00:13:38.081 --> 00:13:42.430
you can even take this term Hellenistic,
uh,
to be just Greeks themselves.

222
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.270
So at least there's some idea that these people were speaking not just a Greek

223
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:50.800
speaking Jews,
but to also to Greeks that introduces then this,
uh,

224
00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:52.780
period of the gentiles.

225
00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:57.490
So you have the introduction to a predominantly gentile church in Antioch,

226
00:13:57.491 --> 00:13:59.860
and that's what you get from 1119 through 30.

227
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:05.580
And then you get some persecution in Jerusalem at Vir and chapter 12 and then

228
00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:07.960
you get a shift of attention from Jerusalem to Judea,

229
00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:11.050
to the gentiles in 1225.

230
00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.280
But the word of God continued to advance and gain inherence.

231
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:16.960
Then after completing their mission,

232
00:14:16.961 --> 00:14:19.990
Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem and brought with them John,

233
00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:21.040
whose other name was mark.

234
00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:24.610
And I actually think that supposed to be returned from Jerusalem to Antioch.

235
00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:29.590
There's some against manuscript problems because in 13 one you have now in the

236
00:14:29.591 --> 00:14:30.490
church at Antioch,

237
00:14:30.491 --> 00:14:34.780
they were prophets and teachers from chapter 13 to the rest of acts.

238
00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.910
The attention is not in Jerusalem.
They go back to Jerusalem.

239
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.380
Paul goes back to Jerusalem a few times and you and Paul was eventually arrested

240
00:14:41.381 --> 00:14:44.440
in Jerusalem and there is a trial and there's all kinds of interesting,
exciting,

241
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.950
uh,
riots and things that happened in Jerusalem.
But the rest of acts,

242
00:14:47.951 --> 00:14:51.580
the attention is away from Jerusalem and to the rest of the world.
The rest of,

243
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:56.300
uh,
all the way there.
And then,
so that then you had from 13 one,

244
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:58.220
you had the period called after the gentiles.

245
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:00.260
This is after gentiles had been brought into the church.

246
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.530
And then the focus is going to be on the gentile church for the rest of acts.

247
00:15:03.531 --> 00:15:06.470
So you get,
for example,
the first missionary journey of Paul.

248
00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.500
Then you have the Jerusalem conference and Chapter 15,

249
00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:10.640
which we've talked about already.

250
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.300
Then you have the second Miss January journey of Paul and then the third

251
00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:17.690
missionary journey of Paul.
And then you have Paul,
uh,

252
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:20.360
in Jerusalem and then arrested and taken to Rome.

253
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.860
And then you have Paul in Rome and ending the whole book chapter 28,

254
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.370
17 through 31.
Notice what's going on here.

255
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.860
You get Luke constructs his two volume work like this.

256
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.990
It starts off,
uh,
in Judea.

257
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:45.390
It keeps coming towards Jerusalem.
Jerusalem,
Jews,

258
00:15:45.391 --> 00:15:48.830
many focuses you on Jerusalem through the,
through all the gospel of Luke.

259
00:15:49.190 --> 00:15:52.970
And then the last week of Jesus' life in Jerusalem where he's crucified,

260
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:54.020
he's resurrected.

261
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:58.130
Where did Jesus appear to his disciples after his resurrection?

262
00:15:58.131 --> 00:16:02.530
According to Matthew Galilee.

263
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:07.000
Exactly.
Did Jesus appear to any of those disciples in Jerusalem?

264
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:08.020
According to Matthew?

265
00:16:09.730 --> 00:16:10.563
<v 1>No.</v>

266
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:12.000
<v 0>All the appearances of Jesus,</v>

267
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:15.330
the resurrected Jesus in Matthew Tech Plays in Galilee,
not Jerusalem.

268
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:20.040
On just the opposite of that,
at the end of act,

269
00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:21.930
at the end of Luke in the beginning of acts,

270
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:26.040
Jesus tells his disciples after he ribs and several of them see him and he says,

271
00:16:26.250 --> 00:16:27.990
stay in Jerusalem.

272
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.230
Don't go out of Jerusalem in Judea until you get the Meth,

273
00:16:32.231 --> 00:16:36.060
until the Holy Spirit comes.
So they they,
and it says they stayed in Jerusalem,

274
00:16:36.090 --> 00:16:41.070
the whole,
he,
Jesus appeared to his disciples for a stated period of time,

275
00:16:41.071 --> 00:16:45.930
according to acts,
I think it's 40 days.
Is that right?
Something like that.

276
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:50.280
And after that period of time,
Jesus no longer appeared to his disciples.

277
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:52.290
According to acts,
he ascended to heaven.

278
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:56.040
But that whole time they stayed in Judea.
So all the appearances of Ge,

279
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.790
the resurrected Jesus according to Luke take place in Jerusalem.

280
00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.630
So That's interesting.
See that he starts off in Galilee,

281
00:17:02.631 --> 00:17:07.320
he ends up in Jerusalem and then act starts off again in Jerusalem and then it

282
00:17:07.321 --> 00:17:10.080
goes out and find to part of the world.

283
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:14.370
It expands its vision to Antioch,
to Asia,

284
00:17:14.371 --> 00:17:16.740
minor to Greece,
to Europe.

285
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.760
And finally Paul ends up in Rome at the end.
So this is,

286
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:23.880
there's a very schematic geographical,

287
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.990
a system to the way Luke has organized this two volume work.

288
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:32.910
And that's even reflected in the,
uh,
layout of the outline of the book,

289
00:17:32.911 --> 00:17:34.980
which is why I wanted to give you that very simple outline.

290
00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.860
Now let's go back and see how this is reflected in other parts.

291
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:42.890
Look at Luke's Jesus inaugural speech as put forward by Luke in chapter four of

292
00:17:45.751 --> 00:17:46.584
Luke.

293
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:50.670
Now we're going to spend a lot of time talking about this because you're going

294
00:17:50.671 --> 00:17:53.910
to imitate me.
When you write your exit Jesus papers.

295
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.410
You're going to pay really good attention to all the details of the pericope p

296
00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:02.430
you know you've learned now that pericope p is just a fancy Latin word,

297
00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:05.790
a Greek word for section.
It's the Greek form of section.

298
00:18:05.791 --> 00:18:09.240
Both of them made something cut out and sew.
Pericope p is what we,

299
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.700
biblical scholars,
often tall call a little piece of text that you do in X.
Jesus.

300
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:18.710
All you want to concentrate on the details of your pericope p to try to find out

301
00:18:18.991 --> 00:18:20.050
what the messages.
So whatever.

302
00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:23.910
What we're gonna do with this passage for 16 through 30 now,

303
00:18:23.911 --> 00:18:25.980
it would help if you also compared this,

304
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:30.060
we're not gonna do that so much right now with mark six one through six because

305
00:18:30.061 --> 00:18:32.370
Luke is getting the scene from mark.

306
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:36.630
But what's going to be interesting to us is what does Luke change about the

307
00:18:36.631 --> 00:18:40.020
scene he gets from mark?
What does he add to the scene he gets from mark.

308
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:45.290
You could also compare it with Matthew 1353 through 58 cause that's where

309
00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:48.750
Matthew has it.
If you were to compare mark and Matthew,

310
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:53.130
what you would see is Matthew pretty much just follows mark here.

311
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
He takes this story about where he finds it in the story of Mark and he puts it

312
00:18:59.401 --> 00:19:02.250
in his story at chronologically about the same place.

313
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:05.460
And he doesn't have Jesus give a long speech.

314
00:19:05.730 --> 00:19:08.970
He just has him appear there and and that sort of thing.

315
00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.380
Now notice what Luke does it.

316
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.530
Luke takes this text and he does a lot more with it.

317
00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:18.090
So we're going to read it and talk about that.
When he came to Nazareth,

318
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:20.160
where he had been brought up,

319
00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:24.060
he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath Day as was his custom.

320
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:27.570
And if you're a good exit,
you had noticed as was his custom,

321
00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:29.690
might need to look up in a,

322
00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.120
<v 1>uh,
uh,</v>

323
00:19:32.130 --> 00:19:35.730
<v 0>concordance to see if Luke likes that phrase</v>

324
00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:37.690
<v 1>cause he does.</v>

325
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:41.860
Uh,

326
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.700
<v 0>he stood up and read and the scroll of the Prophet Isaiah was given to him.</v>

327
00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.910
He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it is written.

328
00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:53.800
The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good news

329
00:19:53.801 --> 00:19:54.634
to the poor.

330
00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:58.480
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the

331
00:19:58.481 --> 00:20:02.890
blind to let the oppressed go free to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor

332
00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:08.260
and he rolled up the scroll,
gave it back to the attendant and sat down.

333
00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.860
The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.

334
00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.040
Then he began to say that to them today,

335
00:20:15.041 --> 00:20:17.170
this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.

336
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:21.130
All spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his

337
00:20:21.131 --> 00:20:24.430
mouth.
They said,
is not this Joseph's son.
He said to them,

338
00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.010
doubtless you a quote to me,
this proverb,
Dr,

339
00:20:27.011 --> 00:20:29.650
cure yourself and you will say,

340
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.300
do here also in your hometown the things we have heard you did in Capernaum

341
00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:39.090
<v 1>in Capernaum.
That's interesting</v>

342
00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.650
<v 0>because he hasn't really got to compare them yet</v>

343
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:44.483
<v 1>in Luke's Gospel</v>

344
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:50.080
<v 0>and he truly,
I tell you,
no prophet is accepted in the Prophet's hometown,</v>

345
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.100
but the truth is there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah.

346
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:56.890
When the heaven was shut up for three years and six months,

347
00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.170
there was a severe famine over all the land,

348
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.760
yet a lodge was sent to none of them except to a widow at Xero fath inside and

349
00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:04.970
there was a,

350
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:08.260
there were also many lepers in Israel in the time of the Prophet Elisha,

351
00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:12.790
and none of them was cleansed except name in the Syrian when they heard this.

352
00:21:12.791 --> 00:21:16.960
Now notice they started out the scene.
They're all happy.
He's the hometown boy.

353
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.350
He's come home.
They are amazed at his teaching.

354
00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.360
The mood changes.

355
00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:26.230
Why does the mood change right there?

356
00:21:27.340 --> 00:21:32.230
When they heard this all in the synagogue were filled with rage.
They got up,

357
00:21:32.231 --> 00:21:35.530
drove him out of town and led him to the brow of the hill on which their town

358
00:21:35.531 --> 00:21:37.990
was built so that they might hurl him off the cliff,

359
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:40.510
but he passed through the midst of them.
And went on his way.

360
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.820
He went down to Capernaum,

361
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.310
a city of Galilee and was teaching them on the Sabbath.

362
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:50.260
Notice this is when he moves to Capernaum from Nazareth.
In Luke's Gospel,

363
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.060
in all the synoptic gospels,

364
00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:55.900
Jesus Makes Capernaum his home base in Galilee,

365
00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:59.920
not his hometown of Nazareth,
but according to mark and Matthew,

366
00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.100
it's later in the gospels that Jesus has rejected in Nazareth and makes his then

367
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:09.430
moves and makes his home in Capernaum.
Notice that Luke knows this.

368
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.170
Luke is giving us a clue that he knows he's taking this path,

369
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:19.000
this passage out of its context from where he found it,
because the people say,

370
00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.310
do for us what you did in Capernaum,

371
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:26.740
implying that they think of Capernaum is his home base.
Well,

372
00:22:26.741 --> 00:22:29.800
that's because by that time and mark and Matthew was his home base.

373
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.660
By the time he gives this speech in Nazareth,

374
00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:37.380
Luke takes this passage that he finds later in mark and he moves it,

375
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.610
plops it down at the beginning of Jesus' Galilean Ministry.

376
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.940
He wants this speech to be Jesus.

377
00:22:45.941 --> 00:22:50.380
His first speech,
this sermon,
Jesus first sermon.

378
00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:53.980
So maybe that means that if we analyze the content of the sermon,

379
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.400
we can try to figure out why did Luke change the setting of the story to be at

380
00:23:00.101 --> 00:23:03.700
the beginning of the ministry and then also why did he make it so much bigger?

381
00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:08.560
It occupies only a few little versus in mark and Luke expands it into this whole

382
00:23:08.561 --> 00:23:12.190
speech and makes this big conflict.
So let's look at several different things.

383
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:15.400
First I said,
he says as was his custom,

384
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:17.980
as we'll talk about next week,

385
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:23.070
one of the main themes of the gospel of Luke and acts is that good Jewish boys

386
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:28.120
do good Jewish things.
They'd go to synagogue,
they know their scripture,

387
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:31.570
they're circumcised,
they keep kosher,
they worship in the temple.

388
00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:36.490
So Jesus also is depicted by Luke as a good Jewish boy.

389
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:37.870
We'll see next time.

390
00:23:37.871 --> 00:23:41.590
And I'm going to talk about some of these themes a bit more fully in both Luke

391
00:23:41.591 --> 00:23:43.330
and acts.
And I'll talk about for example,

392
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.080
why is it only in Luke that he tells us that Jesus,
his parents,

393
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.890
after he was born,
circumcised him on the eighth day like they were supposed to,

394
00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:55.490
after a month,
they take them to the temple for the presentation,

395
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.830
all of this and Lucas and tells it this is to fulfill the t,

396
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:01.760
the scripture and the fulfill the law.
And he's referring back to Leviticus.

397
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:04.670
So Jesus,
his mother and father are good Jewish parents.

398
00:24:04.671 --> 00:24:07.940
They do exactly what the law tells him to do and Jesus is a good Jewish boy.

399
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:11.630
So another clue here as was his custom,
this is like Jesus goes to this,

400
00:24:11.631 --> 00:24:16.190
goes to temple every Saturday.
Uh,
look also the,

401
00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.770
the spirit of the Lord.
He says in Verse 18,
he cites a Texas.

402
00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:24.380
The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to bring good news

403
00:24:24.381 --> 00:24:26.420
to the poor.
Again,
if you took,

404
00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.130
if you took a concur concordance and searched all the times and Luke and acts,

405
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:35.060
when the spirit either called the Holy Spirit or sometimes just the spirit of

406
00:24:35.061 --> 00:24:39.380
the spirit of God occurs,
you'll find this as one of Luke's favorite themes.

407
00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.490
The Holy Spirit in fact,
is the main actor in the book of acts.

408
00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.470
Jesus is the main actor in the gospel of Luke.
Jesus leaves the scene.

409
00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.170
He kind of talks from all stage every once in a while who've talked.

410
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.200
Talk to Saul,
Saul,
Saul,
why do you persecute me?

411
00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.270
But Jesus is kind of saying that from off stage,

412
00:24:57.230 --> 00:25:00.110
the real actor in the book of Luke is the Holy Spirit.

413
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:04.880
So again,
he's getting right at the beginning of this lecture,
this sermon,

414
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.190
Jesus talks about the spirit.
Notice also,
the poor,
uh,

415
00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.280
sent me to bring good news to the poor.

416
00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.320
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives,

417
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:15.830
recovery of sight to the blind to let the oppressed go free.

418
00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:18.021
Any of you know,

419
00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:23.021
the magnific caught the song that's sung by Mary when she's told by the angel

420
00:25:23.181 --> 00:25:26.980
that she's pregnant.
If you,
uh,
it,
it's,
uh,

421
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.900
very important liturgical piece.
I'll talk about it again next time,

422
00:25:29.901 --> 00:25:33.590
a little bit more depth.
But if you go to a Catholic church or a,

423
00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.700
an Episcopalian church,
chances are you'll say,
the magnific cut.

424
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.770
My soul blesses the Lord.
It's called the magnificant because,
uh,

425
00:25:41.810 --> 00:25:44.390
my soul magnifies the Lord in the Latin.

426
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:49.750
The first word of the song that Mary says is Magnifi caught that is magnifies my

427
00:25:51.351 --> 00:25:52.460
soul,
magnifies the Lord.

428
00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.960
And that song that Mary says has all this stuff about God will,

429
00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:01.640
that her son will lift up the poor and the oppressed God will help the poor.

430
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:06.080
He will send the rich away empty over and over again in that song by Mary.

431
00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:10.760
This idea that God's going to perform this great reversal of rich and poor,

432
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.000
the poor will be helped and made rich.
The rich will be made poor.

433
00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:16.850
The high will be sent down low,
the low will be raised up high.

434
00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:21.200
So we've already seen this theme already in the gospel of Luke and now it's

435
00:26:21.201 --> 00:26:25.940
right here in Jesus' first sermon.
So that's another theme.
Um,

436
00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:33.560
look at verse 19 to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor.

437
00:26:34.010 --> 00:26:37.880
If you're using older translation of the King James version.
Anybody else have,

438
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.700
what do you have for 19 to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor?

439
00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:44.800
Anybody have a different translation?
Yeah.
Nope.
Yes sir.

440
00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:51.560
The year acceptable to the Lord.
So a lot of translations,
uh,

441
00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:55.390
the older transaction will say to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.

442
00:26:56.050 --> 00:27:00.610
That's as we'll see.
That's another theme of Luke.
He's quoting it from scripture,

443
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.760
but then he incorporates it.
So for example,
uh,

444
00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:08.080
there'll be a time later where I will see that at one point Jesus condemns

445
00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:13.060
Jerusalem because they did not recognize the time of their visitation.

446
00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:18.930
So Jesus is being there on earth represents this special time is a focus of

447
00:27:20.441 --> 00:27:24.100
history on one point of time.
So again,

448
00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:29.430
Jesus in his first sermon quotes this acceptable year of the Lord as being his

449
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.930
year.
It's the Jesus Year in Judea.

450
00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:33.610
<v 2>Okay.</v>

451
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:38.020
<v 0>And then another theme that you see here is what happens to Jesus first.</v>

452
00:27:38.021 --> 00:27:42.250
Jesus as he sets himself up as a profit,
right?
By quoting,
by,
by siding.

453
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:46.870
Stories about Elijah who helped the woman,
the widow's son,
Alicia.

454
00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.350
So Elijah and Elisha are important profits for Luke,

455
00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:54.820
and Jesus portrays himself as being like that.
So that's why he says,

456
00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:55.960
um,

457
00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:01.240
no prophet is accepted in the Prophet's hometown.

458
00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.570
But the truth is there were many widows in Israel in the time of Elijah.

459
00:28:04.571 --> 00:28:06.250
When the heavens was shut up for three years and six months,

460
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:09.130
there was severe famine,
yet Elijah was not sent to them.

461
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:13.460
Alijah wasn't sent to the Jews,
to any Jewish widows,
didn't,

462
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:18.040
weren't there Jewish widows who needed a little help to God?
Well,
yeah,

463
00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:23.590
but he wasn't sent to the Jewish widows.
He was sent to a non Jewish widow,

464
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.290
a woman who lived in the design.

465
00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.570
There were many lepers in Israel and the time of the Prophet Elisha,

466
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.150
Elisha was the,
uh,
junior profit to Elijah.
Elijah anointed,

467
00:28:34.151 --> 00:28:37.240
Alicia [inaudible],
knowing him,
he gave me his mantle.
And so Elisha,

468
00:28:37.241 --> 00:28:39.790
after Elijah went up in the,
in the fiery chariot,

469
00:28:39.791 --> 00:28:42.580
you know the flying fiery chariot.
You've heard the story swing low,

470
00:28:42.581 --> 00:28:44.200
sweet chariot coming for to take me home.

471
00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:46.870
Elijah doesn't die at the end of his life,

472
00:28:46.871 --> 00:28:50.530
he's swooped up in a fiery chariot into heaven and in right before that he gives

473
00:28:50.531 --> 00:28:52.990
his mantle to his,
his disciple Elisha,

474
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:57.820
and then is the profit there.
Elijah also weren't there,

475
00:28:57.821 --> 00:29:00.180
many Jewish lepers.
Elisha,

476
00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:04.750
couldn't you take a nice Jewish Leper to heal Alicia?
No,
Jesus says

477
00:29:06.490 --> 00:29:09.220
he wasn't sitting to them.
He was into Naaman the Syrian.

478
00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:12.550
So I said,
when they heard this,

479
00:29:12.551 --> 00:29:16.390
all this all in the synagogue were filled with rage.
And I said,
why this why?

480
00:29:16.391 --> 00:29:19.120
What were they so upset with?
Now you tell me.

481
00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:23.140
Why does he say they were filled with rage,
right?
Then

482
00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.190
what?
Just say it.
Shout it out.
You know,

483
00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:35.110
are there no Jewish lepers?
Elijah,

484
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.090
are there no Jewish widows.
Elijah,

485
00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:45.310
why are they mad?
Cause you saying he's not there.

486
00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:46.421
Yeah.

487
00:29:46.421 --> 00:29:51.421
Jesus is saying I'm not here for you or at least he's saying Elijah and Elisha

488
00:29:52.090 --> 00:29:55.450
were sent to gentiles,
not to Jews.

489
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:57.730
Notice what Luke has done here.

490
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.780
He's set up Jesus as a prophet like Elijah and Elisha.

491
00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.730
And he said,

492
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:08.230
had Jesus himself predict that the message will go out to the gentiles.

493
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:10.840
It hasn't gone out yet to the gentiles and the gospel of Luke.

494
00:30:10.841 --> 00:30:14.200
Jesus pretty much sticks with the Jews.
And in fact,

495
00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:19.410
Peter has to have a revelation and acts before he will go preach to a gentile as

496
00:30:20.831 --> 00:30:25.540
we'll see next time.
So the Jews,
the gentiles are not receiving the gospel yet,

497
00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.970
but Jesus is predicting that they will.

498
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.390
So that's another theme here that did Lucas playing on.

499
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:34.570
But notice the other thing,
what happens when Jesus does this,

500
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:36.700
he's rejected by his own people.

501
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:42.690
So another theme of Luke and acts is true profits get rejected by their own

502
00:30:44.171 --> 00:30:45.004
people.

503
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:51.640
A prophet in his own country is not accepted.
So there is,

504
00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:54.520
Jesus has a great prophet like Elijah and Elisha.

505
00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:57.820
He's not accepted in his own country.
He's rejected.

506
00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:02.620
And the gentile mission happens after the rejection by the Jews.

507
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:05.230
That's going to be a theme that we'll see over and over and acts not so much in

508
00:31:05.231 --> 00:31:06.064
the gospel of Luke,

509
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:11.070
but Jean Luke is foreshadowing the book of acts in this chapter with Jesus'

510
00:31:11.591 --> 00:31:14.770
sermon.
Because Jesus himself doesn't go preach to gentiles.

511
00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:16.900
You had to wait until acts to get that.

512
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:22.350
But Lucas foreshadowing the rejection of the gospel by Jews and the taking of

513
00:31:22.571 --> 00:31:23.890
the Gospel to the gentiles,

514
00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:27.610
that you'll then see an ax and any foreshadows it all right here in this first

515
00:31:27.611 --> 00:31:31.360
sermon by Jesus.
And then the last theme that you have here is them trying to,

516
00:31:31.361 --> 00:31:33.070
trying to kill Jesus.
40 says,

517
00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:37.040
which that's going to foreshadow the theme all the way through that,
uh,

518
00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:42.250
the Gospel,
wherever the gospel goes,
you get persecution.
When we get to acts,

519
00:31:42.251 --> 00:31:45.130
you'll see this in a way that,
that just drummed it into your head.

520
00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:49.540
Paul goes to of town,
he goes first to the synagogue in the town.

521
00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:53.140
He preaches to the Jews in the synagogue.
They get all mad.
Uh,

522
00:31:53.141 --> 00:31:55.300
some of them usually except a few of them will accept.

523
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:59.200
We'll see that as a theme in acts also.
But the majority of them don't.

524
00:31:59.230 --> 00:32:02.410
They reject Paul.
They throw them out of the Paul,
they tried to stone him,

525
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.440
or they try to persecute him and they tried to throw him out of town.

526
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:10.690
And then Paul turns and preaches the same message to the gentiles and they

527
00:32:10.691 --> 00:32:14.620
accept and they form a church.
He goes to the next town,

528
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:18.460
he does this in festival Nika,
he does it in Philippi.
He doesn't in Corinth,

529
00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:19.840
he tries it in Athens,

530
00:32:19.841 --> 00:32:22.720
but he's not successful because nobody pays any attention to him.
In Athens.

531
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.770
It's a university town.
After all,
they know better,
right?

532
00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.560
So this theme of the profits being rejected,

533
00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:33.730
and it's the rejection of the message by the Jews that causes the message then

534
00:32:33.731 --> 00:32:36.730
to be taken to the gentiles.
That will play out over and over again in a,

535
00:32:36.731 --> 00:32:38.140
here you again,
you get it here.

536
00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.860
So Luke has transposed that story about Jesus preaching in Nazareth from where

537
00:32:47.451 --> 00:32:50.630
he finds it in mark,
which is later in Jesus's ministry.

538
00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.430
And he puts it at the beginning of Jesus' ministry and he packs it up with all

539
00:32:55.431 --> 00:32:58.370
this other stuff.
And that should be a very good clue to you.

540
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:02.090
If you're comparing Luke with mark,
you just know this must be important.

541
00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:05.240
This must be a way where we really see what this author is about.

542
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:10.570
And notice is Luke concerned about when the event in Nazareth actually

543
00:33:13.371 --> 00:33:17.750
historically happened?
No,
he's even,

544
00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:22.810
we can tell he's even getting it out of his source from one spot and consciously

545
00:33:23.151 --> 00:33:23.984
transplant.

546
00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:27.800
Bring it to another spot which tells us one thing is that he does it to him.

547
00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:32.180
It's not that important chronologically when this story actually happened.

548
00:33:32.660 --> 00:33:37.100
What's important to him is using this story to emphasize the theological message

549
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.660
that he wants to emphasize.
Now let's look at another place where Luke does this.

550
00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:45.320
You have to turn to acts for this though.
Look at acts chapter 11

551
00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.290
any questions about that before I go on?

552
00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.850
No questions.
All I love.
Good dos.

553
00:33:57.851 --> 00:34:01.990
I'll students always happy with everything I say.

554
00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.620
Okay.
Look at chapter 11 verse 19

555
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:17.300
I already read this earlier and then I read it,
uh,
actually in another lecture.

556
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:19.250
But it's very important to see what Luke is doing now.

557
00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:22.850
Those who are scattered because of the persecution that took place over.

558
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:25.970
Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia,
Cyprus and Antioch,

559
00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.370
and they spoke the word to no one except Jews,

560
00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:32.210
but among them were some men of Cyrus and Sarine who aren't coming to Antioch.

561
00:34:32.211 --> 00:34:35.060
Spoke to the healthiness also proclaiming the Lord Jesus,

562
00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.980
that the hand of the Lord was with them,

563
00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:39.560
and a great number became believers and turn to the Lord.

564
00:34:39.890 --> 00:34:43.490
News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem and they sent Barnabas

565
00:34:43.491 --> 00:34:45.920
to Antioch.
When he came and saw the grace of God,

566
00:34:45.921 --> 00:34:49.520
he rejoiced any exhorted them all to remain faithful in the Lord with steadfast

567
00:34:49.521 --> 00:34:50.840
devotion,
for he was a good man,

568
00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.690
full of the Holy Spirit and of faith with a great many blah,
blah,
blah.

569
00:34:53.930 --> 00:34:57.230
Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
and when he found him,

570
00:34:57.231 --> 00:35:00.470
he brought him to Antioch.
So it was that for an entire year.

571
00:35:00.471 --> 00:35:02.690
They met with the church and taught a great many people,

572
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.830
and it was an Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.

573
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:12.350
Isn't that a nice little encapsulation?
He's in that little paragraph.
Luke,

574
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.450
the author,
whoever.

575
00:35:13.490 --> 00:35:16.250
We still tend to call these gospel writers by these names even though we don't

576
00:35:16.251 --> 00:35:18.530
believe historically this was the historical Luke,

577
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:21.590
but I'll still keep calling him Luke just for cause easier than saying the

578
00:35:21.591 --> 00:35:26.591
author each time Luke takes a little paragraph in which he shifts your focus

579
00:35:26.931 --> 00:35:29.060
here from the whole Jerusalem,
Judea,

580
00:35:29.061 --> 00:35:34.061
Jewish oriented form of the movement and now he goes to Antioch and now you get

581
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:36.710
this Greek kind of a movement.

582
00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:39.270
This predominantly in a Greek speaking city Antioch.

583
00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.120
This is one of the things that I think that that word that you're,

584
00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:46.120
that my translation translates Hellenistic that they spoke to Hellenism and

585
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:48.900
verse 20 I think that's not correct.

586
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:53.010
I think that either in the original Greek and some manuscripts have this or you

587
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:56.700
just would translate this word.
It must be that they saying they spoke to Greeks.

588
00:35:56.940 --> 00:35:58.380
That is ethnic Greeks.

589
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:04.220
Why do I think this is a reference to ethnic Greeks and not just Greek speaking

590
00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:07.450
Jews.
And you had to have an idea

591
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:13.120
because this isn't the first time that people,

592
00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.840
that followers of Jesus have spoken to Greek speaking Jews.

593
00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:18.610
We already have in Jerusalem.

594
00:36:19.190 --> 00:36:22.870
He has already told us in the earlier part of acts that in Jerusalem there were

595
00:36:22.871 --> 00:36:26.110
already Greek speaking Jews,
part of the community.

596
00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:30.280
And in fact it says that uh,
Stephen himself would have,
uh,

597
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:31.930
talked with these Greek speaking Jews.

598
00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.260
So all we already have before we get to chapter 11,

599
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:40.470
the idea that the gospel of Jesus has been taken both to Aramaic speaking Jews

600
00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.210
and Greek speaking Jews because it's already there in Jerusalem.
So He's,

601
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:48.820
he's talking about something new happening here.

602
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:53.650
This is people not just speaking to Aramaic speaking Jews or to Greek speaking

603
00:36:53.651 --> 00:36:56.920
Jews.
They're actually speaking to non Jews.

604
00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.590
And this is the first time you get this indication in the book of acts that the

605
00:37:02.591 --> 00:37:05.500
movement has now spread out from Jerusalem.

606
00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:10.180
And it's also being spread to Greeks,
ethnic Greeks.

607
00:37:10.181 --> 00:37:14.020
And I think by Greeks he just means gentiles.
Not just Greeks ethnically,

608
00:37:14.021 --> 00:37:16.810
but anybody who wasn't a Jew is what he mainly means here.

609
00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:22.450
But what's interesting is that this is kind of out of place.

610
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:26.380
So one of the things I'm arguing is that unlike this translation I just read,

611
00:37:26.381 --> 00:37:29.290
which might lead you to believe that the author is telling us this is the first

612
00:37:29.291 --> 00:37:31.000
time they spoke to Greek speaking Jews.

613
00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:34.990
I think that the original text must've meant that this is the first time that

614
00:37:34.991 --> 00:37:37.090
these people are speaking to actual non Jews.

615
00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:41.950
Now it's not the first time though that people can access spoken to Non Jews,

616
00:37:41.951 --> 00:37:42.784
right?

617
00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.830
When's the first time that according to acts that people actually speak to non

618
00:37:47.831 --> 00:37:51.820
Jews and preach the Gospel to non Jews and non Jews become members of the
church?

619
00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:57.520
When have you read acts yet?
Cornelius?

620
00:37:58.390 --> 00:38:00.130
This interior,
the Roman Centurion.

621
00:38:00.310 --> 00:38:04.600
Remember I said Peter has to have a whole series of revelations on top of the

622
00:38:04.601 --> 00:38:09.601
roof before he's convinced to finally go preach to a gentile and convert them.

623
00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.900
And that plagues tastes in acts 10 but now keep your finger on acts 1119 and

624
00:38:15.941 --> 00:38:18.520
flip over to acts eight one through four.

625
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:19.973
<v 2>Okay.</v>

626
00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:23.350
<v 0>I think I may have mentioned this already,
but let's look at a bit closer now.</v>

627
00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:24.993
<v 2>Okay.</v>

628
00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.010
<v 0>Acts Eight one through four.</v>

629
00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:32.400
This takes place right after the stoning of Stephen from Stephen.

630
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:38.170
Is that a Hebrew or Aramaic name?

631
00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:43.630
No.
Does anybody know where are the or the name?
Stephen comes from.

632
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.890
Raise your hand.
Yes sir.
Crown.
Are you a Steven?

633
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.550
Nope.
You just know.
Yes,
it comes from the word Stefan Oss in Greek,

634
00:38:51.551 --> 00:38:52.384
which means crown.

635
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:57.760
So notice already there are Greek speaking Jews who have Greek names in the

636
00:38:57.761 --> 00:39:00.040
church and Stevens.
One of them.
In fact,

637
00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:03.580
the seven deacons were appointed that we saw we could read about just right

638
00:39:03.581 --> 00:39:04.510
before this and acts.

639
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:09.340
Those are appointed precisely in order according to acts to be able to minister

640
00:39:09.341 --> 00:39:10.750
to the Greek speakers.

641
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:14.950
Cause some Greek speaking widows were being neglected in the distribution of,
uh,

642
00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:17.050
food and funds according to the text.

643
00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:20.160
So the seven deacons were appointed those seven deacons,
seven hat,

644
00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.470
they have Greek names,
so they're Greek speaking Jews and Jerusalem already.

645
00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:28.060
So this right after the stoning of Stephen,
you have this,
uh,

646
00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:32.260
chapter eight and Saul approved of their killing him that day,
uh,

647
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:37.270
severe persecution began against the church in Jerusalem and all except the

648
00:39:37.331 --> 00:39:41.530
apostles were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Sumeria.

649
00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:46.720
Devout men buried Stephen and made long,
loud limitation over him.

650
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.440
But Saul was ravaging the church by entering house after house,

651
00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:53.560
dragging off both men and women.
He committed them to prison.

652
00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:59.250
Now those who were scattered after the stoning of Stephen went from place to

653
00:39:59.441 --> 00:40:02.470
place proclaiming the word Phillip,

654
00:40:02.471 --> 00:40:07.060
who was one of those deacons along Stephen was Philip.
That's a good Greek name,

655
00:40:07.061 --> 00:40:11.200
right?
At least it's a Macedonian name named after King of Mastodon,

656
00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.500
Phillip went down to the city of Symeria and proclaimed the messiah to them.

657
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:18.790
So then you get Philip going to Samarria and so forth and you'll have other

658
00:40:18.791 --> 00:40:21.820
things happening.
But now keep your finger,
keep your head,
your finger there.

659
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.830
Notice if you say now,

660
00:40:23.831 --> 00:40:28.831
those who were scattered went from place to place proclaiming the word flip over

661
00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.260
without thinking anything.
Don't think anything.

662
00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.990
Acts 1119 now those who were scattered because of the persecuted hip over

663
00:40:37.991 --> 00:40:41.320
Stephen traveled as far as you see,

664
00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:43.300
Luke seems to have had a source,

665
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:49.150
maybe a written source that had this message about the stoning of Stephen,

666
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:51.910
the dis,
the persecution that arose in Jerusalem,

667
00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:57.600
and then the dispersal of Greek speaking followers of Jesus and they don't just

668
00:40:57.941 --> 00:40:59.440
go to Samarria is Phillip did.

669
00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.930
It actually says that they went to Phoenicia Cyprus,

670
00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:05.530
Antioch Bova w speaking to no one about Jews,

671
00:41:05.531 --> 00:41:09.640
but then it has this message to the Greeks and the gentiles.
In other words,

672
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:15.390
from eight chapter eight verse four it must've originally joined on to what goes

673
00:41:16.931 --> 00:41:21.931
without x 11 verse 19 because you can just see this narrative stops and then it

674
00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.200
takes up again and 1119 in that Luke took what it was a text are a source for

675
00:41:29.651 --> 00:41:33.260
him that had this story that had this kind of thing.
In order,

676
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:38.030
Steven Preaches the gospel to the Jews.
They get mad at him,

677
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:42.810
they persecute him and stone him.
The persecution of stoning leads,
uh,

678
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:45.920
Steven leads to more persecution of the church in Jerusalem.

679
00:41:45.950 --> 00:41:50.120
The rejection of the Gospel by the Jews.
The disciples are scattered and they go,

680
00:41:50.121 --> 00:41:54.680
and who do they preach to?
The gentiles?
Haven't we seen this pattern before?

681
00:41:55.880 --> 00:42:00.030
We all saw it in the very first sermon of,
of Jesus,
right?
So what,

682
00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:04.760
what Luke has done is he split this thing which showed that pattern and in it he

683
00:42:04.761 --> 00:42:08.630
put all the stuff that's in chapters eight,
nine,
and 10,

684
00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:11.870
and the first part of 11 in between there.

685
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:17.200
Now you tell me why did Luke split a narrative and put this material in between

686
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:24.260
those two sentences.
What's in that material between eight,

687
00:42:24.350 --> 00:42:29.150
nine,
10 and 11?
That was Luke wanted to insert there.

688
00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.393
What?

689
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:36.980
Pardon Peter Preaching to

690
00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:39.980
Cornelius.
The gentile.

691
00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:45.590
What Luke is doing is he has a source that basically,

692
00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:47.780
who are the first people to preach to gentiles.

693
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:50.840
They're anonymous according to his source.
We don't know who they are.

694
00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:53.270
Just some people,
some followers of Jesus,

695
00:42:53.271 --> 00:42:57.140
Greek speaking followers of Jesus who were left Jerusalem in Judea.

696
00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:58.370
They traveled around different parts.

697
00:42:58.371 --> 00:43:00.620
They went to the eastern Mediterranean and as they went,

698
00:43:00.621 --> 00:43:02.420
they took the gospel with them.
And along the way,

699
00:43:02.421 --> 00:43:05.540
they even spoke not only to Greek speaking Jews,
but they even spoke to gentiles.

700
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.600
That's what it is.
Sources.
Luke splits that and he,

701
00:43:08.601 --> 00:43:10.430
but he doesn't want to do that first he wants to say,

702
00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:15.140
well Philip went to some area and he preached to some area in some area.

703
00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:16.490
So you have some area there.

704
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:19.430
And then you had this whole thing with Peter and you know the story about Peter,

705
00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:22.190
he's up on the rooftop praying and uh,

706
00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:25.730
this sheet with all these unclean animals with alligators and snakes and stuff.

707
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:28.280
That was somehow some Sunday school material.

708
00:43:28.281 --> 00:43:32.540
I had had a sheet with alligators and snakes and stuff coming down from Peter.

709
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:35.270
So it doesn't tell us in the text that there were alligators and snakes.

710
00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.430
It's just part of my Sunday school memory.

711
00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.060
But they're unclean animals and he's commanded to kill them and eat them.

712
00:43:41.061 --> 00:43:43.960
And he says,
I'm a good Jew.
I don't eat that.
That's not kosher.
And God,

713
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:47.330
the voice from Heaven says,
what God has cleansed,
don't you declare unclean?

714
00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:49.070
The vision happens three times.
Why?

715
00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:53.720
Because Peter does not want to take the message to gentiles.
Is your hand up?

716
00:43:54.110 --> 00:43:54.943
Nope.
Okay.

717
00:43:55.250 --> 00:43:59.990
So finally Peter is forced to take the message to gentiles by God,
by revelation.

718
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:02.990
And then you have the story of the baptism of Cornelius and his house.

719
00:44:02.991 --> 00:44:04.220
The first gentile converts,

720
00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:06.560
and then Peter Goes back to Jerusalem and all the people,

721
00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.390
the Jews in Jerusalem and say,
why did you do that?

722
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:10.940
You're not supposed to bring an uncircumcised people in the church.

723
00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:12.710
And Peter has to defend the whole thing.

724
00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:15.980
And then finally Peter wins the argument.
And even James,

725
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.160
the conservative head of the church in Jerusalem says,
okay,

726
00:44:19.161 --> 00:44:21.560
well God must have been including the gentiles.
Also,

727
00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:26.870
Luke wants Peter to be the first person to take the message to gentiles and he

728
00:44:26.871 --> 00:44:30.620
wants Peter to do so only after being compelled by God to do so.

729
00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.380
Luke knows that the first people who took the message to gentiles were probably

730
00:44:34.381 --> 00:44:37.050
just anonymous followers of Jesus because he didn't source.
It's there.

731
00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:41.460
He splits that source and he puts all this stuff about Peter there because he

732
00:44:41.461 --> 00:44:45.860
wants Peter to be the first and only then the others in.

733
00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:46.740
In other words,

734
00:44:46.740 --> 00:44:51.740
what you get there is a key to what is the entire outline of acts and look back

735
00:44:51.781 --> 00:44:53.340
at acts one verse eight.

736
00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.460
<v 2>Okay,</v>

737
00:44:55.460 --> 00:45:00.460
<v 0>acts one verse eight gives you in a sense the outline of acts.</v>

738
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.863
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

739
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:08.230
<v 0>this is Jesus about to ascend into heaven,
talking to the disciples,</v>

740
00:45:08.770 --> 00:45:11.140
right outside Jerusalem in the suburbs of Jerusalem,

741
00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.470
but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit again,

742
00:45:14.471 --> 00:45:17.860
there's that Holy Spirit important for Luke has come upon you.

743
00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:23.100
You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and all Judea and Sumeria and to the ends

744
00:45:25.541 --> 00:45:29.560
of the earth.
That's exactly the way he will construct the book of acts.

745
00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:35.440
Jerusalem,
Judea is the country of Jerusalem.

746
00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:38.170
Symeria is actually another part here,

747
00:45:38.171 --> 00:45:41.320
but you had this idea that the message is going out in concentric circles.

748
00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:42.430
That's why Philip,

749
00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:46.960
when he has Phillip going to some area right before Peter goes to the gentiles

750
00:45:46.990 --> 00:45:51.490
with in Cornelius in chapter 10 so in chapter eight Philip goes to Sumeria and

751
00:45:51.491 --> 00:45:53.620
then chapter 10 Peter Goes,

752
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:58.830
and then so the dentist and then you had the gentiles and you have Rome as where

753
00:45:59.171 --> 00:45:59.830
the Gospel,

754
00:45:59.830 --> 00:46:04.830
I mean where the book ends up Rome sort of representing symbolically the very

755
00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:08.530
ultimate ends of the earth.
This is the whole world.

756
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:12.250
So why by looking at the details,

757
00:46:12.251 --> 00:46:16.570
we can tell that Luke is not telling us what happened by chronological or

758
00:46:16.571 --> 00:46:20.560
historical accuracy.
He's puts it in the,
even in the order he puts it,

759
00:46:20.561 --> 00:46:24.430
even the outland his books because he wants to have this message of the Gospel

760
00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:28.360
centering on Jerusalem.
That's why the whole first part of Luke centers,

761
00:46:28.361 --> 00:46:31.330
and that's why it has 10 full chapters on the journey to Jerusalem.

762
00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:36.100
He wants to focus your attention on Jerusalem through the Book Gospel to do the

763
00:46:36.101 --> 00:46:38.770
Gospel.
But then what he does is once you're in Jerusalem,

764
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:43.150
he focuses your attention on the fact that the gospel goes beyond Jerusalem.

765
00:46:43.450 --> 00:46:44.710
And in one last thing,

766
00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:50.710
look at Luke 21 2127.

767
00:46:54.080 --> 00:46:54.913
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

768
00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:59.000
<v 0>we'll unpack a lot of this much more less time when we talk about both Luke and</v>

769
00:46:59.001 --> 00:47:03.170
acts as far as what are the major thematic issues in these two.

770
00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:10.710
And I'll start in again next time with this or I'll,

771
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.570
I'll reiterate this but just to get your thinking,

772
00:47:13.571 --> 00:47:17.620
look at Luke chapter 21 Luke gets this from mark 13.

773
00:47:18.130 --> 00:47:20.740
Do you remember we talked about how can we tell when mark was written because it

774
00:47:20.741 --> 00:47:23.560
has this abomination of desolation being set up in the temple,

775
00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:28.630
which probably refers to uh,
you know,
gonna calls.
This idea from of the uh,

776
00:47:28.690 --> 00:47:31.750
profit to the temple by and tag is still fraught the epiphany's but mark Billy

777
00:47:31.751 --> 00:47:33.700
was going to happen in the future probably by the Romans.

778
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:36.880
And right after that happens then in Messiah comes you have all these terrible

779
00:47:36.881 --> 00:47:40.600
things happen.
Masako is using mark as his source.
Mark 13.

780
00:47:40.601 --> 00:47:42.010
But notice how Luke changes it.

781
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:47.080
Verse 20 when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies,
that's not in mark.

782
00:47:48.850 --> 00:47:50.500
When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies,

783
00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:52.870
then know that its desolation has come near.

784
00:47:53.290 --> 00:47:54.940
Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains.

785
00:47:54.941 --> 00:47:57.370
Those inside the city must flee it for these days or vengeance.

786
00:47:57.371 --> 00:47:59.410
I'm going quickly through this.
You have to read over it yourself.

787
00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.120
Look at verse 24 they will fall by the edge of the sword so the Jews will be

788
00:48:04.121 --> 00:48:07.360
defeated.
He says,
not only do you have Jerusalem surrounded by the Roman army,

789
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:09.880
but you have them defeated fall by the sword.

790
00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.870
They will be taken away as captives among all nations.
Yes,

791
00:48:13.871 --> 00:48:18.310
the Jews were taken as slaves to Rome and then they were sold off and disperse

792
00:48:18.311 --> 00:48:22.300
throughout the nations as slaves and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the

793
00:48:22.301 --> 00:48:27.301
gentiles until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled.

794
00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.400
None of that was in Luke source of mark.

795
00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:36.680
This tells us that Luke is writing after the destruction of Jerusalem because he

796
00:48:36.681 --> 00:48:40.820
tells you it happens and even says that there's going to be a time of the

797
00:48:40.821 --> 00:48:43.910
gentile domination of Jerusalem,
and if you read on,

798
00:48:43.911 --> 00:48:48.260
it's only after that that you have the messiah coming on the clouds.

799
00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:52.700
Then as he picks up again,
the story so knows all over Luke and acts.

800
00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.030
We can tell by looking at his sources,
his editing procedure.

801
00:48:56.630 --> 00:49:00.520
Luke was written sometime after the destruction of Jerusalem and the time he's

802
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:05.210
telling the story is here and what's that time?

803
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:07.220
The time of the gentiles.

804
00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:14.420
Any questions?
See you next time.
