00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
## This Video Will Hurt

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.610
Please, put on your headphones -- I promise
that there won't be any loud sounds, but this

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.529
video is going to hurt.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.150
There's a study about hypersounds and how
they cause headaches: these sounds are too

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.139
high-pitched to hear -- like the one added
to this video, playing right now -- but cause

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:16.710
headaches they still do.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.950
The hypersound in your headphones is pressing
on your inner ear, stressing the nerves leading

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.880
to your brain where, if the headache hasn't
started already, it soon will as exposure

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.700
causes headaches after only ten seconds.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.700
Oh my.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.700
Can you feel it?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.399
That pressure on your ears spreading to your
now throbbing brain?

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.399
Because...

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.120
...you shouldn't: the study is made up and
there's no hypersound in the audio, but still

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.640
some of you will have began to feel a headache.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.640
Why?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
The nocebo effect.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.600
A nocebo is a harmless thing -- like a video
with nonexistent hypersounds -- that causes

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.850
harm -- like a headache -- because you *believe*
it's harmful.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.020
That sounds like Voodoo, but there's science
behind the nocebo effect, which is more than

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.319
an irritating parlor trick, it causes real
problems like in medicine.

00:00:58.319 --> 00:01:02.111
When testing a new drug doctors get a group
of sick people give half of them the new drug

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:06.780
and give the other have a fake pill that does
nothing -- but which they're told is real.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.600
This is how science finds the stuff that works
amongst the junk that doesn't.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.500
But new drugs have side effects and sometimes
patients drop out of the experiment because

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.500
of them.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.610
No surprise there.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.620
But some people on the fake *also* drop out
from the side effects.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.180
Side effects they've gotten from a drug they
*aren't* taking.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.920
But because they *think* they're on the real
thing, they've also *thought* themselves into

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.250
the side effects.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.880
Now maybe this is just a case of misattribution:
people get headaches and, if they're joined

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.741
a drug trial that lists headaches in the side
effects, it's natural to blame the new drug

00:01:35.741 --> 00:01:38.320
-- and that certainly happens to some extent.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.390
But the nocebo effects is more than just misattribution,
it causes real, additional harm that scientists

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.110
can measure in cruel, cruel experiments -- and
this is one of the reasons there not an over

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.960
abundance of research on nocoboes: approach
your friendly neighborhood ethics board with

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.530
an experiment designed to hurt people and
they'll frown on that.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.710
But sometimes nocebo experiments do get approved
to the benefit of science and humanity, if

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.880
not the participants.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.320
For example, under the right conditions some
people who expect a harmless injection will

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.479
give them a rash will get a rash, but for
people who expect nothing to happen, nothing

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.380
is exactly what happens.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.470
And fake pills can be additive: take test
subjects off pills they believe are addictive

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.980
and some will experience nocebic withdrawal
symptoms -- like pain and fatigue -- from

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.450
the pills that they could never have been
addicted to in the first place.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.060
Another experiment gave people harmless injections,
told half of them to just sit there and told

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.310
the other half that their pain would increase
for the next thirty minutes -- which it did.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.200
But in this situation there is a drug that
can block the nocebo effect and those who

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.050
were told the injection would hurt, but were
also secretly given the nocebo-blocking drug

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:43.870
did *not* report an increase in pain -- showing
that the nocebo effect is a real, physical

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.870
process.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.050
In all these nocebo experiments it's the belief
in harm that matters.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.630
If someone dressed as a voodoo witch doctor
popped up and hexed you with a curse of great

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.060
pain -- no effect.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.069
But, in a room with a real doctor and his
clipboard and a big science machine and a

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.480
needle in your arm, you'll take his words
rather more seriously.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.430
Which is why doctors say: "This won't hurt
a bit" rather than "Oh this?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.530
It's going to hurt.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.069
Like *a lot*." -- which, by the way, was a
real experiment done on women undergoing labor

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.320
during spinal injections.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.580
Guess how that turned out?

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.240
But nocebos don't end here.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.230
While illnesses like the flu, spread from
contact with disgusting, germ-infected humans

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.000
and the things they touch with their, disgusting
germy hands -- a nocebo spreads from mind

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.920
to mind, no contact required.

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.819
A notable example happened in a Tennessee
high school.

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.620
One teacher reported a strange smell in her
classroom and developed symptoms of headache

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.600
nausea, and difficulty breathing.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.880
These symptoms spread to some of her students
and from them to others in the school.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.069
Almost two hundred people ended up at the
local hospital but all medical tests came

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.819
back with nothing, nor was anything harmful
found at the school.

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.599
This was a nocebo -- the belief that the air
was making them sick -- spread mind to mind.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:56.310
Everyone who got sick heard about the symptoms
from someone else.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.600
When this happens, it's called mass psychogenic
illness.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.750
The treatment in these cases is to separate
those with symptoms from the rest and reassure

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.230
the ill that yes, their symptoms are real,
but no they haven't been exposed to anything

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.860
toxic, and yes people are getting better quickly:

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.680
The last is one of the indicators that separates
a real poison gas leak or biological weapon

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.470
from mass psychogenic illness.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.760
But the final factor, number of cases increasing
with greater media coverage, can lead to this

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.199
kind of thing spreading far and wide.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.630
Take, electrosensitives: people who get nausea
(among other things) from exposure to parts

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.040
of the electromagnetic spectrum, notably WiFi
the density of which is increasing over time,

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.800
forcing particularly bad sufferers to retreat
to places like the creepy-sounding radio science

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.380
zone in, where else, West Virginia.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.750
But put electrosensitives in a room with a
WiFi router and they can't actually tell via

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.220
their symptoms if it's on or off.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.180
Instead their symptoms track with being told
if it's on or off.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.690
And if you make a group of people without
electrosensitivity watch a news report on

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.100
how Wifi makes you ill while another group
watches something uninformative and afterward

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.631
expose both groups to a fake Wifi signal only
some of those who watched the news report

00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:05.700
feel sick.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.170
There's a similar phenomenon called 'wind
farm disease' with similar side effects, which

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:13.430
turns up where it's been talked about on the
local news, but not in other places in the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.520
same country with the same wind farms where
it isn't.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.290
All this makes it too easy to mock people
for thinking they're getting sick from WiFi

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.380
or Wind farms or *Wind farms with WiFi* -- but
it's important to realize they're not crazy,

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.020
the side effects are real, they're just wrong
about the source: all evidence points to the

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.350
belief in electrosensitivy as the cause of
electrosensitivity.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.100
Which means the news reports talking about
these illnesses are spreading a kind of mind

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.100
virus.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.080
And while these are exotic examples, there
is also evidence that some allergies and asthma

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.030
cases are nocebic and thus able to be spread
in the same way.

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.830
To be clear: if someone's having an asthma
attack, that's not the time to tell them you

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:55.310
know they're being a drama llama because you
watched an Internet video about the nocebo

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:56.310
effect.

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:59.790
*They're really having an asthma attack* and
they *really* need something to make it stop

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.260
and that's *really* not you showing off your
knowledge.

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.290
Harmful things aren't harmful just because
we believe they are -- the right dose of arsenic

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.880
will kill you as surely as an anvil to the
head, no matter your insistence otherwise.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.449
But the nocebo effect does show that our beliefs
about otherwise harmless things can make them

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.449
harmful.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.180
Which means that our voodoo doctor's hex from
before really could work, but only if you

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.689
were foolish enough to believe him.
