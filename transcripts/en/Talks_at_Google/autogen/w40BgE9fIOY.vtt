[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:10.020
JULIE WONG: So
thank you for taking

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.770
the time to come visit
Google, and we're all just

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.890
going to kick off with
that you're returning

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.740
from the first film,
"Bad Moms," and Christmas

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.440
is approaching in this film.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.960
So where do we find
each of your characters?

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.250
KRISTEN BELL: Oh, I'll start.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.770
Well, Kiki has much repaired
her relationship with Kent.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.380
I'll say that.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.579
She stood up for herself,
which a lot of times,

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.370
when you stand up for
yourself, you sort of

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.590
set new boundaries
and new dynamics

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.160
in your life, which she's done.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.820
Kent helps out a lot at home.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.030
He is no longer a neverhard,
if you know what I mean.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.980
So she has a thriving
sex life, and she's still

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.240
friends with both these girls.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.570
But I think as life ebbs and
flows, you go through waves,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.790
where the moms felt like they
took a part of their life back.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.819
But Christmas and the
holidays are approaching,

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.890
and they feel like it's
just slipping away,

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.330
all that control.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.216
That's where--

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:12.950
MILA KUNIS: God, I love it.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:13.590
So good.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.089
Amy?

00:01:14.089 --> 00:01:14.820
Where's Amy?

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.509
So she is in a relationship--
spoiler alert-- with Jay.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:23.050
Yeah, Jessie.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.900
That's his name.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.896
And that's right.

00:01:26.896 --> 00:01:29.510
Jay Hernandez, slash Jessie--

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.760
and is in a very happy
place in her life.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.560
She has filed for divorce.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.140
Everything's great.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.850
And her mother-- her
mother comes into town

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.420
and throws her in for
a loop of spiraling out

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.160
of control and feeling like
she's never good enough

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.354
and that nothing she
ever does is good enough

00:01:51.354 --> 00:01:53.770
and feeling the pressure to
be as perfect as their mother,

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.870
while having these
wonderful women

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:01.180
try to help themselves and
her be strong and powerful

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.650
and go against the
system of Christmas.

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:06.880
KATHRYN HAHN: Well, I--

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.050
MILA KUNIS: You play Carla.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.810
KATHRYN HAHN: --play Carla.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.370
And thank you.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.870
Mimosa.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.880
Most Carla is trying-- you know,
I think from the last movie,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.580
I think is trying a modicum of--

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.490
thank you-- some
responsibility in her life.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.630
She has a job now.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.100
I think she works--

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.690
she's an esthetician and all
that that entails at a spa.

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.279
And so I think
she's trying to have

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:34.570
a little bit of responsibility.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.855
It's just her and
her boy, and then

00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:38.230
yeah, Mom walks
in, who I haven't

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.320
seen in years and years.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.890
I don't think Christmas
in their family was ever--

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.075
MILA KUNIS: Celebrated.

00:02:46.075 --> 00:02:49.927
KATHRYN HAHN: --cele--
really, no one really cared.

00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:52.510
Yeah, so I think that's the role
you see her in is trying to--

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.180
I think she's trying to have
a little bit of responsibility

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.638
and trying to enjoy these last
couple of years with her boy

00:02:57.638 --> 00:03:00.490
before he goes away
to school or wherever.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.930
Or who is she kidding?

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.100
He's never leaving her home.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.800
JULIE WONG: Oh.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.920
Well, this film was directed
by Jon Lucas and Scott

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.927
Moore, the duo best known
for "The Hangover" films.

00:03:11.927 --> 00:03:14.260
How much were you able to
influence the script this time

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.759
around?

00:03:17.838 --> 00:03:23.760
MILA KUNIS: Uh, I
would say, yeah, a lot.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.710
It was a really
nice collaboration.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.040
God, I hate the
sound of my voice.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.570
Sorry, guys.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:35.820
It was all done very quickly
between the time of yes,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.460
let's do a sequel to let's shoot
the sequel to it coming out,

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.560
it's probably been
nine months total.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.450
And so the guys had a
short period of time

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.250
to write the script in.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.800
I would say, all in all,
a pretty good amount

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.320
of influence, as much as they
were willing to listen to me

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.330
talk and talk and talk and do
rewrites and notes with them.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.990
But they're so great
and so inclusive,

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.634
and I think they wanted it
to be as good, if not better

00:03:56.634 --> 00:03:58.050
as the first one,
and so they were

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.170
more than willing to sit
down and talk to anybody who

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.084
was willing to give them notes.

00:04:03.084 --> 00:04:05.250
KATHRYN HAHN: We were so
excited when we heard the--

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.635
at least I was-- when I
heard the idea of where

00:04:07.635 --> 00:04:10.260
the sequel would be set or what
time of the year, because there

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.190
really isn't another
period, where, you know,

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.740
moms, in particular, are
so expected to make magic

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.620
happen for everybody
else in their lives.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.850
And it's like, you know,
behind the curtain,

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.147
she's sweating and miserable.

00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:26.730
And then there's
like an innate comedy

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.370
timeline of Christmas Eve.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.160
It's like inherently, you
have to try to get to there--

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.390
it's a countdown.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.790
So comedy-wise, we knew.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.370
And it's such a
crazy, crazy pressure

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.650
for no reason, where
it should just be

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.246
this magic time with everybody.

00:04:46.246 --> 00:04:46.870
And of course--

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:47.980
JULIE WONG: Yeah,
and it should be fun.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.438
KATHRYN HAHN: And
it should be fun.

00:04:49.438 --> 00:04:50.140
And it gets so--

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.790
and it's earlier and earlier.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.520
Clearly, I mean it's October.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:56.510
But it's so clearly
earlier and earlier.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.950
JULIE WONG: I started my
Christmas list already,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.660
and I've started shopping.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.170
I know.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.170
MILA KUNIS: I start now.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.980
I really do.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.160
KRISTEN BELL: It's insane.

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.105
KATHRYN HAHN: Yeah.

00:05:05.105 --> 00:05:06.730
MILA KUNIS: But then
by Thanksgiving, I

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:08.000
don't have any Christmas
shopping to do.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.650
KATHRYN HAHN: No,
then you can relax.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.114
MILA KUNIS: I'm done.

00:05:10.114 --> 00:05:11.530
JULIE WONG: Well,
your mothers are

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.890
played by award-winning Susan
Sarandon, Christine Baranski,

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.600
and Cheryl Hines.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.449
Did any of you have a role in
casting your on-screen moms?

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.115
MILA KUNIS: Yes.

00:05:21.115 --> 00:05:21.880
KRISTEN BELL: Yes.

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:22.290
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.790
JULIE WONG: So you were just
like, me think of who I want?

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:25.456
MILA KUNIS: Yes.

00:05:25.456 --> 00:05:27.040
JULIE WONG: And they
were, like, yes.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.610
But that's--

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.200
MILA KUNIS: And then they
were like, yeah, sure,

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.033
write them a letter.

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:31.772
And you're like, OK.

00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:34.506
And then you're like,
send And people respond.

00:05:34.506 --> 00:05:35.297
It's kind of crazy.

00:05:35.297 --> 00:05:36.111
KATHRYN HAHN: Yeah,
it's kind of crazy.

00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:37.190
JULIE WONG: That's so smooth.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.148
KRISTEN BELL: The directors
are very confident,

00:05:39.148 --> 00:05:41.020
but also, like,
they're resigned.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.360
They're not like gigantic
personalities that

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.610
jump into a room, but
they're confident enough

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:49.760
to know that they take
all advice and all ideas.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.760
And they use the ones they like.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.140
And there's just something
sort of beautiful about that,

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.350
so they listened to all
of our Christmas stories,

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.220
thought about what we would
want our characters doing,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.290
and then they thought
about how they

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:00.640
would place that into the film.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.020
And I think the same
thing went with the moms.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.603
They were like, who
do you connect to?

00:06:03.603 --> 00:06:05.677
Who do you feel like you
would want to work with?

00:06:05.677 --> 00:06:06.760
Who are you friendly with?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.384
Who do you think is
wonderful for this?

00:06:08.384 --> 00:06:11.080
But they're really,
really collaborative.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.900
JULIE WONG: Yeah, it seems
like it was the perfect cast.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:16.420
So one of my favorite
lines is delivered

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:17.860
by Christine Baranski.

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.900
She says, "You're a mom.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.130
Moms don't enjoy.

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:22.450
They give joy.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.540
That's how being a mom works."

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.000
And can you tell us more
about each of their characters

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.958
and what we can expect?

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:32.180
MILA KUNIS: They're all--

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.280
no, you can go ahead.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.400
KRISTEN BELL: No, [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.970
My mom is played by Cheryl
Hines, who weirdly enough,

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.800
has been like a friend of
mine for about a decade.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.635
So I was like, this is weird,
but do you want to play my mom,

00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:48.010
and we can just add a weird
line that you had me when you

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.870
were, like, 10 or something?

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.940
And she was like, sure.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.960
So we already had a very strong
friendship bond going into it,

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.260
and we share a similar
sense of humor,

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.760
and I sort of idolized her.

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.190
And I was so excited
that she said yes.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.850
And the storyline with Kiki--

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:09.702
it pretty much wrote
itself in that, of course,

00:07:09.702 --> 00:07:12.160
Kiki has the issues she has,
because she had an overbearing

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.980
mother, like an intensely
overbearing mother,

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.740
a mother that wore her face
on her sweatshirt often,

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.340
and a mother that cuts and
colors her hair exactly

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:25.660
the same, a mother that just
cannot stop living through her

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.470
daughter, and how much
pressure Kiki feels,

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:34.390
and how that makes her sort
of neurotic and unable to set

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:37.330
a boundary, because she's
fearful of hurting her mom,

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.920
which I've experienced.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.910
And it was wonderful
to be able to work

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.450
in a safe, fun environment
with Cheryl, who's

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.750
one of the best, also,
improv female comedians we

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:50.420
have out there.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.180
So she, I feel like,
brought a ton to it,

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:56.840
and I was just really
grateful that she said yes.

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.330
MILA KUNIS: I had the pleasure
of Christine Baranski, who

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.790
came about of me going,
hm, who makes me nervous?

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.630
And I was like,
Christine Baranski.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:09.650
My character in the
first one was constantly

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:13.370
trying to be perfect, and
that was her whole spiral of,

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.260
how do I beat the
ideals of perfection?

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.440
So the mother that
I get in the movie

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.680
is somebody who has
to have everything

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.140
be exactly the way the public
would want it to perceive.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.570
So everything has to
visually be great.

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.540
Doesn't matter what's
happening behind closed doors,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:28.670
but you don't air
your dirty laundry,

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:29.690
and everything
has to be perfect,

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:31.535
and the kids have to be happy,
and it has to be the best this,

00:08:31.535 --> 00:08:33.909
and everything has to be
perfect and wonderful and great.

00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:36.289
And so I was like, who makes
me nervous as a person?

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:37.955
And I literally like,
Christine Baranski

00:08:37.955 --> 00:08:39.445
kind of makes me nervous.

00:08:39.445 --> 00:08:41.320
And I was like, well,
let's see what happens.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.986
And literally, that's
how it went about.

00:08:42.986 --> 00:08:45.640
And then I emailed her
and was like, hey, there's

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.750
this little movie we
did called "Bad Moms."

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.850
Like I went on a whole thing,
and she was like, yeah, OK.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.200
And that was it.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.240
And I was like, do you
want to read the script?

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.455
She's like, no, that's fine.

00:08:56.455 --> 00:08:58.580
And then the directors,
Jon and Scott, met with her

00:08:58.580 --> 00:09:00.140
and pitched her the idea
of this character that's

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:01.610
a very overbearing mother.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.610
And all the moms,
ultimately, have

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.560
a reason as to why they
are the way that they are,

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.800
which explains why our
characters became the way they

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.740
became, which is very
reminiscent of you are who

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.185
your parents are, whether
your parents were consciously

00:09:16.185 --> 00:09:17.810
driving you, and you
fought against it,

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.310
and you became a rebel,
or you went into it

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.720
and became Mark Zuckerberg.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.490
Like whatever version of
that you became, it is true.

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.740
You are what your parents are.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.115
And so in this
case, I think this

00:09:26.115 --> 00:09:29.090
gives an explanation as to
why we, as mothers, are so

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.075
constantly fighting
for perfection.

00:09:32.075 --> 00:09:33.200
KRISTEN BELL: And it also--

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.480
I think what they did a
great job of in this movie

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.220
is they give the moms enough
behind the curtain time

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.130
and peel away the onion
time, where it does sort

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.500
of resonate that,
like, guys, everybody's

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.570
doing the best they can
with what they've got.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.990
JULIE WONG: Yeah.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.948
KRISTEN BELL: You know?

00:09:48.948 --> 00:09:50.641
And that rings true
for our characters,

00:09:50.641 --> 00:09:52.640
but it also, throughout
the course of the movie,

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.190
you see, yeah, your
mom is so annoying,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:57.427
but she's doing the best
she can with what she got.

00:09:57.427 --> 00:09:58.760
MILA KUNIS: And it explains why.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.502
Like you no longer
resent your parents.

00:10:00.502 --> 00:10:01.460
KRISTEN BELL: Oh, yeah.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.180
MILA KUNIS: And let
me take that back.

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.890
I meant Larry Page,
not Mark Zuckerberg.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:04.390
OK, guys?

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.320
My bad.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.500
I apologize.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.980
I also mean Eric Schmidt.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.020
We can go down the list.

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.140
JULIE WONG: That's OK.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:10.660
We're all friends.

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:11.260
MILA KUNIS: I didn't mean Zuck.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.041
Sorry go on.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.010
KATHRYN HAHN: I got to get on
this bob game, too, you guys.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.660
Your hair looks so
awesome, both of yours.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:24.217
I feel like I'm the odd odd
woman out with this long hair.

00:10:24.217 --> 00:10:25.550
MILA KUNIS: Fuck the hair, guys.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.480
JULIE WONG: [INAUDIBLE]
for your scenes.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:27.313
KATHRYN HAHN: Right.

00:10:27.313 --> 00:10:28.180
JULIE WONG: Yeah.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:29.830
KATHRYN HAHN: Susan
Sarandon, you guys.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:30.370
JULIE WONG: I know.

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.600
KATHRYN HAHN: It's nutso.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.680
I mean, I was so excited.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.190
And similarly, I was like, who--

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.260
there's only one person
in the world that

00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:41.120
would make Carla feel small,
and that would be her mother.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.780
And then I was so excited at
the thought of it being Susan,

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:45.520
and I, yeah, wrote her as well.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:46.720
MILA KUNIS: You wanted
Susan Sarandon very early

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:46.870
[INAUDIBLE].

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:47.830
KATHRYN HAHN: I did.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:48.788
I was like, oh, my god.

00:10:48.788 --> 00:10:49.810
I just knew it.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.230
And then even just being in a
scene with her would be very--

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.630
it would take me a second,
because it would be all those

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:56.650
movies would--

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:59.080
it was like, "Thelma and
Louise," "Dead Man Walking,"

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.246
"Rocky Horror Picture Show."

00:11:00.246 --> 00:11:03.100
So it's like hard to refocus,
because she's such a goddess.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.760
They all are.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.980
We really lucked out
with these women.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:09.330
And so yeah, I think in their
dynamic, Carla and her mom,

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.450
it's more--

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.900
I think they were more,
like, kind of siblings

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:13.840
than mother-daughter.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.230
You know what I mean?

00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:15.792
There was not a
lot of boundaries.

00:11:15.792 --> 00:11:16.750
JULIE WONG: Friendship.

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.184
KATHRYN HAHN: Yeah, exactly.

00:11:18.184 --> 00:11:19.600
JULIE WONG: Well,
we were thinking

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.430
about how you
celebrate the holidays,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:22.619
since it is a holiday film.

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:24.910
Can you share what some of
your favorite traditions are

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:27.019
and if you are sharing
this with your children?

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:28.060
KATHRYN HAHN: Oh, my god.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.910
Well, when I grew up, we used
to have to sing "Happy Birthday

00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:33.100
Baby Jesus" on Christmas Eve.

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:34.030
I'm not kidding you.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:37.430
My mom would get a cake, and we
would be like, happy birthday.

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.610
And I had so many questions.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.200
Like, how many candles?

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.667
It was so confusing.

00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:43.750
I have not passed that on.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:44.190
JULIE WONG: A lot of candles.

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.106
KATHRYN HAHN: Yeah, I
have not passed that on,

00:11:46.106 --> 00:11:48.945
but that was something
we had to do.

00:11:48.945 --> 00:11:51.797
At least sing "Happy
Birthday Baby Jesus.

00:11:51.797 --> 00:11:56.264
Like, [SINGING] happy
birthday, Baby Jesus.

00:11:56.264 --> 00:11:57.180
And we were all like--

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:57.960
just did it.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:58.850
So weird.

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.100
MILA KUNIS: What kind of cake?

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.190
KATHRYN HAHN: Baskin
Robbins, Santa Claus cake.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:04.710
So it was confusing on a whole--

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.760
a lot of levels.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.952
JULIE WONG: Even better.

00:12:06.952 --> 00:12:08.100
KATHRYN HAHN: Yeah.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.600
MILA KUNIS: I got
nothing, you guys.

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.000
JULIE WONG: I don't know
that we can top that.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.990
MILA KUNIS: Tradition
that I've passed down--

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.865
I don't really have--

00:12:14.865 --> 00:12:16.110
none.

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:18.864
I mean, no, because you
know, I'm Jewish, you guys.

00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:20.530
So not to be like,
rah-rah, don't really

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:21.570
celebrate Christmas.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:25.620
But sorry.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.260
I also grew up in
communist Russia,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:29.675
where you don't really
celebrate Christmas.

00:12:29.675 --> 00:12:31.020
But I do now, so yay.

00:12:33.930 --> 00:12:36.267
I think we're creating
traditions is the best

00:12:36.267 --> 00:12:37.350
way that I can explain it.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.070
So our kid is in--

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:44.450
she's-- how do I explain this?

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:45.990
She's having a
hard time grasping

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.800
why a man is coming into
our house through a chimney.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.084
So spoiler alert-- we're not
teaching her about Santa Claus.

00:12:54.084 --> 00:12:55.500
We're not not
teaching her, but we

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.670
try to explain to
her that there's

00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:58.350
a man that's coming
into the house,

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.882
and she was like, [GASPS], why?

00:13:00.882 --> 00:13:03.434
KRISTEN BELL: That's so
weird, like one night a year,

00:13:03.434 --> 00:13:04.600
breaking and entering is OK.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.317
MILA KUNIS: But if you kid
believes in it, it's great.

00:13:07.317 --> 00:13:08.400
KATHRYN HAHN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.680
KRISTEN BELL: Oh, so he's got
a bunch of exotics on the roof.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.025
He's in a jumpsuit and combat
boots, but don't worry.

00:13:13.025 --> 00:13:14.400
MILA KUNIS: Did
your kids buy it?

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:15.240
Because mine's not buying it.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:15.990
She's like, I don't get it.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.280
KRISTEN BELL: One of them
does, one of them doesn't.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:19.440
JULIE WONG: [INAUDIBLE]
Harley or Jay Hernandez,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.777
maybe that would be OK.

00:13:20.777 --> 00:13:22.110
MILA KUNIS: Not for my daughter.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.901
KRISTEN BELL: It's
scary, though, because I

00:13:23.901 --> 00:13:26.310
try to be so honest
about everything else.

00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:29.010
And even like during
Easter, I was like, bunny--

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:29.550
too far.

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:30.650
That's too far.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.187
I was like, we play a game,
where we pretend and imagine

00:13:33.187 --> 00:13:35.020
this giant bunny brings
us an Easter basket,

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.690
but Mommy went to the store
and got this for you. .

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:38.550
But around Christmas,
everyone talks about it,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.410
and you don't ever want to say
it in front of another kid,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:43.260
because you don't want to insult
another parent and take over.

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:44.610
That's their domain.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.070
But I'm having a hard time
lying to them about it.

00:13:47.070 --> 00:13:48.180
MILA KUNIS: I tried lying.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.430
I'm really trying.

00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.710
KRISTEN BELL: Oh, so like--

00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.030
MILA KUNIS: I'm like, see,
that's totally awesome.

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.790
She's like, I don't get it.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:53.430
JULIE WONG: [INAUDIBLE],,
tooth fairy.

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:54.300
You name it.

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:55.020
[INAUDIBLE]

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.910
KRISTEN BELL: Yeah, but
also, so when they find out,

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.890
they're going to go, what else
have you lied to me about?

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.160
KATHRYN HAHN: Well,
that's what's confusing.

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.050
It's when your kids--

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:01.740
KRISTEN BELL: And then
that's like, shit, I

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.573
shouldn't have lied.

00:14:02.573 --> 00:14:03.300
You're right.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.525
I've lost it.

00:14:04.525 --> 00:14:07.200
KATHRYN HAHN: It's when your
kids have questions about God,

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.330
but then you're, like,
but with definitively,

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:10.675
but there's a tooth fairy.

00:14:10.675 --> 00:14:13.560
But you're like, some
people believe this.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.420
It gets confusing.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.990
KRISTEN BELL: I was babysitting
yesterday an extra kid

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.620
at my house.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:18.180
Here is some of the
questions that I

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.470
fielded throughout the day.

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.460
Is Santa Claus real?

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:22.710
And I couldn't say anything
in front of the other kid.

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:24.630
Who made dogs?

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:25.935
Why is the earth?

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.510
Literally, I was like-- no,
no, that was the question.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:32.650
And they're just, like,
painting, and they're like,

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.070
who made dogs?

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.440
Why is the earth?

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.450
And I was like, oh, my
god, where's my husband?

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:37.950
I can't--

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:39.900
JULIE WONG: Sounds like
an awesome play date.

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:40.640
We'll have to come over.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.640
KRISTEN BELL: I was like,
I'm Kiki in real life.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.345
It's so sad.

00:14:44.345 --> 00:14:45.970
MILA KUNIS: You're
like, it's a planet.

00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:47.720
JULIE WONG: Well,
you're all working moms,

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.290
and the pressures of
being a perfect parent

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:52.540
is something that we
can all relate to.

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:56.800
So is there a secret to
your work life integration?

00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:01.076
And then what do
you do to recharge?

00:15:01.076 --> 00:15:03.650
KATHRYN HAHN: Well, I
love my girlfriends,

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:09.920
like, my tribe of other
mamas and humans that I love

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.449
and that we share the same
kind of phil-- you know.

00:15:12.449 --> 00:15:13.490
You just find your group.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.510
And I cherish that.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:19.920
And then I think the
balance is really hard.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:20.431
It's hard.

00:15:20.431 --> 00:15:21.305
JULIE WONG: Oh, yeah.

00:15:21.305 --> 00:15:21.870
KATHRYN HAHN: Yeah.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:23.450
JULIE WONG: I try not to say
balance anymore, because--

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:23.800
KATHRYN HAHN: You can't.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.250
JULIE WONG: --I don't
believe that balance exists.

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.958
KATHRYN HAHN: No.

00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.145
It doesn't.

00:15:27.145 --> 00:15:29.240
It's just-- it is really like--

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.310
I've always thought,
like, it really does suck

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.060
that biologically, our chief
money-making years are lined up

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:36.920
with our fertility.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.120
It just blows.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.440
You know what I mean?

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:43.370
It's just what it is, but
it really sucks for us.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:45.956
Anyway, I'm going to
have some more mimosa.

00:15:45.956 --> 00:15:47.330
JULIE WONG: Let's
drink some more

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.711
and just make the
most out of it.

00:15:49.711 --> 00:15:51.870
KATHRYN HAHN: To women.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.444
JULIE WONG: Any secrets to
just recharging, signing off?

00:15:55.444 --> 00:15:57.110
KRISTEN BELL: I mean,
self-care is huge.

00:15:57.110 --> 00:16:00.740
I think, like, just knowing
when you're feeling frustrated

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.130
and knowing when you need to
call a girlfriend or when you

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.455
need to even just tag
team with your-- like we,

00:16:06.455 --> 00:16:07.830
in our household,
we'll be like--

00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:09.500
I'll be like, I've
got to switch kids.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.490
I don't want this one anymore.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.890
JULIE WONG: Oh, yeah.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.080
KRISTEN BELL: I'm not
doing this one right now,

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.830
because one of them
will be partic--

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:14.400
I'm not-- I don't want--

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.230
I want to switch.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.040
And then he's like, got it.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:16.910
Totally, totally.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:20.090
And then we switch, because
sometimes you just need

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:23.330
to know when you're
getting higher,

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.860
your thermometer
is getting higher.

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:27.050
And whether that goes
for, like, oh, it's

00:16:27.050 --> 00:16:29.655
been four months since
I've like a girls' dinner.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:30.530
I'm going to do that.

00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:34.650
Any amount of self-care,
and never ever, ever, ever,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:36.529
beating yourself up
for needing self-care--

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:37.820
I used to do that all the time.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.153
And I was like, no, I should
be of service to my family.

00:16:40.153 --> 00:16:43.370
And I was like, no, I can get a
manicure once every six months.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:44.440
Like, that's OK.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.590
Do you know what I mean?

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:47.960
And not killing myself
for it, and also,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.450
surrendering to the fact
that there is no balance.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.626
It is only just have a mantra.

00:16:52.626 --> 00:16:53.750
Like just be where you are.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.583
Like when I'm at home,
I focus on my family.

00:16:55.583 --> 00:16:57.680
When I'm at work, I
focus on work and scroll

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.940
through pictures of my family.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.910
But you just have
to be where you are.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.680
It's really just mindfulness.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:07.472
Like there's no-- the
balance is such a sad joke.

00:17:07.472 --> 00:17:08.180
JULIE WONG: Yeah.

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.138
KRISTEN BELL: You know?

00:17:09.138 --> 00:17:10.082
JULIE WONG: Yeah.

00:17:10.082 --> 00:17:12.540
MILA KUNIS: I mean I can just
talk for the sake of talking,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.505
but I actually have--

00:17:13.505 --> 00:17:15.380
yeah, everything that
you said, I agree with.

00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:18.036
There's no balance.

00:17:18.036 --> 00:17:20.119
But I also don't want it
to be like a woman thing.

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:21.740
There's just no balance if
you're a working parent.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:22.550
There is no balance.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.341
It doesn't matter if
you're a man or woman.

00:17:24.341 --> 00:17:26.550
I am incredibly fortunate,
and I've said this before,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.466
and I'll say it again.

00:17:27.466 --> 00:17:29.120
I do have an amazing
partner in life.

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:30.960
I do-- who just-- yeah.

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.580
Who?

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.121
That's right.

00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:33.191
Who, you guys?

00:17:33.191 --> 00:17:34.730
Who my partner?

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.140
He's fucking awesome.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.600
And I'm not going to shit
on him, because he's great.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:39.780
And guess who was
home with the kids

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.150
today at 5:00 in the morning
when I was getting ready.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:41.810
He was.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.400
He was awesome.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:46.970
And you know, I had to
go away for five months

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.476
to shoot something, and he
took the time off from work.

00:17:49.476 --> 00:17:51.350
He was like-- you know,
we travel as a tribe,

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:52.340
as I know you do.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:54.680
Where one goes, the other
one follows with the kids.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.470
And for five months, he
was on a flip schedule.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.170
So we were in Europe, so
he would work from 9:00 PM

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.420
to, like, 5:00 in
the morning, and then

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.830
be with the kids all day.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.270
Never once did he complain,
and all the time, he would go,

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:08.103
you know, I'm so blessed
that I get to spend

00:18:08.103 --> 00:18:09.420
this much time with the kids.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.990
And it's the most
great-- like it's--

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:14.160
you take it for granted
having a partner,

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.420
whether it's hired help or a
husband or a wife or whatever.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.220
Anyone that allows
you to just be like,

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.770
I can't do this
anymore, to your point,

00:18:21.770 --> 00:18:23.370
don't take them for granted.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.310
Don't, because I think it's
the one thing that I sometimes

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:26.810
forget to do is just
simply say thank you,

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:29.030
because as much as I'm
like, I'm about to explode.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.724
I need to go and,
like, lock myself up

00:18:30.724 --> 00:18:33.140
in the closet for a minute,
he's like, babe, you got this.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.010
Go.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.500
And I'm like, OK,
OK, I got this.

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.660
But you just-- I think
that we should just

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.787
be grateful for whatever
help it is that you're

00:18:40.787 --> 00:18:43.370
able to conceive, whether it's
your friends, your girlfriends,

00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:44.939
your village, your
mom, your dad.

00:18:44.939 --> 00:18:47.105
KRISTEN BELL: Don't feel
guilty for relying on help.

00:18:47.105 --> 00:18:47.450
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:48.589
Never feel guilty about it.

00:18:48.589 --> 00:18:50.630
And that's the one thing
that I think both of you

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:54.890
helped me with two years ago,
because I had the hardest time

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.810
asking for help two years ago.

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:58.580
When I did "Bad
Moms," the first one

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.955
was the first time I went back
to work after having kids,

00:19:00.955 --> 00:19:02.480
and I literally was like--

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:05.210
you know, as Daniel Tagger says,
when you're feeling frustrated,

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:07.000
step back and ask
for help, y'all.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.460
Fucking step back
and ask for help.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.650
It's OK.

00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:12.180
And it took me forever
to be OK with it.

00:19:12.180 --> 00:19:15.020
And you and you were the
biggest champions of that,

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.125
so I thank you.

00:19:16.125 --> 00:19:17.150
It's true.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.340
JULIE WONG: Well, cheers for our
girlfriends and our partners.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.340
We'll go ahead and
start taking questions,

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:23.780
if you want to line up.

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:28.820
And I guess to wrap up,
yeah, where would each of you

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.060
like to see your characters
go, if there was a third film?

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.802
MILA KUNIS: To Hawaii.

00:19:34.802 --> 00:19:35.885
KRISTEN BELL: On vacation.

00:19:35.885 --> 00:19:37.700
KATHRYN HAHN: A destination.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.991
JULIE WONG: Actually,
vacation takes a lot of work.

00:19:39.991 --> 00:19:41.990
MILA KUNIS: That's the
bad moms plan a vacation.

00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.660
JULIE WONG: I feel you.

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.620
KRISTEN BELL: Just planning
a family vacation--

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.610
JULIE WONG: Packing,
having everything

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.264
you need on the plane ride.

00:19:48.264 --> 00:19:49.930
MILA KUNIS: Favorite
thing in the world.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:50.870
JULIE WONG: I don't
know [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.953
MILA KUNIS: [INAUDIBLE]
forgot to lock up our kids

00:19:52.953 --> 00:19:54.020
in their car seats once.

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.470
JULIE WONG: Oh,
yeah, car seats--

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:56.030
MILA KUNIS: Drop them in.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.560
JULIE WONG: --on that
airplane in the car

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:58.435
that you have to run.

00:19:58.435 --> 00:19:59.702
Yeah, we could go on and on.

00:19:59.702 --> 00:20:02.160
Great, so we'll go ahead and
start with the first question.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.100
Thanks so much for
coming to Google.

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.840
It's great to see all of you.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:10.340
My question is, how was working
on this set of "Bad Moms"

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.770
different than other sets
you worked on in the past?

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:14.561
KATHRYN HAHN: Well,
it's a Christmas movie,

00:20:14.561 --> 00:20:20.200
and we shot it in
Atlanta in May and June.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.250
So that was relaxing.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:26.375
Pools of sweat in places I
didn't know could gather.

00:20:29.084 --> 00:20:30.500
KRISTEN BELL: I
think we were also

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:34.310
kind of like, whereas the last
movie, we had a lot of peers,

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.620
and like we were all very
friendly, this movie,

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:39.890
we were all sort of,
like, in awe of the things

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.340
that Christine and Susan and
Cheryl were sort of bringing.

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:45.920
And we felt-- I feel like
I felt a little bit more

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.029
like a fan girl on
this, not that I'm not

00:20:48.029 --> 00:20:50.070
in love with the other
women that we worked with.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.159
But this just felt a
little bit more like--

00:20:52.159 --> 00:20:54.200
I don't know, like, why
are they doing our movie?

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.110
This is so exciting.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:57.541
You know?

00:20:57.541 --> 00:20:58.791
JULIE WONG: Thank you so much.

00:20:58.791 --> 00:21:01.246
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:01.246 --> 00:21:02.230
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:03.360
I'll second that.

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.090
Thank you so much for
coming to Google today.

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.322
One of my favorite parts of the
first movie, which was amazing,

00:21:09.322 --> 00:21:10.780
but the very end,
where each of you

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.529
were interviewed with
your moms, I thought

00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:15.180
was incredibly touching
and so transparent

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:16.980
of you, especially
in the public light,

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.930
to have your moms be there.

00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:22.907
So with your new stage
moms in the second one,

00:21:22.907 --> 00:21:24.990
did your moms get to meet
any of your screen moms?

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.615
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:29.710
KATHRYN HAHN: My mom did.

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:33.432
She happened to be there while
we were doing a gallery shoot,

00:21:33.432 --> 00:21:35.140
so remember, we were
doing the publicity,

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.920
and so she got to meet her,
which was very, very exciting.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.504
Yeah.

00:21:38.504 --> 00:21:40.170
But those first
interviews were so dear.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.003
And remember-- do you
remember they ended up

00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:44.300
being incredible interviewers?

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.260
Jon and Scott, our
directors and writers,

00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.600
actually did the interviews
for all of us as couple--

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.014
the mothers and daughters,
and it was-- they

00:21:51.014 --> 00:21:51.930
were pretty revealing.

00:21:51.930 --> 00:21:53.135
It got real deep in there.

00:21:53.135 --> 00:21:54.510
MILA KUNIS: Very
Barbara Walters.

00:21:54.510 --> 00:21:54.870
KATHRYN HAHN: It was.

00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:55.440
JULIE WONG: Oh, yeah.

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.580
It was really well done.

00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:58.663
MILA KUNIS: My mom has not
met Christine Baranski,

00:21:58.663 --> 00:22:01.280
but my mom's five
feet on a good day.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.130
Like if she stands
up really tall,

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:04.800
she's maybe five feet tall.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.760
And she's tiny.

00:22:05.760 --> 00:22:08.100
She's just a tiny little
thing, because [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:09.060
tall and beautifully.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.950
My mom's like, that's
what I imagine myself as.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:14.590
She was like, that's how I feel.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.950
It's very cute,
so they will meet.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:17.700
Yeah, for sure.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.330
They're both awesome.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:21.880
Thank you.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.400
JULIE WONG: I think we
have one last question.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:25.995
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:22:25.995 --> 00:22:27.950
So thank you, first off,
for doing the movie,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:30.470
giving us a reason
to go get drunk

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:33.590
and get all the weird
kind of awkward moms

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:37.520
from preschool together
and represent body moms.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.232
Thank you.

00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:39.440
KRISTEN BELL: Get some, girl.

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.620
AUDIENCE: Neurotic,
really organized.

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.230
I loved it.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:44.900
I was just curious
which pieces really

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:46.066
resonated the most with you.

00:22:46.066 --> 00:22:49.412
Like, if you could have
chosen the characters,

00:22:49.412 --> 00:22:50.870
would you have
chosen the character

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:51.911
that you got assigned to?

00:22:51.911 --> 00:22:52.610
MILA KUNIS: Yes.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:53.293
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:53.293 --> 00:22:54.510
MILA KUNIS: Without a-- yes.

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:55.010
Yes.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:57.890
I can go on a very
lengthy explanation

00:22:57.890 --> 00:23:03.030
as to why, but with the first
"Bad Moms," that was me.

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:04.970
I literally was like,
I had so much pressure

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:09.260
that I put on myself, not
anybody else, of everything

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.480
has to be perfect for
my kid, for my life.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:12.920
Everything-- I need to organize.

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:14.430
I need to figure this out.

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.100
I literally was going
crazy, because I

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:17.450
was like, what's a shower?

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:21.900
Like I forgot to take care
of myself so much so that I--

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:25.910
it was the most perfect therapy
session was doing this movie.

00:23:25.910 --> 00:23:28.850
Both of these films have been
like giant therapies for me.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.770
KATHRYN HAHN: I'd
say Carla is more

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.100
my spirit animal, like I wish.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.970
AUDIENCE: That's
actually reassuring.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.127
KATHRYN HAHN: Yeah, I wish.

00:23:36.127 --> 00:23:37.460
JULIE WONG: I think we all wish.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.750
KATHRYN HAHN: We got
a little inner inner.

00:23:38.750 --> 00:23:39.110
JULIE WONG: Oh, yeah.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:40.850
We all have some of her in us.

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:41.720
KRISTEN BELL: When
I first read--

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.370
Mila had this script,
and she called me,

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:44.540
and she was like,
read this script.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.849
You should do this with me.

00:23:45.849 --> 00:23:47.140
And I read it, and I was like--

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:47.460
MILA KUNIS: Bullied her.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.950
KRISTEN BELL: --this is so good.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.607
And I was like, maybe I
should play the bitchy one.

00:23:51.607 --> 00:23:53.440
Like I wanted to play
Chris-- remember this?

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.773
I want to play Christina's role.

00:23:54.773 --> 00:23:56.280
I was like, she's
so funny, and that

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.370
would be so cool, because
I could be super bitchy.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:00.230
And she's like, no,
no, no, you're Kiki.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.070
You're Kiki.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:02.110
You're Kiki.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.610
That's it.

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:04.050
And I was like, OK, cool.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:06.440
And then I realized,
that's such a Kiki thing

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.590
to do to be like, ooh,
maybe I can play the vixen.

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:13.456
And everyone would be like,
no, that's not your essence.

00:24:15.982 --> 00:24:18.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.740
Thanks for being
true to yourselves.

00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.740
JULIE WONG: Well, in closing,
on behalf of all the bad moms

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.500
at Google, I want to
thank you for portraying

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.500
the realities of being a
mom and giving us a reason

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.430
to have a moms' night out.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:33.940
So be sure to watch "A
Bad Moms Christmas" out

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.500
in theaters on November 1st.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.960
KATHRYN HAHN: I want a
micro kitchen 400 feet

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:40.190
from where I am at all times.

00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:41.160
That's the best idea.

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:41.760
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:42.660
JULIE WONG: I'm
learning on the loo.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.785
KATHRYN HAHN: I'm obsessed.

00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:49.010
JULIE WONG: Thank you so much.
