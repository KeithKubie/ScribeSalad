00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.480
Now that we have some sense of what things are slightly different and

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.730
more complicated and we need to be concerned with geographic data,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.840
even with something as fundamental as the file type,

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.290
we're going to start building our map step by step in D3.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.770
As you can see here,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.836
the familiar skeleton of code that we've always started with.

00:00:20.836 --> 00:00:28.230
Here is our function named draw that takes a single argument geo_data, named, so

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.560
because this function's actually going to get passed our GeoJSON at the bottom.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.980
Notice, rather than loading our TSV of World Cup data,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.970
we're simply loading world_countries.json,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.930
a GeoJSON file that contains the outlines of all the countries.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.480
Since we are displaying a map of the entire world,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.470
there are ready GeoJSON data files for many common geographies.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.890
The most common being the entire world and the US.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.368
So I was able to find a GeoJSON of all the world countries online.

00:01:02.368 --> 00:01:06.020
If a GeoJSON file does not already exist of the region you would like to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.990
visualize you can use a few different utilities to convert

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.300
shape files into GeoJSON.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.570
There's a few resources and

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.670
tutorials in the instructor notes of this video, which can show you how.
