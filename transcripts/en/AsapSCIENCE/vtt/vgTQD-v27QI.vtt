00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.549
On a night out while looking for love, there
is nothing like having the support of a friend.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:09.630
Known sometimes as a wingman or wingwoman,
the term originates from fighter jet pilots,

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.030
where the wingman's job is to support and
protect the leading pilot. This same dynamic

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.650
is applied when a friend needs support approaching
potential partners. But what is the science

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.280
behind this strategy - and do wingmen actually
work?

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.390
First things first - you look better in a
group than you do on your own. One study had

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.440
participants evaluate pictures of 300 people
and found that faces were significantly more

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.650
attractive when they were shown in a group
photo compared to the same faces shown on

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.510
their own. Another good tactic a squad can
use is that of a Wild turkey. Wild Turkeys

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.070
attract mates in a “coalition” where one
turkey is “dominant” and the other turkey’s

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.240
are “helpers”. These helper turkey’s
wear less colourful plumage - making the dominant

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.400
one look like a better catch. And this strategy
almost doubles the reproductive success compared

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.230
to those turkeys who ride solo.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.160
Even male fireflies work together to attract
ladies! Fireflies use bioluminescent flashes

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.080
to signal a mate. And when male fireflies
synchronize their flashes, females responded

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.450
82% of the time, compared to 3% of the time
with asynchronous flashes. So maybe it’s

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.909
time for your squad to think of a co-ordinated
dance?

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:21.260
Especially if you’re the wingman to a lance-tailed
manakin. Males of this species team up in

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.940
pairs, performing intricate dances - including
leaping over one another. But within the group

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.431
there is an alpha and a beta - and the beta
never gets lucky. So why be a wingman? A study

00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:38.400
that tracked and analyzed DNA of 457 birds
found that beta birds, after learning from

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.320
the Alpha’s, had a better chance of becoming
an alpha the following year.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.850
These strategies are often used among males
- but what about females? Across cultures,

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.299
human women tend to be more selective or choosy
than men when it comes to partnerships though

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.070
significant variation does exists among sexes.
After all, females expend more resources in

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.720
pregnancy, making it important that they choose
a partner more selectively. When asked to

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.340
describe their courtship strategies, interestingly,
women were actually more likely to use cooperative

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.609
techniques than men, but these techniques
were used to avoid partners where there was

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:15.389
no romantic interest. Again this certainly
varies from person to person, and these studies

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.010
also only focused on heterosexual behaviour.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.279
How far will your squad go for you? Are they
willing to lie? It turns out the closer relationship

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.639
you have with someone the more likely you
are to lie to make them look good. This is

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.760
why going out with your best friends to the
bar can help boost your image.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.790
Looking for love or a fling while in the company
of friends is fun and often effective. Just

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.700
remember that finding romance doesn’t need
to be a strategic game where you have to “trick”

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.879
someone - if you just be yourself you are
more likely to find someone who likes you

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:43.879
for you.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.549
