we do our online and are working on

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719
we do our online and are working on
 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:13.390
we do our online and are working on
social networks and are working off of

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400
social networks and are working off of
 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.420
social networks and are working off of
microtransactions and you end up having

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430
microtransactions and you end up having
 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.300
microtransactions and you end up having
to think about these things and it's

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310
to think about these things and it's
 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.620
to think about these things and it's
it's a very curious space it's a space

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630
it's a very curious space it's a space
 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.200
it's a very curious space it's a space
that we're all kind of finding our way

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210
that we're all kind of finding our way
 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.600
that we're all kind of finding our way
in and kind of learning learning how it

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:28.610
in and kind of learning learning how it
 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.990
in and kind of learning learning how it
works there's some basic things that we

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000
works there's some basic things that we
 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.630
works there's some basic things that we
we certainly know i mean the a lot of

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640
we certainly know i mean the a lot of
 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.220
we certainly know i mean the a lot of
people assume that oh i'll create some

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230
people assume that oh i'll create some
 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.900
people assume that oh i'll create some
kind of virtual economy and like people

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910
kind of virtual economy and like people
 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.190
kind of virtual economy and like people
will spend money on it but that's

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200
will spend money on it but that's
 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.930
will spend money on it but that's
certainly not true what you have to do

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940
certainly not true what you have to do
 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.490
certainly not true what you have to do
is you have to create a situation where

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500
is you have to create a situation where
 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.400
is you have to create a situation where
people are going to want to put money in

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410
people are going to want to put money in
 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.730
people are going to want to put money in
so you have to find a way that people

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:51.740
so you have to find a way that people
 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:54.040
so you have to find a way that people
are going to feel invested and if you

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050
are going to feel invested and if you
 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.830
are going to feel invested and if you
look at the way a lot of the successful

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840
look at the way a lot of the successful
 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.660
look at the way a lot of the successful
online games are created particularly

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670
online games are created particularly
 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.670
online games are created particularly
the free ones they create a situation

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680
the free ones they create a situation
 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.130
the free ones they create a situation
where they work hard to get you

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140
where they work hard to get you
 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.800
where they work hard to get you
psychologically invested and then they

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810
psychologically invested and then they
 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.010
psychologically invested and then they
they find exactly the appropriate time

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020
they find exactly the appropriate time
 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.610
they find exactly the appropriate time
to kind of say you know this game could

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620
to kind of say you know this game could
 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.290
to kind of say you know this game could
be a little better if you would just put

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300
be a little better if you would just put
 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.030
be a little better if you would just put
five bucks in or you would just put ten

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040
five bucks in or you would just put ten
 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.370
five bucks in or you would just put ten
dollars in or maybe they'll even mask it

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:18.380
dollars in or maybe they'll even mask it
 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.870
dollars in or maybe they'll even mask it
if you would just contribute you know

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880
if you would just contribute you know
 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.490
if you would just contribute you know
eight facebook credits that kind of

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500
eight facebook credits that kind of
 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.130
eight facebook credits that kind of
thing then you could suddenly get this

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140
thing then you could suddenly get this
 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.149
thing then you could suddenly get this
make this better so it's it's okay and

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159
make this better so it's it's okay and
 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.100
make this better so it's it's okay and
we're not used to this as game designers

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110
we're not used to this as game designers
 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:31.510
we're not used to this as game designers
game designers are used to we're going

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520
game designers are used to we're going
 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.910
game designers are used to we're going
to make the best game possible and we're

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920
to make the best game possible and we're
 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:34.990
to make the best game possible and we're
going to want people to know about it

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000
going to want people to know about it
 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.310
going to want people to know about it
because they're going to pay upfront and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320
because they're going to pay upfront and
 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.140
because they're going to pay upfront and
then we're going to deliver a game that

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150
then we're going to deliver a game that
 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.160
then we're going to deliver a game that
they think is great we don't have to

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170
they think is great we don't have to
 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.109
they think is great we don't have to
think about that anymore but now it's

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119
think about that anymore but now it's
 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.539
think about that anymore but now it's
like we're all designing you know the

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549
like we're all designing you know the
 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.090
like we're all designing you know the
point of purchase display at walmart

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100
point of purchase display at walmart
 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.500
point of purchase display at walmart
right and we're trying to figure out

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510
right and we're trying to figure out
 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.960
right and we're trying to figure out
what how do we position the racks of gum

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970
what how do we position the racks of gum
 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.609
what how do we position the racks of gum
that's going to make people buy more

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619
that's going to make people buy more
 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.440
that's going to make people buy more
than one pack of gum you know and that's

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450
than one pack of gum you know and that's
 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.630
than one pack of gum you know and that's
that ends up being how you have to think

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640
that ends up being how you have to think
 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.700
that ends up being how you have to think
about it so very often now one of the

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710
about it so very often now one of the
 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.580
about it so very often now one of the
big changes is we design games around a

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590
big changes is we design games around a
 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.840
big changes is we design games around a
psychological moment where people are

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850
psychological moment where people are
 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.730
psychological moment where people are
willing to spend money and we figure

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740
willing to spend money and we figure
 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.649
willing to spend money and we figure
well how do we kind of make that moment

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:08.659
well how do we kind of make that moment
 

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:10.409
well how do we kind of make that moment
is exciting and engaging as possible

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:10.419
is exciting and engaging as possible
 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.699
is exciting and engaging as possible
it's we're not used to that we're used

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709
it's we're not used to that we're used
 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.280
it's we're not used to that we're used
to kind of having fun be at the core but

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290
to kind of having fun be at the core but
 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.250
to kind of having fun be at the core but
now fund

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260
now fund
 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.320
now fund
is at the core and we have to kind of

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
is at the core and we have to kind of
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
is at the core and we have to kind of
build out that way which is which is

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
build out that way which is which is
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.370
build out that way which is which is
very different

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380
 
 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.530
 
what's going to happen with virtual

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540
what's going to happen with virtual
 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.140
what's going to happen with virtual
currencies is is is interesting I mean

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150
currencies is is is interesting I mean
 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.060
currencies is is is interesting I mean
because the advertising folks just like

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070
because the advertising folks just like
 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.400
because the advertising folks just like
everybody else are really kind of trying

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410
everybody else are really kind of trying
 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.480
everybody else are really kind of trying
to struggle to figure out what is this

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490
to struggle to figure out what is this
 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.880
to struggle to figure out what is this
new digital media mean an interactive

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890
new digital media mean an interactive
 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.760
new digital media mean an interactive
advertising is problematic right because

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770
advertising is problematic right because
 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.760
advertising is problematic right because
when you say here's an advertisement now

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770
when you say here's an advertisement now
 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.020
when you say here's an advertisement now
you can interact with it your first

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030
you can interact with it your first
 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.540
you can interact with it your first
interaction is make it go away right

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550
interaction is make it go away right
 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.710
interaction is make it go away right
because you don't want advertising

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720
because you don't want advertising
 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.330
because you don't want advertising
that's the whole point of advertising is

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340
that's the whole point of advertising is
 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.430
that's the whole point of advertising is
you don't want it and so advertisers are

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440
you don't want it and so advertisers are
 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.160
you don't want it and so advertisers are
going to realize the incredible power

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170
going to realize the incredible power
 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.950
going to realize the incredible power
that the the ways they can tap into

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:02.960
that the the ways they can tap into
 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.530
that the the ways they can tap into
these virtual economies as we become

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540
these virtual economies as we become
 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.240
these virtual economies as we become
more and more connected right now people

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250
more and more connected right now people
 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.220
more and more connected right now people
think that these virtual economies they

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230
think that these virtual economies they
 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:10.780
think that these virtual economies they
think of them that they're isolated and

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790
think of them that they're isolated and
 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.580
think of them that they're isolated and
that they're off somewhere but

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590
that they're off somewhere but
 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.010
that they're off somewhere but
everyone's going to start to realize

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020
everyone's going to start to realize
 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.100
everyone's going to start to realize
that it's just you know information on

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110
that it's just you know information on
 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.100
that it's just you know information on
the internet and if you want to give me

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110
the internet and if you want to give me
 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.250
the internet and if you want to give me
a hundred gold if I buy a 24-pack of

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260
a hundred gold if I buy a 24-pack of
 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.520
a hundred gold if I buy a 24-pack of
coca-cola at the grocery store you could

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530
coca-cola at the grocery store you could
 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.380
coca-cola at the grocery store you could
do that now there's like no

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390
do that now there's like no
 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.960
do that now there's like no
technological barrier to keep you from

technological barrier to keep you from
doing that the grocery store already has
