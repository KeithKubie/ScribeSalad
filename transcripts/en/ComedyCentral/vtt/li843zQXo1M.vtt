00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.801
My opponent tonight
is Karamo Brown,

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:04.170
one of the stars
of the Netflix show,<i> Queer Eye.</i>

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:06.439
If he thinks he's going
to get me to cry tonight,

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:08.908
he's gonna have
to dig real deep.

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:10.643
Or just mention my dad.

00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:12.178
Karamo Brown, everybody.

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:14.681
-Hey! -Karamo, welcome. Welcome.
-(cheering and applause)

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.784
-So, your father...
-Please, don't...

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.452
-Can we... can we wait?
Can we wait? -Okay. We'll wait.

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:20.586
We'll wait,
we'll wait, we'll wait.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.921
But do you know something?
Does he love me?

00:00:21.954 --> 00:00:23.322
I do.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.924
-We will get to that.
-Okay, okay.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:26.926
-'Cause that's a Pandora's box,
all right? -Yes.

00:00:26.959 --> 00:00:29.462
And that she-devil's box,
you do not want to open.

00:00:29.495 --> 00:00:31.464
-I want to talk about your show.
-Yes.

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:34.067
<i> Queer Eye.</i> Now, the Fab Five,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.135
uh, you shoot a lot of this
in Georgia,

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:38.071
-which is a red state.
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:41.207
Is this goal of this show
transforming Trump's America

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.276
to become more liberal?
Is that your end goal?

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.078
No!

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:46.546
-Okay, that...
-Okay. (laughs)

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.215
No, our-our goal
is definitely not to change, uh,

00:00:49.248 --> 00:00:51.617
you know, the red states pink,
you know?

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.953
We just want to make sure
that they open their hearts

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.155
-a little bit. -So you-you w...
you're going out there

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:58.424
-to try to change parts
of America. -Yeah.

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:00.760
Well, no, we're not trying
to change parts of America.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:03.763
We're trying to make people
feel better about who they are

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:05.565
so that, hopefully,
they'll change themselves.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:07.100
How do you have the hard
conversation with yourself

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:08.701
so you can have a hard
conversation with other people?

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.303
How<i> do</i> you have a hard
conversation with yourself?

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:11.504
Well, let's start
with your father.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:13.039
-Please, okay, let's...
That was... -Okay?

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:15.441
How do<i> you</i> have a
hard conversation with<i> yourself?</i>

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.710
-We start with<i> my</i> father.
-You start with your...

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:19.779
-It-it all starts there.
-It starts from the top down.

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:22.048
-Yeah. Uh-huh. -You-you are...
You cover culture.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:24.183
-Yes. -Now, that's something
I've never been that into.

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:26.519
-(laughs) -What do you mean...
When you walk in there

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:28.521
with a focus on culture,
what are you talking about?

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.656
So, culture is actually
a misleading title, you know?

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.325 line:0%
My goal is actually to fix
the inside.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:34.327 line:0%
My background is in social work,
psychotherapy.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.662 line:0%
So it's all about figuring out
what's blocking you

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:38.998 line:0%
and what's stopping you
from talking to people

00:01:39.031 --> 00:01:40.199 line:0%
or being curious about life.

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.001
And that's where,
really, my goal is.

00:01:42.034 --> 00:01:43.469
That's why you see the tears.
It's...

00:01:43.502 --> 00:01:45.004
I break them down on the inside.

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:46.873
How do... how<i> do</i> you make
somebody... how...

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:49.475
-Now,<i> that's</i> something
I'm interested in. -Yeah, okay.

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:52.211
How do you break a person down
from the inside?

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.614
-Exactly.
-How<i> do</i> you get at the tears?

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.149
How-how do you make somebody
cry?

00:01:56.182 --> 00:01:57.750
I've just been watching
Republicans all week,

00:01:57.783 --> 00:01:59.819
-so that's how I usually do it.
Yeah. -Yes, yes?

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:01.554
I just follow their format.
Yeah.

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:04.157
'Cause I have been crying
since this election started.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.692
-There's been a lot of tears
on television. -Yes, definitely.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:08.494
Well, stuff has shifted.
The... Uh,<i> Queer Eye</i>

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:10.630
<i> -for the Straight Guy</i> 
started in 2003. -Yes.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.899
<i> -Queer Eye</i> is now
15 years later. -Uh-huh.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.167
Well, how is this show
different?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.301
How is it approached
differently?

00:02:15.334 --> 00:02:16.569
How have times changed,
in that sense?

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.838
Um, well...
How have times changed?

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:20.907
-Well, there was a Bush
in office the first time. -Yeah.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.509
Now there's a-an ass in office.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:25.511
-So, yeah. -We've made...
we've made America great again.

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:28.114
Uh... (stammers)
Perspective, right?

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.982
-Sure. -I think what
we're really trying to hope

00:02:30.015 --> 00:02:31.384
and trying to figure out, like,

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:33.920
why do you all keep trying
to change everything, you know?

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:35.788
I liked the country
we had beforehand.

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:37.790
And I think
what we want people to see

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.526
is that there's a beauty in
the country that was here once

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:42.328
-and we don't need to change it.
-There's been

00:02:42.361 --> 00:02:44.530
-some interesting moments on
your show as well. -Yes. Yeah.

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:47.200
-Uh, there was one
when you were in Georgia, -Yes.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:49.869
uh, and-and you had a sit-down
with a police officer.

00:02:49.902 --> 00:02:51.204
What's happen...
what happened there?

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.806
Well, he is a Trump supporter,
a police officer,

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:56.409
and we had a very transparent
conversation about what it is

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:59.345
to be a black man, for me,
a gay man in America,

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:01.280
with the militarization
of police officers.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.416
And it was really beautiful,
because two people

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.618
who normally don't have
a dialogue came together

00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:07.954
and found common ground
in the fact that we are fathers,

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:09.555
in the fact
that we are proud Americans,

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:12.024
in the fact that we want to see
our country be the best

00:03:12.057 --> 00:03:14.093
-that it can be. -Why do you
think people are being draw...

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.696
uh, drawn to<i> Queer Eye?</i> It's had
a lot of popularity recently.

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.232
Uh, what is it about the show
that sticks out

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:20.900
that people want to watch?

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:23.903
Uh, as... I-I'm... I wish
you could tell me months ago,

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:26.372
-uh, what that secret could be.
Uh... -(laughing)

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.774
But what do you...
what do you think the nugget is

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:30.710
inside of a show like that,

00:03:30.743 --> 00:03:32.578
-where people would tune in
regularly? -It's-it's funny,

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.847
-'cause I tune in regularly
to you, so... -I'll take that.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.016
-I'll take... -You actually have
it all. It's the good hair,

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.152
good clothes, pretty eyes,
and being open to America.

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:43.289
-This is... this is... Y...
-(cheering and applause)

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:44.824
Are you crying?

00:03:44.857 --> 00:03:47.093
So, that message
was actually from your father.

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:49.428
I see... Oh, don't...
Karamo, you be careful.

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:51.764
-I s... I see your wicked ways.
-Yes. Exactly.

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:53.633
Why do you think
this resonates in 2018?

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.901
Really, it's because, uh,
we're at a time right now

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:58.037
where a lot of people feel
very divided and disconnected.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.172
They don't feel like people are
talking to each other anymore.

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:02.241
And this is an opportunity
for people to realize

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.043
that we're more alike
than we are different.

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:05.845
And that's what's most important
in all of this.

00:04:05.878 --> 00:04:08.514
-You're political also outside
the show. -I am. Very political.

00:04:08.547 --> 00:04:11.584
-Wha-What are your passions?
-Um, my passions vary

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.853
from comprehensive
gun control...

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:17.056
I was a-a graduate of,
uh, Marjory Stoneman Douglas

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:19.058
in Parkland, Florida.
I'm also a father.

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:22.128
And to see these children die
at the hands of guns,

00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:24.397
it's not about taking guns away
from Americans--

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.898
it's about
how can we work together

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:28.034
-to protect our children. -Do
you have political aspirations?

00:04:28.067 --> 00:04:30.469
Um, you know what,
I-I would say this.

00:04:30.502 --> 00:04:33.673
Ronald Reagan was, you know,
a Californian man,

00:04:33.706 --> 00:04:35.675
and he also was president.

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:39.011
Trump was a reality star,
and he's president.

00:04:39.044 --> 00:04:41.180
I don't know.
Maybe one day, you know,

00:04:41.213 --> 00:04:44.317
there could be a gay,
black governor of California.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.286
(cheering and applause)

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.324
Could that be the change
America needs?

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:53.492
You think Californians
would vote for a liberal?

00:04:53.525 --> 00:04:55.695
(laughing)

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.096
Tell me something
I already know.

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.632
Um, that Donald Trump

00:04:59.665 --> 00:05:02.034
is probably the greatest
magician we have ever seen.

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:04.704
That sleight of hand-- he tricks
you over here and says,

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:06.305
"Look, I'm changing immigration.

00:05:06.338 --> 00:05:08.574
"I'm gonna repeal
what I just done with all...

00:05:08.607 --> 00:05:10.076
"tearing apart
all these families,

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:12.345
"while I'm also pulling us out
of the U.N.

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.080
and, um, the human rights."

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:15.815
And so I think that's something

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:17.216
that we should
really be focusing on

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:18.617
is that this greatest magician

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.553
is trying to pull the wool
over our eyes.

00:05:20.586 --> 00:05:22.555
And we now know there's a man
behind the curtain,

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:23.823
and we're not gonna take it
anymore.

00:05:23.856 --> 00:05:25.891
He shows you the big hand,

00:05:25.924 --> 00:05:27.626
-he grabs you with the other.
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.762
I hear that.
A new season of<i> Queer Eye</i>

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.898
is now available on Netflix.
