00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:02.167
- What I want to do in this video

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:06.016
is find the arc length of one petal,

00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:07.712
I guess we could call it,

00:00:07.712 --> 00:00:12.712
of the graph of r is equal
to four sine of two theta.

00:00:13.092 --> 00:00:16.529
So I want to find the length
of this portion of the curve

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.520
that is in red right over here.

00:00:18.931 --> 00:00:21.280
We'll do this in two phases.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.017
First of all I want to set
up the definite integral

00:00:23.017 --> 00:00:26.437
for finding that arc length,
and then we'll evaluate it.

00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:28.092
I'll actually use a
calculator to evaluate it

00:00:28.092 --> 00:00:30.124
because it'll be a little
bit more straightforward

00:00:30.124 --> 00:00:32.179
at least for this integral.

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.060
Let's just start with that.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.274
I encourage you to pause the video.

00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:37.831
Knowing what we know about
the formula for arc length,

00:00:37.831 --> 00:00:39.203
when we have it in polar form,

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:41.895
see if you can apply it to
figure out this arc length

00:00:41.895 --> 00:00:43.303
right over here.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.170
I'm assuming you've had a go at it,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.653
so let's remind ourselves
that the arc length

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:53.223
is going to be the integral
from our starting angle

00:00:53.223 --> 00:00:56.454
to our ending angle, we'll
call it from alpha to beta,

00:00:56.454 --> 00:01:01.454
of the square root of the
derivative of our function.

00:01:06.668 --> 00:01:11.668
Which respect to theta squared,
plus our function squared.

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:17.027
Plus our function squared d theta.

00:01:17.904 --> 00:01:19.563
Let's figure out what r prime of theta

00:01:19.563 --> 00:01:21.806
and what r of theta actually are.

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:24.127
I'll color code it.

00:01:24.127 --> 00:01:28.716
R prime of theta, we
know what r of theta is

00:01:28.716 --> 00:01:30.688
let me just rewrite it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We know r of theta is equal
to four sine of two theta.

00:01:42.448 --> 00:01:47.448
Our prime of theta is just
going to be derivative

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.290
of two theta with respect
to theta is two times four

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.290
is eight, derivative of sine
is cosine, cosine of two theta.

00:01:57.682 --> 00:02:01.515
If we wanted to write the
definite integral for arc length

00:02:01.515 --> 00:02:05.966
it's going to be equal
to the definite integral.

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:08.021
What's our starting bound?

00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:09.340
For the petal that we care about,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.023
we're going to start at
an angle of zero radians.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.597
When we have an angle of
zero radians, r is zero,

00:02:16.597 --> 00:02:18.662
that's this point right over here.

00:02:19.016 --> 00:02:20.599
We're going to start at zero radians.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.703
And we're going to go all
the way up to pi over two.

00:02:23.703 --> 00:02:27.680
When sine of two times pi
over two is sine of pi,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.094
which is zero, so we'll
get back to this point

00:02:30.124 --> 00:02:31.558
right over here.

00:02:31.558 --> 00:02:34.337
We're going to go from
zero to pi over two,

00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:36.921
to pi over two radians.

00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:39.550
It's going to be the square root of,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.665
give myself some real estate here,

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:46.665
r prime of theta squared is
going to be this thing squared.

00:02:47.522 --> 00:02:50.242
It's going to be 60--

00:02:50.356 --> 00:02:52.236
Let me do it in that same blue color,

00:02:52.948 --> 00:02:57.948
it's going to be 64 cosine
squared of two theta,

00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:06.426
then plus this squared
which is going to be

00:03:07.076 --> 00:03:12.076
16 sine squared of two theta,

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:15.690
then of course we have our d theta.

00:03:17.942 --> 00:03:21.077
You can attempt to solve this
or evaluate this analytically,

00:03:21.077 --> 00:03:22.907
it's not too straightforward

00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:24.518
so I'm going to use a calculator.

00:03:24.518 --> 00:03:25.812
It just gives us a
practice with knowing that

00:03:25.812 --> 00:03:27.562
hey, there are tools out
there that can help us

00:03:27.562 --> 00:03:29.023
do these types of things.

00:03:29.472 --> 00:03:31.623
I'll go to the definite integral,

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:34.143
I'll go to second calculus on my t 85,

00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:37.192
I picked this choice, which
is for the definite integral.

00:03:38.868 --> 00:03:41.350
Let me express when I'm taking
the definite integral of,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.350
it's going to be the square root of 64

00:03:48.241 --> 00:03:52.330
times cosine of two theta squared.

00:03:54.273 --> 00:03:56.443
I'm going to use x instead of theta

00:03:56.443 --> 00:03:58.245
just because it's an easier variable

00:03:58.245 --> 00:03:59.990
to use on my calculator.

00:04:00.131 --> 00:04:02.378
Cosine of two--

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:05.483
Actually let me make sure
my parenthesis are good.

00:04:05.483 --> 00:04:10.483
Cosine of two x, alright I'll close that.

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:16.286
Now I want to square that.

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:18.930
I did that first part.

00:04:19.187 --> 00:04:22.539
Plus 16 times

00:04:22.847 --> 00:04:25.072
plus 16

00:04:25.072 --> 00:04:26.549
times

00:04:26.918 --> 00:04:29.097
16 times

00:04:29.574 --> 00:04:34.574
sine of two x.

00:04:34.877 --> 00:04:37.024
Close that, close that.

00:04:37.024 --> 00:04:38.738
Squared.

00:04:40.231 --> 00:04:42.772
I'm not sure if the calculator
knows to interpret that

00:04:42.772 --> 00:04:46.193
as multiplication, so let me
insert a times right over here.

00:04:46.193 --> 00:04:49.998
64 times cosine of two
x, that thing squared.

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:53.608
Plus 16 times sine of two
x, that thing squared.

00:04:54.247 --> 00:04:56.111
Let me go to the end.

00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.680
Let me close my radical,

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.711
so that's going to close
that right over there,

00:05:05.711 --> 00:05:08.019
that closes what I'm
taking the square root of.

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:11.746
Then comma, the variable
that I'm integrating

00:05:11.746 --> 00:05:14.156
with respect to is x, in this case.

00:05:14.156 --> 00:05:15.371
Everywhere I saw theta here

00:05:15.371 --> 00:05:17.329
I'm just replacing with an x there.

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:21.298
I want to do it from,
instead of theta equals zero

00:05:21.298 --> 00:05:22.705
to theta equals pi over two,

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:27.705
we'll say x is equal to zero
to x is equal to pi over two.

00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:33.367
Hopefully I have not made a
mistake when I've typed this in,

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:35.969
And I get...

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.712
It's chugging on a little bit.

00:05:40.408 --> 00:05:42.494
And we get...

00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:44.711
Will it actually come up?

00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:45.941
Oh finally!

00:05:46.024 --> 00:05:49.139
If we were to round it
to the nearest thousandth

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.754
it'll be nine point six eight eight.

00:05:54.342 --> 00:05:58.582
Approximately nine point six eight eight.

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:01.950
Let's just see, does that
make intuitive sense?

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:05.950
It goes as far as four away,

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:09.755
so if you just went out
to four and then back down

00:06:09.755 --> 00:06:11.442
that would be about eight.

00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:13.607
Of course we have actually gone out some,

00:06:13.607 --> 00:06:15.985
so it actually makes intuitive
sense that this arc length

00:06:15.985 --> 00:06:19.495
would be nine point six eight eight.

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:21.653
Hopefully you enjoyed that.
