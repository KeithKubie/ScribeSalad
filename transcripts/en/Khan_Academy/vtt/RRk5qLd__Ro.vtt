00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.630
We've got 6,798 minus 3,359.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.890
So let's see how far we can
get with the subtraction.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.026
So immediately, when we
go into the ones place,

00:00:12.026 --> 00:00:13.900
we're going to try to
subtract a 9 from an 8.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.250
So we immediately reach a
little bit of a stumbling block.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.000
And to see what our options are
here in terms of regrouping,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.050
I'm going to rewrite
both of these numbers.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.290
So I'm going to rewrite
6,798 literally.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.950
So this is equal to 6,000.

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.800
That's this right over here.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:45.990
That's 6,000, plus
700, plus 90, plus 8.

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.110
Minus all of this.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.630
So I could subtract
each of the places.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:59.447
So I could say this is
going to be minus 3,000

00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:10.046
minus 300 minus 50--
a 5 in a tens place

00:01:10.046 --> 00:01:12.190
is just 50-- minus 9.

00:01:16.336 --> 00:01:18.826
So here, we're just
explicitly showing

00:01:18.826 --> 00:01:20.340
what those place
values represent.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.480
A 6 in the thousands
place is 6,000.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.992
A 3 in the hundreds
place is 300.

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:26.200
Let's go back to our problem.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.350
We wanted to subtract
a 9 from an 8.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.437
Well, that's a little
bit of a stumbling block.

00:01:30.437 --> 00:01:33.020
But what if we could take some
of the value from some of these

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.330
and give it to the 8?

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.970
In particular, we could go
one place value up to the 90.

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.830
And what if we were to
take 10 from the 90?

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.790
So let's do that.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.930
If we were to take 10 from
the 90, then 90 becomes 80.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.607
But we don't want to change
the value of the entire number.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.350
So we're going to give
that 10 to this 8.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.740
We're essentially
regrouping right over here.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.790
And then that 8
can become an 18.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.030
Notice, I did not change
the value of the number.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.280
I just essentially changed
how I represented it.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.360
Instead of saying it's 6,000
plus 700 plus 90 plus 8,

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.170
I'm just saying that it's
6,000 plus 700 plus 80 plus 18.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.320
Those are both going
to give you 6,798.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.010
But now it becomes
a little bit easier

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.327
for us to actually subtract.

00:02:19.327 --> 00:02:26.270
Now, if we subtract, I have
18 minus 9, which is 9.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.160
I have 80-- not 90, now.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.700
I have 80 minus 50, which is 30.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.190
And these are all positive,
so this is plus 9.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.540
This is a positive 30.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.740
80 minus 50 is 30.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.030
I have 700 minus
300, which is 400.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.970
And I have 6,000 minus
3,000, which is 3,000.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.470
So this is literally going to be
3,000 plus 400 plus 30 plus 9,

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.160
or 3,439.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.829
Now, how would you
do it if you didn't

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.120
want to write it out like this?

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.536
And this is where you'll see
a kind of shorthand notation.

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:03.510
This is often called borrowing.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.620
So you say, look, I've got
an 8 in the ones place.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.760
I want to take a
10 from this 90.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.056
So it's going to become an 80.

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:15.680
But we'll just write it as an 8
because it's in the tens place.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.890
This 8 represents the 80.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.220
And I'm going to give
that 10 to the ones place.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.480
So 10 plus 8 is 18.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.870
And now you can subtract.

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.030
18 minus 9 is 9.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.350
8 minus 5 is 3.

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.610
7 minus 3 is 4.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.390
6 minus 3 is 3-- 3,439.
