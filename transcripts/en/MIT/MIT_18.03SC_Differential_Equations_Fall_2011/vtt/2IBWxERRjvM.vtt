00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:07.340
PROFESSOR: So today
we're going to take

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.020
a look at sinusoidal functions.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:11.900
And specifically, we're
going to use complex numbers

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.250
to get a handle on
sinusoidal functions.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.810
The reason is complex
numbers provide

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.820
a robust way of analyzing
sinusoidal functions.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.690
So specifically, we're
interested in this function,

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.017
e to the i*omega*t
divided by 2 plus 3i.

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:28.600
And we're asked to
write the real part

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:34.150
of this function using polar
form and then rectangular form.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.350
And then secondly, we're
asked several properties

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.250
of this function, the real
part of this function.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.240
What's the circular frequency?

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.150
What's the amplitude?

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.390
And what's the phase lag?

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.990
And then lastly, we're asked
to sketch the real part

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:50.310
of this function versus time.

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.069
So I'll let you take a look at
this and try it for yourself.

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:54.360
And I'll come back in a moment.

00:01:07.912 --> 00:01:09.070
Hi everyone.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.161
Welcome back.

00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:10.660
OK.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.910
So let's take a look
at this problem.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:19.120
So we're asked to write e to
i*omega*t divided by 2 plus 3i.

00:01:21.254 --> 00:01:23.420
We're asked to write the
real part of this function,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.264
using polar form and then
also rectangular form.

00:01:26.264 --> 00:01:27.930
So I'll first start
off with polar form.

00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:36.340
And if we take a look
at this function,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.020
we see that the numerator is
already written in polar form.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.720
So just recall that polar
form is of the form r e

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.680
to the i*theta.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.100
Meanwhile, the denominator
is written in Cartesian form,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.040
or rectangular form.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.240
So we need to convert
this into polar form.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.710
So what we can do is
we can write 2 plus 3i.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.470
We can combine these
two into a modulus.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.720
And the modulus is going
to be the square root of 2

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.825
squared plus 3 squared.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.890
So this is the modulus
of the complex number.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.660
And then we have e to the i*phi.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:35.390
And the angle phi we can deduce
by writing a triangle, which

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.650
is over to the
right by two units,

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.830
and then it's up two units.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.590
And this is the angle phi.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:52.410
So we see from the triangle
that the tangent of phi

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.080
is equal to 3/2.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.850
OK.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:06.910
So putting the pieces together,
we have e to the i*omega*t

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.286
divided by root 13 e to i*phi.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.700
And the beautiful
thing about polar form

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.790
is that when we
divide and multiply

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.634
these complex
exponentials, it just

00:03:24.634 --> 00:03:27.050
turns into a simple addition
or subtraction of the phases.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:41.750
So we have 1 over root 13, e
to the i*omega*t minus phi.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.360
So we've successfully
combined all the terms

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.090
into one polar term.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.590
And then now we're asked
to compute the real part.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.940
And here we use Euler's formula.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.680
So just to recall
Euler's formula,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.011
we have e to the i theta.

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:11.380
Then this is equal to cosine
theta plus i sine theta.

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.719
OK?

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.260
So at the end of the day, we're
interested in the real part--

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.970
and I'm going to
use this notation Re

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.450
with a curly bracket to
denote the real part-- of 1

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.480
over root 13.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.100
And I'll use Euler's formula on
e to the i*omega*t minus phi.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:49.540
So we have cosine omega*t minus
phi plus i sine omega*t minus

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:50.040
phi.

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.420
Sorry.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.275
1 over root 13 is multiplying
both the sine and the cosine.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.960
And we see that the second
term is purely imaginary.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.620
So when we take the real
part of a real number

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.054
plus an imaginary
number, we just

00:05:12.054 --> 00:05:14.220
are left with the real
number at the end of the day.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.860
So the answer we're looking
for is 1 over root 13 cosine

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:36.680
omega*t minus phi, where from
before phi is the arctangent

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.180
of 3/2.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.020
And phi can also be thought
of-- the angle being

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.011
between zero and pi over 2.

00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:49.510
OK.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.880
So this concludes the
polar form computation.

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.520
Secondly, we also have
to compute this using

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.180
a rectangular form calculation.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:13.970
So let's do the calculation
in rectangular form.

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.099
And for this, I'm going
to use Euler's formula

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:17.265
to expand out the numerator.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.590
So first, we want to take the
real part of the numerator is

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.850
cosine omega*T plus
i sine omega*t.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.380
The denominator was 2 plus 3i.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.720
And typically what
we want to do is

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.570
we want to turn the denominator
into an entirely real number.

00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:53.830
So what we do is we
multiply the top and bottom

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:01.210
by the complex conjugate
of the denominator.

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:03.280
So for example,
I have 2 plus 3i.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.280
So I'm going to multiply the
top and bottom by 2 minus 3i.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.170
OK.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.470
And when I do this, you'll
note that when we multiply out

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.490
2 plus 3i and 2 minus 3i we
have a difference of squares.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:27.690
So we're left with: 2 times 2
is 4, the cross terms cancel.

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.830
And then we have 3i
times negative 3i.

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:35.010
That's going to give us negative
9 i squared, which is plus 9.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:41.770
So the denominator is
going to be 4 plus 9.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.870
And then the numerator-- I'll
write out all the terms just

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:59.830
for completeness-- it'll be
2 times cosine omega*t plus 3

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.460
sine omega*t.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:14.810
And then now we have
some imaginary terms,

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:23.171
which are negative 3 cosine
omega*t and plus 2 sine

00:08:23.171 --> 00:08:23.670
omega*t.

00:08:26.426 --> 00:08:26.925
OK?

00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:35.690
But now we're going
to take the real part

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.100
of this complex function.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.059
And if we take a look
at it, this first term

00:08:41.059 --> 00:08:43.000
is entirely real.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.400
This second term
is entirely complex

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.120
because we're
multiplying by an i.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.050
So when we take the real
part, at the end of the day,

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:52.940
the second term is
going to drop out.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:07.230
So when the dust settles,
we have 1/13 2 times cosine

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:11.180
omega*t plus 3 sine omega*t.

00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:16.700
OK?

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:21.440
So this concludes Part A.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.800
For Part B, we're
asked several questions

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:34.040
about this sinusoidal function
when written in its real form,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.120
specifically, what's
the circular frequency.

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.100
And the circular frequency
is just the frequency

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:48.080
that this function
oscillates at.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.580
And we can get this from
looking at the rectangular form

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.360
or the polar form.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.350
And it's simply just
going to be omega.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.870
So note how this
function oscillates

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:01.980
with frequency omega.

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.575
Secondly, we're asked
about the amplitude.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.090
And if we take a look
at it, the amplitude

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:22.030
is a little tricky to get
from the rectangular form,

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:25.920
but it's completely apparent
from the polar form.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.010
So if we take a look
at the polar form,

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:33.000
we have 1 over root 13
cosine omega*t minus phi.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.340
And cosine oscillates
between plus 1 and minus 1.

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.260
So this function takes
on a maximum value

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:45.740
of plus 1 over root 13 and
a maximum negative value

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.150
of negative 1 over root 13.

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.560
So the amplitude
of this function

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.570
is just going to
be 1 over root 13.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:57.120
And then lastly, the phase lag.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.960
This is the angle
that the cosine

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.690
is picked up and shifted over.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:19.100
So again, we can get this
directly from the polar form.

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.240
Meanwhile, it's a
little less obvious

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.570
what this angle is when we take
a look at the rectangular form.

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.350
So in our case, the
phase lag is just

00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:34.420
going to be phi, which
is tan inverse 3/2.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.660
OK?

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.960
So this concludes Part B.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.310
And then lastly,
for Part C we're

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.395
just asked to
sketch this diagram.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:58.440
And again, the most direct
way at sketching this function

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.600
is through the polar form.

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.300
So I'll write time on this axis.

00:12:06.510 --> 00:12:13.120
And if we just recall that a
cosine might look something

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.710
like this.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:20.150
So this is a cosine function.

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:27.560
And in our case, we're looking
at plotting 1 over root 13

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.200
cosine omega*t minus phi.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.460
So we're interested
in a cosine which

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.450
has an amplitude
of 1 over root 13

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:44.160
and a maximum negative value
of minus 1 over root 13

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:49.170
whose frequency is omega.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:55.050
So there's a quick
way on finding zeros.

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:59.190
So if the zero of a regular
cosine is at pi over 2,

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:03.490
then if we have an angular
frequency of omega,

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:07.730
the zero here is going
to be pi over 2*omega.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.910
And this zero is going to
be at 3 pi over 2*omega.

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.950
And lastly, this
is not necessarily

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:18.970
the cosine of our function.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.770
Our function is this cosine.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:23.350
However it must be picked
up and shifted over

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.560
by some phase lag phi.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.970
So in our case, the function
we're actually looking for

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.080
is some shifted cosine,
which looks like this.

00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:47.865
And this distance here
is phi over omega.

00:13:51.772 --> 00:13:52.440
OK?

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.250
So this just gives us a quick
sketch of this function.

00:13:57.250 --> 00:14:01.840
And again, we note that we
were able to plot this using

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.850
the polar form very quickly.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.590
And the reason is because
the polar form gives us

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:11.320
the amplitude, the circular
frequency, and the phase lag.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.890
Whereas if we were
to take a look

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.860
at the equivalent
rectangular form,

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.720
it's a little less obvious.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.790
The rectangular form is actually
the sum of a sine and a cosine.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.320
And unless you can just add
sines and cosines in your head

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.810
very quickly, it's a
little less obvious

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.730
on how to come up
with this picture.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:28.360
OK.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.350
So just to summarize, we've
used complex functions

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:36.390
to analyze sinusoidal functions.

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:39.840
And we've used polar
form and rectangular form

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.210
to get a handle on
the complex functions.

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.810
And specifically,
complex functions

00:14:45.810 --> 00:14:50.220
are a very good way to
represent sinusoidal functions.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:52.590
And just to
reiterate, the reason

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:54.750
is that they contain
a lot of information

00:14:54.750 --> 00:15:00.710
that we can graphically
handle and turn into a sketch.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:04.380
So I'll just conclude there,
and I'll see you next time.
