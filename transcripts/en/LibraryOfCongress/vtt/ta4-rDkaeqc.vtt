&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, to
give you a little history

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.240
about this event first.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.800
You know, I'm a cartoonist,
and for me this, it's you know,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.640
with graphic novels it,
they've been seen as sort

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.200
of the kids' section
for a while, right.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.590
They got seen and, so my
job, part of it is to.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.700
Gene said the kindest
thing I've ever,

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.310
compliment I've ever
received I think.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.680
He called me a comics ninja.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.980
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes.t

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Which means we got
to sneak in and we got to, you know,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.950
it's an ongoing fight to bring
legitimacy to graphic novels

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.250
because they've earned it.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.950
As a kid I started cartooning
professionally when I was 12.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.350
I think it was to get attention,
and so I was constantly,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.650
you know, just going around.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.680
And my mom, just to get her
attention, I would do two things.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.980
I would take out a
harmonica and I would end up,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.510
I would walk up right
behind her and I would go.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.900
[ Harmonica ]

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.680
She would take me in the
corner, hand me drawing materials

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.600
and buy me all the cartoon
equipment I'd wanted.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.030
She said, please stop playing.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.040
[ Laughter ]

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.060
And that was the start of my
comics career, and that's why I'm

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.470
at the Washington Post today.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.020
Similarly, this event has its
own sort of auspicious beginning.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.560
Graphic Novel Pavilion,
this began really over beer

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.480
because there wasn't a
special graphic novel event

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.490
at the National Book Festival

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.550
until the website Brightest
Young Things said,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.050
hey you guys need graphic novels.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.400
They took them out for drinks.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.870
They liquored up the National Book
Festival, and kids don't do this

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.380
at home, but this is why
we have what we have.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.480
Anyway, so here's to
beer and bad harmonica.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.940
[ Laughter ]

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.380
So, let me tell you
about Gene Luen Yang.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.680
He's amazing.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.920
He started cartooning as well,
I believe about fifth grade.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.220
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You
were reading DC.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.820
You were reading Marvel.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.120
You had your favorites.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.000
Today, he's writing Superman,
so you can do one thing

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.510
as a kid and grow up and do it.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.510
Yeah, big hand for Superman.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.640
[ Applause ]

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.940
He did web comics.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.840
He, this led to his great
book, American Born Chinese,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.000
which was a National
Book Award finalist.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.350
He did Boxers and Saints, another
National Book Award finalist.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.290
Last year, the library here
named him the Youth Ambassador,

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.510
the Ambassador for Young
People's Literature.

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.680
So, you've spent a year travelling
to schools and being pelted

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.830
with questions, the toughest
crowds, and also last year,

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.510
he was named the Macarthur
Genius Grant winner recipient.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.780
[ Applause ]

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.190
So, tonight we will have Reuben
and Pulitzer Award winners.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.040
We'll have bestsellers, and we'll
have a bona fide genius with it,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.860
and as part of that, his new book.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.260
He has a series with Mike
Holmes and this is brilliant

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.530
because he blends puzzles
with comics,

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.900
and it's the Secret Coders series.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.430
So, you know, you should
get this signed by him.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.670
You should buy it any
way you can get it.

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.780
Travel to his home with
these books out front,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.730
and maybe you would
sign it, you know.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.760
So, I have some questions.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.060
So, what I want to
know from you Gene,

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.130
you've spent the past
year travelling

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.580
and you taught for 17 years or so.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.880
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I did.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You
were in schools.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.620
So you had to convince,
first of all,

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.260
you're doing comics on the side.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.240 position:56%
So, as a comics creator, you're
this rock star, were you a rock star

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.950
in the classroom to your kids?

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.320
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: No, no.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.680
Not at all.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.840
I started teaching in 1998.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.760
I taught high school
computer science for 17 years,

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.920 position:56%
and I remember the first few years
that I taught, on the very first day

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.470
of each of my classes,
I would tell my students

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.440
that I was also making
comic books at home.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.300
Because I thought that
that would make them think

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.660
that I was cool, and it did not.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.330
Back in the 90s, those
of you who were alive

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.230
and who loved comics might
remember this, but back in the 90s,

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.220
especially the late 90s,
nobody was reading comics.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.290
People were talking about how
we were about to see the death

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.650 position:56%
of the American comic book industry.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.860
Marvel Comics, I think, declared
bankruptcy around that time.

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:22.160
A lot of comic book
stores were shutting down.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.710
So, the students that were sitting

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.340
in my classroom just
didn't read comic books.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.700
I very quickly learned that I could
not use comics to make me cool,

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.070 position:56%
so I had to just keep them separate.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.000
So, for years, the way I lived was
I would teach high school by day,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.600
and I would draw comics at night.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.900
They were totally separate worlds.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, at night,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.770
did you put on like a
cape, or did you nerd out?

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.450
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: [Laughing] I
took off my pants, and I sat there

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.010
in my underwear and I drew comics.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.310
[ Laughter ]

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.610
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yikes.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.660
We'll save the rest of that
one for the last session.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.320
There's visuals for that.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.430
Speaking of visuals, I want
to make sure to get to this.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.740
I think that's the
first slide, right?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.610
Okay. This is you with
pants on fortunately.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:03.980
Thank you.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.540
So, one thing I want get
about, you've created a lot

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.630
of the characters, but you know,
you have to, they always say,

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.340
draw from yourself even if you're
creating a character that's nothing

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.620
like yourself, to speak to, it
has to be something about you.

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.060
Could you talk a little bit about
what about you, finding your voice

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.450
from who you are as a creator?

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:22.750
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.240
I mean, I actually, I majored
in computer science in college.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.330
I mean, I like computers, but
also I have a Chinese dad,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.840
so I majored in computer science.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.920
I minored in creative writing,
and I did take this one class

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.230
that was super helpful for me.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.140
It was a creative writing
class taught

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.630
by a woman named Thaisa Frank,
who is an award-winning author.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.070 position:56%
She wrote a book called Finding Your
Writer's Voice, a non-fiction book

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.650
about how to write fiction.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.590
And that book totally helped me.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.650
I felt like the class itself was
like a physical manifestation

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.580
of her ideas in the book,
and I really feel like during

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.750
that semester that I was with her,

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.980
that's when I actually
found my voice.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.420
And it's exactly what you're
talking about, like every character

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.980
that you write, whether
they're hero or villain,

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.610
even if on the surface they seem
completely different from you,

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.680
you have to find some sort
of common humanity in order

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.250
to get it out on the page.

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Absolutely.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.850
Yeah, as I understand it,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.780
your parents said find a
practical career, right?

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:24.160
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Yes, my dad especially.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.160
My mom was a little bit more
understanding, but my dad was.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.460
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Are they
still saying that to you?

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:29.760
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, yeah.

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.940
My dad, I mean, it's hard to,
it's just, I can't compete.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:38.230 position:56%
Like, I have a younger brother, he
was always better at school than me.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.870
He is now a medical doctor.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.170
He's an ophthalmologist.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.890
He owns his own clinic.

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.140
Exactly! Exactly.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.440
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Even here!

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.740
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Is my dad out there?

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.040
[ Laughter ]

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Even
here you get your brother.

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.950
Somewhere he's like, yeah, yeah.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.250 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's also my mom.

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.090
My parents, my dad is very
proud, very proud of me,

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.490
but like when something's wrong
with his body, he's not going

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.090
to call his cartoonist son.

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:03.390
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: No, no.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:04.690
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Right?

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:05.990
When his back hurts, he's
going to call the doctor son.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:07.880
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah, you
can draw how it should look,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.310
but does he have a piece
of paper, your brother,

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:12.980
that literally says genius on it?

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:14.280
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
He doesn't need it.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.080
He can help with the back problems.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.380
He doesn't need it.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay,
well I make an appointment

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.650
with your brother when
we're done, so.

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:22.950
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
You totally should.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.630
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Can
we go to the next slide.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:28.350
So, you've spent the last year,
you know, have this mission,

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.830
you know, Reading Without Walls.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.580
And even within comics there
are walls, but, you know,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.810
you spoke several years ago at
the gala for this very festival

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:41.180
about writing across
cultures and diversity.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.310
And comics have this
power, I have found,

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:48.130
to speak to especially young
people across cultures in a way.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.890
And the power of those images
can speak across cultures.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:53.560
Could you talk about your mission?

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.440
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So, at the
beginning of last year, of 2016,

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.530
I was appointed by the
Library of Congress

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.490
as the fifth National Ambassador
for Young People's Literature.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.530
Which is amazing because
out of all of my job titles,

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.580
that is the fanciest
sounding one ever.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:13.430
But the whole point of the position
is I get to talk about reading.

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:16.260
I get to talk about the importance
of reading, so for the last year

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.620
and a half, I've been travelling
around America, around the nation,

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.330
talking to different
communities at libraries

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.000
and bookstores and
schools about books.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.730
I've gotten to hear about the kind
of books that kids are reading.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.140
I've gotten to talk to aspiring
cartoonists and aspiring writers.

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.460
It's been a phenomenal,
phenomenal experience.

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:38.730
So, every National Ambassador
picks some kind of platform,

00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:40.340
something they want to focus on.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:43.880
For me, that platform is reading
without walls, by which I mean,

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.270
I want kids, I want
everybody really,

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.200
to read outside of
their comfort zone.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.090
I think all of us have a section
at the library, or the section

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.660 position:56%
at a local bookstore that we always
gravitate towards, and it's awesome.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.120
I think it's great that we
each have a home in books.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.250
But I also think that every now
and then you've got to go outside

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.220
of your home because that's
how you grow as a human being.

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.520
I've been going around,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.620
issuing what's called the
Reading Without Walls challenge.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.090
So, here's how the challenge works.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.060
You pick a due date, and you
can do this either for yourself

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:15.850
or for your community,
and by that due date,

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.150
you just do one of three things.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.580
Number one, you read a book
about somebody who doesn't look

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:20.880
like you or live like you.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.600
Somebody who, at least
on the surface,

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.030
seems really different from you.

00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:26.120
Or two, you pick a
book about a topic

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:27.880
that you might not
know anything about.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.310
Or three, you pick
a book in a format

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:31.790
that you don't normally
read for fun.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.550
So, if normally all you read
for fun are prose books,

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:36.190
I want you to try a graphic novel.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.230 position:56%
If normally all you read are graphic
novels and comics, then I want you

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.930
to try something with
no pictures in it.

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah,
and did you have success?

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.310
Did you get the kids to?

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:46.910
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: It's been
kind of stunning, I have to say.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.210
It's been stunning

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:53.040
to see communities really
embrace this challenge.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.850
I could not have imagined that
things would go the way they did.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.820
My publisher, Macmillan,
really got behind it,

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.970
so they created these Reading
Without Walls kits with bookmarks

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.440
and with posters and
with reading lists.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.560
And they gave away, I
think they gave away three

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.040
or four thousand of them.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.110
In addition, they put
all of that material

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:14.150
on a readingwithoutwalls.com.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.450
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I
was going to say,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.750
is there a website
they can go to get?

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:18.050
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yep.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.720
You can just go to
readingwithoutwalls.com.

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.090
They have a goofy video of me,

00:10:21.090 --> 00:10:23.870
but they've totally put
a ton of work into that.

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:26.570
You can download all sorts
of like, printable materials.

00:10:26.570 --> 00:10:28.690
You can download certificates
of completion.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:31.160
You can download book
recommendations,

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:32.460
and it's been awesome.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:36.350
So, on social media, like
on Facebook and on Twitter,

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:41.150
I get all these photos from these
amazing wall displays that teachers

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.160
and librarians and bookstore
owners have put together.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.400
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, you
are legitimately cool now.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.880
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: No,
I wouldn't go that far.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.790
I can tell you though,
I can tell you though,

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.260
I went into Catholic schools,

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.120
so they have these
retreats for their students.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:57.540
And I went to a sophomore
retreat to speak about a year

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.060
and a half after I left the school.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:00.840
And at the end of my speech,

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.770
it's a speech that I've done
before for that community.

00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:05.950
And at the end of my speech,
they gave me a standing ovation.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.680
And I was like what?

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.000
Where was this when I
was an actual teacher.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: That's right.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:14.510
You had to leave to be appreciated.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:17.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I think it's
just impossible to impress teenagers

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.330
that you see on a daily basis.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.760
No matter who you are.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: What about
your, you have kids at home,

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.120
aren't they impressed
when you come home.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.030
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: They
are not impressed at all.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:29.280
Like, I will give them one
of my books as a galley.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.520
I'll give them a book and say
tell me what you think of this.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.940 position:56%
And then they'll read it and they'll
be like, eh, it was all right dad,

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.940 position:56%
but Raina's so much better than you.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.550
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Raina Telgemeier.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:40.290
Wow, okay.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.100
Well, I just hope your brother
doesn't start making comics.

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.400
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Me too.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.700
Me too.

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Can
we go to the next slide,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.810
and maybe the one after that.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:53.110
And, so talk about,
you know, you read DC.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:55.350
You're more of a Marvel kid, right?

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:56.650
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I was.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.060
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: But now Superman,
and you're doing this amazing thing

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.950
where you have a Superman
of Asian descent, right?

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.250
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:04.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Can you talk
about getting to this dream?

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.240
Living this dream?

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.540
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I started
collecting superhero comics

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:10.960
when I was in fifth grade.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.860
The very first comic

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.560
in my collection was
actually a Superman comic.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.100
It was a DC Comics
Presents, so to actually get

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.610
to write Superman now
has just, it's been nuts.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:25.340
The fifth grader in me is
just freaking out every day.

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.700
It's been crazy.

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:32.460
I was a Marvel kid though, growing
up, and I became a Marvel kid

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.890
because I just thought back
then DC was kind of dumb.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.640
I apologize if you're
like an 80s DC fan,

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.050
but I learned that there's
this character named Aqualad

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.350
in the DC Universe.

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.560
And I was just like, that's so
dumb, it's such a dumb name.

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: So, if
they offered you Aqualad?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.680
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well, now I
think Aqualad is kind of cool,

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.390
because of the Young Justice show.

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:53.790
I think they made him cool,
which is an impossible task.

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:58.120
It just shows how far DC has
come, that they made Aquaman cool.

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:59.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: But,
as we know with Marvel,

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.310
they had flawed characters.

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:03.780
We know Spider Man and all
that, you saw flaws, and so,

00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:05.800
when you're a kid,
if ever, you know,

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.190
they talk about Superman being
just the big blue boy scout.

00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.110
He seems too perfect,
and Batman's pretty dark.

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:14.080
But like, there's some Marvel
you could relate to that.

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:15.750
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, I
think that was part of it too.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:19.440
I have since become a
huge DC fan of course.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.900
Not just because they give
me paychecks, but also,

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:27.370
I think there's something very
classic and iconic about DC

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.700
that even Marvel, as great as that
universe is, doesn't approach.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.420
I kind of think of,
like, the relationship

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.030
between the Catholic Church
and the Protestant Churches,

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:38.680
it's kind of the relationship
between Marvel and DC, right.

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.050
DC being the Catholic Church.

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:44.890
Like, DC established the
genre, Marvel cannot be Marvel

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:47.530
if DC had not originally
put out this idea

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.220
that Superman ought
to be perfect, right?

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:51.520
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow, okay.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's my theory.

00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:55.750 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I want to know how
DC and Marvel [inaudible] right now.

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.500 position:56%
It could be a mess, but [inaudible].

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.060
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: So, this
is a page from New Superman,

00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:06.250
which is my current
project for DC Comics.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.620
It's a monthly series, issue
number 15 just came out,

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.310
and this was not my idea.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.310 position:56%
I did a ten-issue run on the main
Superman title, and then after that,

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.980
they called me up and they're like,
they actually said this, they go,

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.660
okay, don't get mad about
this, but we just want

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.960
to find out what you think.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.470
What do you think if we have
a Chinese Superman character?

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:28.080
And I was like, that
sounds terrible.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.600
I don't want anything
to do with that.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.020
That sounds like a horrible idea,
and part of the reason why I was

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.660
so allergic to the idea was
they wanted it set in China.

00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:41.830
And I'm of Chinese descent,
my mom was born in China,

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.700
but I have no experience
living in China.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.080
You know, I'd be writing as an
outsider, and I just felt like,

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.690
because of my last name,
people would expect

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.590 position:56%
that I was an insider, but I wasn't.

00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:53.700
I didn't feel like
I could pull it off.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:58.630
I had these meetings at the
DC Comics Burbank offices,

00:14:58.630 --> 00:14:59.930
which are amazing by the way.

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:03.560
They have like, in front of the
offices, there are giant windows

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.780
with DC characters on them.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.030 position:56%
So like, Jim Lee is the co-publisher
there, he has Batman and Robin.

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:13.100
You actually walk into Batman
and Robin in a [inaudible].

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.680
Amazing. So I had these meetings
with them, and at the end,

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.140
this character, Kenan Kong
ended up like talking to me.

00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:22.260
And anytime that happens, if
you're a writer, you know this.

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.380
When you have a character
talking in your head,

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:25.680
you've got to just do the project.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.980
So I ended up doing the project.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.280
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: But that's

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.580
because the DC editors
actually piped in his voice.

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.880
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
Yeah, that might be it.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.180
That might be it.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.480
That might be it.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.780
But it's been a ton of fun.

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.080
I felt like, they said they
gave me like a little corner

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.380
of the DC Universe to plan.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:38.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And that is great.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.980
Well, that's the key too.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.870
I've talked to a lot of creators
about, a jumping off point is

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:45.610
when your characters
start speaking to you.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.420
So, you felt like you
got to that point

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.610
where your Superman
is speaking to you.

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:50.910
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I
got to that point, yeah.

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:53.110
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Was Superman
respectful in how he talked to you?

00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:54.410
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: No.

00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:55.710
No.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:57.010
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Did he
sort of slap you around?

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.310
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: He was a jerk.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:59.610
Yeah, he was a jerk.

00:15:59.610 --> 00:16:00.910
He was a jerk, and that
shows up in the book.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:02.210
He's a complete jerk.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:05.410
We wanted him the opposite of
what Clark Kent is today, right.

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.860
So, Clark Kent right now,
he is the moral compass,

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.160
but he didn't start off that way.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.950
If you read early Superman
comics from the late 1930s,

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:15.910
he actually kind of started
off as a jerk as well.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:19.280
He used to be very full of himself.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.580
He would laugh at people

00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:22.810
who couldn't figure out
his secret identity.

00:16:22.810 --> 00:16:27.630
He would love to like beat somebody
up and then like sermonize at them.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:30.940
That was like his favorite
thing, and then eventually, he,

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.240
throughout the decades, he's gone

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.750
through this huge character
arc that's taken, you know,

00:16:34.750 --> 00:16:37.270
through the 40s and 50s and 60s,

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.410
to become the character
that we know today.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.480
To become this moral paragon.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.420
So, I wanted Kenan
Kong's character to,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.700
his arc, to reflect that as well.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.410
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Well, let's
run through these images

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:51.090
to make sure we get through them.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:57.120
So, there he is, and I think I'm
going in the wrong direction.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, so that
was Chinese Batman and Wonder Woman.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.830
I asked if I could introduce
a Chinese Justice League,

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.260
and then they were like, sure.

00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:07.130
And then I asked if I could make
Chinese Batman a chubby Asian,

00:17:07.130 --> 00:17:08.740
and they're like, I guess.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.050
[ Laughter ]

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:12.520
I wanted to do that.

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.290
I wanted to do that because I
feel like there are not a lot

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.200
of chubby Asians in American
media, you know what I mean?

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.650
There's like the kid from
Up and that's about it.

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:23.270
And they're always comedic.

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:25.800
They're like played for
laughs, but if you look at like,

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.470
old school Kung Fu movies, there's
always like this, there's often,

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:32.200
not always, there's often
like this chubby Chinese dude

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.500
who everybody writes off.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.800
And then he just whoops you.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.570
That's what I wanted
Chinese Batman to be like.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:37.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: You
wanted that style?

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:39.170
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:42.360
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay, so Secret
Coders, you know, here you worked

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.990
in the industry for two years.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:48.150 position:56%
You taught, but now you're tricking
even kids who might not otherwise be

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.870
into computer puzzles, you're
teaching them coding in a way.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.170
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That's the hope.

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.470
That's the hope.

00:17:53.470 --> 00:17:54.770
So this is my first
explicitly educational comic.

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:57.370
I took a lot of what I was doing
as a computer science teacher

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.410
on my white board, and I
stuck it into a graphic novel.

00:18:00.410 --> 00:18:03.470
So, I'm hoping to teach
kids in like fourth, fifth,

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:07.000
sixth grade the basics of computer
science through a graphic novel

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.340
that I'm doing with a
fabulously talented cartoonist

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:10.640
by the name of Mike Holmes.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:13.520
So, Mike and I originally decided
to do three of these books,

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.070
but the first one's done well
enough that we're now doing six.

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:18.030
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow,
congratulations.

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:24.820
So, also, so you taught and you
decided to do a non-fiction book,

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.620
and you decided at your school,

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:30.110
you would follow the basketball
team for a season, right?

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.790
And at Bishop O'Dowd
in the Bay Area,

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.910
and track that, and now I think.

00:18:35.910 --> 00:18:37.710
Have you been blowing deadlines

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.010
since you've been travelling
the country?

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:40.310
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I've
been blowing deadlines.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:43.490
I'm so behind on this project,
but these are some of the sketches

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:45.590
that I did for this project.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.270
At that school where I taught,

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:50.450
it was Bishop O'Dowd High
School in Oakland, California.

00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:57.020
Right at the end of
2013, beginning of 2014,

00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.590
I had just finished a big project.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.690
I finished a graphic novel
called Boxers and Saints,

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:03.790
which up to that point
was my longest project.

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:07.210
It's about the Boxer Rebellion, a
war that was fought on Chinese soil

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:10.800
in the year 1900, and I felt
kind of lost afterwards.

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.340
I didn't feel like, I didn't
know what story to pursue next.

00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:17.600 position:56%
I started getting interested in
basketball for a variety of reasons,

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.040
including my son joining
his basketball team

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.650
at his elementary school.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:26.010
And including Jeremy
Lynn, and then I got

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:28.890
to know the basketball
coach at this school.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.100
This coach's name is Lou Ritchie,
he is very different from me,

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.910
so writers and cartoonists, we are
famous for having low self-esteem.

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:38.520
This dude does not have
low self-esteem, right.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:42.100
He's like a, at least on the
surface, he's a stereotypical jock

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:44.710
and I was a nerd, but as I sat
down and I started talking to him

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:48.920
about basketball, this
really amazing story emerged.

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.090
And I followed his team for
a season, and at the end,

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:55.060
I was like I need to do
a book about these guys.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.690
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And you said
it was a very diverse squad,

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:58.990
but you said.

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:00.290
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Well, it's
diverse in a certain way.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:01.590
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: And
but the team also,

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.770
some of the players
encounter prejudice

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:06.260
and so you have all of that.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:08.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, I mean I've
always been interested in culture.

00:20:08.420 --> 00:20:10.310
I've always been interested
in identity,

00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.610
and all of that played
into this team.

00:20:12.610 --> 00:20:15.210
So, the school itself
is pretty diverse.

00:20:15.210 --> 00:20:19.280
There's no one group that has
over 50 percent of the population,

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.520
but it's still like the largest
ethnic group is still folks

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.820
of European descent.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.620
Students of European descent.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.110
The squad that I followed was
almost all African-American.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:31.740
There were only three
players on that team

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.040
that were not African-American.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.340
There was a white kid,
and there are two Asians.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:36.640
One who was Sikh.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.720
He was the only Sikh
on the court, ever.

00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:41.020
Like, all the time.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.430
His whole life, he was
always the only Sikh kid.

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.970
And I sat in the crowd
watching them play.

00:20:47.970 --> 00:20:51.880 position:56%
When I sat in the crowd watching
them play, I was shocked at the kind

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.360
of stuff both students and
adults would say to the Sikh kid.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:57.230
You know, would yell
at the Sikh kid.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:00.510
It was just, it was
crazy, it was crazy to me.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.810
And so, I do talk about that.

00:21:01.810 --> 00:21:03.200
He's one of the players
that I focus on.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.500
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:05.800
We have time for, I think,

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.740 position:56%
one question for Gene before we
bring a couple more cartoonists out.

00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:09.040
Is there someone who'd like to step

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.440
to the microphone and
ask a question?

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:16.320
I see a girl walking very
purposefully right here.

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.620
I love it.

00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.170
Hello. What would you
like to ask Gene?

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.890
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang:
I met you earlier.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.050
Cadence. Did I get it right?

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.350
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Wow.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:26.650
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: That
doesn't always happen.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:27.950
My brain usually is
terrible at that.

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.250
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Nicely done.

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.550
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thanks
for coming, Cadence.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.940
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Can someone
help her with the microphone?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.810
&gt;&gt; If you could have any
super power, what would it be?

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:45.770
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: If I could have
any super power, what would it be?

00:21:45.770 --> 00:21:47.070
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Yeah.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.370
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: I would want
to be able to multiply time,

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.510
because if I did that, I
could hit my deadlines.

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.860
[ Laughter ]

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:55.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Nice.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.460
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Thank you.

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.760
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Nice.

00:21:57.760 --> 00:21:59.060
Thank you, Cadence.

00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.360
We have time for one more.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.660
&gt;&gt; Do you think that Bruce
Lee would argue with you

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:02.960
that he was the first
Asian Superman?

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.500
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yeah, Bruce Lee?

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:09.830
He would have a great argument
for being the Asian Superman.

00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:12.820
I think it's hard to
underestimate the effect

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:16.480
that Bruce Lee has had on,
not just Asian America,

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.340
but America in general.

00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:19.990
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: I think
he'd have a forceful argument.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:21.290
&gt;&gt; Gene Luen Yang: Yes, he would.

00:22:21.290 --> 00:22:22.590
He would have a very
forceful argument.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.890
&gt;&gt; Michael Cavna: Okay.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.150

of the Library of Congress.
