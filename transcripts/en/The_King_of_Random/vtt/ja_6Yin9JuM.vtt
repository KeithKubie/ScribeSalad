00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.319
If you're in a survival situation and it's
windy outside, matches can be extremely unreliable,

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.580
and they certainly won't light a fire when
they're wet. So in this project let's try

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.440
using a bit of backyard science, to take the
trouble out of lighting your tinder. Because

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.160
with this special mix, the tinder, lights
itself.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.810
Let's begin this project with the soda cap
container we made in a previous project. They're

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.839
lightweight, cheap to make, and amazingly
useful, so look for how to build them in another

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.799
video. Now our matchless fire starter is about
as simple as mixing two chemicals together.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.960
Potassium permanganate, and a bit of glycerin.
These items are sometimes found in survival

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.480
kits already because of their healing properties
and water treatment abilities. But mix them

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.310
together, and it opens up a whole new world
of possibilities. This purple product is sold

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:55.370
commercially as a rejuvenator for certain
types of water filters, and I found mine in

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.970
the water treatment section of a pool supply
store. Now it might look like a harmless black

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.409
sand, but it's actually a powerful oxidizer.
This stuff can be poisonous and burn your

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.869
skin, so just make sure you're well aware
of the risks before you try handling it.

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.940
Some people have used it for disinfecting water, making antiseptic

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.399
solutions, providing anti-fungal treatment
for hands and feet, and making emergency signals

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.240
on snow. Now I loaded up one half of my container
using a spoon and a funnel, and that seemed

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.390
to work pretty to prevent spills. Now let's
screw the cap back on nice and tight, so the

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.569
powder is locked in securely where it should
be kept safe and dry. Alright, now we can

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:34.369
add the glycerin to the other side. I found
this bottle at a local super center, but they

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.460
can be found just as easily at drug, craft,
and baking stores as well. Glycerin is typically

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.929
used as a moisturizer in creams and lotions,
but it has some really cool uses for first

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.799
aid and survival situations as well. Some
people have used it to relieve insect bites,

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.379
sunburns, chemical burns, and some even say it works as a mild mosquito and ant repellant.

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.509
You may have noticed I color coded the ends
of my container with different caps, and that's

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.219
to help identify which chemicals are in which
end. Since the container is made out of bottle

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.579
caps, it's completely water resistant, so
everything stays dry, even if the container

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.500
gets completely submerged in water. Not only
is it waterproof, and incredibly small, but

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.600
even when it's fully loaded, the whole thing
weighs a mere 1 oz, or about 29 g. Chances

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.220
are, that's small and light enough to be added
to any type of day pack, without making any

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.600
noticeable difference. Now let's go on a little
trip to the mountains to see how this reacts

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.610
when we mix the 2 chemicals together. First
we'll need to open the black side, because

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.720
that's the end with the potassium permanganate.
Now since I was down by the river anyway,

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.090
I thought this might be a good time to experiment
with disinfecting water. All it takes is a

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.220
very small pinch of potassium permanganate
crystals in a liter of water to begin the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.070
disinfecting process. You can see when the
crystals hit the water, they turn a deep purple.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.590
But if we put the lid on and mix it all around,
the water should turn to a nice light pink.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.950
The saying is, "as long as it's pink, it's
probably ok to drink". Just make sure it's

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.340
not purple, and you should be alright. Ok,
let's carefully pour the grains on a flat

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.980
surface, like a rock or piece of wood, and
I'm using about half the container for this

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.100
demonstration. Now, it's a good idea to push
a little indentation into the center of the

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.940
pile, so that when we pour the glycerin on
top, it'll be held neatly in place, right

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.260
in the center. These next few seconds feel
like nothing is happening, but make sure you've

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.830
got some dry leaves, twigs, and other lightweight
kindling gathered up, because when this reaction

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.440
happens, it's going to happen fast. It can
take anywhere up to a minute to notice anything

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.220
changing, but if you look closely now, you
should start to see the glycerin soaking down

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.640
into the powder, and starting to smoke. Make
sure you've got your dry leaves ready, because

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.630
the heat and smoke will continue to build
rapidly, until the the pile spontaneously

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.110
bursts into flames. Let's go ahead and gently
set our leaves and sticks overtop, and you

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.820
should be able to see how quickly the flames
begin to build. Now if you've left a little

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.870
gap at the bottom for air to get in, your
matchless survival fire should continue to

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.900
build quickly on it's own, without having
to put in any extra effort. Congratulations,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.900
you've just started a fire without matches,
and now that you've got a healthy flame, why

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.480
don't you try making yourself a batch of char-cloth?
This stuff is another must-have for emergency

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.840
fire starting, and is so sensitive to heat,
you can easily start future fires with your

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.070
water bottle. So look for the video on how
to make char-cloth, as well. Now whatever

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.699
you do, don't ever mix glycerin directly into
the same compartment as the potassium permanganate.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:21.109
I tried screwing the lid back on to seal out
any oxygen, but the potassium permanganate

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.499
is still a strong enough oxidizer to start
the reaction. And like any air-tight container

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:30.139
holding a rapidly expanding gas, it's eventually
going to blow. So if you want to error on

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.580
the side of caution and avoid any unnecessary
messes, feel free to store your ingredients

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.169
in completely separate containers. Well now
you know how to take two very different, but

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:44.620
very useful emergency kit items, and mix them
together to get an awesome synergistic benefit.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.180
The matchless survival fire. If you liked

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.520
