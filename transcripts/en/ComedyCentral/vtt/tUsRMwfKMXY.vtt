00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.602
Now, a lot of people
don't know this,

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:03.803
uh, but we have something
special tonight.

00:00:03.836 --> 00:00:05.605
Okay, the Trump campaign
actually granted

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:08.841
<i> The Nightly Show</i> exclusive
backstage access.

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:10.043
I'm not making this up.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:12.412
(laughter)

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:13.980
Okay, I might be making it up.

00:00:14.013 --> 00:00:16.082
I might be making up,
but I'm really not making it up.

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:17.750
Okay, backstage access
to Donald Trump

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:19.385
in the moments leading up
to his big speech,

00:00:19.418 --> 00:00:21.287
and we were able to capture
some very compelling,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.756
intimate, uh, moments.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:24.891
Take a look.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.461
(people cheering)

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.870 line:0%
The situation in Turkey
is a real mess,

00:00:37.903 --> 00:00:40.940 line:0%
and we all know that it was
crooked Hillary's fault,

00:00:40.973 --> 00:00:43.409 line:0%
but, look, we got
to restore order, okay,

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:44.677 line:0%
and we got to monitor
the situation.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.145 line:0%
We got to show our strength.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:49.115 line:0%
We got to get tough, like real
tough, like unbelievably t...

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.483 line:0%
-look, I got to go.
-All right.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.655
What the hell happened
in Turkey?

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.057
Problems,
got a lot of problems.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.661
So many problems
in our country, folks.

00:01:01.694 --> 00:01:02.995
Believe me.

00:01:03.028 --> 00:01:05.998
Mu-slims. Mu-slims.

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.835
Obama. Obama.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:12.405
Black, black, black. Obama.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:14.740
MAN: No, come on, this is
the perfect time. Come on.

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:16.742
-MAN 2: Uh...
-Mr. Trump, look who's here.

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:18.744
-Hey.
-LeBron James.

00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:21.914
You were absolutely fantastic
against the Warriors.

00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:23.449
-My God, you were good.
-(chuckles)

00:01:23.482 --> 00:01:26.853
Oh, no. I'm-I'm your new,
um, Middle East advisor.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.456
It's-it's, um...

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.794
What are you doing?

00:01:34.827 --> 00:01:38.331
Oh, good. Uh, what are you gonna
be wearing later on tonight?

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.066
Oh, my God, I love that outfit.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.401
-It's so fantastic, so sexy.
-Mr. Trump, five minutes.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:45.938
Uh, look, I got to go, Ivanka.

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.674
...so I put it on. As I'm doing
that, the guy behind me,

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.943
I hear him saying,
"Oh, I've got the wrong coat."

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.880
So now there's two of us. We
obviously have the wrong coat.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:56.549
I realize here's a connection.
I look over.

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:59.452
Who do you think I saw,
everybody?

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.822
Actually, I can't remember.
Actually...

00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:05.758
Melania, who-whose coat was it?

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.894
-MELANIA (accented):
Regis Philbin. -Oh. (hisses)

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.096
God, that Slovenian accent,
it cuts through me,

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.965
literally, like a knife. Um...

00:02:12.998 --> 00:02:15.468
Regis Philbin.

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.537
(light laughter)

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.039
-Oh, that's great.
-What are the chances?

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:22.508
-Great story. -Crazy.
-Unbelievable, right?

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:25.511
That is the perfect story.

00:02:25.544 --> 00:02:27.380
Unbelievable.
I don't tell it to most people.

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:29.182
Most people want to hear it--
I don't tell it, okay?

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.851
But it's the perfect story.
I save it a lot.

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:35.855
Guys, guys,
I just found a Pikachu.

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:39.325
Oh. And there's a Jigglypuff.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.994
Look, my remarks
about the disabled

00:02:42.027 --> 00:02:44.330
were taken out of context, okay?

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:47.400
Jews. The Jews. Jews.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:51.204
I can't believe the crap that
these Never Trump protesters

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:52.672
pulled on the convention floor.

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.607
I mean, look,
I won every primary.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.342
I mean,
I did fantastically well.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:59.011
And now these party hacks want
to steal my nomination.

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.147
-(toilet flushing)
-(sighs)

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.816
And, by the way, that guy
from Alaska, the delegate,

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.551
he's a real asshole.

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:08.554
I was raised in a small town
in Southern Indiana

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:11.557
in a big family with
a cornfield in the backyard.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.726
Although we weren't really
a political family,

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.329
the heroes of my youth were
President John F. Kennedy and...

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.197
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.799
Excuse me.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:23.135
I didn't say
all of them were rapists.

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:25.304
I said most of them.

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:29.041
IVANKA: ...to present to you
and to all of America

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:31.510
-my father and our next
president... -I can't do this.

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:33.379
I can't do it. It was a gag.
It was fun.

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.581
I was just doing it for fun.
I can't do it. Let me out.

00:03:35.614 --> 00:03:37.583
Please. I got to get out
of here. It was all for fun.

00:03:37.616 --> 00:03:39.385
Crooked Hillary can run
the country. I don't care.

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:40.920
Watch your step.

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:42.889
-♪ ♪
-(cheering and applause)

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.527
Unbelievable.
We'll be right back.
