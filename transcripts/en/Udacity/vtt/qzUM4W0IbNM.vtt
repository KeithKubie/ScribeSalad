00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.740
The traditional approach to supporting
different devices is to make an app for

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.430
each device and platform as they
become available and adopted by users.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.720
This has typically meant
a new project for each and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.310
every device developed and
supported independently.

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:19.130
For most of us, we actually think of
the experience on any of these devices

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.010
as part of a single whole experience for
the user with our service.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.220
Approaching each as
a separate project is well,

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.660
it's just the wrong way to go about it.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.320
Instead you're going to want to
think about having a view

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.380
into your service from every
device that makes sense.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.270
Now this is really the definition
of ubiquitous computing

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.890
where your service is available
anywhere and everywhere.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.710
Each view into your service
will differ slightly

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.360
depending on the features available, and
what the user needs in that context, but

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.370
taken as a whole these views lead
to a single seamless experience for

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.970
the user across their life.
