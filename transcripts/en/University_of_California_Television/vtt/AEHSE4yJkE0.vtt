00:00:01.268 --> 00:00:03.350
- [Narrator] This UCSD-TV program

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.549
is presented by University
of California Television.

00:00:19.293 --> 00:00:23.000
(soft piano music)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.971
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:25.971 --> 00:00:28.471
Bipedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:35.187
long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:39.372
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:41.872
Aware that death is inevitable

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.792
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.539
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:53.017
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:57.295
We shape the future from
our shared understanding

00:00:57.295 --> 00:00:58.295
of the past.

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:02.218
CARTA brings together experts

00:01:02.218 --> 00:01:03.973
from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.973 --> 00:01:06.746
to exchange insights on who we are

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:08.413
and how we got here.

00:01:09.742 --> 00:01:11.746
An exploration made possible

00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:14.829
by the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:30.374 --> 00:01:33.291
(soft piano music)

00:02:00.335 --> 00:02:02.421
- So I will discuss today

00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:06.828
the relation between
inflammation and metabolism

00:02:06.828 --> 00:02:09.023
and metabolic homeostasis

00:02:09.023 --> 00:02:11.167
and disease susceptibility.

00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:15.279
So inflammation is a protective response

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:17.815
to a variety of challenges
that we may experience

00:02:17.815 --> 00:02:19.871
including infection and injury

00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:22.598
and various types of tissue stress

00:02:22.598 --> 00:02:25.700
and malfunctions and all the
things that can go wrong.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.909
All of them can induce
an inflammatory response

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.933
that are meant to be protective.

00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:34.721
Depending on the type of
challenge that we experience

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.421
there's different physiological

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:38.598
or intended purpose of the responses

00:02:38.598 --> 00:02:41.782
such as host defense from infection,

00:02:41.782 --> 00:02:43.469
tissue repair response

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.230
or restoration of a normal
state of the tissues.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.197
What is very interesting
about inflammation

00:02:50.197 --> 00:02:52.119
and very clinically important

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:55.192
is that all these different
pathways to inflammation

00:02:55.192 --> 00:02:58.981
can result in a variety
of pathological sequelae

00:02:58.981 --> 00:03:01.970
including autoimmune diseases, sepsis,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.347
fibrotic diseases, tumor growth

00:03:04.347 --> 00:03:07.062
and a variety of diseases of homeostasis

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:09.179
that are becoming more and more common

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:10.999
in modern lifestyles.

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:13.917
To give a very, very simplified
summary of inflammation,

00:03:13.917 --> 00:03:16.361
of inflammatory pathway

00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.222
when inducers of inflammation
such as pathogens

00:03:19.222 --> 00:03:21.626
or tissue damage are encountered,

00:03:21.626 --> 00:03:24.130
cells in our bodies, such as macrophages

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.735
and epithelial cells and so on

00:03:25.735 --> 00:03:27.325
detect these inducers

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:30.268
and produce various inflammatory mediators

00:03:30.268 --> 00:03:31.738
including cytokines

00:03:31.738 --> 00:03:34.334
that some of them were mentioned already.

00:03:34.334 --> 00:03:35.650
And what these mediators do

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.763
is they act on every tissue in the body

00:03:38.763 --> 00:03:41.498
and they change some
functional characteristics

00:03:41.498 --> 00:03:45.133
that intend to either cause elimination

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:47.708
of whatever caused inflammation

00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:51.685
or adaptation to the
presence of these conditions.

00:03:51.685 --> 00:03:55.648
And why inflammation is so
broadly associated with diseases,

00:03:55.648 --> 00:03:59.789
very symbolically it
could be summarized here.

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:03.539
So for every trait,
including defense traits,

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.089
there are benefits and costs.

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:10.904
For defenses the costs are
particularly pronounced

00:04:10.904 --> 00:04:13.210
and the traits would be
evolutionarily stable

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.710
if the benefits are higher than the costs.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.152
Anything in this green
part of the triangle

00:04:21.152 --> 00:04:24.893
would be for potentially
evolutionarily stable

00:04:24.893 --> 00:04:27.895
and everything here would be unstable.

00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:31.358
The problem is that in the case of traits

00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:34.255
that can provide very high benefits,

00:04:34.255 --> 00:04:35.672
such as survival,

00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:39.574
the acceptable cost can also be very high.

00:04:39.574 --> 00:04:42.137
That leads to this type of picture

00:04:42.137 --> 00:04:45.656
where the part of this upper triangle,

00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:48.138
that's on the right side,

00:04:48.138 --> 00:04:50.985
where benefits can still outweigh the cost

00:04:50.985 --> 00:04:53.475
but in terms of the
absolute value of the cost

00:04:53.475 --> 00:04:54.899
this would be already,

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:56.438
from the patient perspective at least

00:04:56.438 --> 00:04:58.035
and the doctor's perspective,

00:04:58.035 --> 00:05:00.797
this would be already in the disease zone.

00:05:00.797 --> 00:05:04.235
This would be conditions
that we would experience

00:05:04.235 --> 00:05:07.210
as something that is
definitely not well-being

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.228
and doctors would diagnose

00:05:09.228 --> 00:05:11.689
as being various types of pathological

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:13.319
or disease conditions,

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.833
even though they still
provide more benefit

00:05:16.833 --> 00:05:18.000
than the cost.

00:05:19.523 --> 00:05:21.320
What we're interested in

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.415
is in the biology of
this upper-right corner

00:05:25.415 --> 00:05:29.510
where the high benefits are
associated with very high costs

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:33.677
and where we're basically
on the edge of the chaos,

00:05:33.677 --> 00:05:37.226
so a transition into
the pathological states

00:05:37.226 --> 00:05:39.809
that can be potentially lethal.

00:05:41.542 --> 00:05:45.709
This type of biology deals with
not just common conditions,

00:05:46.897 --> 00:05:50.512
like mild infections or mild anomalies,

00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:54.662
but it has to do with
essentially biology of survival,

00:05:54.662 --> 00:05:58.427
what are the kinds of
mechanisms that are employed

00:05:58.427 --> 00:06:00.874
by our system, by our organism,

00:06:00.874 --> 00:06:04.751
in order to survive critical conditions,

00:06:04.751 --> 00:06:08.678
the ones that are just
one step away from death.

00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:12.692
This is just, in a very
schematic way, summarized here.

00:06:12.692 --> 00:06:16.210
So if we consider this
type of disease tree

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:17.616
there are many conditions

00:06:17.616 --> 00:06:20.839
that we are one step away from health,

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:24.814
these are various common, mild illnesses.

00:06:24.814 --> 00:06:27.732
These are conditions that make you

00:06:27.732 --> 00:06:30.812
go to see your primary care physician.

00:06:30.812 --> 00:06:33.294
If there are complications
of these conditions

00:06:33.294 --> 00:06:36.085
you get referred to some
internal medicine specialist.

00:06:36.085 --> 00:06:38.557
These are more complex diseases,

00:06:38.557 --> 00:06:41.707
but you can still recover
and go back to health

00:06:41.707 --> 00:06:43.148
and in severe cases

00:06:43.148 --> 00:06:46.604
you can get into this
critical illness state

00:06:46.604 --> 00:06:48.886
when you get into ICU

00:06:48.886 --> 00:06:51.579
and you still can recover from here

00:06:51.579 --> 00:06:54.174
and in this critical illness state

00:06:54.174 --> 00:06:57.121
which is conditions
like sepsis, pneumonia,

00:06:57.121 --> 00:07:00.106
heart attack, brain damage and so forth,

00:07:00.106 --> 00:07:03.192
in these conditions you are one step away

00:07:03.192 --> 00:07:06.952
from these three proximal mechanisms

00:07:06.952 --> 00:07:08.895
that lead directly to death

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.613
and these are points of no-return

00:07:10.613 --> 00:07:12.028
which is respiratory failure,

00:07:12.028 --> 00:07:13.627
cardiovascular failure

00:07:13.627 --> 00:07:15.498
or damage to the brain areas

00:07:15.498 --> 00:07:19.431
that control respiration
and cardiovascular function.

00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:21.415
So we're interested in what happens here.

00:07:21.415 --> 00:07:23.591
What kind of mechanisms may be evolved

00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:27.642
to prevent this transition
into this point of no return.

00:07:27.642 --> 00:07:29.146
The case I will discuss today

00:07:29.146 --> 00:07:31.782
has to do with this very enigmatic

00:07:31.782 --> 00:07:35.642
and very interesting and
very familiar to everyone

00:07:35.642 --> 00:07:38.616
set of conditions known
as sickness behaviors.

00:07:38.616 --> 00:07:40.825
This is something everybody
in this room experiences

00:07:40.825 --> 00:07:44.363
when you have the flu or any
other type of severe infection

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:46.928
or other types of acute illness.

00:07:46.928 --> 00:07:50.020
We all experience this set of conditions,

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:51.758
such as loss of appetite,

00:07:51.758 --> 00:07:53.899
social withdrawal, fatigue,

00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:56.087
sleepiness and so on and so forth.

00:07:56.087 --> 00:07:58.936
So these are all serotypic conditions

00:07:58.936 --> 00:08:00.963
that are associated with acute illness,

00:08:00.963 --> 00:08:03.409
most commonly with acute infections,

00:08:03.409 --> 00:08:07.159
so flu symptoms would
all be in that category.

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:09.400
The biology of sickness behavior

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.785
has not been really well understood

00:08:11.785 --> 00:08:13.624
although there were early studies

00:08:13.624 --> 00:08:16.399
that demonstrated that sickness behavior

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:18.382
is not just a consequence

00:08:18.382 --> 00:08:21.431
of the system being
destroyed by a pathogen,

00:08:21.431 --> 00:08:24.168
but rather these are motivated
behaviors, in other words,

00:08:24.168 --> 00:08:27.171
they are intended by the
organism for some reason.

00:08:27.171 --> 00:08:29.036
There's been many speculations

00:08:29.036 --> 00:08:32.481
whether various aspects
of sickness behavior,

00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:36.396
perhaps help the immune
system to fight the infection

00:08:36.396 --> 00:08:39.204
or maybe there's some other
way that they may contribute

00:08:39.204 --> 00:08:41.704
to dealing with acute illness.

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.280
So we were interested in investigating

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.832
aspects of acute illness,

00:08:47.832 --> 00:08:49.782
including loss of appetite

00:08:49.782 --> 00:08:52.213
and change in sleeping patterns

00:08:52.213 --> 00:08:55.462
and how they may contribute to survival,

00:08:55.462 --> 00:08:58.341
to survival of the acute illness.

00:08:58.341 --> 00:09:02.296
So there are two ways that
we can survive an infection

00:09:02.296 --> 00:09:05.204
or any other challenge for that matter.

00:09:05.204 --> 00:09:06.752
We can either resist it,

00:09:06.752 --> 00:09:08.067
so in the case of infection,

00:09:08.067 --> 00:09:10.504
normally we would be in this state

00:09:10.504 --> 00:09:12.143
where we are healthy

00:09:12.143 --> 00:09:15.393
and there's a negligible pathogen load.

00:09:17.505 --> 00:09:21.168
As we get infected an pathogens expand

00:09:21.168 --> 00:09:25.172
we can become ill, as
indicated by this position.

00:09:25.172 --> 00:09:27.411
From here we can either go back to health

00:09:27.411 --> 00:09:29.241
by getting rid of pathogens

00:09:29.241 --> 00:09:31.544
which is the role of the immune system

00:09:31.544 --> 00:09:35.385
and this is referred to as
a resistance to disease.

00:09:35.385 --> 00:09:38.968
Or we can adapt to the
presence of the pathogen

00:09:38.968 --> 00:09:41.423
and go back to the healthy state

00:09:41.423 --> 00:09:43.143
despite microbial load

00:09:43.143 --> 00:09:45.264
and this would referred to

00:09:45.264 --> 00:09:48.181
as increased tolerance to infection,

00:09:48.181 --> 00:09:49.915
or tolerance to damage.

00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:52.319
There are two ways that
pathogens cause damage,

00:09:52.319 --> 00:09:55.396
one is directly through
tissue destruction,

00:09:55.396 --> 00:09:58.375
through toxins, virulence
factors and so forth.

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:02.587
The second more common way
that infections cause illness

00:10:02.587 --> 00:10:06.754
is due to damage by the
inflammation caused by infection.

00:10:08.997 --> 00:10:12.175
And so we were interested in figuring out

00:10:12.175 --> 00:10:15.799
whether sickness behaviors
provide benefit, first of all,

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:17.849
secondly whether they provide benefit

00:10:17.849 --> 00:10:20.728
because they promote immune function

00:10:20.728 --> 00:10:22.908
and resistance to infection

00:10:22.908 --> 00:10:25.238
or whether they provide benefit

00:10:25.238 --> 00:10:27.284
by promoting tissue protection

00:10:27.284 --> 00:10:29.516
and tolerance to inflammatory damage

00:10:29.516 --> 00:10:31.707
or pathogen induced damage.

00:10:31.707 --> 00:10:34.938
So just like in humans, in mice

00:10:34.938 --> 00:10:37.755
or in any animals that have been studied

00:10:37.755 --> 00:10:39.968
all the way back to insects,

00:10:39.968 --> 00:10:44.693
when they're ill with acute
infection they stop eating.

00:10:44.693 --> 00:10:46.457
This is food consumption in mice

00:10:46.457 --> 00:10:50.327
after they received a dose
of listeria infection,

00:10:50.327 --> 00:10:53.379
this is a common food
poisoning type of infection.

00:10:53.379 --> 00:10:56.527
They stop eating, until they
start clearing infection

00:10:56.527 --> 00:10:59.927
and they start recovering and
then they start eating again.

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:02.836
But there is a very profound anorexia

00:11:02.836 --> 00:11:06.837
associated with infection,
as you can see here.

00:11:06.837 --> 00:11:09.790
So some studies done over 40 years ago

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.533
actually found that in the same
model of listeria infection

00:11:13.533 --> 00:11:17.194
if mice are force-fed,
then mortality increases.

00:11:17.194 --> 00:11:19.677
This is what we reproduce here,

00:11:19.677 --> 00:11:22.495
so this is showing survival of mice

00:11:22.495 --> 00:11:25.700
that are given LD-50 dose of listeria,

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.075
a dose that kills half of mice

00:11:28.075 --> 00:11:30.281
and this is what's shown here.

00:11:30.281 --> 00:11:32.530
If they are force-fed then all of them die

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:36.401
and they were fed just 20%
of daily caloric intakes,

00:11:36.401 --> 00:11:38.169
so they're not really stuffed with food,

00:11:38.169 --> 00:11:40.009
they're just given a little bit of food

00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:41.013
and that kills them.

00:11:41.013 --> 00:11:43.104
The food we used was
actually the same food

00:11:43.104 --> 00:11:45.187
that's used in ICU units.

00:11:46.183 --> 00:11:49.766
Then we asked what
component of food kills?

00:11:51.739 --> 00:11:54.505
So we gave them separately,

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:56.422
proteins, fat and sugar

00:11:58.533 --> 00:12:01.440
and turns out that sugar
alone, or glucose alone,

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:03.553
was sufficient to kill them,

00:12:03.553 --> 00:12:07.092
whether it was given orally
or intraperitoneally.

00:12:07.092 --> 00:12:09.828
So just giving them a small dose of sugar,

00:12:09.828 --> 00:12:13.659
only 2% of normal daily
caloric intake of glucose

00:12:13.659 --> 00:12:17.314
was sufficient to kill 100% of mice.

00:12:17.314 --> 00:12:21.530
Conversely if we gave
them a glucose inhibitor,

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:25.931
called 2DG, 2-deoxyglucose,
it's a modified form of glucose

00:12:25.931 --> 00:12:29.865
that cannot be metabolized, so
it blocks glucose utilization

00:12:29.865 --> 00:12:33.779
then 100% of mice would survive.

00:12:33.779 --> 00:12:37.332
Importantly this was not
because the immune system

00:12:37.332 --> 00:12:41.499
was affected in its ability
to get rid of the pathogen

00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:44.539
and it's not because

00:12:44.539 --> 00:12:48.023
there was a higher
magnitude of inflammation

00:12:48.023 --> 00:12:49.732
because these were not different

00:12:49.732 --> 00:12:53.260
between mice given glucose
or not, as you can see here.

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.266
So this indicated that
mice survived or died

00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:57.869
from this manipulation

00:12:57.869 --> 00:13:01.334
because of the effect
on tissue protection,

00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:04.884
not on the immune function itself.

00:13:04.884 --> 00:13:06.990
So then we ask what would happen

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:09.684
in a more severe condition like sepsis?

00:13:09.684 --> 00:13:13.716
Sepsis is the condition when
infection becomes systemic,

00:13:13.716 --> 00:13:15.248
when it gets into blood,

00:13:15.248 --> 00:13:17.583
in this case it's a bacterial sepsis

00:13:17.583 --> 00:13:19.058
that's mimicked by giving mice

00:13:19.058 --> 00:13:22.008
this component, an endotoxin LPS.

00:13:22.008 --> 00:13:23.582
As you can see here

00:13:23.582 --> 00:13:26.790
if mice given LPS, or septic mice,

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:29.178
if they're given food they die

00:13:29.178 --> 00:13:30.851
compared to a control

00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:33.930
where they're just given saline solution.

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:36.818
Importantly if they're just given sugar

00:13:36.818 --> 00:13:39.144
then they all drop dead,

00:13:39.144 --> 00:13:40.866
but most excitingly,

00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:43.414
if they're just given the simple drug

00:13:43.414 --> 00:13:45.802
that blocks glucose utilization,

00:13:45.802 --> 00:13:48.968
then 100% of them can
be rescued from sepsis.

00:13:48.968 --> 00:13:52.242
Sepsis is a really terrible,
intractable condition

00:13:52.242 --> 00:13:56.409
that is still a very common
cause of death in ICUs.

00:13:58.124 --> 00:14:02.124
So again, the mortality
or protection from death

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.666
in these manipulations

00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:07.779
was not dependent on the
degree of inflammation,

00:14:07.779 --> 00:14:09.821
as shown here is an example

00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:12.988
of a couple of inflammatory mediators.

00:14:12.988 --> 00:14:15.406
Again indicating that it was due

00:14:15.406 --> 00:14:18.906
to increased tissue protection from damage

00:14:20.095 --> 00:14:22.535
caused by severe inflammation

00:14:22.535 --> 00:14:25.118
that is associated with sepsis.

00:14:26.473 --> 00:14:28.643
Then we asked what would happen

00:14:28.643 --> 00:14:30.831
in a different type of infection?

00:14:30.831 --> 00:14:32.811
So far it showed you bacterial infection

00:14:32.811 --> 00:14:34.438
and bacterial sepsis,

00:14:34.438 --> 00:14:35.995
and now we asked what would happen

00:14:35.995 --> 00:14:39.150
in influenza virus infection?

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.011
So when mice are infected with flu virus,

00:14:42.011 --> 00:14:46.013
again, they undergo
this period of anorexia

00:14:46.013 --> 00:14:50.105
when they stop eating
until they start recovering

00:14:50.105 --> 00:14:52.264
and if they're force-fed

00:14:52.264 --> 00:14:56.482
to our great surprise they
actually survive better.

00:14:56.482 --> 00:15:01.321
So this now giving almost
lethal dose of flu infection,

00:15:01.321 --> 00:15:02.692
most mice die,

00:15:02.692 --> 00:15:05.207
but when they're given that food

00:15:05.207 --> 00:15:07.040
most of them survived.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.786
Also if they're given glucose

00:15:11.786 --> 00:15:14.523
that also provided partial protection

00:15:14.523 --> 00:15:17.851
and if they're given 2DG glucose inhibitor

00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:19.720
then all of them drop dead,

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:22.278
so it was exact opposite to what happened

00:15:22.278 --> 00:15:25.610
in bacterial infection
and bacterial sepsis.

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.714
Again the effect of glucose

00:15:27.714 --> 00:15:31.881
was not due to its impact
on inflammatory response,

00:15:32.937 --> 00:15:34.670
so in viral infections

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:37.241
it's a different type
of inflammatory response

00:15:37.241 --> 00:15:40.007
which is dominated by interferons,

00:15:40.007 --> 00:15:41.824
shown here, they're the same

00:15:41.824 --> 00:15:45.543
and the dose burden of
the virus in the lungs

00:15:45.543 --> 00:15:47.819
was also the same, was not different.

00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:49.267
Again suggesting the effects

00:15:49.267 --> 00:15:53.267
are due to impact on
tolerance to tissue damage.

00:15:54.462 --> 00:15:55.983
The data that I'm not gonna show

00:15:55.983 --> 00:15:58.518
but summarize here, what we found

00:15:58.518 --> 00:16:01.748
is that death from viral inflammation

00:16:01.748 --> 00:16:05.665
was associated with
decline in vital functions,

00:16:06.793 --> 00:16:09.836
like respirations, blood
pressure and so on,

00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:11.533
suggesting that there was a failure

00:16:11.533 --> 00:16:15.079
in autonomic control
centers in the brain stem.

00:16:15.079 --> 00:16:17.788
If mice are given food or glucose

00:16:17.788 --> 00:16:21.755
then these declines in autonomic
functions could be rescued,

00:16:21.755 --> 00:16:24.693
if they're given 2d they're enhanced.

00:16:24.693 --> 00:16:27.192
In contrast death from bacterial sepsis

00:16:27.192 --> 00:16:31.343
was associated with neuronal
damage in the mid-brain area

00:16:31.343 --> 00:16:32.881
and it was also,

00:16:32.881 --> 00:16:36.862
the death was immediately
preceded by convulsions

00:16:36.862 --> 00:16:39.279
and these were blocked by 2DG

00:16:40.617 --> 00:16:43.287
and they were enhanced by glucose.

00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:45.411
So we did PET scan analysis

00:16:45.411 --> 00:16:47.994
and found that glucose utilization

00:16:47.994 --> 00:16:50.254
under conditions of bacterial inflammation

00:16:50.254 --> 00:16:52.375
versus viral inflammation
was very different

00:16:52.375 --> 00:16:56.086
and it segregated exactly
to these two brain areas.

00:16:56.086 --> 00:16:57.822
Such that in viral inflammation

00:16:57.822 --> 00:17:00.132
it was primarily in brain-stem

00:17:00.132 --> 00:17:04.299
and in bacterial inflammation
it was in mid-brain area.

00:17:06.512 --> 00:17:10.679
So the increased delivery
of glucose to these areas

00:17:12.357 --> 00:17:15.359
related to the impact of glucose

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.797
or glucose inhibitors on
the damage to these areas.

00:17:18.797 --> 00:17:21.611
Then we asked what is
the mechanism of damage

00:17:21.611 --> 00:17:23.087
and what's happening there?

00:17:23.087 --> 00:17:26.239
So I will just summarize
that part of the study.

00:17:26.239 --> 00:17:30.244
What we found was that in the
case of viral inflammation

00:17:30.244 --> 00:17:34.262
what happens with cells that
are infected with the virus,

00:17:34.262 --> 00:17:36.156
one of the things that happens

00:17:36.156 --> 00:17:39.242
there is a particular type
of cellular stress response

00:17:39.242 --> 00:17:41.878
known as unfolded protein response

00:17:41.878 --> 00:17:43.544
that has two branches.

00:17:43.544 --> 00:17:46.938
One branch tries to adapt
this stress condition

00:17:46.938 --> 00:17:48.216
and to resolve it

00:17:48.216 --> 00:17:51.701
and if that fails the second
branch would kill the cells

00:17:51.701 --> 00:17:53.719
as a second option.

00:17:53.719 --> 00:17:56.715
This death from this response

00:17:56.715 --> 00:17:59.873
is mediated by this
particular gene called CHOP,

00:17:59.873 --> 00:18:02.206
it's a transcription factor.

00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:08.211
What is known is that glucose deprivation

00:18:08.211 --> 00:18:11.535
can exacerbate unfolded protein response

00:18:11.535 --> 00:18:14.073
in this stress response pathway.

00:18:14.073 --> 00:18:17.020
So we hypothesized that
that brain-stem area,

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.334
the neurons in the brain-stem

00:18:19.334 --> 00:18:22.540
for reasons that remain mysterious,

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.578
underwent this excessive
unfolded protein response stress

00:18:26.578 --> 00:18:29.972
that was ameliorated by glucose

00:18:29.972 --> 00:18:32.474
and exacerbated by 2GD.

00:18:32.474 --> 00:18:34.973
Then we asked whether this pathway

00:18:34.973 --> 00:18:37.269
of cell death or neuronal damage

00:18:37.269 --> 00:18:39.725
mediated by this gene is involved?

00:18:39.725 --> 00:18:42.322
And for that we asked whether mice

00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:44.260
that have a mutation in this gene

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.761
whether they would be rescued

00:18:45.761 --> 00:18:49.403
from the effect of such
inflammatory manipulation?

00:18:49.403 --> 00:18:52.862
And indeed what we found, if
we just look at this blue line,

00:18:52.862 --> 00:18:56.347
these are mice that have infection,

00:18:56.347 --> 00:18:58.952
that have viral inflammation

00:18:58.952 --> 00:19:01.489
and they're given 2GD, they all die.

00:19:01.489 --> 00:19:04.118
If they don't have that gene CHOP,

00:19:04.118 --> 00:19:06.756
then they all survive.

00:19:06.756 --> 00:19:09.830
So the mechanism here
is related to a blockade

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:13.026
of this pathway for neuronal dysfunction.

00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:17.058
Finally in the case of sepsis
of bacterial inflammation

00:19:17.058 --> 00:19:21.529
fasting metabolism that
protected them from death

00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:26.505
was related to the switch
from normal fat metabolism

00:19:26.505 --> 00:19:28.286
to a fasted metabolism,

00:19:28.286 --> 00:19:32.409
there's a switch to fuels
from glucose to ketones

00:19:32.409 --> 00:19:37.198
and that switch was necessary
for mice to survive sepsis

00:19:37.198 --> 00:19:38.681
and this is shown here,

00:19:38.681 --> 00:19:41.049
that giving glucose blocked transition

00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:44.799
to a fasting metabolism
and deletion of the gene

00:19:44.799 --> 00:19:48.047
that is responsible for ketone production

00:19:48.047 --> 00:19:50.714
made mice susceptible to sepsis.

00:19:53.432 --> 00:19:56.401
As I mentioned immediately before death,

00:19:56.401 --> 00:19:58.828
mice had convulsions in sepsis,

00:19:58.828 --> 00:20:02.580
so what we did in this
final set of experiments,

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.870
if we gave the mice anti-epileptic
drugs, or valporic acid,

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.679
then we could rescue them from death

00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:12.346
even when they're given glucose.

00:20:13.677 --> 00:20:15.510
So that indicated that the reason

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:17.653
that that worked is because Valproic acid

00:20:17.653 --> 00:20:19.428
unlike this other drug shown here,

00:20:19.428 --> 00:20:22.665
which is Keppra, which is
also an anti-convulsion drug,

00:20:22.665 --> 00:20:24.860
Valproic acid, one of its mechanisms

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.867
is related to the same
effect that ketones have

00:20:28.867 --> 00:20:33.166
on a particular class
of enzymes in the cell.

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:35.134
I will summarize it here,

00:20:35.134 --> 00:20:38.188
that there are two
different pathways to death

00:20:38.188 --> 00:20:41.282
and fasting metabolism
is protective in one case

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.767
and detrimental in the other case

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:47.934
and the final implication
for human treatment in ICU

00:20:48.842 --> 00:20:51.388
is that all clinical trials done so far

00:20:51.388 --> 00:20:54.631
with nutrient manipulation in ICU units

00:20:54.631 --> 00:20:57.391
have been done on patients

00:20:57.391 --> 00:20:59.551
that have not been separated

00:20:59.551 --> 00:21:03.466
based on class of sepsis,
bacterial versus viral,

00:21:03.466 --> 00:21:06.510
and the results of
these studies were mixed

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.895
and we think that it's because
they were not separated

00:21:08.895 --> 00:21:11.484
and they basically
cancelled each other out.

00:21:11.484 --> 00:21:14.459
Now we are planning to
conduct a clinical trial

00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:18.326
where we'll separate them
based on cause of sepsis.

00:21:18.326 --> 00:21:20.008
So this is the summary

00:21:20.008 --> 00:21:21.785
and finally this work was done

00:21:21.785 --> 00:21:24.035
by three very talented
scientists in the lab,

00:21:24.035 --> 00:21:27.368
Harding Luan, Sarah Huen and Andrew Wong

00:21:28.472 --> 00:21:31.703
and we had help from
other colleagues at Yale.

00:21:31.703 --> 00:21:33.934
Thank you for your attention.
