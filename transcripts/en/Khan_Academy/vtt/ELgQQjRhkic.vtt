00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.688
- Okay we have a passage here.

00:00:01.688 --> 00:00:03.766
It says, "This passage
is adapted from a speech

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:06.865
"delivered by Congresswoman
Barbara Jordan of Texas

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:11.346
"on July 25, 1974, as a member
of the Judiciary Committee

00:00:11.346 --> 00:00:13.947
"of the United States
House of Representatives.

00:00:13.947 --> 00:00:17.081
"In the passage, Jordan
discusses how and when

00:00:17.081 --> 00:00:19.426
"a United States president
may be impeached,

00:00:19.426 --> 00:00:23.339
"or charged with serious
offenses, while in office.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.858
"Jordan's speech was
delivered in the context

00:00:25.858 --> 00:00:27.680
"of impeachment hearings against

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.966
"then president Richard M. Nixon."

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.185
So this is, this is fascinating.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:34.123
Alright, let's start reading it.

00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:37.664
"Today, I am an inquisitor.

00:00:37.664 --> 00:00:40.346
"An hyperbole would not be fictional

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:42.482
"and would not overstate the solemnness

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:44.061
"that I feel right now."

00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:44.780
That's a fascinating statement.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.079
She's saying a hyperbole,
even an exaggeration,

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.298
really isn't an exaggeration.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:49.946
It would not be fictional.

00:00:49.946 --> 00:00:52.721
It would not overstate
how solemn she is feeling.

00:00:52.721 --> 00:00:54.544
So she is feeling quite solemn.

00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:56.935
She's taking this very seriously.

00:00:56.935 --> 00:00:59.443
"My faith in the Constitution is whole;

00:00:59.443 --> 00:01:01.846
"it is complete; it is total.

00:01:01.846 --> 00:01:03.763
"And I am not going to sit here

00:01:03.763 --> 00:01:06.896
"and be an idle spectator
to the diminution,

00:01:06.896 --> 00:01:10.541
"the subversion, the destruction,
of the Constitution."

00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:14.824
These are some serious words
here. Let's keep going.

00:01:14.824 --> 00:01:19.422
"Who can so properly be the
inquisitors for the nation

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:23.404
"as the representatives
of the nation themselves?

00:01:23.404 --> 00:01:27.757
"The subjects of its
jurisdiction are those offenses

00:01:27.757 --> 00:01:31.077
"which proceed from the
misconduct of public men."

00:01:31.077 --> 00:01:32.459
And they have this little asterisk here.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.198
So it looks like if we
go to the bottom of it,

00:01:35.198 --> 00:01:36.754
they're saying "Jordan quotes

00:01:36.754 --> 00:01:39.076
"from Federalist" number 65,

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:40.875
"an essay by Alexander Hamilton

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:43.278
"published in 1788, on the powers

00:01:43.278 --> 00:01:45.519
"of the United States Senate, including

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:47.771
"the power to decide cases of impeachment

00:01:47.771 --> 00:01:51.091
"against a President
of the United States."

00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:55.897
So once again, if we go
back to where we said,

00:01:55.897 --> 00:01:59.380
this is a quote from
The Federalist Papers.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.259
"Who can so properly be the
inquisitors for the nation

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.451
"as the representatives
of the nation themselves?"

00:02:05.451 --> 00:02:06.943
So Hamilton's saying, hey look.

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:09.167
These are the people, you
know, these representatives.

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:10.987
These are the people who
can be the inquisitors

00:02:10.987 --> 00:02:13.994
especially when the offenses proceed

00:02:13.994 --> 00:02:16.815
from the misconduct of public men.

00:02:16.815 --> 00:02:18.591
And that's what we're talking about.

00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:20.147
Now this is her talking again.

00:02:20.147 --> 00:02:23.351
"In other words, the jurisdiction comes

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:26.334
"from the abuse or violation
of some public trust."

00:02:26.334 --> 00:02:29.689
So she's making an argument.
Look Congress has a voice here.

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.883
There's some violation
of the public trust,

00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:35.424
so they are the appropriate inquisitors.

00:02:35.424 --> 00:02:38.733
"It is wrong, I suggest,
it is a misreading

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:40.729
"of the Constitution for any member here

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.831
"to assert that for a member to vote

00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:46.522
"for an article of impeachment
means that that member

00:02:46.522 --> 00:02:48.426
"must be convinced that the President

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:50.342
"should be removed from office."

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:52.002
The Constitution does not say that,

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:53.464
or it "doesn't say that.

00:02:53.464 --> 00:02:55.450
"The powers relating to impeachment

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.969
"are an essential check in the hands

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.302
"of the body of the legislature against

00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:04.110
"and upon the encroachments
of the executive.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.825
"The division between the two
branches of the legislature,

00:03:07.825 --> 00:03:11.447
"the House and the Senate,
assigning to the one

00:03:11.447 --> 00:03:14.349
"the right to accuse..." That's the House.

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.066
"and to the other the right
to judge - the framers

00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:19.469
"of this Constitution were very astute.

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.605
"They did not make the accusers

00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:24.182
"and the judges...the same person."

00:03:24.182 --> 00:03:26.289
Fascinating.

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.439
"We know the nature of impeachment.

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.539
"We have been talking
about it a while now.

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.197
"It is chiefly designed for the President

00:03:36.197 --> 00:03:40.783
"and his high ministers to
somehow be called into account.

00:03:40.783 --> 00:03:44.056
"It is designed to 'bridle' the executive

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:46.727
"if he engages in excesses.

00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:50.941
"It is designed as a
method of national inquest

00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:54.063
"into the conduct of public men.

00:03:54.063 --> 00:03:54.922
"The framers--"

00:03:54.922 --> 00:03:58.765
She's quoting again from
the Federalist papers.

00:03:58.765 --> 00:04:00.959
They have the asterisk there.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.560
"The framers confided in the Congress

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.658
"the power, if need be,
to remove the President

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:10.304
"in order to strike a delicate balance

00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:12.742
"between a President swollen with power

00:04:12.742 --> 00:04:15.784
"and grown tyrannical, and preservation

00:04:15.784 --> 00:04:19.104
"of the independence of the executive."

00:04:19.104 --> 00:04:20.578
So there's a balance, that the president

00:04:20.578 --> 00:04:22.656
is swollen with power
and grown tyrannical.

00:04:22.656 --> 00:04:25.617
Hey, maybe that's an
appropriate time for impeachment

00:04:25.617 --> 00:04:27.881
or even removal of the president.

00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:29.517
But then you also have to preserve

00:04:29.517 --> 00:04:31.003
the independence of the executive.

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:33.139
That's what the balance of power is.

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.982
"The nature of impeachment: a
narrowly channeled exception

00:04:36.982 --> 00:04:39.455
"to the separation of powers maxim."

00:04:39.455 --> 00:04:40.639
So once again, it's an exception

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.854
that typically the
president and the Congress

00:04:43.854 --> 00:04:46.037
should be separate, but the Congress

00:04:46.037 --> 00:04:48.579
starts to have jurisdiction
when the president

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:51.679
does something really over-the-top.

00:04:51.679 --> 00:04:55.302
"The Federal Convention of 1787 said that.

00:04:55.302 --> 00:04:58.470
"It limited impeachment to high crimes,

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.140
"to high crimes and misdemeanors,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.011
"and discounted and opposed
the term 'maladministration.'"

00:05:05.011 --> 00:05:05.975
So they're saying, hey look.

00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:07.507
Impeachment isn't just
'cause you don't think

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:09.603
the president is doing a great job

00:05:09.603 --> 00:05:11.576
or, you know, does something slightly bad.

00:05:11.576 --> 00:05:14.233
It's for high crimes and misdemeanors.

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:16.593
High crimes and misdemeanors.

00:05:16.593 --> 00:05:19.977
"'It is to be used only
for great misdemeanors,'

00:05:19.977 --> 00:05:21.927
"so it was said in the North Carolina

00:05:21.927 --> 00:05:23.831
"ratification convention.

00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:26.431
"And in the Virginia
ratification convention:

00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:29.554
"'We do not trust our liberty
to a particular branch.

00:05:29.554 --> 00:05:33.844
"'We need one branch to check the other.'

00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:37.356
"The North Carolina
ratification convention--"

00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:38.772
So this is what they said:

00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:42.591
"'No one need be afraid that
officers who commit oppression

00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:44.971
"'will pass with immunity.'

00:05:44.971 --> 00:05:47.270
"'Prosecutions of impeachments will seldom

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.659
"'fail to agitate the passions
of the whole community,'

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:53.956
"said Hamilton in the
Federalist Papers, number 65.

00:05:53.956 --> 00:05:57.544
"'We divide into parties
more or less friendly

00:05:57.544 --> 00:05:58.739
"'or inimical--"

00:05:58.739 --> 00:06:01.723
Or inimical. Inimical. I always
have trouble saying that.

00:06:01.723 --> 00:06:04.799
"'inimical to the accused.'

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:07.643
"I do not mean political
parties in that sense."

00:06:07.643 --> 00:06:09.385
So in the Federalist Papers, hey you know

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:13.576
if there is a prosecution of impeachment,

00:06:13.576 --> 00:06:16.118
people are going to
have opinions about it.

00:06:16.118 --> 00:06:19.136
It's going to agitate the
passions of the whole community.

00:06:19.136 --> 00:06:21.203
People are going to "divide into parties"

00:06:21.203 --> 00:06:24.534
that are either for the impeachment

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:27.414
or against the impeachment

00:06:27.414 --> 00:06:30.142
and hopefully not along party lines.

00:06:30.142 --> 00:06:31.477
Just people who are sympathetic

00:06:31.477 --> 00:06:33.694
to the impeachment or not.

00:06:33.694 --> 00:06:36.736
"The drawing of political
lines goes to the motivation

00:06:36.736 --> 00:06:39.452
"behind impeachment; but impeachment

00:06:39.452 --> 00:06:41.832
"must proceed within the confines

00:06:41.832 --> 00:06:43.353
"of the constitutional term

00:06:43.353 --> 00:06:45.941
"'high crime[s] and misdemeanors.'

00:06:45.941 --> 00:06:48.658
"Of the impeachment process,
it was Woodrow Wilson

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:53.418
"who said that, 'Nothing
short of the grossest offenses

00:06:53.418 --> 00:06:55.461
"'against the plain law of the land

00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:58.793
"'will suffice to give them
speed and effectiveness.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.094
"'Indignation--'"

00:07:00.094 --> 00:07:01.614
So this is kind of disapproval.

00:07:01.614 --> 00:07:05.735
'"so great as to overgrow party interest

00:07:05.735 --> 00:07:09.055
"'may secure a conviction;
but nothing else can.'"

00:07:09.055 --> 00:07:11.017
So once again, the drawing
of political lines.

00:07:11.017 --> 00:07:12.480
You know, obviously one party,

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.092
especially the opposing
party of the president,

00:07:15.092 --> 00:07:16.893
they're gonna be the ones
that are gonna motivate,

00:07:16.893 --> 00:07:19.692
be motivated to maybe start
impeachment proceedings.

00:07:19.692 --> 00:07:21.790
But the indignation, the disapproval

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.135
of what the president has done

00:07:24.135 --> 00:07:26.722
has to be great enough
to overcome party lines

00:07:26.722 --> 00:07:30.239
in order to "secure a conviction."

00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:32.039
So it can't just be,
or it shouldn't just be

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:36.696
one party trying to do
something political.

00:07:38.126 --> 00:07:39.939
"Common sense would be revolted

00:07:39.939 --> 00:07:44.008
"if we engaged upon this
process for petty reasons.

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:48.321
"Congress has a lot to do:
appropriations, tax reform,

00:07:48.321 --> 00:07:51.513
"health insurance,
campaign finance reform--"

00:07:51.513 --> 00:07:52.221
It's amazing.

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:54.497
They were talking about a
lot of this stuff in 1974,

00:07:54.497 --> 00:07:55.901
and they still are.

00:07:55.901 --> 00:07:58.420
"housing, environmental protection,

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.311
"energy sufficiency, mass transportation.

00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:04.631
"Pettiness cannot be
allowed to stand in the face

00:08:04.631 --> 00:08:07.092
"of such overwhelming problems.

00:08:07.092 --> 00:08:09.472
"So today we're not being petty.

00:08:09.472 --> 00:08:12.200
"We're trying to be big, because the task

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.996
"we have before us is a big one."

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:20.101
So she is taking this
very, very, very seriously.
