00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.340
Smarty pants, egg head, brainiac.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.250
You've heard terms like these before, maybe
you've even been on the receiving end of one

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.250
of them.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.580
But actually, defining intelligence is a lot
trickier than just coming up with new names

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.580
for smart people.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.970
I mean, intelligence isn't like height or
weight; you can't just toss them on a scale

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.270
and give it an exact measurement.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.859
It has different meanings for different cultures
and ages and skill sets.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:23.460
So what is intelligence?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.760
It's a question that doesn't give us a lot
of answers, but it does open a bunch of other

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.640
equally important and interesting questions.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.230
Like, what influences it?

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.579
And how can it be assessed?

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.000
Is it a single, general ability, or does it
cover a range of aptitudes and skills and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
talents?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.250
How do things like creativity and innovation
factor in?

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.940
Or genetics or environment, or education?

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.329
And what about emotional intelligence?

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.930
Most agree that it's best to think of intelligence
not of a concrete thing so much as a concept,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.250
the ability to learn from experience, solve
problems, and use knowledge to adapt to new

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.250
experiences.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.170
We've often used intelligence tests, to assess
and compare mental aptitude, but these tests

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.920
have a long, complex and dark history.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.860
I mean there are Nazis involved so, yeah.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.760
So as you'll see, there are reasons that intelligence
is one of the most hotly debated subjects

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.300
in psychology.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:17.180
It's complicated and controversial.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.790
[Intro]

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.130
What if I'm the world's greatest Rubik's cube
solver but a terrible speller?

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.640
Or a truly gifted artist who's barely mastered
long division?

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.710
Could anyone say I was intelligent or not
based on those different aptitudes, or would

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.280
it be more accurate to measure my brainpower
on several different scales?

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.040
Around the turn of the twentieth century,
British psychologist Charles Spearman suggested

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.950
that yes, we do have one comprehensive general
intelligence that underlies all of specific

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.950
mental abilities.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.290
He called it the G-Factor.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.170
Spearman conceded that while people may have
special talents like basket weaving or saxophone

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.550
solos or doing crossword puzzles, those things
still fell under "G".

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.860
And he helped develop a statistical procedure
called factor analysis to try to determine

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.480
how certain clusters of skills might correlate
with another one.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.450
Like, say someone who tests well in spatial
skills might be good with numbers.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.250
We might then refer to that cluster of skills,
that factor, as spatial-numeric reasoning.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.909
But to Spearman, the G-factor was something
of an uber-factor connected to all intelligent

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.359
behavior from architecture to healing to survival
skills, and it's why people who do well on

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.080
one kind of cognitive test tend to do well
on others.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.980
But as you can imagine, reducing intelligence
to a single numerical test score was and is

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:33.980
problematic.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.599
L.L. Thurstone, an American pioneer of psychometrics
and one of Spearman's first challengers, was

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.099
not into ranking people on a single scale.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.969
Thurstone administered 56 different tests
to his subjects then used them to identify

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.379
seven clusters of mental abilities.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.629
By this system, you might turn out to be great
at like verbal comprehension but less stellar

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:54.480
at something like numerical ability.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.480
Sounds fair.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.469
But when researchers followed up on his findings,
they actually did see that high scores in

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:03.239
one aptitude usually meant good scores in
the others, essentially backing up some evidence

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.139
for some kind of G-factor.

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.019
Even though their ideas did not often align,
Spearman and Thurstone together paved the

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.599
way for more contemporary theories on intelligence.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.540
For example, American psychologist Howard
Gardner views intelligence as multiple abilities

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.049
that come in different forms.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.110
He references instances of brain damage where
one ability may be destroyed while others

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.519
stay perfectly intact.

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.800
Savants usually have some limited metal abilities
but one exceptional ability when it comes

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.909
to like, computing figures or memorizing the
complete works of Shakespeare.

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:33.879
To Gardner, this suggests that we have multiple
intelligences beyond the G-factor.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:40.200
In fact, he believes that we have eight intelligences,
ranging from our skills with numbers and words

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.459
to our ability to understand physical space
and the natural world.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.060
American psychologist Robert Sternberg tends
to agree with Gardner, though he boils them

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:52.220
down into three intelligences: analytical,
or problem-solving intelligence, creative

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.620
intelligence, or the ability to adapt to new
situations, and practical intelligence for

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:57.650
everyday tasks.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.620
Both of these models seem reasonable, too,
and Gardner and Sternberg's work has helped

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.620
teachers appreciate students' variety of talents.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.189
But research has suggested that even these
different ways to be smart are also linked

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.319
by some underlying general intelligence factor.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.470
So what about other less tangible forms of
intelligence, like creativity, our ability

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.500
to produce ideas that are both novel and valuable?

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.380
How can a test that demands one correct answer
account for more creative solutions, so-called

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.400
"divergent thinking".

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.350
Well, traditional intelligence tests can't,
and so far, while we do have some tests that

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.230
look at creative potential, we don't have
a standardized system for quantifying creativity.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.970
But Sternberg and his colleagues have identified
five main components of creativity, which

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.730
are useful for framing our understanding of
what creative intelligence is and how it works.

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.790
If you go through the list, you know who I
think is really great at almost all of them?

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.790
Sherlock Holmes.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.790
Hear me out.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.510
First we've got expertise, or a well-developed
base of knowledge.

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.200
This just means knowing a lot about a lot.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.130
Whether it's arcane poisons, jellyfish behavior,
or how to recognize a secret passage behind

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.810
a book shelf, expertise provides the mind
with all sorts of data to work with and combine

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.170
in new ways.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.470
Obviously Sherlock has incredible imaginative
thinking skills, too, which provide him with

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.660
the ability to see things in new ways, recognize
patterns and make connections.

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.600
He loves nothing more than rehashing these
breadcrumb trails for the dopey constables

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.910
at the end of the case.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.250
Sternberg also thought a venturesome personality
contributes to creativity.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.520
By hanging around opium dens and chasing thugs
and generally courting danger, Sherlock routinely

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.110
seeks new experiences, tolerates risk, and
perseveres in overcoming obstacles.

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:37.270
And everyone knows he's driven by intrinsic
motivation.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.141
I mean, he wants to help the widow discover
the thief and everything, but really, Sherlock

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:44.590
is driven by his own interest and sense of
challenge.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.910
He gets pleasure from the work itself.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.710
And finally, Sherlock benefits from a creative
environment which sparks, supports, and refines

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.780
his ideas.

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.500
For so affectionately maintaining this environment
on Sherlock's behalf, we largely have Dr.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.730
Watson to thank.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.440
Sherlock was obviously an academic and creative
genius, but he was pretty weak in another

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.510
form of intelligence: the emotional kind.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.220
Emotional intelligence, defined in 1997 by
psychologist Peter Salovey and John Mayer

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.200
-- no, not, not that one-- is the ability
to perceive, understand, manage, and use emotions.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.470
I don't know about you, but I know plenty
of smart people who have a hard time processing

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.120
social information.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.770
The most brilliant mathematician may struggle
to communicate with colleagues, neighbors,

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:28.830
or staff at the local deli.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.040
Likewise, Sherlock often annoys, offends,
or even baffles those around him.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:38.810
Perceiving emotions means being able to recognize
them in faces, and even in music, film, and

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:39.810
stories.

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.800
Understanding emotions relates to being able
to predict them and how they might change.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.470
And managing emotions comes down to knowing
how to appropriately express yourself in various

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:48.470
situations.

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:53.170
And finally, emotional intelligence also means
using emotions to enable adaptive or creative

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:56.910
thinking; like knowing how to manage conflict
or comfort a grieving friend or work well

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.910
with others.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.450
Much like creative intelligence, emotional
intelligence can be measured to some degree

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:05.840
through testing, but there's no standardized
way to, like, assign a numerical value.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:11.110
So if we can't perfectly quantify things like
creativity or emotional smarts, how did we

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.570
come up with a way to measure intelligence?

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:16.580
Well, as I mentioned earlier, it's a sordid
story.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.860
The first attempts to do it in the western
world began with English scientist Francis

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.990
Galton in the 1800s.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:26.560
Taking a page from his famous cousin Charles
Darwin's theories on natural selection, Galton

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.650
wondered how that premise might extend to
humans' natural ability when it came to intelligence.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.660
He suggested that our smarts have a lot to
do with heredity, so if we encouraged smart

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.830
people to breed with each other, we could
essentially create a master race of geniuses.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:47.820
If that sounds a little sketchy, it's because
it was, like, really, really sketchy!!

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:53.100
This study of how to selectively and supposedly
improve the human population, especially by

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.170
encouraging breeding in some people and discouraging
it in others, is called "eugenics".

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:01.560
A term Galton himself coined, and I'll get
back to, in a minute.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.930
But around the turn of the twentieth century
when eugenics was taking off, the French government

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:08.140
mandated that all children must attend school.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.850
Many of these kids had never been in a classroom
and teachers wanted to figure out how they

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.000
could identify kids who needed extra help.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.730
Enter Alfred Binet and Theodore Simon, two
French psychologists who were commissioned

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.200
to develop a test to measure a child's so-called
mental age.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.271
The concept of a kid's mental age is essentially
the level of performance associated with a

00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:27.440
certain chronological age.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.630
So if six year old Bruno tests as well as
the average six year old, he'd have a mental

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:32.659
age of six.

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:36.870
Binet believed that his tests could measure
a child's current mental abilities, but that

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.479
intelligence wasn't a fixed, inborn thing.

00:08:39.479 --> 00:08:43.279
He believed a person's capabilities could
be raised with proper attention, self-discipline

00:08:43.279 --> 00:08:44.279
and practice.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:46.670
In other words, he was no eugenicist.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:50.930
He was hoping that his tests would improve
children's education by identifying those

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:52.480
who needed extra attention.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.160
But Binet also feared that these tests would,
in the wrong hands, be used to do just the

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.750
opposite: labeling children as "lost causes",
limiting their opportunities.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.100
And wow, was he on to something because that
is pretty much exactly what happened.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:10.990
German psychologist William Stern used revisions
of Binet and Simon's work to create the famous

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:13.449
intelligence quotient, or IQ measurement.

00:09:13.449 --> 00:09:18.970
At the time, your IQ was simply your mental
age, divided by your chronological age, multiplied

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:19.970
by a hundred.

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:24.810
So for example Bruno is six, and so is his
mental age, so his IQ ranks at a hundred,

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:29.420
but his little sister Betty is a four year-old
with a mental age of five, so her IQ would

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:30.420
be 125.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.620
That formula works pretty well for measuring
kids, but it falls apart when it comes to

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:37.120
adults who don't hit measurable developmental
steps like kids do.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.960
I mean there's no real difference between
a mental age of 34 and 35.

00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.470
But Stanford professor Lewis Terman started
promoting the widespread use of intelligence

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:50.089
tests in the early 1900s, and with his help
the US government began the world's first

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:54.949
massive ministration of intelligence tests,
when it assessed World War I army recruits

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:56.749
and immigrants fresh off the boat.

00:09:56.749 --> 00:10:01.370
Unlike Binet, Terman did use these numerical
findings as a kind of label, and he thought

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:07.509
his tests could, as he put it: "ultimately
result in curtailing the reproduction of feeble-mindedness".

00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:11.990
This kind of testing played right into eugenicists'
sensibilities, and soon the eugenics movement

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.050
in the US had a pretty good fanclub, raising
money from the Carnegie's and Rockafeller's

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:19.309
and with proponents working at Harvard and
Columbia and Cornell.

00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:23.680
In the first half of the 21st century, intelligence
tests were used to enforce the sterilization

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:28.410
of about 60,000 people, around a third of
whom were in California.

00:10:28.410 --> 00:10:31.889
Most were poor white women, often unwed mothers
or prostitutes.

00:10:31.889 --> 00:10:35.579
Other eugenics efforts persisted later into
the century, and there is evidence of poor

00:10:35.579 --> 00:10:40.970
African American, Native American, or Latina
women being forcibly or covertly sterilized

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:43.140
in large numbers as recently as the 1970s.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.240
But do you know who really loved their eugenics?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:47.240
The Nazis.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:51.069
Hitler and his cronies took the idea of intelligence
testing to even darker conclusions.

00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:56.360
The Nazis were all about selecting against
so-called "feeble-mindedness" and other undesirable

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.899
traits as they sought to strengthen what they
saw as their Aryan nation.

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:03.879
They sterilized or simply executed hundreds
of thousands of victims based of their answers

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:08.120
to IQ test questions that were really more
abut adhering to social norms than measuring

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:09.699
actual intelligence.

00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:12.790
Questions like: "Who was Bismarck?" and "What
does Christmas signify?"

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.189
So you can see how this terrifying history
still makes some people leery of how such

00:11:17.189 --> 00:11:20.050
tests are administered, interpreted, and weighted.

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:23.670
Today we understand that intelligence, as
defined by all the people we've talked about

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:27.320
here, does appear to be a real and measurable
phenomenon.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:32.189
But no one can say that they've disentangled
all of the would-be genetic, environmental,

00:11:32.189 --> 00:11:34.910
educational, and socio-economic components
of it.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.430
In the end, it's best to think of intelligence
as something about which we've still got a

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:39.430
lot to learn.

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:43.990
And next week, we'll talk about how we test
intelligence today and the problems we still

00:11:43.990 --> 00:11:45.220
face in doing it.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:49.189
Today, your intelligent mind learned about
the history of how we think about and define

00:11:49.189 --> 00:11:54.209
different types of intelligence, what the
G-factor is, and how Sherlock Holmes is incredibly

00:11:54.209 --> 00:11:56.589
intelligent but emotionally unintelligent.

00:11:56.589 --> 00:12:00.680
You also learned about the history and methods
of intelligence testing, IQ scores, and how

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:05.379
eugenics turned to the dark side, and has
since made even talking about intelligence

00:12:05.379 --> 00:12:06.379
kind of controversial.

00:12:06.379 --> 00:12:10.170
