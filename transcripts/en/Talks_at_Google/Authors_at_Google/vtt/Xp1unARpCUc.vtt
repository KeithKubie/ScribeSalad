CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: So I feel
that an introduction for Salman

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.670
Rushdie is almost unnecessary.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.960
Nonetheless, here we go.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.510
We are delighted to welcome
Salman Rushdie to discuss

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.840
his 12th novel,
"Two Years, Eight

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.272
Months, and Twenty-Eight Days."

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:20.230
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Nights.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.740
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Nights.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.990
Excellent start.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.680
Anyway, it's now being 26 years,
seven months, and 28 days,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.900
or nights, since the fatwa
against Rushdie was announced,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.960
and 17 years in 14 days
since the government of Iran

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.960
announced a public commitment
that it would neither

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.910
support nor hinder
assassination operations.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.440
However, it's only one of
the many stories that make up

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.150
the life of Salmon Rushdie.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.580
He was born in Bombay
and educated there

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.340
and it Rugby School
and Warwickshire

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.220
before reading
history at Cambridge.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.880
Before turning to
literature full time,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.830
he worked as a
copywriter for Ogilvy,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.750
and while there he wrote a
small book that some of you

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.200
may have heard of called
"Midnight's Children."

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.800
This went on to win the 1981
Booker Prize for fiction,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.300
the Booker of Bookers for the
best novels among the Booker

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.950
prize winners for fiction
at its 25th anniversary,

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.420
and finally the
best of the Bookers,

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.620
awarded to commemorate the
prize's 40th anniversary.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.790
He's completed 12 novels, two
children's books, and a memoir

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.230
along with three edited
collections and other essays

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.360
and works of nonfiction.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.740
He's an emblem of
and strong proponent

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.050
shouting for human rights
and freedom of speech.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.050
He's a fellow of the Royal
Society of literature

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.330
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] and in 2007
was knighted for his services

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.330
to literature.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.930
So again, please
welcome Salman Rushdie.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.390
So we're here to talk about
your new book, "Two Years, Eight

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.020
Months, and
Twenty-Eight Nights."

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.710
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Which is 1,001.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.110
I know you're a very
mathematical audience,

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.120
but as the internet
already tells me,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.750
it doesn't work if
there's a leap year.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.690
To which all I can say
is there's no leap year.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.250
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: So in a
recent interview in Canada,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.010
where I'm from, you said
in reference the tails,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.210
the "1,001 Nights"
and other myths

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.796
that realism showed up later in
your life and seemed inferior.

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:26.170
So it would be
great if you could

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.770
start by telling us a
little bit about the djinn

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:29.832
in this particular novel.

00:02:29.832 --> 00:02:31.790
What brought you to the
djinn and their stories

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.910
as a way of grounding a much
larger cultural narrative

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.524
or battle?

00:02:35.524 --> 00:02:37.190
SALMAN RUSHDIE: If
you grow up in India,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.210
you grow up with the djinn.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.690
They're everywhere.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.750
People will still use
them colloquially.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.201
If you're car has a flat tire,
you say that a djinn did it.

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:52.920
If you knock over
a glass of wine,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.730
it's always somebody
else's fault.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.560
It may as well be a
supernatural creature.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.170
So these stories are things
that you grow up with,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.040
and the djinn-- basically
they're quite mischievous.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.110
On a scale, they range
from ordinary mischief

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.995
to something much
more malevolent.

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:23.190
So I'd had them in
the back of my head,

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.700
and when I found
myself wanting to write

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.650
a novel about a world in
which things were going badly

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.470
wrong in many ways, it seemed
that these creatures whose job

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.920
it was to make things
go very badly wrong

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.937
seemed like an obvious
metaphor to reach for.

00:03:42.937 --> 00:03:45.270
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: But as
creatures they also-- Dunya,

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.311
the princes of the djinn.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.740
SALMAN RUSHDIE: I'm assuming
that there are nice ones,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.060
but I said basically
made them up.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.610
Yes, I suppose the main
female character of the novel

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.440
is a princess of the djinn
who is unlike the others--

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.000
somebody who is actually very
fond of human beings in general

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.420
and one in particular.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:16.355
And when her less pleasant
fellow djinn attack the earth,

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:17.980
she's the one who
comes to the defense.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.500
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Oh,
and she comes out swinging.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.166
It's not just a little
bit of a defense.

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:25.209
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah,
she's a badass creature.

00:04:25.209 --> 00:04:26.750
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
So in the novel,

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.544
she rallies here descendants.

00:04:28.544 --> 00:04:30.460
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yes,
because she's been here--

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.720
the story suggests
that hundreds of years

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.880
ago in the 12th century
she visited the earth

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.120
and had a love affair
with an Arab philosopher

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.970
and produced
supernatural numbers

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.250
of children, which
gradually over the centuries

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.570
coming down to the present day
had spread across the world.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.940
And when there's this assault
on the earth by the dark djinn,

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:56.050
she comes back and
sort of, as it were,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.060
reactivates her
descendants, who in some way

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.570
are partly djinn as well
in order to fight back.

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.325
So it's a sort of war of
the worlds story, I guess.

00:05:06.325 --> 00:05:08.200
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
And so one of the things

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.160
I found very interesting was
this supernatural epic battle

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.810
that takes place at the
climax, and on the one hand,

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.976
we seem to have reason and on
the other faith or religion.

00:05:17.976 --> 00:05:19.600
Do you think there's
any way of finding

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.500
a common ground
between those two,

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.160
or are we destined to fight?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.314
Is there a synthesis
or just a battle?

00:05:25.314 --> 00:05:26.730
SALMAN RUSHDIE:
Are you asking me?

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.707
I think no.

00:05:28.707 --> 00:05:31.040
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: But then
what do we do in response?

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.110
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Excuse me?

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:33.180
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: What
do we do if there's--

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.804
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Oh,
I think we can just

00:05:34.804 --> 00:05:37.720
start understanding that
the real fairytale is God

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.860
and get rid of it.

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.350
I'm very much of the
Christopher Hitchens persuasion

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:48.420
in this matter, who is
one of my close friends,

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.260
and so we agree about
the fact that religion

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.870
has become a very big
problem in the world,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.760
and it's very
strange because when

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.104
I was young-- I mean in the
mid '60s when I was a college,

00:06:05.104 --> 00:06:06.520
nobody ever talked
about religion.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.950
Religion just sort
of disappeared.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:13.160
The idea that it would return
to become a colossal force

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:20.020
in the world would have
seemed absurd 15 years ago,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.410
and yet there it is, sitting
in the middle of the room.

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.800
And so even though
I'm not particularly--

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.320
I'm not at all a
religious person--

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.090
I find myself writing
about it quite a lot,

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.492
because it seems to me
there's no way of not

00:06:34.492 --> 00:06:35.950
writing about it
because it becomes

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.320
such an important subject.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:42.050
So I would really like never
to write about it again.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:43.900
That would be my preference.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.210
In fact, I've kind
of promised myself

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.800
that the next book will have
no mention of religion in it,

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.300
but I've been saying this
to myself for a long time,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.670
and I keep failing.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:54.707
So there we are.

00:06:54.707 --> 00:06:56.290
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
So is it religion

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:58.570
is a grand narrative that
draws you back, or did--

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.420
SALMAN RUSHDIE: No, it's just
because of its public function

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:02.920
these days, and I think--
because my view is that I

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:08.450
haven't-- the private practice
of religion in my view is not

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.410
my business.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:13.670
If there are people who
find it valuable to them,

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:18.780
nourishing, consoling, whatever,
that's just not my business.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.820
That's their business,
and it's only

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.420
when it becomes a
public force, when

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:30.370
it starts telling other people
how to behave or trying to,

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.470
then I think it becomes
everyone's business,

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:34.505
and that's sort of
what's happened.

00:07:34.505 --> 00:07:36.880
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: One of
the things we like to do is--

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:37.730
SALMAN RUSHDIE: By
the way, just to say

00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.188
that the point about the djinn--
one of the things I really

00:07:40.188 --> 00:07:43.060
like about them is
that they're pre--

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.960
they do exist in the
Islamic tradition,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.190
but they're actually
pre-Islamic.

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:50.015
They're actually
ancient pagan creatures,

00:07:50.015 --> 00:07:51.640
and one of the things
I like about them

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.030
is that quite a lot of
them don't necessarily

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.010
believe in God either.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:06.960
So to them God is just as weird
an idea as the djinn are to us,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.495
and that made them
appealing to me.

00:08:09.495 --> 00:08:10.870
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
We certainly

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.780
see that in this epic
clash between the two sides

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.204
that you have on
the one hand you

00:08:17.204 --> 00:08:18.870
have Dunya, who is
fighting for humanity

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:22.020
and is trying to save humanity,
which she successfully does,

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.260
but on the other,
you say, oh well,

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.920
if that's what
you'd like us to do.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.900
SALMAN RUSHDIE: The
problem with the djinn

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.890
is that one of them
in the novel gets

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.510
kind of infected with
religion, but most of them

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:36.370
just want to cause
trouble and take over,

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.685
and they're actually
not very good at it,

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.060
because the thing
about the djinn

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.230
is that they are
very bad at focusing.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.330
They have a sort of form of ADD.

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:47.790
They get bored easily.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.900
They get distracted.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.840
So even when they're trying
to conquer the world,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.129
they decide, well,
maybe not today.

00:08:54.129 --> 00:08:56.420
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Or
there's the scene where the sea

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.260
creature emerges over the Staten
Island ferry, and it has a nap.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.510
SALMAN RUSHDIE: They have
these metamorphic abilities,

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.718
so they can turn themselves
into all kinds of things,

00:09:03.718 --> 00:09:05.660
and one of them
turns into a monster

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:08.377
and eats the Staten Island
ferry, I'm sorry to say.

00:09:08.377 --> 00:09:10.460
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: But
then he has a nap, right?

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.160
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Huh?

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.410
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Then he has a nap.

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:14.100
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Then
he has a nap, exactly.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:15.500
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: That
takes a couple of months.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.580
So it's quite
interesting to see even

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.332
in the midst of this battle.

00:09:19.332 --> 00:09:20.540
SALMAN RUSHDIE: They're lazy.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.110
The djinn are very
lazy, which is useful,

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.587
because it makes
them defeatable.

00:09:28.587 --> 00:09:30.420
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
And one of the things--

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:31.710
they're fantastic creatures.

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:33.459
So one of the things
we learn in the novel

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:36.680
is that stories are a curse
and the antidote at the same,

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:37.732
nested inside each other.

00:09:37.732 --> 00:09:40.190
This is the climax of the book,
and I found this incredible

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.440
that we can't pull them apart.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.850
We can't see where they
start, see where they end.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.790
They're nested together.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.390
So what do you think the
place for stories is?

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.060
SALMAN RUSHDIE: You see, the
reason for that-- first of all,

00:09:52.060 --> 00:09:55.590
there is in the tradition in
books like the "1,001 Nights"--

00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:59.820
those books are very fond of
the idea of the nested stories

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:04.120
and Chinese box stories, a story
in which somebody says that

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:08.530
reminds me of a story, and tells
you a story in which somebody

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:12.570
says there's a story
about that, and so on.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:14.050
So that's there
in the literature,

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:17.930
but it struck me
that in many ways--

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:20.330
and many of those
stories don't finish.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.240
They get interrupted,
and it seemed to me

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:27.740
in many ways that's quite a
true portrait of how we live,

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.050
that we all live-- we are
ourselves an unfinished story,

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:36.010
because here we are being
the story of ourselves,

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:39.410
and surrounding us
like concentric circles

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.080
of continuing stories.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:45.930
So there's, let's say, the
story of our family and friends

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.160
around us, and
around that there's

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.780
a larger story of community,
and maybe the story of a city,

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.100
or the story of a
country, or et cetera.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.970
So we are there in the middle
of these concentric circles

00:10:57.970 --> 00:10:59.560
of stories, and
they're not ended.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.140
They're continuing.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:04.240
So we all live in these
unfinished stories,

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.420
and so I thought that was
just a useful way of talking

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.711
about what life is like.

00:11:08.711 --> 00:11:11.210
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: And I love
the metaphor-- an indigenous

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.390
writer have read for my own
research in the past talks

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.650
about these concentric
circles of stories,

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:18.130
but they intersect
as well, right?

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.050
SALMAN RUSHDIE: And
they intersect as well.

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.250
They infect each other.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:21.760
A wonderful example
of this is-- I

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.384
didn't know how many
of you have seen--

00:11:23.384 --> 00:11:26.390
there's a wonderful film by
Pedro Almodovar called "Talk

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:32.070
to Her," and in that film,
he does this, where somebody

00:11:32.070 --> 00:11:35.480
starts telling a story, and
the film goes into that story,

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:37.590
and in that story
there's another story,

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.400
and it goes down
about five levels.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.900
And then they all end, one after
the other, boom, boom, boom,

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.890
boom, boom, like that.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:48.130
And it's an amazing effect,
and he does it with such skill

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.300
that you're never confused.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.530
You know exactly where
you are, but it's

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:57.000
a very appealing
thing, and I had--

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.710
there's a chapter in the book
where the stories start diving

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:03.960
into other stories,
and it was one

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.530
of the more difficult
chapters to write

00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:08.940
because you want
the reader to still

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:11.370
have a sense of a through line.

00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:14.310
There's a reason
why you're doing it,

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.560
but it was also one of the
most fun chapters to write.

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.030
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Yeah, it was.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:20.760
I very much enjoyed it.

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.320
Before we open it
up to the audience,

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:25.760
we have a few crowdsourced
questions, and a lot of them

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.000
not surprisingly
were about religion.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.640
So what one was,
what can be done

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.770
to ensure religion is not
being taken literally,

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.220
and do you believe our--

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.660
SALMAN RUSHDIE: What can I
do that religion is not what?

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.750
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Being taken literally.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.150
And do you believe our own
political correctness prevents

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.387
us from tackling
the problem head on?

00:12:42.387 --> 00:12:43.970
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well,
what can be done

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:47.150
is to-- I think that two
parts of the question

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:51.190
are related, because it seems
to me the way you confront

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.720
ideas that you don't
like is to confront them

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.790
and argue about them.

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:04.400
And there has grown up
a conventional wisdom

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.250
that somehow religion
should be excused

00:13:07.250 --> 00:13:12.700
from that kind of criticism,
and frankly I don't see why.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:16.480
It seems to me that's it's
one idea amongst many ideas,

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.850
and one of the-- kind
of a central part

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.040
of the nature of
intellectual life

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.770
is to question all
ideas, to submit them

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:29.940
to a rigorous interrogation,
particularly when

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:33.170
you begin to see that they're
capable of giving rise

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.610
to very unpleasant effects.

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:40.430
So yeah, I do think there
is a problem of PC where

00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:43.054
people are-- and I
don't think it's only

00:13:43.054 --> 00:13:43.970
political correctness.

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:45.910
I think it's also
fear, because there

00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:47.800
have been a number
of, as you know,

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.360
violent attacks on people who
have been critical of religion.

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.342
That, again, makes people
worried about doing it,

00:13:56.342 --> 00:13:58.050
but I think it's very
important to do it.

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.050
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
And it also ignores

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.400
centuries of religious
philosophical tradition, right?

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:01.740
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah.

00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:02.360
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
We have centuries

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.460
of arguing about religion--

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:03.805
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Exactly.

00:14:03.805 --> 00:14:05.030
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: --in
good constructive ways.

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.990
SALMAN RUSHDIE:
Yeah, and there's

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.850
one thing about-- there's two
ways of arguing about religion.

00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:11.080
One is from inside, and
the other is from outside.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.200
So of course all religions
have theological disputes

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:23.080
and evolve in a
way through that,

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.320
but it's also important
to be able to come

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.990
at the subject from
outside so that you don't

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:30.710
have to be bound by the
rules of the religion,

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.230
because I think
one of the problems

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.740
of the interior argument
is that you can't really

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.210
question first principles.

00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:39.030
You can't question
the existence of God.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:42.380
You can't question the
nature of revelation,

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:43.960
and it seems to
me that, if you're

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.459
going to really
talk about religion,

00:14:45.459 --> 00:14:49.600
you have to question
both those things.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.260
But I think both forms of
discourse have their place,

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:54.624
yes.

00:14:54.624 --> 00:14:56.540
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Another related question,

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:58.640
which I'll touch on
because I quite liked it,

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:00.598
but I think you might
have answered most of it.

00:15:00.598 --> 00:15:03.550
A new term has been coined
recently, regressive leftists,

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.580
to identify a trend where
liberal theocratic ideologies

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:10.030
are being defended by
people through conflating

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.840
valid criticism of an
ideology with bigotry

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:14.140
towards individuals.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:15.780
So what are your thoughts on
the way that term is used?

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.696
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, I
hadn't heard the term,

00:15:17.696 --> 00:15:18.970
but I kind of like it.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:20.930
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
[INAUDIBLE].

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.140
SALMAN RUSHDIE: I do think
it has-- I found myself

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.390
saying this to
somebody the other day

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:32.690
that what other ideology
that was aggressively

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:37.080
anti-woman, homophobic,
and antisemitic

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.480
would the British left support?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.930
And the answer is probably
none, but for some reason

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:51.470
when it's a religion all
that gets brushed aside,

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:54.070
and I think that's a
really very big problem.

00:15:56.986 --> 00:15:58.450
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Great.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.120
The last one for me-- it's
one of my favorite passages

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.800
in the novel.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.750
It's where the
American president--

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:04.590
I love how you've
brought pop culture,

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:06.465
and Donald Trump is
a [INAUDIBLE] here.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:07.090
It's wonderful.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:10.460
SALMAN RUSHDIE: I'm very proud
of having invented Donald Trump

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.720
before he invented himself.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:12.872 --> 00:16:14.580
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
I do wonder, though,

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:15.621
about the timing of that.

00:16:15.621 --> 00:16:19.220
So there's a wonderful,
very subtle aside to Trump,

00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:21.660
and I think, oh, gosh, did
you actually realize that--

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:22.270
SALMAN RUSHDIE: No, no.

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:22.730
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Incredible.

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:23.005
Incredible.

00:16:23.005 --> 00:16:23.570
SALMAN RUSHDIE: The
point is, if you

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.810
happen to have an
egomaniac in town,

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:30.800
he's going to do something
to draw attention to himself.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.790
I didn't realize he was
going to do this, but--

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.790
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Well,
beautifully prescient

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:35.840
in the context of the book.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.173
SALMAN RUSHDIE: I have this
terrible confession to make,

00:16:38.173 --> 00:16:41.600
which is I've only met
Donald Trump like twice,

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:45.460
but for some reason
he took a shine to me.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.507
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:49.840
And this is really embarrassing.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:53.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.270
And I think it's
because a very-- this

00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.766
will show you how
old we both are,

00:16:57.766 --> 00:17:00.280
but there's once upon
a time I found myself

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.595
sitting next to him and his
children at a Crosby, Stills,

00:17:04.595 --> 00:17:09.410
and Nash concert in New York,
and he knew all the words

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.420
to all the songs.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.040
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Oh my word.

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:12.748
SALMAN RUSHDIE: But
I thought, oh my god.

00:17:12.748 --> 00:17:15.680
Donald Trump singing along
with Crosby, Stills, and Nash.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:18.170
That was weird,
but somehow I think

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:24.280
it became-- I'm sorry to say--
a bonding experience for us.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:27.920
So now-- literally I have to
say I've only met him twice

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.870
since then, but
on one occasion we

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.056
were-- I don't know-- at
some theater together,

00:17:32.056 --> 00:17:34.410
and he's never
quiet, Donald Trump.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:37.870
So he came at me from
a distance like this,

00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:40.297
and he would shout Salman!

00:17:40.297 --> 00:17:41.630
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Oh my word.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:42.921
SALMAN RUSHDIE: You're the man!

00:17:42.921 --> 00:17:45.139
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:45.139 --> 00:17:46.760
And I go, really?

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:49.176
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: So will
this be part of the campaign?

00:17:49.176 --> 00:17:50.930
SALMAN RUSHDIE: To which the
correct response, of course,

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:51.606
is no, Donald.

00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:52.230
You're the man.

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:54.986
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:57.270 --> 00:18:00.660
And then he offered me-- it was
at the time of the US Tennis

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:06.500
Open, and he said come and use
my box whenever you want it.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.350
And I thought that's a kind
of real career ending move,

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:14.990
to be scene in Donald
Trump's box at the US Open.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.670
The end.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.472
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:16.472 --> 00:18:18.200
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Oh my.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:18.760
SALMAN RUSHDIE:
On the other hand,

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:19.980
it's a really good box, so--

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.140
But I didn't go.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.890
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Are you a tennis fan?

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:25.750
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah.

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:26.800
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Well, then I don't know.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:27.290
SALMAN RUSHDIE: No, no, no.

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:28.180
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Principles are important, but--

00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:29.122
SALMAN RUSHDIE: No, no, no.

00:18:29.122 --> 00:18:30.410
There are other places to sit.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:32.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.690
Which also have a good
view, but yeah anyway,

00:18:36.690 --> 00:18:42.122
so that's my shameful
confession-- my pal, Donald.

00:18:42.122 --> 00:18:43.830
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
It gets even better.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:45.532
It gets even better.

00:18:45.532 --> 00:18:47.115
Yeah, so you talk
about Donald Trump.

00:18:47.115 --> 00:18:48.490
You also talk
about Barack Obama,

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.114
and you have him
trying to respond to--

00:18:50.114 --> 00:18:52.170
SALMAN RUSHDIE: It's
not really Barack Obama.

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:54.070
It's a president with big ears.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.594
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Whose wife
dances better than he does.

00:18:56.594 --> 00:18:58.760
SALMAN RUSHDIE: His wife
dances better than he does.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.410
That's true, but his
race is not specified,

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.337
and the actual exact time of
the novel is a little vague.

00:19:04.337 --> 00:19:05.920
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Yes, that's true.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.170
SALMAN RUSHDIE: So it may
or may not be Barack Obama.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:09.711
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
So the president

00:19:09.711 --> 00:19:11.280
who may or may not
be Barack Obama

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.880
has to respond to all of
these strange things going on

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.080
and this war between the worlds.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.122
There's apocalyptic storm,
and lightning strikes,

00:19:18.122 --> 00:19:20.288
and the ground is shifting,
and people are floating,

00:19:20.288 --> 00:19:22.520
and there's a baby that
senses corruption and causes

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.740
horrible disfigurement,
and he comes up

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:26.750
with this incredibly
banal response, right?

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:27.180
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yes.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.721
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Which is
we'll continue to do everything

00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:32.874
in our power to combat
this, and we think, well,

00:19:32.874 --> 00:19:34.290
there's nothing
you can do at all.

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:35.050
This is crazy.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.820
This is so far removed
from anything you can do.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.380
So the question
then is really how

00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:46.430
do we combat that which doesn't
bend to reason or rationale.

00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:49.120
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, that's--
the fortunate thing about being

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.974
a novelist is you get
to ask the question.

00:19:51.974 --> 00:19:53.390
You don't have to
have the answer.

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.460
You combat it by combating it.

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:06.180
There isn't a magic
button, but one

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:08.730
of the things that the
book-- I think really what

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:11.470
the book suggests is
that the resistance comes

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:13.870
from ordinary people, because
what happens in the novel

00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:18.270
is that these ordinary people
who discover that they're

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.590
the descendants long ago
of the djinn princess,

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:25.870
and so it suggests they have a
little bit of magic in them--

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:31.550
but what I'm really meaning
to say by that is that people

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:35.570
faced with an extreme
situation very often

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:41.190
discover in themselves
resources, courage, abilities,

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.410
which they didn't know they
possessed, and are actually

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:50.056
able to rise to the occasion,
and defend themselves,

00:20:50.056 --> 00:20:51.430
and some stand up
for themselves,

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:53.763
and I think that's essentially
what happens in the book.

00:20:53.763 --> 00:20:55.980
Yes, there are these
djinn flying around,

00:20:55.980 --> 00:21:01.120
but essentially what happens
is the resistance to chaos,

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.590
mayhem, evil, et cetera is
ordinary people discovering

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.960
in themselves the
capacity to resist,

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.950
and really that's what
the book is about.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.200
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Fabulous.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.800
With that shall we open it up
to questions from the floor?

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.040
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.530
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: There's
a microphone in the center.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:22.050
Yeah, so if we could please--
I'm sure in this packed room

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.955
we've got some
excellent questions.

00:21:24.955 --> 00:21:26.580
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Or
we'll just sit here.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:27.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.690
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
I could keep talking,

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.630
but-- oh there we go.

00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:33.890
AUDIENCE: There's a
very basic question,

00:21:33.890 --> 00:21:39.340
which is why has there been
such a rise in religiosity?

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.950
I can remember going to
Pakistan many years ago,

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:44.909
and the Pakistan cricket
team would look pretty much

00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:45.700
like everyone else.

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:48.710
And now people are bearded and
say [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] all

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.410
the time.

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.965
What has happened
that has caused this?

00:21:52.965 --> 00:21:53.900
I agree with you.

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.205
I think growing up in
the '60s I would never

00:21:56.205 --> 00:21:58.429
have predicted this outcome.

00:21:58.429 --> 00:21:59.220
SALMAN RUSHDIE: No.

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:03.535
None of us-- unfortunately while
we were all busy inhaling--

00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:06.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:13.547
--unlike President Clinton,
basically the uncool people

00:22:13.547 --> 00:22:14.380
took over the world.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:23.040
So beware-- this
could happen to you.

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:26.659
I don't know.

00:22:26.659 --> 00:22:28.200
I think the problem
with the question

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.650
is it's a very
important question,

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.390
and the audience is
not at all short,

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.230
but because I
think what happened

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:35.160
is different things
in different places.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.870
I think what
happened in Iran was

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.780
a response to the
rule of the Shah,

00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:44.900
and what happened in
Algeria was a response

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.620
to the gradual corruption of the
party of the revolution, which

00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:52.800
had been a secular
party, and so on.

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.390
But one of the things
I could say in general

00:22:56.390 --> 00:23:00.180
is precisely related to what
this book talks about, which

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:03.560
is that we live in
a time of incredibly

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.430
metamorphic, rapid
transformation,

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.130
change everywhere.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.380
The world is changing
at a speed faster

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:17.710
than it's ever done before,
and some of that is your fault,

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:22.480
but I think for some people,
or even for many people,

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:26.600
in a time of such change it
engenders great uncertainty

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.330
and even fear.

00:23:28.330 --> 00:23:32.470
And it becomes comforting
to reach for something which

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.820
feels unchanging,
something which

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.474
says this is an eternal truth,
and you can hold on to this

00:23:39.474 --> 00:23:40.890
and cling on to
this in the middle

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.240
of this time of great change.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.600
And I think that's one of the
things which for some people

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.660
is an attraction--
that religion becomes

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:53.360
an attraction because
it seems to offer

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.890
a moral code and
an unchanging world

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:59.950
in the middle of a world
that is changing very fast.

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.160
So that's one thing.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.630
The violent thing
is another thing.

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.095
That's another
conversation perhaps.

00:24:06.095 --> 00:24:07.280
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Great.

00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.420
Next question.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.420
AUDIENCE: Hello, Salman.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.005
Thank you for being
here and for being you.

00:24:12.005 --> 00:24:14.737
I really appreciate someone
stepping up like this.

00:24:14.737 --> 00:24:15.820
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Thank you.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.000
AUDIENCE: My
question is you said

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.590
people can think in their
own homes what they want,

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:25.650
and at the risk of trying
to combat thought crime,

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:29.510
I wonder if that's the right
attitude because religions

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.430
are so inherently damaging.

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.270
OK, it's fine to at your home
believe the Christian mythology

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:37.940
or the Muslim
mythology, but to do

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:41.290
that, you have to accept a
certain set of tenants that

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.320
are very worrying,
because, yeah,

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.280
like you said, being scared
of gay people and those kinds

00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.260
of things-- in Holland,
for example, we

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.750
have Christian
parties, and if they

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:55.410
were to come to power
as an absolute power,

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:57.550
I'm worried that they
will have to follow what

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.800
it says in the
Bible, and suddenly

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.280
all those people
that are silent might

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.585
have to own up to that belief.

00:25:04.585 --> 00:25:05.460
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah.

00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:09.440
Well, look, it's a
well asked question

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.796
because private life is not
necessarily only private.

00:25:15.796 --> 00:25:18.900
Private life can
lead to public action

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:24.650
and to the kinds of
prejudice and bigotry

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:25.860
that you touched on.

00:25:28.984 --> 00:25:30.400
I suppose what I
was trying to say

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.410
is that the moment it becomes
any form of a public action,

00:25:34.410 --> 00:25:38.170
which can include a prejudice
against a gay person,

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:41.090
for example, then it
becomes a real difficulty,

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.142
and we have to talk about it.

00:25:43.142 --> 00:25:44.780
And I'm just saying
that there are

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.370
people, who are not
fanatics, who are not

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:50.480
bigots, who are religious.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.130
And we live in the country
the Church of England.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:56.670
It's the only religion
ever started for a divorce.

00:25:56.670 --> 00:25:59.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:08.460
And it's a relatively mild
form of a religion, which

00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:10.910
in other forms can
be quite virulent,

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:12.729
such as in America
nowadays, where

00:26:12.729 --> 00:26:14.645
there are very virulent
forms of Christianity.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:19.460
I'm just saying that
the private desire

00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:23.030
to find a form of consolation--
I might think it's wrong.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:26.170
I might think it's
absurd, but in the end,

00:26:26.170 --> 00:26:29.070
it's not my business to tell you
what you should believe or not

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:32.640
believe, but the moment that
belief starts manifesting

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.044
itself in society in ways
to become problematic,

00:26:36.044 --> 00:26:38.210
then of course it is my
business, and your business,

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:39.043
and everyone else's.

00:26:39.043 --> 00:26:40.900
So I'm just trying to
make a distinction,

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:42.900
but I agree it's a
difficult distinction

00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.660
to make between private
life and public life.

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.880
And actually it's one
of the things that

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.130
would argue with
Christopher Hitchens

00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:53.680
about, because he would
take your position, which

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.860
is all of it is awful, and you
can't make these hairsplitting

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.390
distinctions.

00:27:01.390 --> 00:27:03.550
And I'm tempted
by that position.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.770
I'm just trying to be nice.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:07.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:09.615
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: I
also-- I have to wonder.

00:27:09.615 --> 00:27:12.720
Certain aspects of
religion seem good, right?

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:14.051
Charity, for example.

00:27:14.051 --> 00:27:16.550
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah, certain
aspects of religion seem good,

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.716
but you could be charitable
without being religious.

00:27:18.716 --> 00:27:20.140
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Very true.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:20.340
I

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.756
SALMAN RUSHDIE: You could be
good without being religious.

00:27:22.756 --> 00:27:24.860
I think it's one of
the things that I

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.220
find most problematic about the
way in which religious people

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.040
talk-- is that there's an
assumption that you can't have

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.530
an ethical sense if you don't
have a religious structure,

00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:38.540
and you don't have some kind
of supreme arbiter, and so on.

00:27:38.540 --> 00:27:41.800
It seems to me quite clear
that the opposite is true,

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.760
that human beings in some
sense have an ethical sense,

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.950
and one of the ways in
which historically we've

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:50.600
given expression to
that ethical sense

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:55.570
is to create religions which
codify a form of ethics.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:58.880
It seems to me that
religions exist historically

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.880
to answer two great questions.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.680
One is, how did we get here?

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.490
Where do we come from?

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.790
And the other is, now that
we're here, how shall we live?

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:10.760
So the question of
origins, the question

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.770
of ethics-- it seems to me
those are the big questions.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.920
And my view is we know
a lot more now than we

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.680
knew when the Bible was written,
and one of things we know

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.980
is that, at least
in my view, I don't

00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.760
need to look at
religion for an answer

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.172
to the question of origins.

00:28:29.172 --> 00:28:30.630
It seems to me
there are a lot more

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.004
interesting and knowledgeable
answers than that available

00:28:33.004 --> 00:28:36.340
now, and I don't want to look
at religion for an answer

00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.300
the question of ethics,
because on the whole,

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.190
religion has not
been particularly

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.130
great on that subject of late.

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:46.910
And so my requirement
for religion

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:49.980
doesn't exist, because I
don't need it to answer

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.230
these great questions of life.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:54.730
And I think it's
perfectly possible

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.570
to argue that our
ethical sense precedes

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.770
our development of
religions and the we

00:29:01.770 --> 00:29:04.065
are in some way
hardwired to have

00:29:04.065 --> 00:29:07.820
an-- I think people do
instinctively have a need

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.940
to distinguish right from
wrong and good action

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:18.450
from bad action, and religion is
just one of the codes by which

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:20.759
they try to explain that.

00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:22.550
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Next question, please?

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.755
AUDIENCE: Hi, [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:24.755 --> 00:29:26.380
Thank you very much
for taking the time

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:28.960
to come in and speak to us.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:31.410
I see a lot of
value in religion,

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.110
and from all of
the things you've

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:38.870
mentioned already, providing
some truth in an ever changing

00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:41.130
world, fighting
against capitalism--

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:43.030
but I don't want to
ask about capitalism.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:48.640
I want to ask about the
concerning effects of religion

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.870
as we see them today.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.630
If you follow the
Middle East, or Europe,

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.340
or, as matter of fact,
unfortunately almost anywhere,

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:55.980
you can see those
bad circumstances.

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.040
And I would like to ask
you if you are an optimist,

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.119
and if you are, why?

00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:01.410
And if you're a pessimist, why?

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:07.550
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, it's very
difficult to look at the world

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:13.530
right now and not have
a tragic sense of life

00:30:13.530 --> 00:30:14.680
if you're a writer.

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.250
However, this book is
strangely optimistic,

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.630
you will discover as
you go through it.

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:28.160
It's perhaps more optimistic
than the times deserve,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:33.040
but what I think is
quite seriously that-- I

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:34.370
was a student of history.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:37.440
That was my university
subject, and one

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:41.070
of the things you learn
in the study of history

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:43.600
is the unpredictability
of history,

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.050
the idea that history inevitably
goes in a certain direction

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:51.110
is just not true, that history
is very, very changeable

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:53.970
and unpredictable,
and it constantly

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:56.200
takes one by surprise.

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.220
Just to give you one recent
example, if I had been sitting

00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:05.590
here in January of 1989
and I had said to you

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:09.040
the Soviet Union will not
exist at Christmas time,

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.950
you would have
thought I was crazy

00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:16.080
because it seemed to be this
huge, solid, powerful entity

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.270
that was just there.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.770
The idea that it would
just blow away like dust

00:31:20.770 --> 00:31:24.434
was very hard to imagine,
and yet that's what happened,

00:31:24.434 --> 00:31:25.850
but of course now
there's somebody

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:31.460
trying to put it back together,
but that's a different story.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.370
I'm just saying that it's an
example of how unexpectedly

00:31:35.370 --> 00:31:37.670
and rapidly things can shift.

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:41.970
And so I think if one
wants to be-- they

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.960
can shift for the worse,
as well, by the way.

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.580
Not just for the
better, but what I think

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:50.680
is the future is
invariably unexpected.

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.539
It's not what we think
it's going to be.

00:31:52.539 --> 00:31:54.580
It could be worse than we
think it's going to be,

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.070
or it could be better, but
it's going to be different,

00:31:58.070 --> 00:32:04.430
and so I think that's
a kind of comfort,

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.245
the mutability of the future.

00:32:06.245 --> 00:32:09.500
And I think nowadays
there's so many people

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.590
whose job appears to be
trying to predict the future.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.120
Futurology has become
this big thing,

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.220
and it always strikes
me that futurology

00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:22.230
is the science of being wrong
about the future, because just

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:24.600
look at the way in which the
future has been described

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.150
in movies quite recently.

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:31.250
The future according to
"2001 A Space Odyssey"--

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:35.200
in that future, we're all
wearing Pierre Cardin jump

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:40.940
suits, and actually space
exploration is really much more

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.790
advanced than it is,
and as it happens,

00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:45.690
we're not wearing Pierre
Cardin jump suits.

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.050
I can't see anyone,
and we haven't really

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.860
got as far as the movie
suggests we might have got

00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:56.370
in terms of leaving the planet.

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:58.550
So every time anybody tries
to predict the future,

00:32:58.550 --> 00:32:59.175
it never works.

00:32:59.175 --> 00:33:03.260
It actually tells
you about that time.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:04.960
The reason why
George Orwell called

00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.440
"1984" "1984" is because
it was written in 1948.

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:12.730
He just flipped the
last two digits,

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:17.030
but the 1984 that he
wrote about is much more

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:20.920
a portrait of fears that
were present in 1948.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:25.160
It tells us a lot about the time
in which the book was written,

00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.690
and I think that's-- when
people project into the future

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.360
in works of art, whether
movies, or books, or et cetera,

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:35.140
they're actually talking
about their own concerns.

00:33:35.140 --> 00:33:37.942
And actually one of the
things about this book, which

00:33:37.942 --> 00:33:39.900
somebody actually explicitly
says in the book--

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.900
that if you're talking
about the future,

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.680
you're talking
about the present.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.290
If you're talking
about the past,

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.390
you're talking
about the present,

00:33:49.390 --> 00:33:53.580
because we are here now, and
we have our concerns now.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.240
And we find those concerns
either in the past

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.700
or in the future.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.120
That's how we think.

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:01.200
So if you look at, for
instance, histories--

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:06.240
if you take the 16th century--
I guess since Hilary Mantel so

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.010
much popularized the
16th century of late,

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.610
but if you look at the way
in which the 16th century was

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.870
written about, in the 17th
century, the 18th century,

00:34:14.870 --> 00:34:17.699
the 19th century,
and the 20th century,

00:34:17.699 --> 00:34:19.739
they could be writing
about different times

00:34:19.739 --> 00:34:23.210
entirely because each
age finds in the past

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:28.070
the things that concern
it in its present.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.920
And the same is
true of the future,

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:34.130
so I think the only-- to answer
your question about optimism,

00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.280
all I can say is it
won't be what you think.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.815
It might be worse.

00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:41.980
It might be better, but it
won't be what you think--

00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.340
the day after tomorrow, I mean.

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:43.949
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
That's quite

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.250
a solid scientific outcome.

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:45.639
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Huh?

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:47.847
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: It's
a solid scientific outcome.

00:34:47.847 --> 00:34:49.350
We know what it will not be.

00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:50.269
SALMAN RUSHDIE: We know
what it will not be.

00:34:50.269 --> 00:34:50.769
Exactly.

00:34:50.769 --> 00:34:51.739
That's very good.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:52.710
Exactly.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:53.090
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Fabulous.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:54.199
SALMAN RUSHDIE: What you
think it's going to be

00:34:54.199 --> 00:34:55.170
is what it won't be.

00:34:55.170 --> 00:34:56.420
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Fabulous.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:58.441
Next question, please?

00:34:58.441 --> 00:34:59.500
AUDIENCE: Hi there.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.740
It's been almost 30
years since you received

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.210
what can only be described
as a very bad book

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.401
review from the Ayatollah.

00:35:05.401 --> 00:35:07.150
SALMAN RUSHDIE: It was
described as that--

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.540
--by V.S. Naipaul.

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:10.400
AUDIENCE: Oh really?

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.120
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yes, it was.

00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.890
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering,
based on the Britain of today,

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:17.650
do you think that your
rough years that followed

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:20.250
would be easier in the
Britain of today or harder,

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:24.819
given various shifts in public
discourse, moral relativity?

00:35:24.819 --> 00:35:27.110
SALMAN RUSHDIE: No, I think
it would be much worse now.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:32.670
I think I was actually quite
fortunate that what happened--

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.980
I would, on the whole,
not recommend it,

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:41.200
but I think that was
just before, for example,

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:44.660
the explosion of the
information universe.

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:51.250
And I think now information
moves so fast, and as we know,

00:35:51.250 --> 00:35:55.940
the internet is a very
regrettably good tool

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.605
for hostility.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.980
It's for many things,
but including that.

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.230
There's all kinds
of hysterias that

00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:09.260
seem to sweep
across the internet,

00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:12.660
and I think the danger
would have been much greater

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.340
is what I'm saying,
because I think

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:19.420
it would be impossible to
magnify the attack 1,000

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:22.760
fold, 10,000 fold.

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.150
I also just think the world's
become even more violent

00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:30.460
than it was then,
and if you like,

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.910
the kind of
privatization of violence

00:36:33.910 --> 00:36:40.150
has made it more unpredictable
when the violence will occur.

00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.930
At that time, the
danger arose essentially

00:36:42.930 --> 00:36:46.190
from the Iranian
state and its proxies,

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:49.520
and essentially
from nobody else,

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.220
although the Iranians did
try and involve other people,

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:57.100
but really nobody wanted
to know about truthfully.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.590
We've also made it fixable,
because basically there's

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.690
one player.

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:05.140
You can find ways to
talk to that person

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:09.630
and to nullify it, which is
eventually what happened.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:13.140
Now the threat is everywhere,
and random, et cetera,

00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:14.530
and that's more alarming.

00:37:14.530 --> 00:37:18.905
So I think people are more
afraid now than they were then,

00:37:18.905 --> 00:37:23.898
and it's a very much more
worrying time for that reason.

00:37:23.898 --> 00:37:25.128
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:25.128 --> 00:37:26.378
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Fabulous.

00:37:26.378 --> 00:37:27.870
AUDIENCE: Have you
got time for one more?

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:28.550
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Of course we do.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.220
We actually have time for quite
a-- well, a few more anyway.

00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:31.940
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah, more.

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:32.170
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:32.170 --> 00:37:33.601
SALMAN RUSHDIE: More, more.

00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:35.600
AUDIENCE: One of the
things which I particularly

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.690
enjoyed in this session
actually is being exposed

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.380
to your critical thinking
and the way you break down

00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:43.120
your problems and look at them.

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.490
I have a 15-year-old
son, and I'm

00:37:45.490 --> 00:37:48.139
very struck by the lack
of the critical thinking

00:37:48.139 --> 00:37:49.430
that they get taught at school.

00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:51.770
It's very much here's
a bit of rote learning.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.810
Go and learn this.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:55.450
And as a result as
a nation, we seem

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.530
to be happier debating
the offside rule

00:37:58.530 --> 00:38:00.640
than we are questions
such as, why am I here,

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.309
and how should I live?

00:38:02.309 --> 00:38:04.684
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, the
offside rule is very important.

00:38:04.684 --> 00:38:07.477
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:07.477 --> 00:38:09.060
AUDIENCE: What should
we be promoting,

00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:10.904
and how can we get
people to be having

00:38:10.904 --> 00:38:12.070
these important discussions?

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:13.486
SALMAN RUSHDIE:
Well, I think this

00:38:13.486 --> 00:38:15.650
is a question for the
school curriculum.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.160
I think you're right that
people are not really

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:19.900
encouraged to think.

00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.400
It's interesting you raise the
subject of critical thinking.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.290
I have an 18-year-old son who
has just started at university,

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.952
and he's very
philosophically inclined,

00:38:28.952 --> 00:38:30.660
which means that he
likes to argue a lot.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.680
And of course believes
that he's always correct.

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:39.710
And he told me
yesterday on the phone

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:44.030
that they had been asked
in this philosophy class

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:48.320
to come up with a definition
of what a human being is.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:51.390
Not specific to a particular
country, or culture,

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:55.180
or whatever, but what is it
that makes us human beings as

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.200
opposed to not human beings.

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:02.840
And somebody in the class had
said that critical thinking was

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.070
one of the things the
defined us as human beings,

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:09.150
and then being
18-years-old, he went on

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.990
to argue that therefore,
if you're in a coma,

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.510
you probably no longer
qualify as a human being

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.180
because you can't indulge
in critical thinking.

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.680
The person clearly
didn't understand

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.160
the flaw in that argument,
and so my son rather

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.550
proudly told me that he'd
really taken him down

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:33.000
because he pointed out that
actually when we're asleep

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.190
we're not capable of
critical thinking,

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:39.060
and so do we cease to be
human beings when be sleep.

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.690
To which the other
young fellow didn't

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.900
have an answer, so my son wins.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:49.540
The point is I think it's
very helpful and valuable

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:54.260
to young people to be asked to
have that kind of conversation,

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:58.370
however unsophisticated
the arguments might be.

00:39:58.370 --> 00:40:01.220
You can only acquire
sophisticated arguments

00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:08.110
by getting there, by learning,
and I certainly benefited,

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:14.680
I think, in my education
by having philosophy

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:18.570
as a part of what I studied,
and ideas, the history of ideas,

00:40:18.570 --> 00:40:21.050
as something that
I studied, and I

00:40:21.050 --> 00:40:23.600
think it would be really
valuable if people were

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:24.840
asked to study those things.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.987
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:25.987 --> 00:40:27.070
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Excuse me?

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:30.452
AUDIENCE: Why do you feel
that other people don't

00:40:30.452 --> 00:40:31.660
seem to think it's important?

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:33.170
Is there a malaise
in this country?

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:37.890
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Because there's
an idea around at the moment--

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:40.540
which is frankly not specific
to any political party,

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:42.810
so it's not a kind of
left right argumen--

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:48.260
that education is a training
for a job, the kind of market

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:53.080
driven idea of education that
basically you're channeling

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:57.080
people towards the
workplace, and that's

00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.820
what you're doing at
school or at college.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.480
Whereas the old idea of
the liberal arts education,

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:06.420
the liberal education, was that
you're actually training people

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.410
to be human beings
and allowing them

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:14.030
to emerge from the educational
system as complicated,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:15.900
interesting, rounded
human beings,

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.940
who will then do something
valuable in the world.

00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.010
And I think that idea
is under threat now.

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:26.770
Not just in England,
but everywhere, and I

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:29.470
think it's a very valuable idea,
and it needs to be restated.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:30.635
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:41:30.635 --> 00:41:31.510
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Nice.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.688
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
Next question?

00:41:36.688 --> 00:41:37.354
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:41:37.354 --> 00:41:40.300
I thought it was
very interesting--

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:42.300
I study history
myself, and what you're

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.410
talking about the
unpredictability of history

00:41:44.410 --> 00:41:48.730
and especially about how we are
how different centuries were

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:51.930
viewed and had different
interpretations of history.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:53.834
In terms of the
role of a novelist,

00:41:53.834 --> 00:41:55.250
how do you think
that has changed,

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.130
or has it actually stayed
as almost that kind

00:41:57.130 --> 00:42:00.160
of stable source of
truth or questioning?

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.940
It's got to be quite interesting
to see you opinion on that.

00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.398
SALMAN RUSHDIE:
Well, of course you

00:42:04.398 --> 00:42:06.250
see the problem with
the moment anybody

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:11.170
says something like the role of
the novelist it doesn't apply.

00:42:11.170 --> 00:42:15.040
There's no answer which
applies across the board

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.320
because novelists are of
very, very different kinds.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:26.430
Some feel the need to
have a kind of public art,

00:42:26.430 --> 00:42:31.360
an art that engages with
public life, and others don't.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:34.290
They just don't want to, and
I think both kinds of novels

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:36.580
can be great.

00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.950
So I'm reluctant ever to say
here is what writers should do,

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:50.250
but I think what literature does
do at its best is to provide

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:53.260
a world for people to live
in while they're reading

00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:57.180
the book, which is first of
all interesting in itself,

00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:02.460
enjoyable in itself, and
secondly makes the reader think

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.710
about human nature, understand
things about how we are

00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:08.270
with each other and what
we do to each other,

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:13.430
and to come out of that
world with perhaps a slightly

00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:18.489
enhanced sense of what it
is to live in this world.

00:43:18.489 --> 00:43:20.530
And I think that's what
writing does at its best,

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.820
and I think one of
the things I think

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:29.340
is a kind of magical thing about
literature as opposed to film,

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.900
or music, or whatever is that
the other art forms happen

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:34.100
outside you.

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:36.279
You sit there as an
audience, and there's

00:43:36.279 --> 00:43:38.320
somebody playing a musical
instrument over there,

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:40.510
or there's a movie on
a screen over there.

00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:44.380
And you watch it, and you can
engage with it very deeply--

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:48.110
of course you can-- and be
very deeply affected by it,

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:50.690
but it's over there,
and you're over here.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:52.530
Whereas when you
read a book, it's

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:58.120
inside your head, and the
intimacy of the conversation

00:43:58.120 --> 00:44:00.730
between the writer
and the reader--

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:03.360
the conversation that
happens inside the reader

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:06.570
is a very profound
intimacy, and it's

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:10.330
a unique thing to
literature that it

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:14.780
can be an interior experience.

00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:17.760
And so when books
affect you, they

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:22.660
affect you very profoundly,
and I think the experience

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:26.480
of falling in love with a
book, of really loving a book,

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.650
which may not happen that
often-- it may happen

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:31.750
a few times in a lifetime.

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:34.790
If you have to name
the books-- if somebody

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:37.060
asks you what are the
books you really love,

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.070
that's probably not a long list.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:43.550
It's probably a short
list, but those books, I

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:46.340
believe, in some way change
the way you see the world,

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:49.010
that you begin afterwards
to see the world

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:55.010
a little bit through what you've
absorbed from that work of art.

00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:59.590
And I think that's how-- I
don't believe in this idea

00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:01.390
that literature can
change the world.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:05.180
I think that's kind
of over claiming.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.660
Every so often,
very rarely there's

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:11.590
a work of literature that
has a direct social impact,

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:15.990
and one example of that would
be "Uncle Tom's Cabin"-- that

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:19.410
when that book came out,
it had a profound impact

00:45:19.410 --> 00:45:22.050
on the discussion of
slavery in America,

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.340
and in fact there's
a rather nice story

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.450
that President Lincoln was
introduced to Harriet Beecher

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:30.260
Stowe, the author of
"Uncle Tom's Cabin,"

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.220
and he said to her, so
you're the little woman

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:34.780
who started this big war.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.190
And you can see the sense
in which that's true,

00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:39.660
but mostly that's
not what happens.

00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:43.260
Mostly what happens is
this other strange thing

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:47.610
of every so often this
intimate experience

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.280
between the writer and reader
doing something profound

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.590
to the reader.

00:45:51.590 --> 00:45:54.014
And the great thing about it
is that neither the author

00:45:54.014 --> 00:45:56.180
nor the reader can predict
when it's going to happen

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.406
or to whom.

00:45:57.406 --> 00:46:00.440
AUDIENCE: Do you that's
a timeless experience?

00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.190
So no matter what's
going on in the world,

00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:04.155
no matter how
history is changing

00:46:04.155 --> 00:46:06.305
and how people are changing,
society is changing,

00:46:06.305 --> 00:46:08.430
do you think that's an
experience that [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.221
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah,
I think that's what--

00:46:10.221 --> 00:46:12.840
this is why this form
has hung around so long.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:19.490
It's because our desire
to be told stories

00:46:19.490 --> 00:46:23.090
is very, very central
to human nature.

00:46:23.090 --> 00:46:27.200
I've said often that we are
the storytelling animal.

00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:29.930
We are the only
creature on earth

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:33.240
that does this very strange
thing of telling itself

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.485
stories in order to understand
what kind of creature it is.

00:46:36.485 --> 00:46:38.110
Some of those stories
are true stories.

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:40.280
Some of them are
made up stories,

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.660
but we all tell
each other stories.

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.280
I'm not even talking about
professional writers.

00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.530
We all tell each other stories
about ourselves all the time,

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:52.610
and it's a way in which
we understand who we are.

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:55.720
And I think therefore we
are creatures who understand

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:57.260
ourselves through narrative.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:00.510
That's the point
I'm trying to make.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:05.340
We have more narrative oriented
than analysis oriented.

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:08.910
We learn more
through stories than

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:13.620
through any other structure,
and that's why it persists.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.450
It's just something people need.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:17.550
When children are very
little, the moment

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:21.530
they feel safe,
and loved, and fed,

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:25.200
and housed-- very, very soon
after that the next question

00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.470
is tell me a story.

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:31.510
The desire for once upon a
time is very, very, very deep

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:35.260
in human beings, and so no
matter what else happens,

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:36.120
that persists.

00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.450
People still want it.

00:47:37.450 --> 00:47:38.239
Tell me a story.

00:47:38.239 --> 00:47:40.030
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
I think one thing that

00:47:40.030 --> 00:47:41.911
strikes me about that is data.

00:47:41.911 --> 00:47:43.410
So we're a very
data driven company,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.895
but data is just another
story or a set of stories.

00:47:45.895 --> 00:47:48.340
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah, I think
we just organize ourselves

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.280
through narrative.

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:54.590
I think it's natural
to us to do it.

00:47:54.590 --> 00:47:55.530
AUDIENCE: Hi, Salman.

00:47:55.530 --> 00:47:56.110
Massive fan.

00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.410
Read all your books, and I
guess that's because someone

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:01.910
born in India and growing up
in the west your novels were

00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:04.300
always able to bring
together these really

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:05.930
unrelated spheres in my life.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:08.180
And my question for you is
quite a general one really.

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:10.740
If you had any thoughts
on the future of India,

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:13.487
its role in the world, and its
relationship with the west?

00:48:13.487 --> 00:48:14.570
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, god.

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:16.239
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:16.239 --> 00:48:18.030
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI:
A nice easy to finish.

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:20.071
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah, in
30 words or less, right?

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:30.054
I think it's a worrying time in
India, particularly in the area

00:48:30.054 --> 00:48:31.470
we're talking about
tonight, which

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:33.430
has to do with free expression.

00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:37.910
I think there's a lot
of bullying going on,

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:39.660
a lot of repression.

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:43.260
There's been three people
killed in recent weeks

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:53.450
for upsetting various extremist
groups, writers included.

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:59.660
So it's becoming this
government has allowed

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:04.160
a kind of thugishness to
arrive in Indian life which

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:07.410
has never been there
to that degree before.

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:09.630
Of course, there have been
terrible violent moments

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:10.630
in the history of India.

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:14.910
It would be wrong not to
say that, but right now--

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:18.430
it's very interesting that after
these recent murders, including

00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:22.510
the murder of this Muslim
man for having allegedly

00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:26.160
eaten beef, which it turns
out he actually hadn't done,

00:49:26.160 --> 00:49:29.620
but even if he had, so what?

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:34.200
That's not a reason to lynch
somebody, except now it is.

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:36.990
And since this happened,
and since there

00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:40.320
have been these other
murders recently of writers

00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:46.760
and other anti-government
individuals,

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:50.890
the prime minister of
India has said nothing,

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:54.840
and Mr. Modi is an
incredibly talkative man.

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.120
He talks all the time about
everything, particularly

00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.910
himself.

00:49:58.910 --> 00:50:02.700
He's a kind of
Donald Trump figure,

00:50:02.700 --> 00:50:08.530
except he's running the country
with a very large majority.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:09.660
Very, very powerful.

00:50:09.660 --> 00:50:12.385
Probably the most
powerful leader that India

00:50:12.385 --> 00:50:15.510
has had for quite a
long time because he

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:16.800
doesn't require coalitions.

00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.280
He doesn't require compromises.

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:24.740
He's there with a
mandate, and yet here

00:50:24.740 --> 00:50:27.280
are these terrible
events happening

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.340
with what seems to be at
the very least the collusion

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:36.160
of members of his party, if
not the actual organization

00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.260
of the events by
members of his party.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:42.030
We don't quite know that yet,
but it seems fairly clear

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:45.760
that the BGP people
have been involved

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:49.930
in all these atrocities,
and yet not a word

00:50:49.930 --> 00:50:52.220
from the prime
minister's office,

00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:55.860
which is clearly
saying, go ahead.

00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:59.760
It's clearly enabling
giving permission, unspoken

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:05.910
permission, to these
very violent elements

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:06.660
in the society.

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.610
So yeah, I'm very
worried about it.

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:13.110
I'm very worried
about it, and whenever

00:51:13.110 --> 00:51:15.390
people speak up--
right now there's

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:17.390
an enormous protest
going on in India

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:20.780
by writers and
intellectuals, many of whom--

00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:23.720
because the Indian Academy,
the [INAUDIBLE] Academy,

00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:26.320
has also remained
completely silent

00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.360
in the face of the
actual murders of writers

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:29.410
and intellectuals.

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:33.360
Hasn't said a single thing,
and so an enormous number,

00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:35.930
a growing number-- it's
seven today-- of writers

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:38.470
and intellectuals
are returning honors

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:40.110
that they've received
from the academy

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:44.220
and protesting
against its silence.

00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.180
And immediately
they are vilified

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:51.490
because the thing about
the Modi crew, let's say,

00:51:51.490 --> 00:51:56.970
is that it's enormously
skilled at using social media.

00:51:56.970 --> 00:52:01.160
I had a tweet this morning
supporting some of the writers

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.140
who had protested
about these things.

00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.680
There have now been
maybe 10,000 tweets

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.070
calling me all sorts of
names within a couple

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:12.780
hours of my saying
this one thing,

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:15.890
and that's happening to
everybody who in any way

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:17.700
objects to what's going on.

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:24.070
There's an orchestrated very,
very extreme attack on them

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:27.590
throughout all media.

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:28.950
So yeah, it's a worrying time.

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:30.450
I think you're
getting to the point

00:52:30.450 --> 00:52:33.906
where it's difficult to
call India a free society.

00:52:33.906 --> 00:52:35.780
I think they may just
have elected Mussolini.

00:52:38.135 --> 00:52:39.260
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Great.

00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:42.970
I think we have time for
one more very fast question,

00:52:42.970 --> 00:52:46.099
and then we'll move to books
are for sale and a book signing

00:52:46.099 --> 00:52:48.140
outside, but if we could
take one last quick one.

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:49.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:49.410 --> 00:52:51.110
This is on a slightly
lighter note.

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:51.610
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yes.

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:52.818
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Oh good.

00:52:52.818 --> 00:52:53.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:56.340
AUDIENCE: If you can choose
what's your favorite book

00:52:56.340 --> 00:52:57.300
that you've written.

00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:57.870
SALMAN RUSHDIE:
That I've written?

00:52:57.870 --> 00:53:00.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, also what's the
favorite one that you've read,

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.510
assuming they're not the same.

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:04.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:06.860
SALMAN RUSHDIE: I
don't actually read

00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.280
the novels of Salman Rushdie.

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.220
I just write them.

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:14.470
By the time I
finished writing them,

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:17.570
I've read them so many
times that I never

00:53:17.570 --> 00:53:21.890
want to look at them again,
because in the process

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:25.340
of writing a book, you reread,
and reread, and reread.

00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:28.450
And by the time the book has
gone through the publication

00:53:28.450 --> 00:53:32.550
period, you read it again in
great detail dozens of times,

00:53:32.550 --> 00:53:35.720
and at the end of
that, I'm done with it.

00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.680
I have to say I'm really
delighted with the way

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:42.530
in which this book is
being received so far.

00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:45.970
People seem to be really
enjoying it and having

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:49.180
a great time with it, and
that's a very nice feeling.

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:52.380
And there are these
two earlier books

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:56.860
that I wrote for my two sons
when they were 11 or 12 years

00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:00.260
old each, "Haroun and
the Sea of Stories,

00:54:00.260 --> 00:54:04.200
and "Luka and the Fire of Life,"
which one is the sort of sequel

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:06.620
to the other.

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.840
And I have a very
soft spot for those,

00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.530
partly because they were written
in this very personal way,

00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:16.160
and again, partly because I just
had the most fun writing them.

00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:18.260
They were really--
I can see why people

00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.990
who write children's books
go around looking happy,

00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:24.570
because it's kind of fun.

00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:28.470
And also the response you
get from young readers

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:32.990
is incredibly enjoyable.

00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:36.490
I get these letters from
entire classrooms who've

00:54:36.490 --> 00:54:38.640
been reading
"Haroun," or "Luka,"

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:41.220
and they've all done
drawings of the characters.

00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:44.700
And they write me notes saying
which characters they like,

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:47.050
and which ones they
don't like, and giving me

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:52.720
tips for how to write sequels,
what that should be about.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:55.470
It's really a lot of fun.

00:54:55.470 --> 00:54:58.780
I had this letter
from a girl in America

00:54:58.780 --> 00:55:02.990
in Massachusetts when
"Haroun" came out,

00:55:02.990 --> 00:55:04.610
and she asked me
various questions.

00:55:04.610 --> 00:55:08.490
She was obviously quite a
smart, highly literate reader.

00:55:08.490 --> 00:55:11.220
So she had a quite intelligent
letter, and at the end of it,

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:14.120
it said, please write back.

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.665
Please reply to
this letter at once.

00:55:15.665 --> 00:55:18.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:20.790
She said, because
when I grew up,

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:24.755
I intend to be either a writer
myself or a world leader.

00:55:24.755 --> 00:55:27.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.590
I thought right
back to this girl.

00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:33.220
She's going to be
president in 20 years time.

00:55:33.220 --> 00:55:35.660
So anyway, those books,
I think, I would choose.

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.140
If I had to choose,
I would choose those

00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:41.140
just because it's been so
much fun to be their author

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:43.620
because of what's
come back at me.

00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:45.531
CHRISTINA MATTEOTTI: Fantastic.

00:55:45.531 --> 00:55:48.030

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:50.570

amazing, amazing event.
