00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's say we're studying a
very small and oversimplified

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:08.290
country that only
sells apples, and we

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.400
measure the GDP in year one.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.050
And we measure
that GDP as $1,000.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.290
And all of that
is due to apples.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.850
And we also know that the price
of apples in year one was $0.50

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.720
a pound.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.670
So I'll write it
as $0.50 per pound.

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.354
And let's say that now
year one has gone by

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:34.020
and even year two has
gone by, and we're

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.970
able to measure the
GDP in year two.

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.950
So the GDP in year
two is $1,200.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.670
And the price of apples in year
two, let's just say it is $0.55

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.180
a pound.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.590
So my question to you is, GDP,
the whole point of measuring

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.900
GDP, is measuring the
productivity of a country.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.760
I mean we are measuring
in terms of dollars,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.676
but we care more about
just the dollar amount.

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:07.360
We really care is, was this
country more productive?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.670
And if it was more productive,
how much more productive

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:10.570
was it?

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.230
And if we just look at these
GDP numbers right over here,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.779
this $1,000 versus this
$1,200, it gives you the sense

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:19.070
that-- well, at least if you
just look at the numbers--

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.490
$1,200 is 20%
larger than $1,000.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.740
So if you just look at those
numbers right over there,

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.780
it looks like the
GDP grew by 20%.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.640
But is that an
accurate representation

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.090
of the productivity
of this country?

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090
Did it actually
produce 20% more goods?

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.480
And a big clue is looking
at this price here.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.290
Because some of
this GDP actually

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.410
might have increased
just due to price.

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.930
But that doesn't actually make
the country more productive.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.247
The quantity, the extra
quantity of apples

00:01:46.247 --> 00:01:47.830
that the country
produces, is actually

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.194
what adds to the
total productivity.

00:01:50.194 --> 00:01:51.610
One way to think
about it-- Let me

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.510
draw a little diagram over here.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.210
On this axis, I'll do quantity.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.950
On this axis, I will do price.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.870
And P1, so if I want to figure
out the GDP in year one,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.760
I would have the price
of apples in year one--

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.289
that's the only good or service,
just to simplify things--

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.860
times the quantity of
apples in year one.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.640
And then this right
over here, the area

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.845
of this green rectangle,
would GDP in year one.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.310
And then GDP in year two would
be the price in year two.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.960
So we're going to go
from $0.50 to $0.55.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.070
The price in year two times
the quantity in year two--

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.560
we'll assume some growth as
occurred-- times the quantity

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.560
in year two.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.070
And so GDP in year
two would be the area

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.290
of this entire rectangle.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.600
And if we want to find
the difference between GDP

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.080
in year two and
GDP in year one, it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.520
would be the difference in area.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.930
So it would be what I am shading
in, in blue right over here.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.870
And based on the numbers that
we went over right over here,

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.450
the area that I'm
shading in, in blue--

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.400
so the difference between GDP
in year two and GDP in year one,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.860
the area I'm shading
in blue-- would

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.290
be this 200, the 200 increment.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.394
So this area right over
here would be that 200.

00:03:05.394 --> 00:03:06.810
Now when you look
at it over here,

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.780
you see that that
200, some of it

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.465
is due to an
increase in quantity.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.460
But a lot of it is also due
to an increase in price.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.320
So if we really wanted to figure
out how much more productive

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.370
the country got, and we still
want to measure GDP in dollars,

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.300
maybe we can take
a measure of GDP

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.440
that measures year two's
GDP, but it does it

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.800
in year one's prices.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.710
So if we could
somehow multiply--

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.040
if we could multiply year two's
quantity by year one's prices,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.110
then we would get this
rectangle right over here.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.570
And then the difference
between that and year one,

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.770
would give us the incremental
GDP in year one prices due

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.450
to quantity.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.699
And that's what we care about.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.434
We care about
total productivity.

00:03:56.434 --> 00:03:57.850
When we're thinking
about GDP one,

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.890
we say how much more
productive did the country get?

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.240
So let's try to do it with
these numbers right over here.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.977
So we can figure
out quantity two,

00:04:06.977 --> 00:04:08.810
we could figure out the
quantity in year two

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.260
just by dividing the
GDP by the price.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.880
Just by dividing this area
of the entire blue rectangle

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.740
and dividing it by the price,
that will give us the quantity.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.675
So if we divide 1,200
divided by $0.55-- let

00:04:21.675 --> 00:04:24.770
me get my calculator out.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:31.640
So if I do 1,200
divided by $0.55,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.370
this is my quantity of apples
and in pounds in year two.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.490
And I'll just round it, 2,182.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.140
So this is 2,182.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:48.290
So the quantity in year
two is 2,182 pounds.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:49.720
So this is equal to that.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.790
And then I could multiply
this times the price.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.831
So this is this quantity.

00:04:52.831 --> 00:04:54.650
It's 2,182 pounds.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.550
And then I could multiply it
times the price in year one

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.930
at year one's price.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.500
So I'm going to
multiply it times--

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.310
P1 is equal to $0.50 a
pound, $0.50 per pound.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.190
And this will give me-- so let
me just get my calculator out.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.981
I should be able to do
that one in my head.

00:05:11.981 --> 00:05:13.890
But let's see 0.5.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.890
And I get 1,090.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.190
Obviously, I'll
round it to 1,091.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.470
So this is equal to 1,091.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.210
And this is an
interesting number.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.210
So this is-- you could view
this as year two's GDP.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:41.700
In year-- or adjusted for-- I'll
write it, adjusted for prices,

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.400
or adjusted for price increases.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.870
Or you could say
in year one prices.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.640
And what's useful about
this is, this says, look,

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.960
if prices had remained
constant, this

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.410
is what our GDP
would have gotten to.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.650
If prices did not
increase, our GDP

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.983
would have gotten to this 1,091.

00:06:01.983 --> 00:06:04.970
1,091 is this area that
I drew in pink here.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.720
And so now, you could say if
prices were held constant,

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:14.070
the growth in GDP would
have been $91 not $200.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.440
So this area right over
here that I'm-- actually,

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.810
let me do it in a color.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.060
Let me do it in orange, maybe.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.590
This area right over
here, the actual growth,

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.810
if prices were held constant,
would have been $91.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:30.250
We would have gone from
$1,000 of GDP to $1,091.

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:31.910
So this right over
here, that area,

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.370
is $91 of-- and we could
even call it real growth.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.850
It really measures
the productivity.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.840
Now this gives us an
interesting, I guess,

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:43.360
set of ideas.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:47.120
One idea is to just measure
your GDP in the current year's

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.100
dollars.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.510
So this was GDP measured
in year two's dollars.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:53.130
It was year two GDP measured
in year two dollars,

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:54.610
year two prices.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:07:00.340
So we could call that
year two's nominal GDP.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.100
Nominal, in name.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.930
So it's GDP in name,
in that year's prices.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:07.120
But this right over
here, where we measured

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.490
year two's GDP, in some
base year's prices--

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.750
so it allows a real
comparison of how much did

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.240
our productivity
actually increase.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.560
Our productivity
actually increased by 9%.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.390
We produced 9% more apples.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.180
This, we call real GDP.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.410
Because it gives you a
measure of real productivity.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.450
It tries to take
out price increases.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.860
What we'll see in the
future, or we might not

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.030
do it in an introductory
course, but in practice,

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.000
it's kind of hard
to really measure

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.790
what the absolute-- this was a
simple economy, where we only

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.950
had one product.

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.170
But if you have many, many,
many products-- actually

00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:47.762
gazillions of products in a
real economy and the prices

00:07:47.762 --> 00:07:49.720
are adjusting and the
quantities are adjusting,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:53.710
it's not so easy to figure
out how to adjust for price.

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.560
But the folks running the
national income accounts

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.860
do try to do this.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:03.790
So they get a sense of how much
was the actual real growth.
