just wondered about it Plus also my
 

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:09.400
just wondered about it Plus also my
first thought actually when the Lynch

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:09.410
first thought actually when the Lynch
 

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:12.640
first thought actually when the Lynch
was starting to grow skin and bone ins

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:12.650
was starting to grow skin and bone ins
 

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.760

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:18.530
my first thought actually was oh my god
 

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.640

life is killing him oh that would have

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:21.650
life is killing him oh that would have
 

00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:24.010
life is killing him oh that would have
been interesting actually because he was

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:24.020
been interesting actually because he was
 

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.380
been interesting actually because he was
getting covered in life yeah like he was

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:28.390
getting covered in life yeah like he was
 

00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:29.860
getting covered in life yeah like he was
dead

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:29.870
dead
 

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:32.500
dead
he's nothing essentially he's a skeleton

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:32.510
he's nothing essentially he's a skeleton
 

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:34.830
he's nothing essentially he's a skeleton
this very symbol of death and

00:16:34.830 --> 00:16:34.840
this very symbol of death and
 

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.170
this very symbol of death and
nothingness and he brings death and so

00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:38.180
nothingness and he brings death and so
 

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.830
nothingness and he brings death and so
to be covered in flesh and

00:16:40.830 --> 00:16:40.840
to be covered in flesh and
 

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.990
to be covered in flesh and
and and muscle and all this living stuff

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.000
and and muscle and all this living stuff
 

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.360
and and muscle and all this living stuff
and being covered in living stuff I

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:48.370
and being covered in living stuff I
 

00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:50.190
and being covered in living stuff I
thought that was my first thought was

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:50.200
thought that was my first thought was
 

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.350
thought that was my first thought was
life was killing that well you could

00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360
life was killing that well you could
 

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.810
life was killing that well you could
argue it still kind of it what is the

00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:54.820
argue it still kind of it what is the
 

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.090
argue it still kind of it what is the
best way for life to kill death okay of

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:57.100
best way for life to kill death okay of
 

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.180

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:00.190
life birth yeah yeah it does kind of
 

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:05.819
life birth yeah yeah it does kind of
make sense I still don't like it I don't

00:17:05.819 --> 00:17:05.829
make sense I still don't like it I don't
 

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:08.490
make sense I still don't like it I don't
