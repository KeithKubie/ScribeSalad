00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:02.516
- Balancing chemical
equations is one of those

00:00:02.516 --> 00:00:07.087
concepts in chemistry that
often confuses people.

00:00:07.087 --> 00:00:11.624
But I think we'll see that
if we work through this

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:13.673
carefully and methodically,
and we also appreciate

00:00:13.673 --> 00:00:15.797
the art of balancing chemical equations,

00:00:15.797 --> 00:00:18.120
that it's actually not too bad.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.722
So first of all, what
is a chemical equation?

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.670
Well this is a chemical
equation right over here.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.776
It's describing a reaction.

00:00:24.776 --> 00:00:28.788
So if I take an atom of
aluminum and I add it

00:00:28.788 --> 00:00:32.070
to a dioxygen molecule, so a molecule that

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.458
has two oxygens with it, under
the appropriate conditions

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:40.054
they will react to form aluminum oxide.

00:00:40.054 --> 00:00:43.153
And the aluminum oxide molecule has

00:00:43.153 --> 00:00:47.064
two aluminum atoms and three oxygen atoms.

00:00:47.064 --> 00:00:48.601
And so you might say, "Okay, well what's

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:49.960
"the balancing business all about?

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.496
"I have a chemical reaction.

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:53.059
"What do I have to balance?"

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.342
Well if you look carefully,
you might notice that

00:00:55.342 --> 00:01:00.024
you don't have the same number
of each atom on both sides.

00:01:00.024 --> 00:01:02.341
For example, right over
here on the left-hand side,

00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:04.126
how many aluminums do we have?

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:06.901
Well on the left-hand
side, we have one aluminum.

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.151
How many do we have on
the right-hand side?

00:01:09.151 --> 00:01:12.303
Well on the right-hand
side, we have two aluminums.

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:14.985
And so aluminum just can't
appear out of thin air

00:01:14.985 --> 00:01:17.312
by virtue of some magical reaction.

00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:20.076
You have to have the same amount
of aluminums on both sides,

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:22.499
and the same thing is
true for the oxygens.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.400
Over here on the left-hand
side, we have two oxygens.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.138
They form one dioxygen molecule
that has two oxygen atoms.

00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:33.779
And then over here in the
aluminum oxide molecule,

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:35.538
we have three.

00:01:35.538 --> 00:01:38.486
We have three oxygen atoms.

00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:41.208
So once again, we can't
just have miraculously

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:44.838
an oxygen atom appear out of nowhere.

00:01:44.838 --> 00:01:47.567
So we have to balance the number
of aluminums on both sides,

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:49.733
this number and this
number should be the same,

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:51.638
and we have to balance
the number of oxygens,

00:01:51.638 --> 00:01:55.127
this number and that
number should be the same.

00:01:55.127 --> 00:01:56.552
So how do we do that?

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.856
Well one thing might be
to say, "Okay, if I've got

00:01:58.856 --> 00:02:02.238
"two aluminums here and
I have one aluminum here,

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:03.964
"well why don't I just double the number

00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:06.294
"of aluminums right over here?"

00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:08.157
I could just write a two in front of it,

00:02:08.157 --> 00:02:09.747
so now this has two aluminums,

00:02:09.747 --> 00:02:11.592
so I no longer have one aluminum here.

00:02:11.592 --> 00:02:14.102
I now have two aluminums,
and so it looks like

00:02:14.102 --> 00:02:17.624
the aluminums are balanced,
and they are indeed balanced.

00:02:17.624 --> 00:02:20.363
But still we have an
issue with the oxygens.

00:02:20.363 --> 00:02:22.079
Over here I have two oxygens.

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.432
Over here I have three oxygens.

00:02:24.647 --> 00:02:25.893
So one thing that you might say is,

00:02:25.893 --> 00:02:27.894
"Okay, well how do I go from two to three?

00:02:27.894 --> 00:02:30.112
"I could multiply by 1.5."

00:02:30.112 --> 00:02:34.647
So I could multiply by 1.5,

00:02:34.647 --> 00:02:37.336
and if I multiply 1.5 times two,

00:02:37.336 --> 00:02:38.906
that's going to be three.

00:02:38.906 --> 00:02:42.560
So now I have three
oxygen atoms on this side

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.219
and three oxygen atoms on this side.

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.414
But the convention is that we don't like

00:02:47.414 --> 00:02:50.106
writing "1.5 molecules."

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:52.404
We don't like having this
notion of a half molecule,

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:54.329
which is kind of this bizarre notion.

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:56.869
We want whole number molecules.

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:58.900
So what can we do?

00:02:59.623 --> 00:03:01.748
Well, you can imagine that
this makes it very similar

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:04.305
to what you did in algebra,
an algebraic equation.

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:08.344
We just can multiply both
sides by the same number

00:03:08.344 --> 00:03:12.479
that gets rid of having this
fraction or this decimal here.

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:14.165
So if we multiplied both sides

00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:15.992
by two, we're going to do that.

00:03:15.992 --> 00:03:19.236
This is going to be a four,
this is going to be a three,

00:03:19.236 --> 00:03:21.217
this is going to be a two right over here.

00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:22.249
So let me do that.

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.139
Let me multiply both sides by two.

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.738
So instead of two aluminum atoms,

00:03:26.738 --> 00:03:28.330
let me have four aluminum...

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.855
Actually, let me just write
the chemical equation first

00:03:30.855 --> 00:03:32.346
in the form that it was before.

00:03:32.346 --> 00:03:36.509
So I had aluminum plus dioxygen,

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.508
a molecule of two oxygens,
yielding in the reaction --

00:03:40.508 --> 00:03:44.315
these are the reactants,
this is the product --

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:49.295
aluminum, aluminum, aluminum oxide.

00:03:49.728 --> 00:03:51.993
So what I'm saying here
is to get rid of this 1.5,

00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:55.030
to turn it into a whole number,
let's multiply all of these,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.810
all of the number of molecules by two.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.773
And here, there's implicitly a one...

00:04:01.773 --> 00:04:03.293
Let me do this in a different color.

00:04:03.692 --> 00:04:06.380
There is implicitly a one right over here.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.394
So let's multiply all of these by two.

00:04:08.394 --> 00:04:10.680
So two times two is...

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.622
Let me do that same color.

00:04:13.022 --> 00:04:16.363
Two times two is four...

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.500
That's not the same color.

00:04:18.838 --> 00:04:21.346
Two times two is four.

00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:25.117
1.5 times two is three.

00:04:25.117 --> 00:04:27.316
And then one times two,

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:29.235
one times two is two.

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.141
And now you can verify how many aluminums

00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:32.991
do we have on each side?

00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:37.050
Well I have four aluminum
atoms on the left-hand side,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.015
and how many do I have
on the right-hand side?

00:04:39.015 --> 00:04:40.976
I have four aluminum atoms.

00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:43.935
How many oxygens do I have
on the left-hand side?

00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:48.382
I have three molecules of dioxygen.

00:04:48.382 --> 00:04:50.623
Each molecule has two oxygen atoms,

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:53.656
so I have six oxygens on the left,

00:04:53.656 --> 00:04:57.218
and I have two times three oxygens

00:04:57.218 --> 00:04:58.908
on the right, or I have six oxygens.

00:04:58.908 --> 00:05:02.108
So my chemical equation is now balanced.
