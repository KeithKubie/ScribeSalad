00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.120
North Korea claims it’s created a thermonuclear
bomb, so how is this any worse than just a

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.630
regular ol’ nuclear bomb?

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.460
Blessings of the glorious leader be upon you,
I’m Julian here for DNews.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.640
North Korea, a country that ranks in my top
two Koreas, recently announced it has successfully

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.490
detonated a Hydrogen bomb.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.270
The country has a detonated atomic weapons
in the past but an H-bomb could be a game

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.270
changer.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.400
First, a quick primer on atomic weapons.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.440
The original A-bombs, like the ones the US
dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki worked by

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.089
splitting the nuclei of heavy elements into
smaller ones in a process called fission.

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:43.199
They use either Uranium-235 or Plutonium which,
when split, release neutrons that split more

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:44.329
atoms in a chain reaction.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.929
The resulting elements have a smaller total
mass than the original, so where did that

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.249
missing mass go?

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:55.780
Well if you remember Einstein’s equation
E=mc2 you know that energy is equal to mass

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.829
times the speed of light squared.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.090
This means that a tiny amount of mass is equivalent
to huge amounts of energy.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.880
If you’re making a weapon, this principle
means the amount of Uranium-235 you can fit

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.710
in a coffee mug packs the same punch as 20
thousand tons of TNT.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.780
But A-bombs leave a lot of atomic fuel un-split,
which is where Hydrogen bombs come in.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.939
An H-bomb detonation starts the same way an
A-bomb does: Uranium-235 or Plutonium is split,

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.060
releasing tons of energy.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.159
However, right next to the A-bomb primary
is, you guessed it, hydrogen.

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.720
More specifically, Deuterium and Tritium.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.060
Deuterium is a stable hydrogen isotope with
one proton and one neutron, and Tritium is

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
also an isotope with one proton and two neutrons.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.890
The two isotopes can be smashed together to
form helium in a process called fusion, like

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.249
what happens in the core of our sun, but that
only starts to happen at 50 million degrees

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:48.359
celsius, hence why these devices are called
"thermonuclear bombs."

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.499
The x-rays from the exploding atomic bomb
have enough energy to implode the hydrogen

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:55.729
and they travel at the speed of light, so
they get to the Hydrogen before the shock

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.590
wave blows the bomb apart into less deadly
chunks.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.970
Of course, the fusion fuel produces plenty
of energy itself, but it also produces more

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.479
free neutrons which can be used to make the
fission more efficient.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.650
For this reason the H-bomb is often wrapped
in a “tamper” of more Uranium-235, meaning

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.280
it explodes in stages of fission to fusion
to fission again, like a turducken of armageddon.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.400
Theoretically it could have several stages,
and designs with up to seven layers have been

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.620
drawn up, but eventually what’s the point?

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.850
I mean just how dead to you need to make something?

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.750
The largest man-made explosion ever was a
3-stage Hydrogen bomb the equivalent of 50

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.490
million tons of TNT called the Tsar Bomba.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.360
I’ll let you guess the country.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.610
So Hydrogen bombs can be thousands of times
more energetic than Atomic weapons, which

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.440
North Korea has already tested.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.030
And since they deliver maximum bang for their
size, h-bombs can more easily fit on a missile

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.530
and devastate a city.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.090
But North Korea probably didn't set off and
H-bomb.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.010
The seismic readings from the test area are
on par with nuclear tests the country conducted

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.650
3 years ago, making experts skeptical North
Korea has pulled off the expensive and complicated

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.250
feat of creating a thermonuclear device.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.780
You may be wondering how North Korea figured
out how to make any sort of atomic weapon

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.780
in the first place.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:19.290

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.090
Are you worried about North Korea or is their
bark worse than their bite?
