00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.636
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.263
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout teaches writing
and literature at the University

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.676
of California, San Diego.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.853
Her most recent book, Burst,
merited the unusual trifecta

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.120
of wining the Pulitzer
Prize in 2010,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.373
the National Book Critics Circle
Award as well as being a finalist

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.286
for the National Book Award.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.156
This comes at a point in a
prolific career boasting 10 volumes

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.390
of poetry, here's Burst.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.936
She is only the third poet to have
won these two awards in one year.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.696
And to quote a recent
New Yorker article,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.466
the most genuinely experimental
poet to get the Pulitzer

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.763
since John Ashbury won
the triple crown in 1976.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.410
On the surface, these poems
appear modest and contained

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.070
and resemble those of
William Carlos Williams.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.816
Perhaps unassumingly simple,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.810
her poems are what the Pulitzer
Prize committee characterized

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.990
as little thought bombs.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.430
They tick in your brain, you
see the word play and virtuosity

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.596
and sophistication there, showing
off what the art of poetry can do.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.093
They pulse with intelligence.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.136
She is a high practitioner
of the art.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.903
These poems do not sit, they do
not settle, they do not behave.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.806
They sparkle with hard, brilliant
surfaces, reflecting our lives.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.956
These poems address matter and time,
existence, metaphysics with wit --

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.033
when I'm metaphorical, I'm happy,
she quips -- and make us realize --

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.836
these poems make us realize
these big questions exist

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.543
in every waking moment.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.276
Why is sleep's border
guarded, or, how the feeling

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.330
of emptiness is a preexisting
condition,

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.810
or been aware of the
bitter symbiosis of couples.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.700
It is provocative work
about the exhausting

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.006
and exhilarating moments
of our lives.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.203
Her poems are very quotable,
but I will stop there,

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:05.316
although it's tempting,
because we have the privilege

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.636
of having her with us today.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.430
Welcome, Rae Armantrout.

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.330
[ Applause ]

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.013
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Thank you.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.880
Those introductions
are always so daunting.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.716
And I was also very daunted when I
was told that I was expected to talk

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.776
and not just read, because poets are
accustomed to giving readings and,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.206
you know, maybe interspersing
the poems with a few remarks,

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.526
but not actually talking.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.333
Now, I need to put this down.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.193
But, so -- I'm prepared
to talk a little bit,

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.556
and then I'm going
to read some poems.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.843
And I wanted to start by saying
that there's a real sense

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.473
in which I shouldn't be here, in
which it's amazing that I'm here.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.326
Well, two reasons, actually.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.040
First, I grew up in a world

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.496
where literature was a
very distant reality.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.206
People sometimes say
I came from nothing,

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.366
but it's never quite like that.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.090
My parents were from Missouri,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.956
rural southern Missouri
in my mother's case.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.333
My father was a chief
petty officer in the Navy.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.510
I think it's a bit unfortunate

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.310
when you have the word
petty in your title.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.376
Like -- I don't know
why the Navy does that.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.003
So, I was raised in San
Diego, where I live now.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.930
I mean, how boring is that?

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.913
And first in Navy housing, and then

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.370
in a housing tract called
Allied Gardens, which was,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.850
as the name implies,
essentially a tract built

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.303
to house veterans returning
from the Second World War.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.156
It was a white, working-class
suburb, deliberately invented

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.993
for these returning veterans.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.790
I only recently read, really, in
Mike Davis's book on San Diego,

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.330
Under a Perfect Sun, that those
loans way back in the day,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.106
were available to white
veterans only.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.760


00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:18.853
Allied Gardens was pretty much
on the eastern edge of San Diego

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.760
at that time, so, far
from the beach,

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.560
no beach boys, no surfer culture.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.096
I didn't meet anyone who was an
artist while I was growing up.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.033
Once, a teacher tried to
introduce me to a woman

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.746
who wrote greeting cards.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.080
That was it.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.663
That was about as close as
I came to seeing a poet.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:47.096
But, nonetheless, my mother
did actually, I think,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.666
begin my interest in poetry.

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.906
She had a children -- she bought a
children's encyclopedia called Child

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.180
Craft that -- I mean,
encyclopedias now are

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.393
such a distant artifact already.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.403
They don't exist anymore, you know?

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.136
Now you just have the internet.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.463
You look things up on Google.

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.730
Google's the encyclopedia, right?

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:09.730
But, so this couldn't happen now.

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.930
But then, there was this anthology,
this encyclopedia for children,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.910
and two of the volumes
were devoted to poetry.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.533
And somehow I was captivated by
that, partly by the illustrations,

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.766
I have to admit, but partly by
the cadences and the images.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.323
There was Lewis Carroll, of course,

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.716
but somehow the editors
had also seen fit

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.873
to include some Emily Dickinson.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.406
You know, little bits, the
ones that seemed tamer.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.266
I remember one that started:
The morns are a meeker now.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.480
And ended up, you know:
I'll put a trinket on.

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.263
She was trying to match --

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.263
she was ironically trying to
match the grandeur of nature

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.406
by putting on a little trinket.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.840
My mother's favorite was called
When the Frost is on the Punkin,

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.860
which reminded her
of Missouri, I guess.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.680
When I went to school,
then I was lucky again,

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.960
because I had a first grade
teacher who loved poetry

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.033
and she got us to make
up little poems.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.793
And she bound them in
a mimeographed book.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.326
And then my seventh grade teacher
is the one I really have to thank,

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.366
if indeed thanking is appropriate
to people who turn you into a poet

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.710
because some people would
think that's exactly

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.716
where you want to end up.

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.476
But, this teacher gave me the
Louis Untermeyer Anthology

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.233
of Modern American Poetry.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.156
And it was there that I
discovered T. S. Elliot

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:42.776
and William Carlos Williams.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:47.380
Like all young teenagers, I read
The Hollow Men -- maybe not all --

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.970
but I read The Hollow Men and
went: Yeah, they're all hollow.

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:53.976
So, you know, now I think
it's not that simple.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.620
But then that was my teenage
response and I loved that.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.920
And then when I was 18, I
went to the local college,

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.540
which was San Diego
State, and met my husband.

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.416
That was about 1966, say.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.133
And I bet you can imagine
what comes next?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.853
What comes next is we
started hearing more and more

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.146
about a country about Viet Nam.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.703
The boy who grew up across the
street from me went there and died.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:19.673
And I certainly didn't want that
to happen to my new boyfriend,

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.373
to whom I'm still married.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.906
So, we began to listen to the
justifications that were being made

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.376
for that war, which are a
lot like the justifications

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.233
that are still made for wars.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.020
And we got our first taste of
spin, what we now call spin,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.280
that is concentrations
camps were captured,

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:48.923
Vietnamese were called
freedom hamlets.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.733
And people spoke about having

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.626
to destroy a village
in order to save it.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.173
And that sense that words can
be manipulated and can be used

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.753
to mislead has stuck with me since.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:07.870
I think that one good thing

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.363
that poetry can do is
it almost forces you

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.773
to pay close attention to words.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.483
I mean, that's what you're
doing when you read a poem.

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.520
There's not many other
ways to read a poem.

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:19.413
It forces you to kind of slow
down and look at the words.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.640
And I think that's useful,
especially in this age of spin.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:30.396
I think another thing
that is interesting

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.553
about poetry is it takes us back to
that time when we were very young

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.750
and we were learning language,

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:39.240
because we were all code
breakers then, right?

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.526
We were listening for repetition,
we were listening for patterns,

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:49.336
we were listening for
inflections, and we were trying

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.553
to make sense in that way.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.470
And I think we still
approach poetry that way.

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.573
And then as we got the feeling
that we were getting the hang

00:08:58.340 --> 00:09:00.806
of language, we began
to play with it.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.153
Maybe we started by babbling.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:06.286
We enjoyed it a lot, we
made language our game.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:06.430
And I think poets get to still
do that, which is pretty cool.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.533
Not that I'm going to babble,
although you may consider it babble,

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.886
but you know, the pure
pleasure of words.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.870
And then as far as my
poems, my particular poems,

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.876
I think the introduction mentioned
this, but I often start a poem

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:31.616
when I feel puzzled, when I
have a question I can't answer,

00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:34.110
which is what I call
a real question.

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:38.703
Then I try to write my way into it,
and not necessarily to settle it.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.673
I don't -- I like, for myself I
like poetry that leaves unsettled,

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.366
that just points where the problem
is, poems that are as much a mystery

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.306
as existence is a mystery,
because it is.

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:57.080
So, that's, for me, where
maybe all good literature,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.546
but certainly poems come in.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.966
And then -- so now I'm getting
close to talking about the book

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.056
that -- my most recent book.

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.253
And that book was partly written

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:13.593
after a very strange
thing happened to me.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.480
I mean, I was writing it,
I had launched into it.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:22.683
And then I was diagnosed
with a strange kind of cancer

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:23.066
that I had never heard of
before, adrenocortical cancer.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:26.356
It's extremely rare, so rare
that I've been now asked

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:29.296
to address two medical schools.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:35.563
So I'm like, you know, I present
my case as -- I'm an exhibit now.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.840
So, you know, I went, what?

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:41.830
But, and then I found out by looking
it up on the internet that it has

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:47.050
like a 5 to 15 percent
survival rate.

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:47.950
And they're talking
about five years.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:50.620
Well, it's been over four
years now and I don't seem

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.720
to be sick, so that also is strange.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.440
Thank you.

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:03.216
Thank you for clapping
for survival, yay!

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.070


00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:08.386
But being diagnosed with
a deadly disease puts you

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:09.226
in unfamiliar territory, right?

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:14.360
In a very strange state
of mind, which is, oddly,

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.366
especially if it stretches out
and you don't die right away

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:18.443
and you're not in terrible pain
-- I was lucky that I wasn't --

00:11:21.570 --> 00:11:25.836
you're left with this sense of
the strangeness of your situation,

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:26.213
your estrangement from
the world as you knew it.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:29.406
And that's not a bad
place from which to write.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:35.286
So, now I'm -- if I have
time left, and I guess I do,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:37.900
I'm going to read a few poems.

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:40.016
And I'll start with one that was
written before the diagnosis,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:45.096
but one which I think talks
about playing with language,

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:51.463
and just the pure pleasure of words
for themselves, in themselves.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.626
And that one is called Scumble.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:11:59.490
What if I were turned on
by seemingly innocent words

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.760
such as scumble, pinkie,
or extrapolate.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.183
What if I maneuvered
conversation in the hope

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:13.010
that others would pronounce
these words?

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:14.680
Perhaps the excitement would come

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.813
from the way the other
person touched them, lightly

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.946
and carelessly with his tongue.

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.860
What if 'of' were such a hot button?

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:28.250
Scumble of bushes.

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.540
What if there were a hidden pleasure

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.583
in calling one thing
by another's name.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:38.733
And there is, I think,
for some reason.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.933
That's what metaphor does.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.800
Okay, then I'm going to skip
to a couple of prose poems

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.613
that I wrote shortly after
receiving the diagnosis.

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:51.853
This first one takes most of its
imagery from the Egyptian Book

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.586
of the Dead, but it's
not quoting it literally.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:59.790
On Your Way.

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:06.163
On your way to the sea of reeds, you
will meet the soul devouring demon.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:10.416
You've heard it all
before, and you believe it.

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.546
Why not? Why would they lie?

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:17.906
You must wear the beetle
amulet to avoid being consumed.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.153
But it's also true that
you can't really know

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.020
until it's actually happening.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:28.696
So you have a sort of knowledge
which, even if later confirmed

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.776
in each detail, is still
not real knowledge.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.553
He will weigh your heart,
and if it's too heavy,

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.746
you will be swallowed up.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.973
What is this extra
element that is mingled

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.940
in when you arrive
at the ordained spot?

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:49.153
And this next one is
also a prose poem.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:51.423
And it was -- I didn't really
write it in a doctor's office,

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.793
but I got the idea for it while
I was waiting for the doctor

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:57.916
to come back and tell me
whether my cancer had remerged,

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.490
because they were reading
a scan and they were going

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:04.956
to come back and tell me.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:10.083
Together. Now I am always perched
on a metal examination table.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.513
Two people, a doctor and
a nurse, come at intervals

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.656
to tell me whether
I will live or die.

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:21.896
They do this with practiced
solemnity.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.150
They're smug or snug
in their habits,

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.400
their relative safety, of course.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.460
But that is to be expected.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.640
And I wait expectantly,
even eagerly,

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.610
as if I might be of some help.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.220
If the news is bad, I imagine,

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:42.966
they will direct our attention
to an area of concern.

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:47.803
For a moment, we will lean
together toward that place.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.666
But it would be a short
moment, right?

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.880
Then they would go away.

00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.693
And I think that when you're
in a situation like that,

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:07.153

you don't just cry and worry.

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.846
You laugh sometimes, too.

So, some of this next one
might be a little funny.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:11.270
Some of it's based on a dream I had.

Around. Time is pleased
to draw itself out,

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.016
permit itself pendulous
loops, to allow them meaning.

This meaning, as it goes along.

Chuck and I are pleased
to have found a spot

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:34.653
where my ashes can be scattered.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:38.736
It looks like a construction
site now, but it's adjacent

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:41.176
to a breathtaking, rocky coast.

Chuck sees places where
he might snorkel.

We're being shown through
by a sort of realtor.

We're interested, but can't
get her to fix the price.

It's as if the real thing, your own
absence, can never be uncovered.

Each actor's face seems

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:32.186
to have survived the same brave
battle to remain in character.

used to indicate the past.

reading poems about illness.

Okay. Lots of time.

Is that supposed to
include the Q and A?

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.563
Okay, then I should
probably stop soon.

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:13.116
I'm going to read one that
doesn't have to do with illness,

00:17:14.810 --> 00:17:15.863
it has to do with movies
that you've probably seen.

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:19.490
So these are based
on movie previews.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:19.596
And the poem's called Previews.

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:25.016
And they are also prose
poems, and each is subtitled.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.573
So the first is subtitled, America.

The playboy scion of a
weapons company repents.

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.510
His company, he sees
now, is corrupt,

his weapons being sold behind
his back to strong men.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:45.343
Alone, he builds a super
weapon in the shape of a man.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.706
Now more powerful and more innocent
than ever before, he attacks.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280

with the outside world.

Things are happening ahead, but
we don't know what they are.

no longer passengers.

going to read one more.

I don't know which
one it's going to be.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.230
And then I'm going to
take questions, I guess.

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.763
So, think of questions.

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.230
All right.

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.830
I'm going to read this one
called Hoop, which gets back

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.230
to the illness theme, in away.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:30.430
It's in two parts.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.420
Hoop. God twirled across the face

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.373
of what cannot be named
since it was not moving.

God was momentum then, that
impatience with interruption,

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.623
stamping time's blanks
with its own image.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:52.923
Now her theme will be that she
has escaped certain destruction,

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.803
that she is impossibly lucky.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.656
This theme should be jaunty,
but slightly discordant,

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.190
coming in as it does, so late.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:08.190
The character associated with
this theme should be dressed

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:12.723
in markedly old-fashioned
clothing, a hoop skirt perhaps,

offs, ready for the barbeque.

&gt;&gt; Hi. I enjoyed your
comments very much.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:41.046
In terms of the poetic act,
you talked about some stimulus,

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.336
some irritant, some mystery.

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:47.663
Okay, that's percolating
in your brain.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.340
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:51.140
&gt;&gt; What then happens?

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.273
Do you start a kind
of stream of words?

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.873
Do you write a bit, erase,
play with more words?

00:19:57.330 --> 00:20:00.263
How does it come out
and how do you shape it?

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.016
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, I carry a
blank book around with me so that

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:08.576
when something does puzzle me,
irritate me, inspire me, whatever,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:08.846
when I see or hear something
interesting, I make a note of it.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:13.100
Or even if I read something
interesting,

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.300
I make a little note of it.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.166
So, I'm kind of a magpie.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.366
And then in the mornings I'll
sit and look over my notebook

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:25.100
and I'll see what has some resonance
and also what might go with what,

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.950
because although -- some

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.486
of the poems I read today
were actually in one piece.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.056
It's more typical for my poems
to be divided into sections.

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:34.336
And those sections might
represent different moments,

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.656
different irritants or puzzles.

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.340
And so part of my process
is to see what looks

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.266
like it would juxtapose well

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.133
with something else
in an interesting way.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.250
And then, yes, I do --
I do a lot of revision.

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:56.223
And often that amounts
to cutting things out.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:58.603
Sometimes it amounts to
thinking of the right word,

00:20:59.610 --> 00:20:59.876
but often it's cutting things out.

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:02.123
I have a couple of friends
I will send poems to,

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.563

say, no, or I don't get it.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:09.060

can with it [laughs].

at least one prose poem.

could just comment on

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:36.973
or explain what your
conception of a prose poem is?

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:38.580
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.410

differentiating a prose poem

from free verse?

Actually, now that I
think of it, I read three.

a matter of tone, for me.

to use phrases that -- where
there are a lot of words

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.686
that have an immediate punch, then
I turn that into a prose poem.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:08.983
My poems that are poems tend
to have very short lines.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:11.726
And I like each of those short lines
to have an interesting word or,

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.240
you know, something punchy in it.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.026
So if it looks like I'm
not going to be able to do

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.846
that because it's just going
to be too normally discursive,

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:27.403
then I'll write it as a prose poem.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.600
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:30.810

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.876
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Oh, okay.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:35.143
I didn't see you.

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:37.010
Yes?

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:39.810
&gt;&gt; Frank Clay, from Kansas.

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:41.676
Thank you for being here.

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:42.210
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Oh, thank you.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:45.143
&gt;&gt; God bless you.

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.543
My question, as a poet
myself, is who's your audience?

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:48.343
I mean, do you define the audience?

00:22:50.010 --> 00:22:51.143
Do you care if it's us
or are you really talking

00:22:52.010 --> 00:22:52.610
about the people who
are walking around?

00:22:54.010 --> 00:22:55.956
How do you write for an audience,
or is that important to you?

00:22:56.130 --> 00:22:56.463
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, I think --

00:22:58.130 --> 00:22:58.970
I don't know how this plays to a
crowd, but I think that a poet,

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.956
or at least I, write
first for myself.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.850
And I mean that as I write as a
way of figuring out what I feel,

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:11.293
and figuring out what I think
if I can ever figure that out,

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.220
and writing into a problem.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.783
And it's a way of talking myself
into and through something first.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:23.536
So that's my first audience.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.573
And then secondly, you know,
I write for people I know

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.656
who will read my poems, I know,

00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:35.846
critically as well
as sympathetically.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:42.166
And then, you know, lately I've
been reading to more people

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.073
who aren't poets and
whom I don't know.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.310
And, you know, that's nice.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:53.076
I don't think you can
really try to write in order

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:53.443
to please an unknown audience,
though, because if you do,

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:57.030
you're turning yourself into an
entertainer somehow, which --

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:00.450
I just don't think
it works that way.

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:02.756
I think that's counterproductive
somehow.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:05.943
That's just my feeling.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:07.410
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.010
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:11.410
&gt;&gt; Oh --

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:13.276
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: You,
I guess you're next.

00:24:14.410 --> 00:24:15.410
&gt;&gt; [Laughs].

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:18.410
Yes, the -- one of the authors

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:20.010
that almost won the Pulitzer
yielded the poetry author.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:22.410
She also has a deadly disease.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:23.690
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Oh,
I did not know that.

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.490
&gt;&gt; Lucia Perillo, and --

00:24:26.890 --> 00:24:27.890
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Oh,
I'm sorry to hear that.

00:24:28.890 --> 00:24:30.556
&gt;&gt; -- multiple sclerosis.

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:32.856
My question is, do you have a
-- do you have to write about --

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.256
she also writes about her disease.

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.566
And do you have to write
about a deadly disease to --

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.413
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
To win the Pulitzer?

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.613
&gt;&gt; -- to win the Pulitzer?

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.146
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Maybe [laughs].

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.466
&gt;&gt; And the second thing on that is
actually, her poetry is very earthy,

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.360
very female, like yours
on one level,

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.070
and also on the second level it's
also very complex, like yours.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.336
And I guess the two questions are,

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.470
is that what the academics
are looking for and is

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.880
that what the masses
are looking for?

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:09.080
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, once again,
I don't claim to speak for either

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.166
of those groups specifically, but
I think if you look at the history

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:18.446
of the Pulitzer, you'll
see that it --

00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:20.726
the person, the type of poet

00:25:20.910 --> 00:25:23.576
who wins changes a
lot from year to year.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.973
I mean, you know, you're
talking about two people who won

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:27.703
or were finalists in the same year,

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.136
which means they had the same
jury of three jury people.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.303
But, you know, if you look
back two or three years,

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.603
you will see different patterns.

00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.603
I mean, it changes all the time.

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.670
It depends on who the judges are.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.936
Does it help to have
a deadly disease?

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.403
It probably does, I'm afraid.

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:47.336
I, you know, sorry [laughs].

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:48.470
Yes?

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.696
&gt;&gt; In one of the poems that you read
to us today, you used the language

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:55.643
of economics to describe
a deadly disease.

00:25:57.670 --> 00:25:59.270
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:04.003
&gt;&gt; And I'm just wondering, do you
consider that lexicon of finance

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.706
to be comparable or intertwined

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:10.983
with the lexicon of,
like, political spin?

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:14.816
And if so, could you talk
a little bit about that?

00:26:15.790 --> 00:26:17.323
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, my
next book, which is coming

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:20.190
out in January, is
called Money Shot.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.123
And that's a term that
actually comes from porn,

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:28.193
but there's not a whole
lot of porn in the book.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:31.886
It has more to do with --
well, the pornography of money

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.986
in the last couple of years.

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.273
So, yeah, I pick up language.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:37.253
Like I said, I'm sort of a
magpie, and I pick up language

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:39.770
from all sorts of sources,
the language of medicine,

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:45.150
the language of science,
the language of finance.

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.613
Whatever is, you know,
coming to the fore and is

00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:49.586
of concern to me at the moment.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.386
And, you know, we've been --

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:54.433
I actually brought poems from Money
Shot to read, but we're out of time.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:58.070
So you would have seen more
of that had I done that.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:02.450
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:05.516
I can't wait for your new book.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.566
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: [Laughs].

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.700
Yes?

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.500
&gt;&gt; You spoke about your illness, and
you write poetry about your illness,

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.496
listen, do you think an element
of truth in terms of a writer,

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:15.503
because you're writing about
something that's personal

00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:16.993
that really, really
affects you that's physical,

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:19.306
do you think an element of truth
exists there when you're writing

00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.720
about that as opposed
to other subjects?

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:27.620
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, my
experience often comes into my work.

00:27:30.180 --> 00:27:32.513
It doesn't always come in directly.

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:32.953
I mean, it's not always
announced as my experience,

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.653
even when it's about illness.

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.860
My poems never begin and
so I have cancer and so.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:43.840
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.496
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Or, you know, but
I mean, other experiences of mine,

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:47.336
other than cancer, also, you know
-- say a problem I had with my son

00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:51.343
or something, it could
enter into my work.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:55.783
I just don't frame it
as autobiographical.

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.033
It -- the autobiographical
material enters on a par

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:04.270
with things I might
notice, you know,

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.633
looking at a bird, or something.

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:11.490
And, I don't really think that one's
view of oneself is any more accurate

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:14.156
than one's view of
the rest of the world.

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.090
It can be less accurate.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.956
A lot of novelists
will tell you that.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:21.030
Okay. One more?

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:23.896
Where are -- okay, one more.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:24.436
&gt;&gt; Hi. I was wondering if you recall
the first time you were introduced

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:31.356
as a poet or you introduced
yourself as a poet?

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.130
And if you do recall,
how did that feel?

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.243
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: It
feels icky [laughs].

00:28:37.510 --> 00:28:39.776
I still try to avoid it, you know?

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:41.273
If I'm on an airplane and
I'm going to give a reading,

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.616
and the person next to me says:
What are you doing in Chicago?

00:28:46.250 --> 00:28:46.650
I never say I'm giving
a poetry reading.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.450
[inaudible].

00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:51.450
I don't know.

00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:54.316
I think that's just America.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.716
I think in some other countries,
you know -- I hear, I hear tell,

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:59.716
that in Mexico or Iran,
that poets are celebrated.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:04.503
But I think in the United
States there are a lot

00:29:05.210 --> 00:29:06.210
of sort hostile parodies of
poetry out there in the media.

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:08.303
It's considered to be
sentimental or something, you know?

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.316
So, it's a hard thing to do.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.493
I mean, I have to do it sometimes,
but it's not something you want

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.910
to usually come right out with
and have as the first thing

00:29:19.370 --> 00:29:21.036
that you tell a stranger.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:22.370

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:24.370

&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah,
well, of course I am proud.

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:36.743
But it's not something that -- I'm
not proud of being proud [laughs].

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:41.823
But you should write poetry if you
have to or if you feel like it,

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:43.433
because, you know, it is rewarding.

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:46.966
I think it's very rewarding.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.566
For one thing, poets
form a community.

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:50.720
I mean, even before I got any prizes
or even before I was published

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:55.226
by a university press back when
I was published by a small press,

00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:02.093
I could go to most big
cities and stay with someone

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:04.456
because they were a poet, or they'd
go out to dinner with me, you know?

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:07.256
There is a kinship of poets.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:08.730
And that's one of the
good things about it.
