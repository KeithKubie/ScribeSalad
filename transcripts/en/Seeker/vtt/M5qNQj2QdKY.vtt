Hey guys Trace here for another DNews short!

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:08.510
Teeth are super important for us.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.350
They allow us to chew our food and break it
down for digestion.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.450
So why aren’t we aren’t born with the
teeth we have as adults.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.450
What is the purpose of having baby teeth first?

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.450
Most mammals, including humans, are diphyodonts,
meaning we grow two sets of teeth in our lifetime.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.550
This is because baby mouths can’t fit a
full set of 32 adult teeth.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.990
Instead, we start with a set of 20 baby teeth,
also called deciduous teeth.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.590
You're actually born with these teeth already
developed inside your jaw!

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.300
In rare cases, babies can even be born with
teeth already in their mouth, called natal

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.300
teeth.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.489
For most people though, they start poking
through the gums at around 6 months to 2 years

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:44.489
old.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.060
Children need these deciduous teeth so that
they can chew food, advance their speech and

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.830
develop muscles in their mouths.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.399
But, perhaps most importantly, baby teeth
forge a space in our gums for adult teeth

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.399
to grow in later.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.239
They’re like little space holders, patiently
waiting while bigger teeth grow underneath.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.281
As we develop, our mouths grow bigger and
eventually become too big for our 20 baby

00:01:05.281 --> 00:01:06.281
teeth.

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:10.180
If we kept our initial set of teeth, they
would be tiny in our adult mouths, and have

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.780
huge spaces between them, making chewing close
to impossible.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.920
So when they start to fall out around age
6, a set of ‘permanent’ teeth emerge!

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.180
A lot of animals don’t follow this two-set
system.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.680
For instance, an alligator can replace its
teeth roughly 50 times in its lifetime.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.180
But unfortunately humans, we don’t have
that luxury.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.670
After childhood, we only get one set.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.290
Which is why it’s SUPER important to take
care of them.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.049
But what happens if you don’t?

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.420
What would happen if you just...stopped brushing.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.930
You can find that out in this video here.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.930
What about you?

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.340
Got any weird stories about losing your teeth?

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.549
Do you still have some baby teeth?

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:43.549
Let us know!
