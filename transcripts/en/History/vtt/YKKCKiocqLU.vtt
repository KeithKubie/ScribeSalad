00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:02.802
DANIELLE: Is that it?
MIKE: That's it?

00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:04.471
DANIELLE: That's
gotta be it, right?

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.705
MIKE: Wow.
DANIELLE: Yeah.

00:00:05.705 --> 00:00:07.073
MIKE: God,
this place is killer!

00:00:07.073 --> 00:00:09.075
DANIELLE: Oh, yeah.
MIKE: You don't even see it!

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.677
MIKE: Hey, Dani.

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:12.078
DANIELLE: Hi, Sue.
SUE: Hi.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.114
DANIELLE: I'm Danielle.
We spoke on the phone.

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:15.615
I told you I'd be
coming in today.

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:16.850
MIKE: Hey, I'm Mike.
DANIELLE: This is Mike.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.318
SUE: Oh, yeah, hey.
Let me grab my husband.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.153
DANIELLE: Awesome, yeah.
MIKE: Alright.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:21.588
SUE: Jack.
JACK: Yeah.

00:00:21.588 --> 00:00:22.889
DANIELLE: There's that.
JACK: Nice to meet ya.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:24.224
DANIELLE: This is what we
talked about on the phone.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.892
Hey.
MIKE: Hey, nice to meet ya.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.060
DANIELLE: Nice
to finally see you.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.495
MIKE: Yeah,
that's a list of the stuff...

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.130
MIKE: What year is the building
underneath the ivy?

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.297
JACK: 1930.

00:00:31.297 --> 00:00:34.100
My dad bought it
in the early '70s.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.470
JACK: My father bought
the Homestead Building, totally

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.974
for storing car parts,
and for storing cars.

00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.076
MIKE: Oh my gosh,
look at this side of it!

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.377
So how do you get in it?

00:00:44.377 --> 00:00:46.079
JACK: We can get into
the building through this hole.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.414
DANIELLE: We're going
in through the hole?

00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:48.648
Okay.
SUE: This is where I stop.

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.583
I'm going shopping.
Have fun today! [laughter]

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.018
SUE: You can do your own
shopping... bye-bye!

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:53.019
MIKE: Alright,
it's good to meet ya.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.120
SUE: Nice seeing you.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.355
DANIELLE: We'll
see you in a bit.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.489
SUE: Bye-bye.
DANIELLE: Thank you so much.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.690
MIKE: Alright, Dani,
you want to go first?

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.858
DANIELLE: I think
I'll let you go first.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.360
For sure.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.597
♪

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:05.698
MIKE: Alright...

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:08.468
JACK: You need a hand?
MIKE: I got...

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.671
DANIELLE: Yeah, you got it.
MIKE: Woo!

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:15.208
♪

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.877
DANIELLE: Alright.
Flashlight's on.

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:20.113
MIKE: Man, this is cool.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.748
Wow.
DANIELLE: [gasps]

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.149
This is incredible.

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.118
DANIELLE: When was the last time
this was actually opened up?

00:01:25.118 --> 00:01:26.820
JACK: Probably in the '70s.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.987
DANIELLE: Really?
MIKE: No kidding.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:29.456
JACK: It's been a long time
since I've been

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:32.559
in that building,
but it's pretty much exactly

00:01:32.559 --> 00:01:34.794
the way I remember it.
MIKE: Wow.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:36.362
JACK: Okay,
the first two steps are...

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.998
questionable.
DANIELLE: Alright.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:40.333
JACK: Bring your light,
walk on the left.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:41.935
DANIELLE: Like many of
my life choices, I suppose.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:44.370
Ooh, yeah, they are
questionable, at best.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.506
JACK: I think that's
just from moisture, though.

00:01:46.506 --> 00:01:48.308
DANIELLE: Ugh!
Whoa...

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:49.742
MIKE: You got it?
JACK: Yeah.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:52.779
MIKE: Pretty sketchy.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:55.315
DANIELLE: Ooh!
Wow...

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:57.717
MIKE: Danielle and I walk
into a room that's packed

00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:01.921
full of stuff.
I'm talking layers of it.

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:06.593
MIKE: Oh, I saw some
sign hangers over here.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.127
These are great.
They're original.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:10.663
Guys that collect signs,
you know, or have signs

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.165
that want to display them
the way they were,

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:13.299
these are perfect for it.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.767
JACK: What year do
you think they are?

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.470
MIKE: You know, early teens,
into the '40s, you know?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.005
JACK: Yeah.
Probably.

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.341
MIKE: How about these,
would you sell these?

00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:24.777
JACK: Yeah, these can go away.
MIKE: I'd do, um...

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.513
45 bucks apiece.

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:28.147
JACK: So 90 bucks
for both of them.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.649
MIKE: Yeah.
JACK: Sold.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.150
MIKE: Okay, cool.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.687
Alright, love it, man.
Appreciate it.

00:02:34.687 --> 00:02:36.422
DANIELLE: Jack had not
been in that building

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.558
in over 30 years.

00:02:38.558 --> 00:02:40.126
But what I love
is that he shared

00:02:40.126 --> 00:02:42.328
that process with us.
SUE: Wow...

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.963
DANIELLE: Got some
fun stuff happening.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.131
MIKE: Hey, sold a few things.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.666
SUE: Looks like
you had a busy day.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.901
MIKE: I did.

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:50.069
MIKE: Hey... thank you
guys for having us.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.671
SUE: Fun day, fun day.
Good to meet you.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:53.106
MIKE: I appreciate you,
seriously.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.274
DANIELLE: Yeah.
I'd give you a hug but, aw...

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:55.275
[inaudible]
MIKE: Alright.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.543
DANIELLE: Thank you
for everything.

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:59.045
MIKE: Dani, you driving?
DANIELLE: Thank you so much.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.880
[honks horn]
SUE: Bye, safe trip!

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.549
DANIELLE: Bye, Jack!
Bye, Sue!

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:03.783
JACK: See ya.
SUE: Come back soon!
