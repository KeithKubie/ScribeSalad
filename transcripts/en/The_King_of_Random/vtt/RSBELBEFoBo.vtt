00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
I want to tell you a little story of when I was growing up and working on a farm in Canada.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.140
One of the farmers I was working for had a gopher problem, they were everywhere.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.300
Thousands of them. And what he had me do was get a little bit of grain and add some

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.440
anti-freeze to it, and mix the two together.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.260
Then we would place these by the gopher holes and they would eat it,

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.420
and they would eventually die.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.340
Which brings me to the point guys, this stuff is extremely toxic and it tastes very sweet.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.500
So if you have animals in the house, and anti-freeze lying around, they will lick it up, and they will die.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.340
So please be extremely careful, if you ever try and do any experiments with anti-freeze.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.880
So I was still getting tons of requests in the comments for liquid nitrogen experiments

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.280
And as I was scrolling through today I found this comment from "Sagisu12" that says:

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.480
"Can you freeze anti-freeze in liquid nitrogen?"

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.280
That's a really good question, will anti-freeze freeze?

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.520
Over 800 of you thumbs up this comment so apparently it's something you really want to see.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.840
So I went and picked up some ethylene glycol so we can put that suggestion to the test.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.460
So in preparation for this experiment today, I did a little research on anti-freeze,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.020
and beside from the fact that it is extremely poisonous,  it actually has a really wide operating range.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.100
It can get as hot as about 130ºC and as cold as -37ºC.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.900
And I'm saying Celsius for all you international viewers out there. Give me a thumbs up if you appreciate that.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Will this stuff actually freeze, will it gum up, will it turn into kind of a slime or a gel or will it turn into like a frozen crystal anti-freeze?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
That's the purpose of this experiment today! Let's find out what anti-freeze does in liquid nitrogen.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.300
Now for this demonstration I thought it will be fun to use this curious looking little dish here.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.260
This is called a quaich and it comes from my good friend George Calver from Scotland, so thank you

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.800
George. We'll be putting this to good use today, with anti-freeze and liquid nitrogen.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.880
Let's get started

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.240
That is so pretty

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.920
It's so beautiful

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.220
That, my friends, is what anti-freeze looks like

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.180
But you would not want to put this in your mouth, it's extremely poisonous

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.480
As good as it looks,

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.560
don't drink it!

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.940
Because the way that this is kind of shining it does make me wonder

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.580
What if we took a UV flashlight to it?

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.160
Wow! That is really cool!

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.660
That is neat!

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.200
A little UV light and some anti-freeze and you've got a homemade glowstick

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.200
Who knew?

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.900
You can control your glowstick

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.480
[chuckles]

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.060
Now this fluid is really curious and I thought it would actually be a lot thicker

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.460
more like glycerin

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.840
but if you look at it, it flows kind of like water

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.800
But if I put my finger in and just kind of swish it around,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.340
it feels more like a watery, sugary syrup.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.260
It's very viscous

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.640
So let's get into our experiment. Liquid nitrogen, glass dish, here we go.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.040
There we go!

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.360
Look at that bubbling.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.880
For as many times as we've used this glass dish

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.440
I'm amazed it hasn't cracked by now.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.080
[Chuckles]

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.000
It's held up really really well!

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.020
This happens every time!

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.940
Like, as the liquid nitrogen has almost cooled the glass down in temperature,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.400
it starts rapidly boiling! It gets very violent and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.620
usually spills everywhere

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.740
Oh yeah, there it goes! Look at all the skittles!

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.380
Look how much nitrogen it has taken to cool this dish down!

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.980
This was filled up more than half-way, and now it settled down to about

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.340
a quarter, of the glass!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.500
So,

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.100
the difference is now the glass is really cold, and we can add more nitrogen to it.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.700
This nitrogen is homemade, fresh out of the dewer this morning

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:16.800
Perfect!

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.900
So looks like our dish is ready, let's go ahead and

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.540
lower the quaich.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.380
Alright, moment of truth guys!

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.420
This is pure antifreeze

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.220
First test is 100% antifreeze

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.640
Let's see how that reacts

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.460
I'm kind of, like, a little bit nervous

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.940
Cuz this dish is warm compared to that nitrogen

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:33.820
Woah! My gloves froze!

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.480
And there goes the-- Ha!

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.320
I kinda knew that was gonna happen

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.320
But look down here, look down here at the bottom

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.320
You can actually see

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.380
The antifreeze--is kinda like balling up

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.520
Bubbling around

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.580
That was a total fail

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.860
And my shirt is cold

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.580
But we still get to see what's happening here

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.520
If you look at the antifreeze, it looks like

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.000
It is turning into some kind of a--

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.900
Slightly greenish gel

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.500
But is it gel or is it solid?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.680
If you look at the slo-mo, you can see it

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.680
actually froze my fingers,  like the gloves,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.560
the tips of my fingers froze solid

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:06.880
And so I had to let it go

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.900
Liquid nitrogen repels off of the skin faster

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.000
when you don't have any gloves, like by wearing gloves

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.840
It actually freezes solid and keeps the cold in contact with my skin

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.000
So having gloves with liquid nitrogen may be counter-productive.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.120
Oh yeah, look at that

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.200
It's beautiful

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.980
It's very, very pretty and it was totally an accident.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.980
yep that's super hard

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.460
Look at this stuff down here

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.640
I'm in need of some way to scoop that out

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.620
Woah, yeah look, it froze my fingers solid

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.040
it just takes an instant

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.680
Oh! That's cold!

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.320
Ha!

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.740
*spoon clinks*

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.500
Look at this chunk in here--

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.460
Oh yeah, there's a nice, healthy chunk of antifreeze right there

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.240
That is definitely solid

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.020
WOAH!

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:56.960
Ah, it's freezing my fingers!

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.400
It like, busted away like breakaway glass,

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.640
and then it stuck to my fingers and cryogenically froze them

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.120
like a cryogenic napalm

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.760
That is nasty stuff!

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.340
You can't get it off very easily because it's very sticky.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.860
This stuff will actually crush up into a powder, check this out--

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.100
So check this out guys, we have just created--antifreeze snow.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.140
Oh look, it's dripping!

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.940
It's like, warming back up and turning into slime!

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.480
Anti-frozen slime!

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.320
Aw, you can mush it, you can mold it, you can sculpt it!

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.840
It's like gel, and it's a little bit translucent, so it kinda looks like--

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.380
The ninja turtle ooze I made out of borax

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.260
in one of my other videos

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.500
This stuff is starting to warm up, and it's actually turning opaque, which is really interesting

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.760
like, the warmer it gets, the more cloudy it gets

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:53.980
kinda looks like a lime sorbet

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.300
I wonder what it smells like

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.540
It has a slightly sweet smell, for the most part i would say you can't really smell anything

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:04.660
What does it taste like?

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.020
Just joking!

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.140
*laughs* we're not gonna taste it, ok

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.540
So we have a little leftover nitrogen in the container here,

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:13.500
what would happen if we poured that directly into a cup of antifreeze itself?

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.980
Let's find out!

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.000
Ohhh cool!

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:22.460
Look at the top here, check this out

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.920
So the nitrogen actually floats on the top of the antifreeze

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.500
and then it forms like this little crusty layer

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.640
That's bizarre, it's like making little islands of ice in there

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.560
We'll do a litle bit more this time

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.240
Yeah, so the nitrogen floats on top of the antifreeze,

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.980
And then it freezes it, this crusty layer on top.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.980
It's almost like a poisonous creme brulee.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.580
Let's poor in the rest of it.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.700
*chuckles* almost immediately, the top crusts over with ice

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.080
Or whatever that is, ethylene glycol

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.320
So if you look in here you can see the antifreeze,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.060
is almost untouched on the bottom, but then it freezes and forms a layer here,

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.960
and we have nitrogen bubbling on the top.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.940
So, we have like, frozen antifreeze--

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.100
And as it thaws it'll form this very viscous, slimy kinda syrup.

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.780
Let's make it like a frozen pond of antifreeze.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.820
So update, guys, we know antifreeze by itself will freeze completely solid,

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:25.160
but according to the container here, if we add 30% water, that will give us maximum efficiency.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.140
So I filled up a container here with a little less than 1/3 of a cup of water,

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.940
and so if we fill it the rest of the way with antifreeze,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.580
we should theoretically have a 70 30 mix,

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.580
and we can see how that reacts.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.380
A solution of antifreeze and water has a very wide temerature range

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.420
and that's very important because most automobile engines are water cooled.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.920
If you just use water by itself, there's a couple problems you might run into:

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.900
if it gets too cold, the water can freeze and turn into ice and clog up your radiator,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:57.000
and if it gets too hot it can flash into steam and cause extreme damage to the engine itself.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.720
But by adding antifreeze to the coolant, you can now widen the temperature range

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.780
because it has a much lower freezing point and raises the boiling point dramatically at the same time.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:08.420
So in the interest of conserving my precious homemade liquid nitrogen,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.400
I'm gonna pour it into the quaich here and let that cool down

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:15.060
and then we'll take this antifreeze-water solution and just slowly poor it in so we can see the reaction close up.

00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.260
Ok, so here we go, our quaich has cooled down, we got little bits of my glove floating around in there

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.440
Let's go ahead and take our antifreeze-water solution and just drip it down inside.

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.040
Here we go!

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:29.540
Aw, sweet!

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:34.320
It's like bubbling on the top, and then it sinks to the bottom.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:36.660
Will it freeze, that is the question.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.580
Now I'm not expert, but I can clearly see the answer is yes.

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.440
Look at that.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.880
It's like made a bubble.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.380
It's almost hollow on the inside, it's made a bubble of water and antifreeze.

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.220
Whoops!

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.760
It's very very fragile, apparently.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.840
I'm just gonna drip this stuff in slowly and see if that makes any difference.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.460
Now, that is kinda cool

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.200
For a second, it seems the antifreeze just kind of--

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.040
bubbles and floats on the top.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.000
Now check this out--

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.320
That is neat!

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.040
That looks pretty freakin' cool.

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:31.020
Ohh, did you see that bubble just squirt out?

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.100
While you're looking at that, I'm gonna put some UV light on it.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.060
Oooooh

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.040
Look at the way that just lights up

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.920
Woah

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.480
After this stuff is frozen solid, it kinda looks like crystals of kryptonite.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.900
Yeah, that's definitely rock hard.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.980
Adding water is still no match for liquid nitrogen.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.300
So will liquid nitrogen freeze antifreeze?

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.860
I think the answer is apparent--yes, it will. And we had a lot of fun doing it today.

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.620
We also made antifreeze snow--I didn't even know you could do that--and found that

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.820
UV light will make this stuff light up like a glowstick.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.920
All super cool experiments, and all because you asked for them.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.280
And good thanks to Sagisu12 for suggesting this experiment today

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.420
and all 814 of you that thumbs up-ed that comment.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.280
Keep an eye on your youtube inbox, Sagisu, and I'll send you 25 bucks.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.320
And thanks to all you guys for hanging out with me today! I'll be looking for you in the next video.

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.240
Talk to you then.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.740
*punch sound*

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.760
I think this thing is actually stuck to my workbench.

00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.400
I can't get it up!

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.900
*crack*

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:40.340
*punch sound*

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:50.200
*music*
