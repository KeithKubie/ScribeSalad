00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.190
Only the heterozygous genotype offers the best

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.920
of both worlds. A partial resistance to

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.140
malaria and no severe clinical symptoms of

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.610
sickle cell anemia. Either the homozygous genotypes

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.550
would result in a higher likelihood of

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.030
death. Either from susceptibility to malaria, or

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.030
a more severe syndrome of sickle cell

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.780
anemia. The heterozygote here has the advantage.
