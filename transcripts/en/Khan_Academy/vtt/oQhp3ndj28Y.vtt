00:00:00.503 --> 00:00:01.752
Narrator: In a previous video

00:00:01.752 --> 00:00:03.403
when we were looking at a very simple case

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:06.143
of compounding interest,
we got the expression

00:00:06.143 --> 00:00:14.541
(1+1/n)^n and the way we got this,

00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:17.520
we saw an example where
a loan shark is charging

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.755
100% interest and that's where this 1 is,

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:23.272
and then if they only
compound once in the year,

00:00:23.272 --> 00:00:26.066
so it's 100% over the year, then n is 1.

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:30.019
So, you get 1+100%/1^1,

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.019
you're going to have to pay back

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.778
twice the amount of the
original amount of money.

00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:39.689
If n is 2, (1+1/2)^2, gets you 2.25

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:43.852
If you compound half the interest,

00:00:43.852 --> 00:00:47.803
so 100%/2, but you compound it twice.

00:00:47.803 --> 00:00:49.672
Then we kept going and going and going,

00:00:49.672 --> 00:00:51.681
we saw interesting things happen.

00:00:51.681 --> 00:00:53.521
I want to review that right over here

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.516
using this calculator.

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:57.082
I want to see what
happens as we get larger

00:00:57.082 --> 00:00:58.269
and larger and larger n's.

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.476
In that last video we
went as high as n=365

00:01:01.476 --> 00:01:04.354
and it seemed to be
approaching a magical number,

00:01:04.354 --> 00:01:06.254
but now let's go even further.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:12.871
So, let's type in ... let's throw
some really large numbers here.

00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:23.072
1+1/1,000,000 so that's a
million to the millionth power.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:27.242
(1+1/1,000,000)^1,000,000

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:28.434
Did I get the right number of zero's?

00:01:28.434 --> 00:01:29.353
Yeah, that looks right.

00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:32.293
Before I even press
enter, which is exciting,

00:01:32.293 --> 00:01:33.872
let's just think about
what's going on here.

00:01:33.872 --> 00:01:35.719
This part that we have here is that

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:37.562
n gets larger and larger,
it's getting closer

00:01:37.562 --> 00:01:40.015
and closer to 1, but
never quite exactly 1.

00:01:40.015 --> 00:01:42.027
This is 1 and 1 millionth.

00:01:42.027 --> 00:01:44.433
So, it's very close to
1, but not exactly 1.

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:46.936
We're going to raise that
thing to the millionth power

00:01:46.936 --> 00:01:48.023
and normally when you raise something

00:01:48.023 --> 00:01:49.267
to the millionth power,
that's just going to

00:01:49.267 --> 00:01:52.020
be unbounded, just
become some huge number,

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.870
but there's a clue that 1 to the
millionth power will just be 1.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.266
If we're getting really close to 1,

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:59.929
well maybe this won't just
be some unbounded number.

00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:03.203
When we calculate it, we
see that that's the case.

00:02:03.203 --> 00:02:06.272
It's 2.71828 and just keeps going.

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:07.536
Now, let's go even higher.

00:02:07.536 --> 00:02:17.019
Let's take it ... let's
do 1+1/ and actually

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.136
I can now use scientific notation.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:32.675
Let's just say (1+1/1'10^7)^1'10^7,

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:33.637
so what do we get here?

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.810
So, now we went 2.718281692.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.139
Let's go even larger.

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:41.934
Let's get our last entry here.

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:44.341
Let's go, instead of the 7th power,

00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:45.635
let's go to the eighth power,

00:02:45.635 --> 00:02:51.068
so now we're (1+1/100,000,000^100,000,000)

00:02:51.068 --> 00:02:53.270
I don't even know if this
calculator can handle this

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.633
and we get 2.71828181487

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:02.076
and you see that we are
quickly approaching,

00:03:02.076 --> 00:03:03.803
or maybe not so quickly,
we have to raise this

00:03:03.803 --> 00:03:07.036
to a very large power, to the number e.

00:03:07.375 --> 00:03:08.803
The number e in our calculator.

00:03:08.803 --> 00:03:14.807
You see we've already gotten
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 digits

00:03:14.807 --> 00:03:16.613
to the right of the decimal point

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:19.533
by taking it to the 100 millionth power.

00:03:19.825 --> 00:03:21.542
So, we are approaching this number.

00:03:22.172 --> 00:03:25.554
We are approaching, so
one way to talk about it

00:03:25.554 --> 00:03:32.400
is we could say the limit,
as n approaches infinity.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.743
As n becomes larger and larger,
it's not becoming unbounded.

00:03:35.743 --> 00:03:37.511
It's not going to infinity.

00:03:37.511 --> 00:03:39.845
It seems to be approaching this number

00:03:39.845 --> 00:03:41.936
and we will call this number,

00:03:41.936 --> 00:03:46.612
we will call this magical
and mystical number e.

00:03:47.104 --> 00:03:48.734
We'll call this number e and we see

00:03:48.734 --> 00:03:51.458
from our calculator that this number

00:03:51.458 --> 00:03:53.599
and these are kind of, these are almost

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.269
as famous digits as the digits for Pi,

00:03:56.715 --> 00:04:04.538
we are getting 2.7182818 and it just

00:04:04.538 --> 00:04:07.267
keeps going and going and going.

00:04:07.267 --> 00:04:09.809
Never, never repeating,
so it's an infinite

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:12.215
string of digits, never, never repeating.

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:14.603
Just like Pi. Pi, you
remember, is the ratio

00:04:14.603 --> 00:04:17.101
of the circumference to
the diameter of the circle.

00:04:17.101 --> 00:04:19.351
e is another one of these crazy numbers

00:04:19.351 --> 00:04:20.868
that shows up in the universe.

00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:22.869
And in other videos on Khan Academy

00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:25.536
we go into depth, why this
is so magical and mystical.

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:26.874
Already this is kind of cool.

00:04:26.874 --> 00:04:28.604
That I can take an infinite ...

00:04:29.034 --> 00:04:33.536
If I just add 1 over a number to 1

00:04:33.536 --> 00:04:35.417
and take it to that number
and I make that number

00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:37.667
larger and larger and
larger, it's approaching

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:40.753
this number, but what's
even crazier about it

00:04:40.753 --> 00:04:42.203
is we'll see that this number,

00:04:42.203 --> 00:04:44.019
which you can view, one way of it,

00:04:44.019 --> 00:04:46.937
it is coming out of
this compound interest.

00:04:47.613 --> 00:04:50.538
That number, Pi, the imaginary unit

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:53.485
which is defined as that
imaginary unit squared

00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:54.535
is a negative 1,

00:04:54.535 --> 00:04:56.337
that they all fit together in this magical

00:04:56.337 --> 00:04:57.134
and mystical way

00:04:57.134 --> 00:04:59.096
and we'll see that again in future videos.

00:04:59.204 --> 00:05:00.736
But just for the sake of e,

00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:02.760
what you could imagine
what's happening here

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.076
is going to our previous example

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:09.867
of borrowing $1 and trying
to charge 100% over a year,

00:05:09.867 --> 00:05:11.869
when our n was 1, that means you're just

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:12.873
charging over 1 period.

00:05:12.873 --> 00:05:14.733
When n is 2, you're
charging over 2 periods

00:05:14.733 --> 00:05:17.808
and then compounding, or you're
compounding over 2 periods.

00:05:17.808 --> 00:05:20.207
When n is 3, you're
compounding over 3 periods.

00:05:20.207 --> 00:05:22.086
When n approaches infinity,

00:05:22.086 --> 00:05:24.769
you could view it as you're
continuously compounding

00:05:24.769 --> 00:05:26.605
every zillionth of a second.

00:05:26.605 --> 00:05:30.001
Every moment you're compounding

00:05:30.001 --> 00:05:32.886
in a super small amount of interest,

00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:35.518
but you're doing it,
essentially you're approaching

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:36.802
an infinite number of times

00:05:36.802 --> 00:05:38.048
and you get to this number.
