that leads to a learning disability and
 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.120
that leads to a learning disability and
intellectual disability in children and

recombinant DNA of the human genome were
 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.350
recombinant DNA of the human genome were
very limited and so the technology

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360
very limited and so the technology
 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.569

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.350
are due to try nucleotide repeat
expansions so we knew then that the

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360
expansions so we knew then that the
 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.659
expansions so we knew then that the
mutation was the expansion of the repeat

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669
mutation was the expansion of the repeat
 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.180
mutation was the expansion of the repeat
we use that to develop diagnostic tests

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190
we use that to develop diagnostic tests
 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.090
we use that to develop diagnostic tests
that went very quickly to the clinic and

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100
that went very quickly to the clinic and
 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.210
that went very quickly to the clinic and
was vastly superior to any of the tests

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220
was vastly superior to any of the tests
 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.580
was vastly superior to any of the tests
that were used before to make the

able to make more informed decisions

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880
able to make more informed decisions
 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.719
able to make more informed decisions
about reproduction and so forth after we

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729
about reproduction and so forth after we
 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.240
about reproduction and so forth after we
made a diagnostic test the next issue is

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250
made a diagnostic test the next issue is
 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.510
made a diagnostic test the next issue is
really to understand how the repeat

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520
really to understand how the repeat
 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.450
really to understand how the repeat
caused the disease so we looked at

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460
caused the disease so we looked at
 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.400
caused the disease so we looked at
expression of the gene and we found that

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410
expression of the gene and we found that
 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.279
expression of the gene and we found that
if the repeat was expanded the gene was

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289
if the repeat was expanded the gene was
 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.219
if the repeat was expanded the gene was
turned off and so it's a lack of this

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229
turned off and so it's a lack of this
 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.529
turned off and so it's a lack of this
the protein it was encoded by this gene

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.909
the protein it was encoded by this gene
that accounted for fragile x syndrome we

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919
that accounted for fragile x syndrome we
 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.260
that accounted for fragile x syndrome we
now know that the repeat itself triggers

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270
now know that the repeat itself triggers
 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.839
now know that the repeat itself triggers
epigenetic change at the locus itself

then we knew that the cause of disorder

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599
then we knew that the cause of disorder
 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.800
then we knew that the cause of disorder
was the absence of this protein the

more protein was associated with
 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:33.330
more protein was associated with
ribosomes so it was involved in protein

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:33.340
ribosomes so it was involved in protein
 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.779

humans and while they were doing that we

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800
humans and while they were doing that we
 

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.790
humans and while they were doing that we
embarked also on a drug screen to try to

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800
embarked also on a drug screen to try to
 

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.500
embarked also on a drug screen to try to
identify other compounds that might

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:25.510
identify other compounds that might
 

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.050
identify other compounds that might
similarly rescue phenotypes and we used

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:28.060
similarly rescue phenotypes and we used
 

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.090
similarly rescue phenotypes and we used
the drosophila model of fragile x

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:30.100
the drosophila model of fragile x
 

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.850
the drosophila model of fragile x
syndrome in order to screen compounds

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:32.860
syndrome in order to screen compounds
 

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.630
syndrome in order to screen compounds
mostly known drugs that might reverse

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640
mostly known drugs that might reverse
 

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.850
mostly known drugs that might reverse
the phenotype in the flies and in fact

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:38.860
the phenotype in the flies and in fact
 

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.460
the phenotype in the flies and in fact
we identified the GABA agonist as

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:41.470
we identified the GABA agonist as
 

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:44.070
we identified the GABA agonist as
another class of compound that could

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080
another class of compound that could
 

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.700
another class of compound that could
reverse the consequence of the loss of

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:47.710
reverse the consequence of the loss of
 

00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:50.340
reverse the consequence of the loss of
frp the advantage of that is there

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:50.350
frp the advantage of that is there
 

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.160
frp the advantage of that is there
already drugs approved that were GABA

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:53.170
already drugs approved that were GABA
 

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.910
already drugs approved that were GABA
agonist so today now there are clinical

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920
agonist so today now there are clinical
 

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.210
agonist so today now there are clinical
trials with both kinds of drugs now the

00:09:59.210 --> 00:09:59.220
trials with both kinds of drugs now the
 

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.660

implore 5 antagonists that a number of

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:02.670
implore 5 antagonists that a number of
 

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.500
implore 5 antagonists that a number of
pharmaceutical companies have come up

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:04.510
pharmaceutical companies have come up
 

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.260
pharmaceutical companies have come up
with compounds as well as the GABA

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:07.270
with compounds as well as the GABA
 

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.170
with compounds as well as the GABA
agonist currently are about five drug

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:10.180
agonist currently are about five drug
 

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.010

cross country and a couple more slated
 

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.900
cross country and a couple more slated
to begin this summer yeah I would say

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:18.910
to begin this summer yeah I would say
 

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.010
to begin this summer yeah I would say
that you know the one of the first

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:20.020
that you know the one of the first
 

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.269
that you know the one of the first
things we did when we started the

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279
things we did when we started the
 

00:10:21.279 --> 00:10:22.650
things we did when we started the
Department of Human Genetics was

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:22.660
Department of Human Genetics was
 

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:26.480
Department of Human Genetics was
established a fragile x syndrome clinic

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:26.490
established a fragile x syndrome clinic
 

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.040
established a fragile x syndrome clinic
so these patients would have a medical

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:29.050
so these patients would have a medical
 

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:32.540
so these patients would have a medical
home and it's proven to be very

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:32.550
home and it's proven to be very
 

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:36.030
home and it's proven to be very
beneficial to the family very useful for

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:36.040
beneficial to the family very useful for
 

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.070
beneficial to the family very useful for
our research and then when it came about

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:38.080
our research and then when it came about
 

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:39.900
our research and then when it came about
that there might be drugs entering

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:39.910
that there might be drugs entering
 

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.110
that there might be drugs entering
clinical trial phases we already had the

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120
clinical trial phases we already had the
 

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.000
clinical trial phases we already had the
infrastructure setup in order to

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.010
infrastructure setup in order to
 

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.090
infrastructure setup in order to
participate in the clinical trials and

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:47.100
participate in the clinical trials and
 

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:50.220
participate in the clinical trials and

well people that do medical research

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:00.730
well people that do medical research
 

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:03.750
well people that do medical research
hope I think at some point their work

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760
hope I think at some point their work
 

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.519
hope I think at some point their work
might lead to

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:05.529
might lead to
 

00:11:05.529 --> 00:11:08.139
might lead to
improvements in the lives of patients of

00:11:08.139 --> 00:11:08.149
improvements in the lives of patients of
 

00:11:08.149 --> 00:11:11.040
improvements in the lives of patients of
the disease a study but I think very few

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:11.050
the disease a study but I think very few
 

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.500
the disease a study but I think very few
scientists actually achieve that goal

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:13.510
scientists actually achieve that goal
 

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.540
scientists actually achieve that goal
