WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.970
I have one.
I have to boil it a Stevens.
We're live on the air.
We are,

2
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.820
yes,
and as you know,
Brody Stevens,

3
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.210
the Joe Rogan podcast is brought to you by the fleshlight.
Did you know that?

4
00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:15.360
Produce Stevens?
I'm holding one right now.
That's not a flashlight.

5
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.110
That's a rubber butthole.
It has nothing to do with the flashlight is not.

6
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.470
That is an inferior product.
That's like a paper mache Shay Porsche,
my friend.

7
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.230
Okay.
It is not the same.
The same quality,

8
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:28.770
the same craftsmanship that goes into a fleshlight.
I'm telling you,

9
00:00:28.771 --> 00:00:30.120
it's God damn work of art.

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.630
If they left you alone on the island with all the information in the world and

11
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:36.290
all the tools in a million years,
you'd never be able to build a fleshlight.

12
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.500
Right now we need a bunch of highly scientific minds,

13
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:43.380
creative minds behind this to build something like this.

14
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.330
Something that makes masturbation better.

15
00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.540
It's really better than a lot of vaginas.
I'm going to be honest with you,

16
00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.280
it's not better than having sex with a girl,
of course.

17
00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.780
Cause there's a lot more than just the actual quality of the feeling of a girl's

18
00:00:54.781 --> 00:00:59.550
vagina.
But let's be honest,
girls very in the way their vaginas feel.

19
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.170
Yeah.
And some of them aren't so good,
right Brody?
Unfortunately.

20
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.610
Yeah.
I'm sure you have.
We'll look.
We all know,
I mean,
you know,

21
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:10.710
we all know that there's somewhere out there for sure.

22
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:12.270
Unless you're some crazy freaking nature.

23
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:15.570
This guys who's got this guy has got a bigger dick than you did.
You get there.

24
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.750
It happens.
It happens.
It has to happen.
And for the girls,

25
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:22.170
that guy with the bigger jack,
that probably feels better.
I would imagine.

26
00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:25.530
It feels better.
Yeah.
I think up to a certain point,
up to a certain point,

27
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:28.470
then it starts to hurt.
But I bet it's still freaks them out that it's so big.

28
00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:32.700
I bet it's exciting.
You know?
So if the guy's like not too rough with them,

29
00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:35.480
I bet it does feel even better.
I bet they get used to it.
You know?

30
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.860
It's just natural to in the same way with tight vaginas and some girl's vagina.

31
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:42.540
It's just unfortunately are built that tight to build a slide out of baby.

32
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:44.760
Nice and easy.
We'll shrimp just like,

33
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.680
couldn't connect guy use a vibrator on a woman or is that or a dildo or is that

34
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:50.431
like demeaning?

35
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:54.000
Is that like I don't feel that you should ever bring tools into the equation

36
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.990
trying to Hitachi first though always go in strong.
No,
the problem is man,

37
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:01.830
you introduced that Shit and you've,
you basically set a bar that you can't,

38
00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.570
you can't hit that bar on your own.

39
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.810
You bring in machinery and shit show you guys are high rpms batteries and you

40
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.620
fucking know what kind of an unnatural thing is that you're hitting her pussy

41
00:02:13.621 --> 00:02:15.390
with a lawn mower,
man.
I mean what are you doing?

42
00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.400
You're trying to vibrate her into stimulation like supernaturally in a way that

43
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:22.170
would never happen in nature.

44
00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.590
So now you're going to get this crazy freak bitch addicted to stick and

45
00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.550
vibrating machines into her body to make herself come.
I mean,

46
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:33.120
she's going to be trying to distract yourself from the stress of everyday life

47
00:02:33.121 --> 00:02:38.121
so hard that she's just sticking things machines inside of her body just to try

48
00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:42.270
and make her come.
That's what she's doing.
I don't support that.
Brody.

49
00:02:42.271 --> 00:02:45.360
I support being healthy.
If a girl can't get off when you eat her pussy,

50
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.100
she's broken and you don't want her around.
Okay.
Orals.
Okay.
You can fuck.

51
00:02:50.101 --> 00:02:54.810
Yeah,
that's fantastic.
If you don't talk,
if you don't eat pussy,

52
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:56.760
there's something wrong with you.
Why would you not want to do that?

53
00:02:56.761 --> 00:03:00.030
It feels great.
It feels great for the girl.
Tastes good.
[inaudible]

54
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.880
<v 1>olives.
It's excited.
Is positive energy.
I love it.
Yeah,
it's exciting.</v>

55
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.130
It's if you love a girl and you're,
and you're having sex with her,

56
00:03:06.131 --> 00:03:09.280
it's exciting to eat her pussy.
Good.
I've done that a lot,

57
00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.040
<v 0>Brody,</v>

58
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.280
<v 1>but it's like my,
uh,
the other thing,
so I got to take like a,</v>

59
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.890
I don't believe in machines.
Protein.
Okay.
Middle almost shoes.
But maybe,

60
00:03:18.891 --> 00:03:22.870
what about a pill like a to help me a pill.
Viagra get full.

61
00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.690
I need to start exercising.
I think you stopped.
Yeah,

62
00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:30.290
and I think it's affected my blood flow.
That probably does,
right?
Yeah.

63
00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:34.140
I'm seeing it firsthand.
The lack of exercise.
I'm full.

64
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:38.850
I'll be 42 in May and started to slow down.
Yeah.
Does that,
that's normal.
Right?

65
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.410
So what can I do to combat that heavy lifting,

66
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.830
<v 0>like high intensity,
a set of like kettle bells and stuff.</v>

67
00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:49.880
Steve Maxwell showed me a bunch of different stuff that you do to sort of a slow

68
00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:54.750
the aging process.
So very,
very intense.
A lot of it is a sequences of exercises.

69
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.210
Like you're doing a whole bunch of stuff,

70
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.530
whole bunch of different like complex movements in a row.
And when you do them,

71
00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:03.560
like with maximum effort like that and you really blow yourself out,

72
00:04:03.561 --> 00:04:08.060
apparently it just jolts your bodies and new grid system and forces your body to

73
00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:12.110
start producing all kinds of higher levels of sex hormones,
testosterone,

74
00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:16.580
testosterone and human growth hormone.
Your body,
when you put your body into,

75
00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.130
if you put your body into a sedentary position,

76
00:04:19.131 --> 00:04:21.440
you put your body into like some sort of an office job.
You know,

77
00:04:21.441 --> 00:04:24.350
you're just sitting in the cubicle and there's not much physical activity going

78
00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:28.460
on.
Your body's like,
why are we working so hard to have all these uh,

79
00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:31.870
chemicals running through our body that we don't use all day?
So let's,

80
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:35.540
let's leave the day.
Let's,
let's leave the body like just like,
you know,

81
00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:40.370
able to execute sentences and you know,
be able to figure things out at work.

82
00:04:40.371 --> 00:04:43.070
But you don't need any physical strength at all.
He needed nothing.

83
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.880
He don't need to run away from Jaguars.
You don't need to fight your enemies.

84
00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:49.550
You don't need any of that.
So let's just shut all that shit down.

85
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.530
And when your body says,
well,

86
00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:53.490
if we don't need to make that and we shut all that shit down,
let's,

87
00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.670
let's not going to be available for you in the weekends.

88
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:57.620
It's not like on the weekends when you want to do crazy shit.

89
00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.760
All of a sudden your body springs to life,
your body responds to what,

90
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:06.410
what kind of stimulus you,
you put it under.
And if you live,
leave your body,

91
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.370
you know,
in a,

92
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.930
in a cubicle all day and you eat shitty food and you don't ever get to exercise

93
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.200
if you're unfortunately too busy or you just can't get motivated,

94
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.440
your body's defined.
I mean there's no way around it.

95
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.590
It's going to be a certain way.
The only way you can change that,

96
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.270
you gotta force yourself to do some serious fucking exercise.

97
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.710
Not like just go to the gym and get on the elliptical and ride that thing.
No,

98
00:05:30.711 --> 00:05:33.900
you gotta do like heavy duty sets of kettlebells.

99
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.840
We going to do like power power sets.
Were you doing like swings,

100
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.460
cleans,
presses,

101
00:05:40.461 --> 00:05:45.461
squats and then you do that in a set of like 20 you know when you're just blow

102
00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:46.790
in your fucking system out.

103
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.580
When you do that kind of extra says if you force yourself to do that,

104
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:50.870
your body will respond.

105
00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:54.680
I think we only use this at small potential of what our bodies are capable,

106
00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:58.460
most of us do.
It's why people that like work in farms are so fucking strong.

107
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.280
<v 2>Their bodies like developed that way.
Like they had to be.
If you ever,</v>

108
00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.580
you ever fuck around when a farmer no.
Also wrestle with a dude who's a farmer.

109
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.250
No Way.
Yeah,
you don't.
You don't want to wrestle with farmers,
man.

110
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.010
They're doing stuff.
The farms.
Fuck yeah,
they're throwing bales of Hay.
All debt.

111
00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.410
Yeah.
They get ahold of you.
You feel like a little bitch.
That's a fact.

112
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:18.120
And that's it's a girl farmer.
Yeah.
That girl farmer,

113
00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.630
you got to fuck the shit out of it,
Brian.
You can't just,
you know,

114
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.240
you can't just pull out machines,
but I was working out.

115
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.230
Can you get it back if you stop it?
Yeah,
you can get it back.
Yeah.

116
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:30.050
You have to take a lot of vitamins and minerals and you have to make sure that

117
00:06:30.051 --> 00:06:31.010
you get a lot of rest.

118
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.890
There's a lot of things you have to do as you get older to ensure that your

119
00:06:33.891 --> 00:06:37.640
body's in good shape.
It's not,
it's not as easy.
You know,
when I was 20 years old,

120
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:38.780
I didn't have to do shit.

121
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.850
I didn't even take vitamins when I was fighting in tournaments.

122
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:44.210
I wasn't even taking vitamins and I was just eating whatever the fuck I felt

123
00:06:44.211 --> 00:06:48.470
like eating and just competing.
Right.
But then as you become 40 years old,

124
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:51.260
like man,
if you don't,
there's a significant impact for me.

125
00:06:51.261 --> 00:06:56.261
I feel it significantly diet versus how my body performs in a rest versus how my

126
00:06:57.111 --> 00:07:00.560
body performs.
Like everything works great as long as I get sleep and I eat well.

127
00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.380
But if you throw either one of those out of the equation,
like you feel it,

128
00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:07.130
like instantly it feel,
you know,
your,
your body is not,
it's not the same body.

129
00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:10.520
I get my sleep,
knock on wood,
I make sure I get my sleep,

130
00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:13.730
but it's not always possible if you're super busy,
right?
You got Force it man.

131
00:07:13.731 --> 00:07:17.630
You fuck with super busy with life is what,
you know,
what's important is life.

132
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.460
[inaudible] these other things,

133
00:07:19.461 --> 00:07:22.670
these super busy things that you throw into your life to fuck up your sleeping

134
00:07:22.671 --> 00:07:27.280
and all this other that might not be right for you.
You know,
we,

135
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.590
we needed to pay bills,
you know,
and we,
we needed to,
to keep ourselves moving.

136
00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:33.500
Where are you going Brian?
We're about to fucking end this.
Oh,

137
00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.350
what's wrong in your mind is messed up.
What are you doing?

138
00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:40.280
Did you see where the Purple Stripe is?
Yeah,
we got to talk into,

139
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:42.223
<v 3>I feel like a</v>

140
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.613
thank you Brian.

141
00:07:47.010 --> 00:07:48.300
<v 2>Sounds exactly the same.</v>

142
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.983
<v 3>Okay.</v>

143
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:53.940
<v 2>I'll move closer to the table.
I think it sounds the same.</v>

144
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:57.240
It sounds exactly the same.
That was chaos.
Anyway.

145
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.150
Where were we fleshlight go to Joe rogan.net.

146
00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.280
Click on a link and her in the crow name.
Rogan.

147
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:05.760
Save yourself 15% Sha Zam ba boom.

148
00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:10.620
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com on it is a supplement company

149
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.820
that,
uh,
we make,
uh,
Alpha brain,
which is a cognitive enhancing supplement.

150
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:18.030
With that is,
is a nootropic if anybody's interested in nootropics.

151
00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:19.440
I say the same shit every week,

152
00:08:19.441 --> 00:08:23.370
but I have to repeat it on the chance that maybe someday someone's going to find

153
00:08:23.371 --> 00:08:25.860
this podcast and they'll never heard any of this shit before.

154
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.270
Just make it yourself.
Yeah,
he's gone.
Like,
shut up.
Brian,
Brian,
Brian,
Brian.

155
00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:32.590
There's a lot of people that haven't heard this commercial actually have to say

156
00:08:32.591 --> 00:08:36.480
it.
Yeah.
You want to make jokes commercial.
You want to mock my little my words.

157
00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:40.440
So brazenly listen what I'm trying to say ladies and gentlemen,

158
00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.580
is this things that you can do that help your mental function,
help your,
your,

159
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.180
your brain formed sentences better for me.
That's what it does.

160
00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:52.830
I notice a difference if I'm taking it from not taking it and how smooth words

161
00:08:52.831 --> 00:08:56.160
come to me.
I mean it sounds silly,
but that's what I feel,
you know,

162
00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:01.470
<v 0>and um,
it's,
there's a bunch of different nootropics.
Fuck,
just buying ours.</v>

163
00:09:01.471 --> 00:09:04.650
If you're interested in this stuff,
I always say go on Google and check it out.

164
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:09.470
Just Google nootropics and o.
O.
T r.
O,
p.
I.
C as in what,

165
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.620
what nootropics are,

166
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:14.880
is a bunch of different nutrients that have been proven to have a,

167
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.751
an effect,

168
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:20.730
a measurable effect on how your brain produces a like neurotransmitters and

169
00:09:20.731 --> 00:09:24.200
chemicals and how they interact with each other.
It's like,
it speeds up your,

170
00:09:24.201 --> 00:09:27.180
your function a bit.
It's not like crazy.
It's not limitless.

171
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:29.730
It's not like that Bradley Cooper movie where you know,

172
00:09:29.731 --> 00:09:31.050
dumb person becomes a genius.

173
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:34.530
But for me it makes me feel clear and it gives me a lot.
It's great for me.

174
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.680
Like I love taking it when I land,
if I have jet lag,

175
00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.980
it's like one of the best things for jet lag for me.

176
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:41.950
A pop two of those and it evens me out.

177
00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.370
<v 4>Is there anything like five h t t p</v>

178
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.000
<v 0>no,
that's another supplement.
That's a serotonin boosting supplement.</v>

179
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.210
And that's a lot of people,
um,

180
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:56.020
that are taking the antidepressants are supposed to not take those,
you know,

181
00:09:56.021 --> 00:10:01.021
there's doctors that think that you can get a too much serotonin and that with a

182
00:10:01.331 --> 00:10:06.100
essentially would five HTP.
If you're not on anything and you take five HTP,

183
00:10:06.101 --> 00:10:09.790
then it's fine.
But if you're on,
you know,
some sort of,
uh,
you know,

184
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:14.020
any sort of antidepressant that that boosts your Serotonin,
um,
then you,

185
00:10:14.021 --> 00:10:17.740
you can actually have too much of it cause the five HTP is providing it and then

186
00:10:17.741 --> 00:10:20.140
your,
your,
your medicine is providing it to them.

187
00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:23.440
<v 4>But what about just like,
yeah,
what's the other than this?</v>

188
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.420
<v 0>Well,
it breathes,
it's five HTP,
boost serotonin and um,</v>

189
00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:31.920
there's also an El Tryptofan which actually becomes five HTP in the body we have

190
00:10:31.921 --> 00:10:36.200
that are combined together on something called new mood.
And what new moon is,

191
00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:40.620
is just,
it's just a,
a little bit better of a five HTP on its own is great.

192
00:10:40.621 --> 00:10:41.580
If you're interested in,
you know,

193
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:44.190
you can Google that and check that out or try that yourself.

194
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:46.810
<v 4>Does that,
is that I like to clear minded thing also</v>

195
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.220
<v 0>five.
Yeah,
I'm sure you know,
when you have more,</v>

196
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.300
more happiness for sure you're going to be more clear minded.
You know,

197
00:10:52.301 --> 00:10:55.070
you feel better.
I think whenever you feel better,
you can make better decisions.

198
00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.350
I mean that,
that adds to clarity.
You know,
I just,

199
00:10:57.351 --> 00:11:01.790
I'm a big believer environments,
man.
I'm a big believer in healthy diet first.

200
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:04.370
Most important because you can take all the vitamins you want.

201
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:07.370
If you're eating shitty,
crappy,
sugary fatty foods,
you know,

202
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.190
you're still gonna feel terrible.
It's just,
it's,
those are there.

203
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:12.020
They're really toxic for your body.

204
00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:15.470
There's a lot of shit that we eat that even though it's Yummy,
it's fuck,

205
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:17.990
it's so toxic for your body.
You know,
like sugar,

206
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:23.120
sugar is fucking terrible for you.
Like drinking sodas,
tricking soda.

207
00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:27.230
Like it might be just as bad as drinking alcohol.
It's terrible for you.

208
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:31.160
Sugar is like horrible free system,
you know?

209
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.810
<v 4>Do you,
uh,
I mean,
can I cut out that and just,
should I just Chore Water?</v>

210
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.240
<v 0>You can.
Well,
you know what man,
I find,</v>

211
00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:42.230
and this is gonna sound so silly because it's,
it does,
it,
it seems silly,

212
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.910
but like I got these two things here.

213
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:49.090
One of them is this a limelight drink that my buddy Tom Atencio who used to one

214
00:11:49.431 --> 00:11:52.670
of the guys that used to be at affliction,
who's my,
who's put on the MMA shows,

215
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.960
very nice guys,
created his own,
um,
his own energy drinks.

216
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:57.940
So you sent me something,
it's really tastes good,

217
00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:02.050
but you know what else tastes good?
Fucking water man.
Water tastes good.

218
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:05.800
If you didn't have it,
you would be so psyched to get it right.
You know this,

219
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:06.913
we just,

220
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.590
we sort of take it for granted because it doesn't have like unusual flavors like

221
00:12:11.591 --> 00:12:14.740
Coca Cola does,
right?
Right.
Dr Pepper does like,
Ooh,
I need,

222
00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:19.090
I need some unusual stimulation here,
but just nice cold,

223
00:12:19.091 --> 00:12:23.320
clear water is fucking delicious.
It's one of the most delicious things ever.

224
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:27.970
But our weird monkey brains crave that fucking high fructose corn syrup.

225
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.710
They figure out how to get us addicted to,

226
00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.890
and it's in everything that it's in fucking serial,

227
00:12:32.891 --> 00:12:36.250
it's in Soda and candy bars is an everything.

228
00:12:36.251 --> 00:12:41.251
But if you can cut out 30% of that from your life that you can cut out as much

229
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:44.710
as high fructose corn syrup.
And there's,
you know,

230
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:47.470
the best I think is the Paleolithic Diet.

231
00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:51.310
And not because I'm living in the Paleolithic era,
you know,

232
00:12:51.311 --> 00:12:53.500
but because I think you,

233
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:58.590
your body is designed to eat what you know and the things that were natural to

234
00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:02.410
us like 50,000 years ago or so,
like they say,

235
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:04.570
it takes a long time for your genes to evolve.

236
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.580
So if that's like 50,000 years ago and we have the same bodies of water,

237
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.080
bodies are designed to eat like vegetables and meat,
that's,

238
00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:13.000
that's all that was there.
There really was no pasta back then.

239
00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.200
These are the longest commercials of all time or stolen store commercial.

240
00:13:17.201 --> 00:13:17.890
I can't believe it.

241
00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:21.400
I have to stop this or I have to end this because this is a good subject.
Okay,

242
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.020
and we'll,
we'll talk about it after the break.
Look,

243
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:25.270
go to [inaudible] dot com if you're interested in nootropics,

244
00:13:25.271 --> 00:13:28.360
please Google the subject.
Um,
if you enter in the code name Rogan,

245
00:13:28.361 --> 00:13:31.630
you will get 10% off.
All the different supplements is shroom,
tech,
sport,
shroom,

246
00:13:31.631 --> 00:13:33.160
tech,
immune,
new mood,

247
00:13:33.161 --> 00:13:36.550
which is the five HTP and l trip defense supplement that we're talking about

248
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:40.690
early on.
Of course,
Alpha brain,
which is my favorite.
All right,
go there,
do it.

249
00:13:40.691 --> 00:13:44.650
Don't do it.
I don't give a fuck.
Listen,
what's important is don't get ripped off,

250
00:13:44.680 --> 00:13:48.190
right?
It is these,
these supplements are real,
they're legit.

251
00:13:48.191 --> 00:13:52.710
But if you feel like it's a rip off,
here's the deal.
If you order 30 pills,

252
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:55.690
you get 100% of your money back that your first order.

253
00:13:55.691 --> 00:13:57.610
You can't like keep ordering and keep getting your money back.

254
00:13:57.611 --> 00:13:58.780
But you know how it is.

255
00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:02.230
If your first order you get your money back 100% you don't have to send them

256
00:14:02.231 --> 00:14:05.920
pills back it,
we just,
we don't want you to feel ripped off.
And then secondly,

257
00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:09.040
Google,
Google nootropics.
If our blend isn't for you,

258
00:14:09.041 --> 00:14:11.620
there's a bunch that I liked that are out there.
Neuro one was,

259
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:14.410
is a great one by a Roman Ascii,
the football player.
Oh yeah.

260
00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:17.500
He created his own blend of nootropics and that's how I got into it.

261
00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:21.410
That's why I was turned onto a buy a no name from San Francisco,

273
00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.970
<v 0>Oh yeah,
for sure.
You're,
you're a fun a cheerleader.</v>

274
00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.160
When we were at the comedy store,
man,

275
00:15:14.161 --> 00:15:16.480
you'd always have these like really fun late nights.

276
00:15:16.481 --> 00:15:17.820
That's one time I saw you at the Improv.

277
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.300
One of the best sets I've ever seen in terms of like how a guide turned the

278
00:15:21.301 --> 00:15:25.440
audience around.
There was a,
it was a late night show.
A you probably got on,

279
00:15:25.441 --> 00:15:27.810
it was probably like one o'clock in the morning by the time you got on and

280
00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:31.380
people were tired.
Man.
You could see that look,
it was like a Friday,

281
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:36.380
Friday or Saturday and you came in and you put on some fucking crazy music.

282
00:15:36.451 --> 00:15:39.690
It was like village people or something like that and you've got a shirt and

283
00:15:39.691 --> 00:15:43.500
started swinging it through the air and like clean everybody and they had

284
00:15:43.501 --> 00:15:47.790
everybody clapping along.
I mean,
it was,
it was a long time.

285
00:15:47.791 --> 00:15:48.624
You did this for,

286
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.050
you did it for like two minutes and then you completely changed the energy of

287
00:15:52.051 --> 00:15:54.600
the room and then you went up and you fucking killed.

288
00:15:54.601 --> 00:15:58.200
It was like the room was dying,
man.
People were tired.

289
00:15:58.470 --> 00:16:00.030
They were just not into it.

290
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:03.480
And you came out and you just completely changed the whole thing.

291
00:16:03.481 --> 00:16:07.560
You walk through the audience swinging,
swinging your shirt over your head.

292
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.170
It was fucking great.
It was awesome.

293
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:14.590
<v 1>Drums there too.
I think one time,
like on the,
on the metal railings.
Oh yeah.</v>

294
00:16:14.591 --> 00:16:17.170
It was drumming from that,
the comedy store all the time.

295
00:16:17.171 --> 00:16:19.180
You're always doing that.
Yeah,
the draw me thing,

296
00:16:19.181 --> 00:16:23.500
I always just thought it was funny to,
uh,
believe I was a drummer.

297
00:16:23.501 --> 00:16:28.300
That was the character.
Like actually sometimes had,
you know,
the music.

298
00:16:28.301 --> 00:16:33.120
I had roadies and I came out with a flashlight and they sat me down and I

299
00:16:33.121 --> 00:16:35.590
drummed to a couple of songs.
It was fun.
And then I would do myself.

300
00:16:35.591 --> 00:16:37.690
We talked about this in the ice house chronicles.
But,

301
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:42.090
<v 0>um,
for,
for,
for folks who don't know,
Brody Brody's,
like he's a,</v>

302
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.951
he's a good friend.

303
00:16:42.951 --> 00:16:46.550
He's one of my favorite comedians and he's like one of most comedians,

304
00:16:46.551 --> 00:16:50.790
favorite comedians.
You know,
there's,
there's a certain thing that happens to a,

305
00:16:50.791 --> 00:16:54.590
a comic when they'd been doing comedy for a certain amount of time.
I mean,
not,

306
00:16:54.591 --> 00:16:57.100
not everybody,
but someone who's good where all of a sudden they,

307
00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:00.890
they can make you laugh at anything.
It doesn't have to make sense.
And that's,

308
00:17:00.891 --> 00:17:05.030
you got in you,
you hit that mark somewhere when you started doing warm up,

309
00:17:05.270 --> 00:17:06.530
when you started doing warm up,

310
00:17:06.531 --> 00:17:10.580
you got so comfortable with going up in front of people and just,
you know,

311
00:17:10.850 --> 00:17:13.640
saying things to get them interested in getting,
you know,

312
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:16.980
and fucking around with the audience and bringing them all together.
You,

313
00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:21.560
you got so comfortable on stage that like,
there was like a big difference.

314
00:17:21.561 --> 00:17:25.070
I can remember it.
I can remember you going up and like all of a sudden like,

315
00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:28.760
you know,
you,
you had figured this formula out,
you know,
you,

316
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.250
you would like figured out whatever your,
you know,

317
00:17:31.251 --> 00:17:36.140
your Brody cadence was and you would say shit like leather exterior and we would

318
00:17:36.141 --> 00:17:39.590
be out howling laughed.
Like,
what does that mean?
A car with a lever,

319
00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:43.910
leather exterior,
no one could ever steal that choke,
killed cumbers not yet.

320
00:17:43.911 --> 00:17:47.810
Pickles,
stuff like that.
Exactly.
Exactly.
And if,

321
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.100
if you had been you,
that was a,
that

322
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.810
<v 1>was a,
a great time though then that,
you know,
that comedy store,
you know,
those,</v>

323
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:59.250
um,
those sets back then,
those late nights hats.
Mostly I liked them.
Those were,

324
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.320
I would go,
yeah,

325
00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:04.560
like be on 1231 o'clock and you get bummed out if that's all you get though.

326
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:07.200
If they like,
keeps happening,
like,
do you get bummed out now?
Like,

327
00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.560
which they still giving you like really late.
So I'm getting better spots.
Yeah.

328
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.910
I get on like last night at 1115 Amit puts me,
gives me like,

329
00:18:14.911 --> 00:18:18.030
on the weekends he gives me an okay spot on.
Um,

330
00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:22.350
I usually go like when it's the right over the end of the hump and I get it.

331
00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.050
I get it.
You know,
we're going to start taking you on the road with us.

332
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.140
If you'd done the comedy Magic Club before,

333
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.710
I did it last time with you like maybe four or five months ago.

334
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:36.150
You work in Saturday.
Um,
I can be,

335
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.830
well you are now.
Yes.
And Joy.
That's how things are booked around here.
Rogan,

336
00:18:40.831 --> 00:18:45.540
positivity,
pushing roadie.
No,
I've done that.
You had me down there.
It was just,

337
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:49.140
yeah,
that's right.
Same kind of thing.
And I went down there and you know,

338
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:53.190
I was right after you got out of your situation too.
Yeah.

339
00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:56.670
It was probably just getting my feet wet again.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

340
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.700
There was one of the first times that you went on stage,
but I had no fair,

341
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.440
no fair.
I knew that you would just go up and crush it.
Yeah.
You know,
comedy is a,

342
00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:09.060
it seems,
uh,
I don't know.
Well,
it was a real good,
good,

343
00:19:09.061 --> 00:19:12.990
real good thing for you to do right then.
Yeah.
All my comedy sets had been good.

344
00:19:12.991 --> 00:19:15.060
They've been getting better.
You've been crushing it,
dude.

345
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:19.140
You have a nice couple of times I've seen.
It's like,
it's empowering,
right?

346
00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:21.150
It doesn't,
it make you feel like,
you know,

347
00:19:21.151 --> 00:19:23.670
you've got your shit back together when you're,
you know,

348
00:19:23.671 --> 00:19:27.870
you're having these great sets.
Yeah.
I feel good.
And I,
the comedians like it,

349
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:32.490
I like it.
I'm not a,
I'm relaxed.
I know,
you know,
you get,
um,

350
00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:37.350
you know,
I've matured,
I've learned from everything so,
and I'm going up,

351
00:19:37.351 --> 00:19:39.420
like Tommy puts me up last in the main room.

352
00:19:39.421 --> 00:19:44.120
I can go on and do 35 I did 50 minutes on Saturday.
He let me do that.
I,
you know,

353
00:19:44.121 --> 00:19:46.530
it was only like 20 people and then the comedians come in,

354
00:19:46.531 --> 00:19:49.410
but I was able to really stretched there.

355
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.070
I think the next phase for me is to,
uh,
you know,

356
00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:54.480
I'm still getting nervous about some things,

357
00:19:54.481 --> 00:19:56.550
but who does and I'm not going to lie to you.
Yeah.
That's good.

358
00:19:56.551 --> 00:20:00.810
I helped me break through that and I'd like to do that.
And I know a broader,

359
00:20:00.811 --> 00:20:02.280
you're hilarious.
Just go do the road.

360
00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:06.030
It's his kid out there till I'll be in her masa.
I will be in her mouth.

361
00:20:06.031 --> 00:20:08.550
So Saturday we need to,
well,
and your podcast,

362
00:20:08.551 --> 00:20:10.230
are you still doing that podcast with Little Leicester?

363
00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.450
We do not have one scheduled on the books,
but the show is still a,
it's up.

364
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:18.440
It's on.
Hey,
this right now we would like to bring it back Heather.

365
00:20:18.441 --> 00:20:22.860
I mean Heather,
Heather
nervous right now.
Right,

366
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:25.740
right,
right.
Yeah.
No.
Uh,
Esther is very funny.

367
00:20:25.741 --> 00:20:28.250
She was on at the comedy store last night.
She goes up.
Yeah,

368
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:32.520
she has her stuff late nights sets too,
right?
Yeah.
I mean I tell you,
yeah,

369
00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:34.380
you become a better comedian at that.
But yeah,

370
00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:37.290
there's nothing like going out on the road to miss those sets.
Man.

371
00:20:37.291 --> 00:20:40.260
Those late night sets are fucking,
first of all,
it's so humbling.

372
00:20:40.261 --> 00:20:43.590
You know those 20 people in the audience said,
but,
but I liked it.

373
00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:48.070
I thrive in those situation.
Very good.
Did they show you what's

374
00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:50.320
<v 0>really bullshit?
Those sets,</v>

375
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:53.890
you can fake some shit in front of a giant room full of people,

376
00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:57.700
but when you get down to,
you know,
20 people,
yeah.

377
00:20:57.730 --> 00:21:02.380
There's no bullshit in 20 people,
man.
They,
if it's funny,
it's funny.
If it's not,

378
00:21:02.381 --> 00:21:06.100
it's fucking painfully obvious.
So I've always found,
yeah,

379
00:21:06.101 --> 00:21:09.730
I've always found that those really small shows are very valuable.

380
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.720
Small shows in front of small,
tiny groups of people are very valuable.

381
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:17.920
I can do those.
Yeah,
they're very,
they're important because a lot of guys,
you're,

382
00:21:17.921 --> 00:21:21.460
you're only getting big crowds that already like you,

383
00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:24.840
so you're not exactly sure if what you're saying is full of shit.
Yeah.

384
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:29.320
You gotta you know,
especially when it's new,
you got to go over it and Redo it.

385
00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.440
You know?
We've all had a joke that we kept a little too long.

386
00:21:32.441 --> 00:21:36.130
It was like a joke from the beginning of our career where it wasn't that good.

387
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:39.760
I've got a lot of those.
You still have them?
Yeah.

388
00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:45.270
<v 1>I mean,
yes.
And I feel like,
oh,
when I need to write new stuff,
I will,</v>

389
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:49.500
I'm having fun right now.
I may have rights to.
I take my sats,
I do crowd work,

390
00:21:49.501 --> 00:21:52.350
I goof around,
but I definitely can sit down.

391
00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.380
I know it just would take me a few sessions to sit down and write new jokes.

392
00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.370
But I haven't done that because I've been focusing on other things and I've been

393
00:22:02.371 --> 00:22:05.160
able to get by and you know,
maybe it hasn't.

394
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.970
It's made me a strong personality,
all that.
But I need to like,
yeah,

395
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.230
go out on the road.

396
00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.940
<v 0>Yeah,
he saw something,
have something out.
So people,
you know,</v>

397
00:22:13.941 --> 00:22:17.120
people hear about you from this podcast to hear about you from yours and other

398
00:22:17.121 --> 00:22:20.640
podcasts that you go on.
They want to like,
I would like to buy a Brody Stevens,

399
00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:23.900
c d,
You know,
they feel like,
why don't,
why doesn't this guy have a CD out there?

400
00:22:23.901 --> 00:22:25.490
Why aren't I on iTunes?

401
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.640
<v 1>Because,
you know,
I,
I just,
uh,
I,</v>

402
00:22:27.641 --> 00:22:32.641
here's the deal I gave myself when I got out of a,

403
00:22:33.011 --> 00:22:36.460
the UCLA thing.
I got we just to say,
I gave myself,

404
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:39.450
<v 0>okay,
let's explain this to people because no one know this is something a lot of</v>

405
00:22:39.451 --> 00:22:42.570
people listen to this podcast that had no idea what the story is.

406
00:22:42.571 --> 00:22:45.360
I don't know the exact details.
So you don't mind.

407
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:48.950
You tell the folks what happened to Brody Stevens.
Okay.

408
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.480
See you exactly the same as it was before this incident.

409
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.290
But there's an incident and I had heard about it like second or third hand,

410
00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.940
I had heard,
holy shit,
there's a public

411
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:01.410
<v 1>incident within the comedian community.
So what happened?
Basically,</v>

412
00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.333
um,

413
00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.880
I was doing comedy and I went to Ireland to perform and went to Ireland,

414
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.140
perform there,
never been over there before.
Did well.

415
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:17.160
Then I went straight from Ireland to Montreal,
went to Montreal,
got sick,

416
00:23:17.161 --> 00:23:18.570
physically sick,
Montreal.

417
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:23.600
I was taking Lexapro up into that point for basically to take the edge off.

418
00:23:23.821 --> 00:23:28.110
I guess my regular doctor gave it to me.
He said,
how long did you taking it for?

419
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:33.000
Four years.
Four years.
How much of a difference did it make?
I mean,

420
00:23:33.001 --> 00:23:37.550
I think it even me out,
whatever that means.
But I still like would,
you know,

421
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.650
staring in the mirror at myself,
be hard on myself,

422
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.620
but I wouldn't like feel it.
It wouldn't physically affect me.
Whoa.

423
00:23:45.621 --> 00:23:46.040
So you would

424
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:48.620
<v 0>still do the same things,
but it would be dull.
You wouldn't,</v>

425
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:52.530
you wouldn't feel the emotional impact of staring in the mirror and,
yeah.

426
00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:53.990
What would you do when you're staring in the mirror?

427
00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.240
<v 4>Uh,
see if my beard's perfect.
Look at this scar on my face.
Oh,</v>

428
00:23:58.241 --> 00:24:02.470
you're not talking to yourself or no,
I would.
No,
no,
no.
I don't talk to myself.

429
00:24:02.471 --> 00:24:06.690
I don't talk to myself.
I don't,
uh,
I don't hallucinate.
Well,

430
00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.180
top notch violins yourself

431
00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:11.700
<v 0>does not hallucinating.
This is people who talk to themselves to work things out.</v>

432
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:13.800
I don't think there's anything wrong with talking to you.

433
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.790
I'm sure everybody does a little bit,
but sounds weird.
But what,
who gives a fuck?

434
00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:21.210
Why isn't weird to talk to yourself?
It's weird to think in your head,

435
00:24:21.211 --> 00:24:23.850
but it's not weird to think out loud.
What if you want to hear the words?

436
00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.580
What is that?
Is that crazy?
I mean,
it doesn't make any sense to me.

437
00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.080
I think if you're a crazy person and you're talking to your staff,

438
00:24:29.081 --> 00:24:31.260
we think someone else is engaging in a conversation.

439
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.910
But sometimes hearing things out loud and defining them by saying it in a

440
00:24:35.911 --> 00:24:39.690
sentence sometimes that makes you address things that you would ordinarily

441
00:24:39.691 --> 00:24:43.170
address if they were just sort of abstract concepts,
not attached to language.

442
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:47.580
Something you weren't happy with that you did I need to someone or,
yeah,

443
00:24:47.581 --> 00:24:50.030
or something you're not happy with as far as like you know,

444
00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:52.410
fulfilling certain aspects of your life or you know,

445
00:24:52.411 --> 00:24:57.210
not being disciplined enough.
So yeah.
But when you,
when you say it out loud,

446
00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.820
okay Joe,
you're a fat fuck,
you need to go to the gym.
If I,
if I was your friend,

447
00:25:02.821 --> 00:25:04.220
I would tell you you're a fat.
Fuck me.

448
00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.890
You know when when you have like that sort of a conversation with yourself.
Yeah.

449
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.970
Sometimes it does not a bad thing to say out loud.

450
00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:14.760
<v 4>Yeah.
I feel like I need to get back to the gym.
I really do
cause I,</v>

451
00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:19.480
but I gave myself six months off to six months to no exercise.
No nothing.

452
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.040
Well I have been,
but honestly I haven't had the motivation.

453
00:25:23.041 --> 00:25:26.790
I'm stressed out a little.
I am,
I get,
I get stressed somewhat.

454
00:25:26.791 --> 00:25:30.360
I'm hard on myself but,
but I would think that the work and that would help dot.

455
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:33.870
Yeah.
And I need to do that,
but I'm also,
um,

456
00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:38.460
I'm on a medication maybe or what kind of medication?
I take Depakote,

457
00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:41.010
what does that,
but I'm only on it for like another few months.

458
00:25:41.011 --> 00:25:45.850
So you started off in the lip,
Lexapro you take that got sick and Canada stop

459
00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.010
<v 0>before that you take the Lexapro.
Yeah.
So the Lexapro you,</v>

460
00:25:49.011 --> 00:25:51.860
this is the first time you'd ever not taken it or gotten off of it?

461
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:55.850
<v 4>Yeah.
I may have got off at one time a long time.
And if you get off of it though,</v>

462
00:25:55.851 --> 00:26:00.290
you're supposed to wean yourself off.
Correct.
And I didn't because I was sick.

463
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:00.891
That's the thing.

464
00:26:00.891 --> 00:26:04.190
I was so physically sick up and I hadn't been that sick in years.

465
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.330
Lou or something.
Yes.

466
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:08.690
I didn't want to put anything in my body and I'd been wanting to get off Lexapro

467
00:26:08.691 --> 00:26:13.010
just because it makes me go pee at night and you can't drink beer and,

468
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:17.300
but that's,
you know what,
that's the trade off probably for having at work.

469
00:26:17.301 --> 00:26:19.790
And when you feel like something's not working,
it's working.

470
00:26:19.791 --> 00:26:21.720
You know what I mean?
Huh?
What,
what?

471
00:26:21.721 --> 00:26:24.080
Like if somethings you feel like you're in a good mood,

472
00:26:24.081 --> 00:26:26.720
I don't need to be on this anymore.
Keep taking it.

473
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:30.220
<v 0>Oh,
I see what you're saying.
I see what you're saying.
That too.
So,
um,</v>

474
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.190
so your doctor just sorta gave it to you to take the edge off.

475
00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:37.210
You weren't complaining about anything like really specific.
That's really,
no,

476
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.850
it was,
that seems,
that seems kind of crazy,
man.

477
00:26:39.851 --> 00:26:43.350
That seems crazy that a doctor would just prescribed pill like that looking take

478
00:26:43.351 --> 00:26:44.184
the edge off.

479
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:48.390
<v 2>I mean,
instead of telling you to like maybe try yoga or,
you know,
well,</v>

480
00:26:48.391 --> 00:26:50.510
you know what,
that's what I need to do.
I haven't done it.

481
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.670
<v 4>I haven't done yoga,
um,
ever.</v>

482
00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.600
But I was exercising.
You seen these videos?

483
00:26:57.601 --> 00:27:00.520
That was one thing I did and I felt like,
um,

484
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.470
I could eat what I wanted to because I was exercising.

485
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.130
I also had a regular gig doing audience warm up for nine years basically.

486
00:27:08.131 --> 00:27:09.930
So every week I was getting a paycheck,

487
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:14.730
doing audience warm up and then I have not been doing audience warm up for a

488
00:27:14.730 --> 00:27:17.340
couple of years.
And it's been,
I'm not saying I'm not blaming that on,

489
00:27:17.341 --> 00:27:22.020
it's been an adjustment for me and I have to start thinking like,

490
00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:25.470
this is my opportunity.
You know,
people think I'm funny,
but you know,

491
00:27:25.471 --> 00:27:28.530
I kind of went at it a different way through this audience warmup.

492
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:31.750
<v 2>Well you sort of took a job along the way and it was a good job and yeah,</v>

493
00:27:31.751 --> 00:27:35.130
it made you better as a comic.
Yeah.
But it's time to let go the teat.

494
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:39.950
<v 4>Right.
And that,
and it's taken about two years and um,</v>

495
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:45.560
I think that I,
yeah,
I put little Ipod,
sometimes I'll put extra PR,

496
00:27:45.561 --> 00:27:46.760
I put pressure on myself,

497
00:27:46.761 --> 00:27:51.761
but I think the fact that I wasn't on the Lexapro and I stopped cold Turkey just

498
00:27:52.851 --> 00:27:53.390
kind of made it

499
00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:55.790
<v 2>wars.
And you didn't feel like you are crazy.</v>

500
00:27:55.791 --> 00:27:57.830
You felt like everybody was over reacting.
Right.

501
00:27:58.970 --> 00:28:02.390
<v 4>Uh,
I thought my friends were,
I actually yet,
to be honest,</v>

502
00:28:02.391 --> 00:28:06.240
I thought they were overreacting.
I thought like,
um,
yeah,

503
00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:08.690
I felt like they were overreacting.

504
00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.910
<v 2>Yeah,
I've listened.</v>

505
00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.940
I've been around people that have been high too high and have a conversation.

506
00:28:13.941 --> 00:28:16.490
I've been around people that have been too drunk and are embarrassing,

507
00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:20.150
but there's nothing weirder than people that are on pills,
man.
You know?

508
00:28:20.151 --> 00:28:22.110
And I'm not saying that Lexapro is like everything else,

509
00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:26.510
so it's not like oxycontin's or it's not like Xanax or something.
There's a,

510
00:28:26.511 --> 00:28:27.321
there's a certain,

511
00:28:27.321 --> 00:28:32.120
something that happens when people are taking like pills now,

512
00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.530
pharmaceutical pills,
the,
the effects are very rarely positive.

513
00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.180
You know,
when,
when I hear someone's taking pills,
you know,
this,

514
00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.480
this Lexapro stuff.
I don't know if you needed it,
you know,

515
00:28:44.481 --> 00:28:47.780
I don't know what the doctor saw her,
you know what you said to him?
I don't,

516
00:28:47.781 --> 00:28:49.760
I don't know.
But I know that that stuff,

517
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.240
especially when you get off of it or if you mix it with anything else,

518
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:54.290
it's very tricky.

519
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.140
<v 4>I mixed it with pot.
Yeah,
you stop taking Lexapro cold Turkey.</v>

520
00:28:58.141 --> 00:29:03.141
I was on Canadian antibiotics and then I had regular stresses may be from the

521
00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:07.770
dis,
all these good things that were happening to me and then I was kind of

522
00:29:07.771 --> 00:29:10.050
celebrating and I actually wasn't stressed out.

523
00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.760
I was celebrating and then my friends were like freaked out and people in that

524
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:19.080
kind of like got to me.
I was in a good mood and they and and

525
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:22.760
<v 2>which is the one that's supposed to make you crazy if you would take it with</v>

526
00:29:22.761 --> 00:29:27.040
alcohol?
Is it Zoloft?
Zoloft is like alcohol and cocaine.

527
00:29:27.041 --> 00:29:28.670
It makes a psychotic or something like that.

528
00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:32.750
Do you think though it may be that a lot of people are having more successful,

529
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:35.960
there's a more successful rate with people that are on it though that just don't

530
00:29:35.961 --> 00:29:37.820
talk about it and you don't even know they're on it.

531
00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:40.910
I think that seems like there's a lot of people that are on these things.
I,

532
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.980
most of it's good.

533
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:44.920
<v 0>I think we just hear about once in a while we hear a crazy person do it.</v>

534
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:46.540
That's one out of a fail.

535
00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.810
You should be very careful when you make a statement like most of it's good

536
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:54.390
unless you've done some serious research and really can back it up because it's,

537
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.910
it's very controversial.
I think for some people it's definitely helpful.

538
00:29:57.911 --> 00:30:02.500
I have a friend that had helped him a lot and he had a a real serious bout with

539
00:30:02.501 --> 00:30:05.740
depression,
couldn't get his shit together,
got on antidepressants,

540
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.100
got himself together,
started getting in shape,
turned his life around.

541
00:30:09.101 --> 00:30:10.870
It became completely positive,

542
00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:15.760
got a real like good amount of success under his belt and then weaned himself

543
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:18.580
off of them and you know he's,
he's much happier guide.

544
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:21.160
He had to change the way his brain was wired.

545
00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.460
He had to change the way he was making connections with life for him.

546
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.410
It was almost like a,
gave him a push start.

547
00:30:26.411 --> 00:30:30.760
He gave him a fresh chance at it and a,
I forget which antidepressant he was on,

548
00:30:30.761 --> 00:30:32.230
but he was on it.

549
00:30:32.231 --> 00:30:35.860
I know I've had a few friends that have been on them and they benefited from it.

550
00:30:36.070 --> 00:30:39.670
I know,
I know there's a benefit to it,
but I all Dow,
I also get scared.

551
00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:41.410
I get scared when you know,

552
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.490
I know that people are putting people on these things and it's just to take the

553
00:30:45.491 --> 00:30:47.610
edge off.
You're like Jesus Christ.
He knew you're,

554
00:30:47.611 --> 00:30:52.360
you're changing the way someone's brain chemistry is essentially permanently.

555
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:56.200
I mean,
you know,
you're,
you're,
you're in,
you're locked into these fucking pills.

556
00:30:56.410 --> 00:30:58.960
These,
they become a part of the way your mind functions now.

557
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.630
Like when you get off of it,
it becomes very tricky,
right?

558
00:31:01.631 --> 00:31:04.750
Your whole brain is out of whack and that's where you were your,

559
00:31:04.751 --> 00:31:07.470
your whole brain.
It's like there's no all of a sudden where the,

560
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.220
where's the fucking Lexapro?

561
00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:13.720
We've been running on Lexapro for x amount of years and now it's not even here

562
00:31:13.721 --> 00:31:18.280
anymore.
So your ability to deal with stress and all the different,
you know,

563
00:31:18.281 --> 00:31:21.010
the d,
The d,
the different,
yeah.
Put that was coming at you.

564
00:31:21.011 --> 00:31:25.020
You couldn't handle it.
It was just,
you're just whacking out,
right?
Yeah.

565
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:26.370
What was it like?
What did it feel like?

566
00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:27.903
<v 6>Well,</v>

567
00:31:28.690 --> 00:31:30.160
<v 4>I mean I was thinking,
um,</v>

568
00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:31.420
<v 6>yeah,</v>

569
00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:35.440
<v 4>when that was going on it felt,
uh,
I felt fine.</v>

570
00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.690
I just felt,
I felt like I thought it was,

571
00:31:37.691 --> 00:31:41.620
I knew I was on some kind of bender and I knew my friends are like freaking out,

572
00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.500
but I was actually happy,
but I was a little combative.

573
00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.853
<v 6>MMM.</v>

574
00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.700
<v 4>But I was in a good mood,
but then I went too far.
I didn't,</v>

575
00:31:48.701 --> 00:31:52.270
I didn't nail the landing.
And when I want on Twitter,
people were saying like,

576
00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.260
this is funny.
Like his hashtags and what he's doing.
And then people got,

577
00:31:56.470 --> 00:32:01.000
they got scared and then them getting scared,
Kinda like I was,

578
00:32:01.001 --> 00:32:03.130
it was part performance art.
Yes.

579
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.490
Because I was trying to be funny and like I knew it was,

580
00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:10.210
but I didn't realize everyone was looking at me.
But the bottom line is,
yeah,

581
00:32:10.211 --> 00:32:14.800
I was,
I stop Lexapro cold Turkey.
I think that's what,
for me,

582
00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:18.700
even though my doctor,
he thought that this was just a real manic episode.

583
00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:21.010
Just w Lexapro or not

584
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.890
<v 0>doctor sounds like a Douche bag.
Well,
there's two of them doctors.</v>

585
00:32:24.930 --> 00:32:27.220
Like what do you get?
You get to feel edgy here,

586
00:32:27.221 --> 00:32:30.270
let me change the way your brain works.
And uh,
then Oh,

587
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.840
I think he just got manic there fella.

588
00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.350
<v 4>Right.
Well,
you know that that's what,
that's what,
uh,
why wouldn't</v>

589
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:40.100
<v 0>he think that that was Alexa blow Lexapro withdrawal issue?
I don't know.
He's</v>

590
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:41.960
<v 2>giving you pills.
It changed the way you think.</v>

591
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:43.420
You stopped taking them and you go bump

592
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:47.140
<v 4>just for a little bit.
Well this is a different guy that my general practitioner,</v>

593
00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:50.830
that was a guy who says,
you be on Lexapro,
you need to be on the restaurant.

594
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:55.810
They do that.
It's not,
it's not,
uh,
I don't want to,
but they do that.
He said,
wow,

595
00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:00.190
this is like five,
six years ago.
The reason why I got on stuff because I just,

596
00:33:00.191 --> 00:33:03.790
my mind was always working instead of like,
um,
you know,

597
00:33:03.791 --> 00:33:08.050
learning yoga instead of like,
I was around baseball and I didn't,

598
00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:12.820
I wasn't in like a supportive,
um,
artistic comedy community.

599
00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:13.841
<v 2>What do you mean?</v>

600
00:33:13.841 --> 00:33:16.660
You're saying your mom was always working and that's why you got on Lexapro,

601
00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.240
like tired all this working,
what would he saying?

602
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:23.480
<v 4>Yeah,
like,
um,
oh no,
I was just too hard on myself.</v>

603
00:33:23.481 --> 00:33:25.760
I've always been hard on myself and

604
00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:29.500
<v 2>did you okay.
But that's not like working,
you know,
you're,
you're saying,</v>

605
00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.470
you're saying your brain was always working.
Brain's always thinking,

606
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.970
so it's not the,

607
00:33:33.971 --> 00:33:37.870
you're thinking about things is that you're thinking badly about yourself.
Yeah.

608
00:33:37.871 --> 00:33:41.470
Low self esteem and it just repeats over and over again in your head.

609
00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:45.020
<v 4>Sometimes you have low self esteem and then a little bit of like the OCD,</v>

610
00:33:45.021 --> 00:33:47.510
I got to look a certain way.
Then I start feeling,
I mean buddy,

611
00:33:47.511 --> 00:33:50.300
these are things that are,
I know normal.
They're normal.

612
00:33:50.301 --> 00:33:53.330
I just got to learn to deal with them better.
And maybe I'm a late bloomer.

613
00:33:53.331 --> 00:33:57.650
May Be,
you know,
it's taken me until,
you know,
age 42 to figure it out.

614
00:33:57.740 --> 00:33:59.750
I don't know.
What do you think?

615
00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.350
<v 2>I think you're a great guy.
Um,
I,</v>

616
00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.120
I don't like seeing anybody in a confused state that's trying to figure

617
00:34:07.121 --> 00:34:09.400
themselves out.
You know,
I just feel like

618
00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:14.020
that's a very tricky situation.
It's very,
uh,

619
00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.450
you never know what kind of advice to ever give anybody when they're trying to

620
00:34:16.451 --> 00:34:19.970
figure shit out,
you know?
What do you say to them?
What can you say?
I know.

621
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:21.440
I don't know how your mind's working.

622
00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:26.130
<v 4>Well,
I think right now,
um,
you know,
my comedy has been great.
I feel good.</v>

623
00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:29.670
I'm relaxed on stage.
It's like these problems that I seem to be,

624
00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.700
and they're not even,
they're not unsolvable problems.

625
00:34:32.701 --> 00:34:34.440
I feel their normal problems,

626
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:39.000
but the comedy has really been good and I'm relaxed.
I'm not,

627
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:40.100
I think the Lexapro,

628
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:44.810
<v 2>yes.
The problems like staring at yourself in the mirror,
like talking about that.</v>

629
00:34:44.811 --> 00:34:45.610
That's hilarious.

630
00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:49.330
<v 4>Yeah.
Well it's all there.
I want to stop.
So next Miros hilarious.</v>

631
00:34:49.390 --> 00:34:54.310
I need a check to say Brody.
Relax.
That's the last one.
Oh,
I don't need that.
I do.

632
00:34:54.311 --> 00:34:56.590
What you need is okay.
Don't need that.
I don't need that.

633
00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.990
<v 2>He needs that.
You,
if you need a check,
it's just to be your friends.</v>

634
00:34:59.991 --> 00:35:02.900
Love you will,
you don't need as a chick that tells you what to do,

635
00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:05.090
but he needs to fuck some pussy up for a while.

636
00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:09.100
Like in like three months of fucking pussy up and then,
yeah,
but that's why nice.

637
00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.320
Or women you need Viagra or something.
Needs to have sex with women.

638
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:17.390
I mean that's,
yeah,
it's almost 40 my libido.
Pussy man.

639
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:21.260
Seriously,
it's been a while,
right?
Brody?
Like it's unique.

640
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:24.750
It's your time to fuck some pussy up for a while.
Brian.
Brian,
do you see,

641
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:26.300
listen to how you're phrasing this.

642
00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:29.730
Fuck some pussy up doesn't even sound convinced it's time to,
I'm to

643
00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.870
<v 4>make love to a woman.
I want times a day.</v>

644
00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:36.040
I know if I went on the road I'd probably hook up with checks.
Yeah.

645
00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:37.800
If you went on the road you'd would,
yeah.

646
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:41.220
<v 0>Really.
What kind of you liked cute girls that are into me.
How,
what,</v>

647
00:35:41.221 --> 00:35:44.310
what age bracket?
Uh,

648
00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:48.850
<v 4>probably like tall blonde.
She was Jewish women,
right?
No,</v>

649
00:35:48.851 --> 00:35:51.970
I like a blonde.
I don't know.
I don't actually,

650
00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.660
I don't like dicey tall blonde.
Jewish?
Yeah.
Oh Wow.
Yeah.

651
00:35:55.661 --> 00:35:59.020
That's what he said before.
Once.
You know what?
They're cute and they're into me,

652
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.260
but I see cute girls,
but half the time they're with a,
you know,

653
00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:04.810
they got a boyfriend or they're not into me.
You know?

654
00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:08.320
Also being in Los Angeles is a tough place to meet girls.
When you say Joe,

655
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:13.220
<v 0>uh,
yeah.
It's probably not the place where you want it.
Well,
I have a very strict,</v>

656
00:36:13.221 --> 00:36:17.870
no head shots policy.
I think it's very important.
Don't date anybody that's like,

657
00:36:17.871 --> 00:36:22.790
you know,
nobody in the business.
Nobody.
Yes.
And when you do that,
you know,

658
00:36:22.791 --> 00:36:24.710
you're cutting out most of the Los Angeles,

659
00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.020
you're cutting out a huge chunk to date.

660
00:36:27.021 --> 00:36:29.600
Someone who's never doesn't want to be an actor.
And it's not,

661
00:36:29.601 --> 00:36:30.980
there's anything wrong with being an actress.

662
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:36.250
It's just that I find my personality collides with people that are also

663
00:36:36.291 --> 00:36:37.700
performers,
you know?

664
00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:41.660
And especially a lot of performers are fucking super needy and they want to talk

665
00:36:41.661 --> 00:36:45.590
about their career all the time.
I,
that shit gets tired,
man.
I don't,

666
00:36:45.591 --> 00:36:48.230
I don't like talking to my,
about my career to anybody.

667
00:36:48.231 --> 00:36:49.700
I don't talk about it to my wife.

668
00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:52.580
And I'd very rarely talk about to my comic friends.
You know,

669
00:36:52.581 --> 00:36:56.630
I just do my shit and just I could concentrate on my work and that's it.
I don't,

670
00:36:56.631 --> 00:37:00.200
I don't,
I don't want to be around someone who's like me.
You know what?

671
00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.860
Because the odds of them being like me and me liking them and being me being

672
00:37:03.861 --> 00:37:07.220
able to like be around them all day every day and deal with their nonsense.

673
00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:11.300
No,
no.
We're at civilians.

674
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:12.303
<v 4>Civilians.</v>

675
00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.090
<v 0>Yeah.
Regular people,
man.
You know,
and somebody,</v>

676
00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:17.250
somebody got annoyed when you fucking cold.

677
00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:20.760
This is the stupidest fucking tweet ever.
I hate when you call,

678
00:37:20.761 --> 00:37:23.820
when you comedians called regular people don't do comedy civilians.

679
00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:28.830
It's a total insult to our armed forces.
It's funny,
you fucking Dork,

680
00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:32.200
whoever you are out there.
You dork.
I hope it wasn't just trolling.

681
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.540
He wasn't trolling man.

682
00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:36.720
I looked at some of his other Rah Rah Rah tweets and I wanted to kick him right

683
00:37:36.721 --> 00:37:40.200
in the Dick.
But Joe has nothing wrong with loving American boy.

684
00:37:40.230 --> 00:37:43.320
Just don't be a pussy about it.
This isn't a Goddamn captain America movie.

685
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.820
You crazy bitch is a reason why comedians call regular folks.

686
00:37:47.821 --> 00:37:51.780
Civilians is because comedians are weird as fuck.

687
00:37:51.781 --> 00:37:56.520
And if you wanted to pretend that the whole world is filled with Comedians,

688
00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:58.860
you'd be able to say anything anywhere.

689
00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.040
You'd be able to say the rudest rape joke at the top of your lungs and a

690
00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:05.410
restaurant while you're on a hot date,
comedians wouldn't care at all.
You,

691
00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:10.400
you almost have to think of the other people that like when someone is,

692
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:14.580
especially like when it comes to like a senses of humor and the uh,
you know,

693
00:38:14.581 --> 00:38:16.800
willingness to get insulted by something like that.

694
00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:19.970
It's almost impossible to insult the average comedian.
You know,

695
00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:23.100
if you have a bunch of us and you came into a room and there was a bunch of us,

696
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:25.830
you've pretty much feel like you could say whatever you want it.
Yeah,

697
00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.290
isn't it one of the beautiful things about being a comic,

698
00:38:28.291 --> 00:38:31.260
like when you would go to the comedy store and pull into the back,

699
00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:36.100
you step out of your car,
you could scream the n word at the top

700
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.980
<v 2>of your lungs.
And we,
and we would just go,
what's up Brody?</v>

701
00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:41.000
You can say whatever you want.
You could just,
you know,

702
00:38:41.001 --> 00:38:43.390
you could just hello niggers and we would just go,

703
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.440
[inaudible] said that somebody stopped.
I'm saying,

704
00:38:47.441 --> 00:38:51.610
I'm not saying it,
I'm saying if he said that,
we would have no problem with it.

705
00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:53.110
You could say the most ridiculous thing ever.

706
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:57.100
Because comedians for the most part are almost impossible to,

707
00:38:57.101 --> 00:39:01.270
to insult like that.
Right.
And that's an average person would be very insulted.

708
00:39:01.271 --> 00:39:03.910
The average person and you know,
really off color things,

709
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.360
you're taking a huge chance.
And I did that on Twitter.
I was being,

710
00:39:07.361 --> 00:39:11.020
so I was on Twitter and people saw that and they go,
this guy's freaking out.

711
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:13.210
Did you see what we're Louis Ck wrote about Sarah Palin?

712
00:39:13.211 --> 00:39:15.760
It was fucking hilarious.
He went off about Sarah panel at all.

713
00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.140
He was drunk on an airplane.

714
00:39:17.141 --> 00:39:20.230
It was just tweeting about her calling her contract and now he won't do the

715
00:39:20.231 --> 00:39:22.450
thing.
Yeah,
it was great.
It was great.

716
00:39:22.570 --> 00:39:26.200
Would you describe Twitter for the people that don't know why Twitter is pretty,

717
00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.300
people don't know what to do.
Yes,
they do Twitter,

718
00:39:29.301 --> 00:39:32.080
it's pretty common with Brody Brody's obsessed with Twitter and Ian,

719
00:39:32.081 --> 00:39:33.970
that's something that you've been talking about lately.

720
00:39:33.971 --> 00:39:36.880
Maybe backing down from Twitter and I've been trying to tell him that's a bad

721
00:39:36.881 --> 00:39:40.150
idea.
As a performer,
as a comic,
I think act out your biggest tool.

722
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:44.980
Twitter is amazing.
I'm just obsessed by my number.
You are.
I'm a,
I'm impressed.

723
00:39:44.981 --> 00:39:49.210
And yet,
um,
you know,
I find out so even you get obsessed about your followers.

724
00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.500
I get excited when I say go up.
Do you compare yourself to other people?

725
00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:55.270
Like somebody as a million favorably,

726
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:59.200
unfavorably to like a lot of famous people might dam and let me ask a question.

727
00:39:59.290 --> 00:39:59.981
Barely hanging in there.

728
00:39:59.981 --> 00:40:03.610
But if I saw Courtney Cox you the day and I smash her with my numbers.

729
00:40:03.611 --> 00:40:08.260
That's cool.
Now does that stress you out,
Josie,
that would like gives me stress?

730
00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:11.890
No.
Why not?
Because I do a lot of Jujitsu.
That's what stresses me out.

731
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.740
My stress comes from real men trying to strangle me.

732
00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:18.070
This is silly nonsense to me.
So this his fun.

733
00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:21.520
I mean like when I look at like my Twitter number,
I go like,
Ooh,
come on bitch,

734
00:40:21.521 --> 00:40:24.760
I want to get a million.
But you also think about,
I don't freak out.

735
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.990
Are you on all those websites?
So that follow and track like,

736
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.290
like twit star or fade star that I didn't even know about.
Oh yeah.

737
00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:35.860
[inaudible]
you'll become like a stockbroker with birds.
It's,

738
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:39.840
you'll fucking go crazy shows how many retweets and favorites you get.
Minor.

739
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.320
I just like when depressed will enjoy,
I enjoy a good Twitter exchange.

740
00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:45.220
You know what I enjoy?

741
00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:49.390
I enjoy putting up a cool link and then having a bunch of people respond to the

742
00:40:49.391 --> 00:40:53.380
link and then a bunch of people will tweet me like related links that are even

743
00:40:53.381 --> 00:40:57.880
more interesting sometimes.
You know,
it's like you get on this little um,
uh,

744
00:40:57.881 --> 00:40:59.140
vibe about something.
Any,

745
00:40:59.141 --> 00:41:03.010
any subject that you wind up posting about and you can learn a lot of shit

746
00:41:03.011 --> 00:41:07.240
through Twitter and just took a few minutes.
Yeah,
I get the news and everything.

747
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:08.770
Fuck,
it's great for news man.

748
00:41:08.771 --> 00:41:12.550
I found out when they killed a Kadafi that was on,

749
00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.310
I found that out on Twitter before I heard that it was like a couple of

750
00:41:15.311 --> 00:41:18.400
different news things.
It was seen on Twitter.
Jeff Ross tweeted it,

751
00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:22.120
deaths when people die as he looks like when Whitney Houston died,

752
00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:26.440
that was on Twitter.
I found out immediately on Twitter.
Yeah,
Twitter.
I go,
yeah,

753
00:41:26.470 --> 00:41:28.690
I'm on it all the time.
I follow a lot of people.

754
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.720
Some people think I follow too many people,
but I know a lot of people.

755
00:41:31.721 --> 00:41:34.610
I follow them.
I know a lot of people follow a lot of people.
Brody,

756
00:41:34.611 --> 00:41:36.020
you're respected and you're well known.

757
00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.680
Have you heard about these tattoos that uh,
no key is coming out with Brian?

758
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.280
Oh yeah.
Oh Dude.
No.

759
00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:45.800
Kia is coming out with tattoos that will vibrate when your fucking phone is

760
00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:49.650
ringing.
That seems like I heard about that.
Oh,
you know what,
that's,

761
00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.830
that's the most ridiculous thing if you think about it,

762
00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:55.250
because like what if you had like a tattoo back in the 80s that was like,
dude,

763
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:58.910
it's a double cassette player in your arm.
You know?
Like right now,

764
00:41:58.911 --> 00:41:59.451
you'll be like,
yeah,

765
00:41:59.451 --> 00:42:02.660
I got this double cassette player in my arm know who's going to care about the

766
00:42:02.661 --> 00:42:06.140
fucking vibrations and 20 years or you might have to get that shit carved out of

767
00:42:06.141 --> 00:42:09.560
your flesh.
Right.
But,
uh,
it's no key in these crazy bastards.

768
00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:14.590
Nokia apparently is like the number one or one of the number one cell phone guys

769
00:42:15.351 --> 00:42:18.920
in the world.
And even though like they're getting crushed now by apple,

770
00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.260
like up until the iPhone came along,

771
00:42:21.261 --> 00:42:23.930
they had like some of the most innovative phones they had.

772
00:42:23.931 --> 00:42:28.040
Like they have like one phone.
It's like,
uh,
like at the top of the line.

773
00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:30.200
Shit right now.
It's amazing.
Beautiful phone.

774
00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.350
But she can never get into it because the operating system is like some wonky

775
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:36.170
thing that they created and it's like,
where's this going?

776
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:39.050
This operating system is going nowhere.
You know?
I mean,
you know,

777
00:42:39.051 --> 00:42:40.160
when there's windows phones,

778
00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.640
you know that windows is always going to be around when there's yeah.

779
00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.140
Know an apple phone,
you know that apple is always going to be around,

780
00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.800
but there's no key,
uh,
you know,
Weirdo fucking,

781
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:52.040
it's not working over here.
What is that noise?
Are you singing over there?

782
00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:53.243
<v 6>No.</v>

783
00:42:53.530 --> 00:42:57.790
<v 2>You didn't hear that?
No,
no.
Really?
Wow.
I was talking about,</v>

784
00:42:58.800 --> 00:42:59.110
<v 6>yeah.</v>

785
00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:03.090
<v 2>Do you hear that?
What was that?
Oh,
no,
lots.
It's people in the other rooms.</v>

786
00:43:03.091 --> 00:43:07.540
Fucking ghost here.
We w w here at the Ice House.

787
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:13.050
Ice House is a fucking great club.
It's amazing comedy club in Pasadena.
And um,

788
00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.340
they have,
uh,
a tele communications room that we took call it.

789
00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:20.880
What is the Tele advanced security room?
Advanced security.
Yeah.

790
00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.620
Is it called like phone spam?
Yeah,
essentially.

791
00:43:24.910 --> 00:43:28.380
It's like when you go to a comedy club and they say,
you know,
fill out this,
uh,

792
00:43:28.381 --> 00:43:31.720
your address and you,
you know,
we'll put you on raffles to win tickets.
Yeah.

793
00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.680
And so it's kind of that.
But what it really is,
is just come to a comedy club,

794
00:43:34.690 --> 00:43:38.130
you know,
help us out.
This place is a bad ass fucking place.
This is,

795
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.430
this is one of the best clubs in the country.
No doubt.
50 year anniversary,

796
00:43:41.490 --> 00:43:45.180
55 zero.
Isn't that amazing?
Yeah.
And there's two rooms here.

797
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.160
That's one of the things that make it so bad ass.

798
00:43:47.161 --> 00:43:51.770
There's a little 85 seater that we always do our a death squad chosen and

799
00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.200
they're the most fun man.
I,

800
00:43:53.201 --> 00:43:56.310
I have a lot of new shit that I've been working on in these little,

801
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:59.850
the little 85 seater.
It's like,
it's so intimate in there.
It's so perfect.

802
00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:03.240
Crowds are great.
Yeah.
Why,
why we're doing our,
um,
yeah,

803
00:44:03.241 --> 00:44:06.360
Brian Needed Dick last time,
but while we're doing our podcast right next door,

804
00:44:06.361 --> 00:44:08.340
there's a telemarketing group.
They're calling people up.

805
00:44:08.341 --> 00:44:11.670
That's what all that noise was.
You know what?
I've never followed Sam Tripoli.
He,

806
00:44:11.671 --> 00:44:15.360
uh,
it was Saint Patty's day or whatever it's called and he,

807
00:44:15.370 --> 00:44:18.920
he's really engages the audiences I've noticed.
Uh,

808
00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:23.190
cause I watched his set and he's just like getting up wound up following him on

809
00:44:23.191 --> 00:44:25.500
Saint Patty's Day with when everyone's drunk and young.

810
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.320
That was one of the hardest sets I've,
I've ever done.

811
00:44:28.321 --> 00:44:31.310
I don't know if I could follow the same AAA.
He needs to be as close.

812
00:44:31.311 --> 00:44:34.800
There's a fucking headline clothes.
I brought him with me a,

813
00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:39.060
a bunch of Canadian gigs.
He fucking crushed dude.
He,
he does great.
He's a,

814
00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:41.340
he's a real common.
He man,
Sam's veteran,
you know,

815
00:44:41.341 --> 00:44:45.030
say I'm probably around crushes.
I love watching them too.
It's fun comedy,

816
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:48.600
you know,
he's a fun dude.
You know?
It's like,
he's like,
he's there.

817
00:44:48.601 --> 00:44:51.210
He's like a party leader,
you know.
It's fun.
It's fun.

818
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:55.980
He's got Nadie so Thursday comedy store.
Comstack yeah,
Sam Tripoli's.

819
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:59.100
Uh,
he's a great dude.
I love that guy.
I love going on the road with them too.

820
00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:01.410
Is it hard to follow a guy like that?

821
00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:05.490
Like good to follow dot that because the crowd is already laughing.
Yeah,

822
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.720
it's easy.
Yeah.
Just as if your materials good.
But there's a lot of guys,

823
00:45:09.721 --> 00:45:10.920
they don't like that pressure.
You know,

824
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:12.810
we've talked about this a few times on this podcast.

825
00:45:12.811 --> 00:45:17.040
A lot of guys go on the road and they take someone on the road that's,
you know,

826
00:45:17.070 --> 00:45:20.790
not gonna show them up.
You know,
it's kind of like,
yeah,
it's important to them.

827
00:45:20.791 --> 00:45:24.840
They want to go on the road with someone who's just okay enough to get the job

828
00:45:24.841 --> 00:45:25.511
done and then,

829
00:45:25.511 --> 00:45:27.930
then you go up and you look or your hero and you knock it out of the park.

830
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:31.230
I'll be with I,
Joey d is an Ohio cause that what you're trying to call yourself,

831
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.570
is that what you are now Brian?
You know,
people want to hear you.
You're fine.

832
00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.800
You got some good stuff here.
Here's,

833
00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.690
I'm going to be give you some public criticism.

834
00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:42.280
You just need to decide if you're going to do it.
Yeah.

835
00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:45.030
Comedy is not something you could do like one day,

836
00:45:45.031 --> 00:45:48.030
every three weeks and think about it for five minutes before you do it and do

837
00:45:48.031 --> 00:45:51.750
the same jokes again.
Right.
If you want to do it,
I only do it a lot.

838
00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:54.030
I only do it about once,
twice a week now.

839
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:58.740
And I tried new jokes on stage because I feel a lot of these crowds,

840
00:45:58.741 --> 00:46:02.130
I've already seen me already.
So a lot of my shit's like half open mic,

841
00:46:02.131 --> 00:46:04.350
half PR to practicing old bits.
Dude.

842
00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.040
You know it's like a workout you have with this podcast is a legitimate

843
00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.950
opportunity to become a professional comedian.

844
00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:15.210
All you have to do is choose to write jokes and start performing on a regular

845
00:46:15.211 --> 00:46:18.510
basis and you could do the road all the time and you don't ever have to work for

846
00:46:18.511 --> 00:46:23.040
me or anybody else or I don't think I or would ever want to work the run the

847
00:46:23.041 --> 00:46:25.260
road.
I don't think I'd ever want to do that fucking traveling.

848
00:46:25.261 --> 00:46:28.950
I'd rather just stay at home and have sex.
It's now go and look at TVs and stuff.

849
00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:32.790
Wow.
You won't see.

850
00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:36.750
You either have to have the road and you are not like traveling does take a lot

851
00:46:36.751 --> 00:46:39.150
out of you.
You love the road,
you're on the road all the time.

852
00:46:39.151 --> 00:46:43.740
I'm amazed you could even survive cause I mean I would want to be home with kids

853
00:46:43.741 --> 00:46:46.080
and kissing kids and you know,
stuff on that every week.

854
00:46:46.081 --> 00:46:46.711
What are you talking about?

855
00:46:46.711 --> 00:46:50.460
I'm never on the road for more than a few days at a time ever.
Yeah.
And I'm all,

856
00:46:50.461 --> 00:46:53.130
I'm on the road a lot of weekends,
but that's how I make my living,
you know?

857
00:46:53.131 --> 00:46:57.150
And I think that if you're a professional stand up comedian,

858
00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.300
in order to be on top of your game,
you have to do it all the time.

859
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.770
I've tried it both ways.

860
00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:05.490
I've tried doing like one show a week for like a couple of weeks.
It's not good.

861
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:08.760
The best way to one show a week is like just enough to keep you tuned up.

862
00:47:08.761 --> 00:47:11.760
And if I do that,
then I make myself listen to recordings.
Stand up.

863
00:47:11.761 --> 00:47:16.410
Comedy is a vibe you have to be,
you have to be able to pull people in to that,

864
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:19.350
that feeling that you get when you're just on top of it.

865
00:47:19.351 --> 00:47:23.790
When you really got your timing down,
you're,
you're in the moment perfectly.

866
00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.610
And that's not an easy vibe to recreate if you're out of shape,

867
00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:30.100
if you're at a comedy shave.
But so once you're in comedy,
like as a comic,

868
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.780
<v 0>as a professional,
I think that's,</v>

869
00:47:31.781 --> 00:47:33.760
it's very critical that you got to perform a lot.

870
00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:38.910
<v 1>I try to get onstage,
right.
Get onstage like three,
four nights a week here.</v>

871
00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:42.780
That's hard to do an ally.
It is hard to do in La.
And then I'll,
you know,

872
00:47:42.781 --> 00:47:46.770
mix a podcast.
I'll pick up another show like,
well I get three.
Yeah.

873
00:47:46.771 --> 00:47:48.980
Like sometimes maybe I'll get him,
I'll get on more than that.

874
00:47:48.981 --> 00:47:51.300
The road is the best because if you're doing,

875
00:47:51.301 --> 00:47:53.280
like I'm doing Louisville next weekend,

876
00:47:53.281 --> 00:47:56.340
this weekend we're at the Comey magical up tickets mall almost.
Hold on.
Yes.

877
00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:57.390
Comedy and Magic Club.

878
00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:01.920
<v 0>Friday and Saturday.
Um,
Duncan trussell's doing both nights.
And um,</v>

879
00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:06.300
I find that when you do like a whole weekend,
he'd do four shows in a row.

880
00:48:06.301 --> 00:48:10.710
Two on Friday,
two on Saturday.
Yeah.
Sometimes one on Thursday or Sunday.
Man,

881
00:48:10.711 --> 00:48:13.860
by the time that wrong,
that's on each show.
Saturday comes around,

882
00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:19.010
you just knew bits just become crushers.
Yeah.
That's the bad.

883
00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:23.670
If you got a new bid on Thursday and you jump on stage with it and by Saturday

884
00:48:23.671 --> 00:48:26.970
night,
how good does it feel when it becomes like a new weapon,
you know,

885
00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.630
get that makes me so excited.
It makes me hard to sleep.
I go back to the hotel,

886
00:48:30.631 --> 00:48:33.750
I can't fucking sleep.
You're excited.
I want to write more.
You know,

887
00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:37.110
it's like what you,
what you create when you create a great bit,

888
00:48:37.111 --> 00:48:40.170
when you create something and all of a sudden people love it and they get

889
00:48:40.171 --> 00:48:42.840
excited by it and you see it kill in front of thousands of people.

890
00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:47.520
You created this,
this,
this,
this burst of energy.
You created this moment,

891
00:48:47.521 --> 00:48:51.420
this positive thing,
this,
this laughter inducing thing.
This,

892
00:48:51.550 --> 00:48:55.590
you pieced it together with words and expression and idea and you've created

893
00:48:56.510 --> 00:49:00.870
something that has the ability to extract good feelings out of people.
Laughter,

894
00:49:00.900 --> 00:49:04.080
hilarity.
And that's so addictive.
Once you do it,

895
00:49:04.081 --> 00:49:07.270
and once you get that feeling and you realize that it's,
it's in you and you,

896
00:49:07.271 --> 00:49:09.870
there's more of it in there.
You just got to pull it out by writing.

897
00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:12.820
Just force yourself to sit down and write and constantly work at it and you,

898
00:49:12.821 --> 00:49:16.230
you just put all your focus in it and boom,
you're rewarded at boom,

899
00:49:16.231 --> 00:49:19.720
you're rewarded.
It's one of the most beautiful things I think in,

900
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:21.840
in all of all of life.
Being human,

901
00:49:21.841 --> 00:49:24.960
it's being able to create something and then bring that shit on stage like right

902
00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:28.800
away and have people laugh at it.
It's one of the fucking greatest gifts ever.

903
00:49:29.230 --> 00:49:32.980
<v 1>So how do I get booked for those rooms?
How does that send out?</v>

904
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:35.890
But I'll tell you what,
when you're saying this,
I did headline,

905
00:49:35.891 --> 00:49:36.850
I went down to La Jolla.

906
00:49:36.851 --> 00:49:40.420
I have gone down there with Sam Aaa and these other voice doesn't count.

907
00:49:41.350 --> 00:49:44.680
I know it doesn't,
it doesn't count,
but it was for me.
It's a club for me.

908
00:49:45.550 --> 00:49:47.800
But it doesn't count because anybody can headline that thing.
They'll,

909
00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:50.200
they'll have crazy headliners down there.
They have,

910
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:52.570
they've done some particular shows down there,
right,

911
00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:56.470
where people are headline and you're like,
what?
They shouldn't be.
Yes.

912
00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.890
Well maybe I wasn't one of those guys.
None.
Well,
but it helped me.
I mean,

913
00:49:59.891 --> 00:50:03.580
I did four shows down there and the kid who went on before me was pretty good.

914
00:50:03.581 --> 00:50:08.190
When or how long ago was this?
Uh,
like,
uh,
six weeks ago and ask us to tweet it.

915
00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:10.720
Rooted,
tweeted the shit out of that.
People from this podcast,

916
00:50:10.721 --> 00:50:14.470
we'd love to go see you alive.
Yeah,
yeah.
No,
I think they were a,

917
00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:18.890
<v 0>yes.
Yeah,
dude,
this is how it works.
Anytime you ever have anything you do,</v>

918
00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.460
you tell us and we'll tweet it.
And then if you,
you know,

919
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:25.480
if you ever want to come on the podcast and talk about something and you're

920
00:50:25.481 --> 00:50:28.790
going to do you just come on podcast,
tell us.
But if you,

921
00:50:28.791 --> 00:50:30.080
if you're doing a gig somewhere,

922
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:32.120
definitely let us know so that we could tweet it.

923
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:36.000
<v 4>You know,
I like doing podcasts.
I love doing the red band podcast.</v>

924
00:50:36.001 --> 00:50:39.600
I love doing the ice house chronicles.
Those are all,
I did Ari's podcasts.

925
00:50:39.601 --> 00:50:43.050
I've done stuff with Duncan.
I'm enjoying my comedy.

926
00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:47.310
I'm working on this HBO project.
It's like I want,
I got a lot of things going on,

927
00:50:47.311 --> 00:50:51.150
but it's like I just try to be me.
Right?
It seems to be working right,

928
00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:54.290
but I want to do,
I want to do the road.
I feel like I'll,

929
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.400
I'm gonna have to wait for something else to happen.

930
00:50:56.401 --> 00:50:57.540
What you should do at the road,

931
00:50:57.580 --> 00:50:59.590
<v 0>you should do the road with a couple other guys.</v>

932
00:50:59.670 --> 00:51:02.860
You should get like a Tripoli or you know,
someone else that,

933
00:51:02.861 --> 00:51:06.230
that can draw off the internet.
People that everybody knows from the Internet,

934
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:09.160
you know,
like if say like him and Tripoli,

935
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:13.060
like you and Tripoli and Brian say of you and Tripoli and Brian decided to do a

936
00:51:13.061 --> 00:51:15.290
couple of dates and Tempe,
Arizona.
Tell me,
yeah,
tell me.

937
00:51:15.291 --> 00:51:17.520
You guys wouldn't kill it.
We would write,
you can't,

938
00:51:17.590 --> 00:51:21.070
I bet you guys could get 300 400 people in a night.
I really believe that.

939
00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:24.780
I agree.
Yeah.
If you do like a Wednesday night or Thursday night and used,

940
00:51:24.781 --> 00:51:28.180
do a reasonable ticket price price,
you know,
and that's it.
That's a great show.

941
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:31.150
Trips,
Tripoli would headline it said when you become,

942
00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.390
and you become a better comedian,
doing those shows too,

943
00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.570
is you become a better comedian when you do a lot of different audiences.

944
00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:41.110
You have to be able to deal with the conservative audiences.
You know,

945
00:51:41.111 --> 00:51:41.681
that you would get,

946
00:51:41.681 --> 00:51:45.940
may be in certain parts of Texas and the liberal audiences that you would get in

947
00:51:45.941 --> 00:51:48.920
certain parts of California,
San Francisco,
northern California,

948
00:51:48.921 --> 00:51:51.700
and northern California is very different than southern cal.
Oh yeah.

949
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:55.120
Northern California is maybe twice as smart as southern California.

950
00:51:55.121 --> 00:51:59.020
They're hard audience there.
They're great audiences.
In my favorite I,
I did,
uh,

951
00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.860
one of my cds,
they're shiny happy Jihad just because I just love it.

952
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:05.620
I think San Francisco is,
if you,
if they're laughing,

953
00:52:05.621 --> 00:52:08.800
it's cause it's fucking funny.
There's,
you know,
they're,
they're like,

954
00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:13.660
they're the smartest.
I think the most read it maybe New York City is pretty,

955
00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:16.960
pretty close up to their,
you know,
they're,
they're probably right.
Right.

956
00:52:16.961 --> 00:52:21.070
Neck and neck with each other.
Yeah.
So you can't pull over any,
no,
no dumb shit.

957
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:24.220
It's very DIY.
You can do dumb shit in San Francisco,
in New York either.

958
00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:27.280
I mean there's parts in New York and his burrows and suburbs and you know,

959
00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.220
you get road gigs,
you might be able to get away with some stupid shit.

960
00:52:30.221 --> 00:52:34.150
But in Manhattan She's as Christ,
you better have good comedy,
you know,
that's,

961
00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:36.850
that's a real city.
These are real people.
They're not stupid.

962
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.380
You're not going to get them with tricks.

963
00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:40.990
And a lot of these people that go to these Manhattan comedy clubs,

964
00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:43.890
I mean these are goddamn comedy because kind of sores,
you know,

965
00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:47.440
they're fans of Lenny James.
Yeah.
They might have Lenny Bruce vinyls at home,

966
00:52:47.441 --> 00:52:48.820
you know,
I can San Francisco,

967
00:52:48.821 --> 00:52:52.330
there's a lot of like real comedy fans in San Francisco.

968
00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.030
Like I've talked to people about this show and you know,

969
00:52:55.090 --> 00:52:57.520
Super Nice people and they,
oh,
thank you very much.

970
00:52:57.521 --> 00:53:00.150
We come every week and then whenever there's a comic and talents,

971
00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:03.450
our favorite thing to do,
we've seen pat nozzle always seen Du,
Du,
Du,
Du,
Du,
Du,
Du,

972
00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.850
we to a lot of,
we have a lot of weed up there,
a lot of weight.

973
00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:11.020
A lot of couples now.
He didn't mean couples like we,
you know,
we'd,
um,
but um,

974
00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:13.120
there's a lot of,
uh,
you know,
people who love it.

975
00:53:13.150 --> 00:53:15.570
Like there's people that are like jazz kind of sewers,
you know,

976
00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:18.280
and they want to just go out and see like live jazz.

977
00:53:18.281 --> 00:53:20.560
They know who the artists are and they go see it in a regular basis.

978
00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:23.350
I find that the,
the two places where that happens,

979
00:53:23.351 --> 00:53:27.900
the most that I experienced is a San Francisco in New York,
San Francisco,

980
00:53:27.901 --> 00:53:30.960
New York.
It seems to be like there's a lot of people that are just really,

981
00:53:30.961 --> 00:53:33.630
really into comedy.
I like the history of comedy.

982
00:53:33.631 --> 00:53:37.530
I've had like the most cool like history of comedy conversations with people.

983
00:53:37.620 --> 00:53:40.140
There's always people that are like fans of one or two,

984
00:53:40.170 --> 00:53:44.370
one a few guys like Hicks or Kinison like that comes up a lot of my shows

985
00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:47.250
because they know that I was a big fan of those guys,
you know?

986
00:53:47.251 --> 00:53:49.620
But as far as like a,
you know,

987
00:53:49.621 --> 00:53:52.020
like cities where your company has to be top notch,

988
00:53:52.170 --> 00:53:55.290
you gotta think like New York and San Francisco,
the top two.
Right.

989
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.450
<v 4>I love performing in New York.
I did the lower east side.
That was,</v>

990
00:53:58.451 --> 00:54:00.850
I mean that wasn't the clubs.
I did stand up New York.

991
00:54:00.851 --> 00:54:03.190
I was a barker at the comedy cellar.

992
00:54:03.191 --> 00:54:08.090
I barely got on at Boston comedy club maybe once.
Boston comedy was great.
Yeah.

993
00:54:08.290 --> 00:54:10.560
What is that like 80 seats?
How many seats was that?
Yeah,

994
00:54:10.561 --> 00:54:14.440
it was something like that.
Small players.
Great.
I used to love doing that place,

995
00:54:14.441 --> 00:54:18.720
man,
but I wasn't,
I wasn't really,
I wasn't really past there,
so I mean it was,
I,

996
00:54:18.721 --> 00:54:22.270
I would be intimidated.
I was so intimidated that I worked at the comedy cellar.

997
00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:25.210
I just never asked to get past.

998
00:54:25.260 --> 00:54:29.640
<v 0>I used to do sets at Boston and it would be me,
Jim Brewer.</v>

999
00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:34.940
Dave Attell.
Yeah,
Dave Chappelle.
I mean,
it would just crazy.
Yeah,

1000
00:54:34.941 --> 00:54:37.800
yeah,
yeah.
And then there's some other guys like really funny guys from New York,

1001
00:54:37.801 --> 00:54:42.660
like Greer Barnes and all these other guys,
but just kill or after killer.
And we,

1002
00:54:42.661 --> 00:54:45.900
you have the sense like when you were watching Nick de would go up,

1003
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:47.610
you had this sense like,
wow,
you know,

1004
00:54:47.611 --> 00:54:51.540
I'm around like I'm around some like really heavy talent.
You know,

1005
00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:53.720
you had the sense with like,
wow,
these guys are,
you know,

1006
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.290
these guys are going to be fucking huge.

1007
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:57.100
<v 4>Which it was at.
Um,
I mean,</v>

1008
00:54:57.101 --> 00:55:01.930
is that happen like everywhere or because you were younger,
you were already,

1009
00:55:01.931 --> 00:55:05.740
it'd be,
I mean,
is that specific to New York or is that specific to like

1010
00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:11.650
<v 0>New York always has a lot of talent for sure.
Right?
There's waves though.</v>

1011
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:15.790
I was a,
I came on a very fortuitous wave,
you know,

1012
00:55:15.791 --> 00:55:20.020
where I got to see a lot of like super talented guys,
you know,
I mean,
my wave,

1013
00:55:20.021 --> 00:55:22.620
when I first moved to New York,
I saw Dave Chappelle performing.

1014
00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.330
He was like really young man.
Dave was way younger than me.

1015
00:55:25.331 --> 00:55:30.070
I'm 44 and I was 21 at the time.
20 No,

1016
00:55:30.071 --> 00:55:34.290
22,
maybe 23 at the time,
the most 23 and uh,

1017
00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:38.680
Dave was way younger than me.
He was like 17 or 18 or something like that.

1018
00:55:38.681 --> 00:55:41.770
I don't know how old he was.
Yeah.
But I got to see him,
uh,

1019
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:45.820
perform at catch a rising star and I was like,
wow,
how bad ass is this kid?

1020
00:55:45.821 --> 00:55:48.790
He was like super chill and he had the,
I don't remember,

1021
00:55:48.791 --> 00:55:50.710
I was thinking like what a great stage presence.

1022
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:54.340
He has like a really like enjoy watching him talk and he's like really

1023
00:55:54.341 --> 00:55:57.940
compelling and yet he's so young,
which is really rare.
You know,

1024
00:55:57.941 --> 00:56:01.420
when someone's young,
usually they try too hard,
they rushed,

1025
00:56:01.421 --> 00:56:04.030
they're too anxious to have you pay attention.
There's,

1026
00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:08.080
it's distracting that they're not on the right vibe but at like as a young

1027
00:56:08.081 --> 00:56:12.160
teenager,
he just had the right vibe on stage.
He knew how to draw you in.

1028
00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.700
It was a,
he was a compelling speaker,
like as a young man.

1029
00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.400
And then he was really funny too.
On top of that,
he had some great bits,

1030
00:56:18.610 --> 00:56:23.500
great timing and Shit.
I got to see like a tell,
develop his style,
you know,

1031
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:27.400
a tell like slowly became that guy.
He might go.

1032
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.410
A lot of that was,
you know,

1033
00:56:29.411 --> 00:56:32.500
it was like you could watch it like come together over the years and then it

1034
00:56:32.501 --> 00:56:35.530
became like the most copied style of delivery ever.

1035
00:56:35.530 --> 00:56:40.360
Maybe for the media of New York.
Definitely.
Yeah.
What is it basically,

1036
00:56:40.361 --> 00:56:43.240
you know,
comedy don't stop.
You know,
you just keep going.

1037
00:56:43.241 --> 00:56:45.850
You're always going to get better.
Hopefully in some people.

1038
00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:48.760
Some people don't get better.
It's like anything in life,
there's no guarantees,

1039
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:51.520
man.
That's what's scary about it,
you know?
I wish I could tell you.
Yeah,

1040
00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:54.890
keep going and you'll get better.
It's no,
I might,
you know,
oh,
this is it.

1041
00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:57.110
But that [inaudible] fear is supposed to be there.
Man.
That said,

1042
00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:00.640
part of what motivates you,
part of it,
what makes you work?
You know,
one,

1043
00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:04.000
one of the things I'm most excited about right now is that I'm about to release

1044
00:57:04.001 --> 00:57:07.870
my next special,
I'm going to film it on April 20th in Atlanta at the Tabernacle.

1045
00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:11.470
Nice.
Still available for the circle.
True.
First show was pretty much sold out,

1046
00:57:11.471 --> 00:57:13.510
but we're going to,
I'm going to film it,
I'm going to release it on the Internet.

1047
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:16.780
And what I'm scared about is writing a whole new fucking act and who knows my

1048
00:57:16.781 --> 00:57:20.350
neck.
Dak might suck.
I might be terrible now.
I might,
I might,

1049
00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:23.380
it might not be able to do stand up without the weapons of the past.

1050
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:24.820
I don't believe that's the case.

1051
00:57:24.821 --> 00:57:27.370
I'm positive that I'm gonna be able to write some new shit.
But Shit,

1052
00:57:27.371 --> 00:57:29.440
anything can happen,
man.
Anything can happen.

1053
00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.830
And that's that that keeps you honest,
that keeps you real.
You know,

1054
00:57:32.831 --> 00:57:36.520
if you're always going on stage,
you know,
killing with the,
these,

1055
00:57:36.521 --> 00:57:41.521
these pieces that you've written for years and honed to a razor sharpness.

1056
00:57:41.621 --> 00:57:46.600
It's like after a while it almost becomes like you just kind of like plugging in

1057
00:57:46.601 --> 00:57:47.890
and using tools.

1058
00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.660
Whereas when you're forced to write new shit and been forced to craft a new bid

1059
00:57:52.661 --> 00:57:56.710
and make it into something that's,
that's that you're confident in,
you know,

1060
00:57:56.711 --> 00:58:01.180
that you could really use on stage with 100% confidence and not go,
here we go.

1061
00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:05.320
How's this one going to work out?
What's that scary.
I'm scared of that.

1062
00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:09.190
I'm scared of that right now,
but that's good dude.
That's important.

1063
00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:12.910
You can't always be comfortable.
You know,

1064
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:17.080
you gotta get up in the morning and run just to let your brain know that you can

1065
00:58:17.081 --> 00:58:18.130
do it.
You know,

1066
00:58:18.131 --> 00:58:23.131
sometimes I force myself to do a Hindu squats like out of nowhere,

1067
00:58:23.261 --> 00:58:26.590
you know what you do,
squats are um,
I'm up to 200 now.

1068
00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:30.640
I do a 200 of them in a row and I do it before I do any workout before.

1069
00:58:30.641 --> 00:58:33.880
No matter what I do before I do what I do,
200 Hindu squats.

1070
00:58:34.360 --> 00:58:36.760
And the reason why is I thought about it,
I was like,
God,

1071
00:58:36.761 --> 00:58:38.800
I hate doing these fucking things.
I hate them.

1072
00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:42.550
There are these body weight squats and you,
it's not hard to do one.

1073
00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:45.960
It's like really easy like breathe in and you like it.

1074
00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.230
You go all the way down your,

1075
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:51.570
your heels come off the ground into a very deep bodyweight squat and then you

1076
00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:56.080
stand back up.
Well,
they,
once you start,
once you get to like 40 or 50 in a row,

1077
00:58:56.081 --> 00:58:59.530
it fucking sucks,
man.
It sucks.
Yeah,
it's your,

1078
00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:02.770
your lungs are burning and you have to keep taking these huge,

1079
00:59:02.771 --> 00:59:05.800
enormous deep breaths in order to keep the pace cause you get,
you know,

1080
00:59:05.801 --> 00:59:08.360
you're trying to keep the same pace.
And I,

1081
00:59:08.370 --> 00:59:12.790
I've started forcing myself to do them and to force myself to do them,

1082
00:59:12.791 --> 00:59:16.540
just to let my brain know that you're going to have to start doing,

1083
00:59:16.541 --> 00:59:19.960
just deal with it,
bitch.
Just stop.
Stop your fucking complaining.
You know,

1084
00:59:19.961 --> 00:59:24.080
just make yourself do it's time to do it.
Ready?
Go.
I don't want to do it.

1085
00:59:24.081 --> 00:59:26.420
I'll do it in them first thing in the morning before breakfast.

1086
00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:29.810
I'll do it before a workout,
but I'll just decide,
all right,
ready,
go.

1087
00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:33.380
And I just have to do it.
It starts off easy.
It starts off like,
shit,

1088
00:59:33.381 --> 00:59:35.300
I want to get off this ride.
I want to get off this ride.
You know,

1089
00:59:35.301 --> 00:59:36.800
I'm going three and four,

1090
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:41.980
but once you get to one 75 one 76 in your fucking legs are burning.

1091
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:45.140
If you get through that man,
the rest of the day's easy.

1092
00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:48.490
The rest of the day is nonsense.
It's all bullshit and it,

1093
00:59:48.491 --> 00:59:50.120
it puts things in perspective.

1094
00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:53.870
It puts things into perspective physically because a lot of the stress that we

1095
00:59:53.871 --> 00:59:57.560
have as far as like accomplishing things and as far as like needing to get

1096
00:59:57.561 --> 00:59:58.310
things done,

1097
00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:01.250
there's a lot of physical stress involved in that because it's sort of never

1098
01:00:01.251 --> 01:00:02.084
satisfied.

1099
01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:07.100
Our body connects stress and stressful activity to some sort of danger,

1100
01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.580
so our body connects it to physical activities.

1101
01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:12.350
The reason why you get pumped up with adrenaline is the reason why when you're

1102
01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:13.760
in an argument with someone,
you're shaking,

1103
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:16.340
you're shaking because you're ready to fight.
Okay?
You,

1104
01:00:16.341 --> 01:00:20.030
you know that's what it's about.
You're not shaking.
It's,
Oh,
I was so upset.
No,

1105
01:00:20.031 --> 01:00:22.760
you're ready to defend your life.
That's what you're doing.

1106
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:24.950
You know when people get an argue with someone,
my hands are shaking.

1107
01:00:24.951 --> 01:00:25.550
I'm so upset.

1108
01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:28.610
It's because you wanted to get violent or someone wanted to get violent with
you,

1109
01:00:28.611 --> 01:00:32.120
or you sent the possibility of violence and your body was preparing yourself for

1110
01:00:32.121 --> 01:00:34.080
it.
That's reality.
Yeah.
And in,

1111
01:00:34.081 --> 01:00:38.390
unless you blow that shit out on a regular basis,

1112
01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.110
I don't believe you think is clearly,
I don't,
I don't believe it.

1113
01:00:42.111 --> 01:00:45.950
I believe your body is designed to have a certain amount of physical stress and

1114
01:00:45.951 --> 01:00:50.300
if you don't instigate it,
I think you,
you can function but you'll be imbalanced.

1115
01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.193
I think it's just,

1116
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.310
you can be just as imbalanced by not exercising as you can by being addicted to

1117
01:00:55.311 --> 01:00:58.720
cigarettes or beer.
I mean it's not as dangerous,
I don't think,
you know,

1118
01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.271
health wise.

1119
01:00:59.271 --> 01:01:03.020
But I mean I think you could be just as imbalanced by it just as out of whack.

1120
01:01:04.170 --> 01:01:05.250
<v 4>Yeah.
I got,
I haven't been,</v>

1121
01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:09.500
<v 0>I used to exercise Brody check out.
It looks do.</v>

1122
01:01:09.501 --> 01:01:11.790
That's hard to do man.
We were talking about this the other day.

1123
01:01:11.791 --> 01:01:16.080
What are those 35 pounders?
It looks like it.
That's hard to do man.
That uh,

1124
01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:20.640
under her press.
Yeah.
Now I was on Lexapro there.
Yeah.
You will.

1125
01:01:20.641 --> 01:01:24.090
You look like a fucking stud.
Look at you.
You look like if there was a,
a,

1126
01:01:24.091 --> 01:01:27.210
a Russian gay bath porn.
Yeah,
you would be,

1127
01:01:27.211 --> 01:01:31.260
the guy would come in at the end and just fuck everyone and looks like Joe

1128
01:01:31.260 --> 01:01:36.030
Rogan's brother.
Can I get back to that?
Of course you can.

1129
01:01:36.031 --> 01:01:38.760
What are you talking about?
It's physically possible.

1130
01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.090
You just have to force yourself.
Just have to force myself.
Yes.
Brody,

1131
01:01:42.091 --> 01:01:45.630
positive people.
That's why you were brought here today for this podcast.
Brody,

1132
01:01:45.631 --> 01:01:46.464
we're going to get you back.

1133
01:01:46.530 --> 01:01:48.630
<v 4>Can I actually get back into that?
You know,</v>

1134
01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:53.360
I gotta get back into that and I feel like I'm off Lexapro.
Do you smell?

1135
01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:58.080
I'm not on it.
I'm just on the Depakote,
which is like a lithium.
Depakote won't,

1136
01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.250
we'll keep me from like spiraling upward,
so it's just,

1137
01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:07.140
I don't have anything for the bottom.
Spiraling upward.
We'll like downward dog.

1138
01:02:07.141 --> 01:02:11.310
Downward.
Upward upward.
That's what a manic moment is.
Yeah.
So I'm,

1139
01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:13.650
I have to be on these probably for another.

1140
01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:17.680
<v 0>You're a few months.
Do they diagnose you as manic?
Like what are they?</v>

1141
01:02:17.681 --> 01:02:20.010
Will they say like,
yeah,
I guess you

1142
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.830
<v 2>said like manic,
bipolar,
bipolar.
Yeah.
It'd be an awesome stripper.</v>

1143
01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:25.800
Bipolar would that perfect combination in a stripper manic.

1144
01:02:25.801 --> 01:02:29.040
Bipolar just likes to talk hard and get crazy.
They should just,

1145
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:33.720
just indycar,
you know,
like really strong.
Endeca like couch weed.

1146
01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:35.480
But I think I'm closer.

1147
01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:40.050
I'm so focused on my career and I know it's not totally healthy but I feel like

1148
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:44.760
once I get in and get comfortable with it then I can be myself.
Like Ah,

1149
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:45.331
I can like,

1150
01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:49.320
cause I feel like I'm not and I've put that stress on me like that close where I

1151
01:02:49.321 --> 01:02:53.850
can not relax.
Maybe you relax but still then really go at it.

1152
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:58.410
Manic,
bipolar Brody.
Yeah.
You know I,
but I learned from it,
you know,

1153
01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.650
I don't want to go back to the hospital.
Comics and strippers are very close.

1154
01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:06.360
Very Aros.
Very Fun.
They're the same.
Very close.
Very close in a lot of ways.

1155
01:03:06.361 --> 01:03:08.640
Thank you.
Thanks.
Strippers get the same sort of fulfillment.

1156
01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:12.660
That's why comics always show their balls and strippers always try to tell jokes

1157
01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.760
honey.
Exactly.
Nailed it.
Are Ya,
I got a retweet from Buck Cherry.

1158
01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:22.350
Oh wrap.
Cause I wrote,
I said that the buck cherry song crazy bitch is like,
uh,

1159
01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:27.060
the anthem of every failed relationship.
A very opinion.
Why,
why is that?

1160
01:03:27.061 --> 01:03:29.310
Brody explained to me that or explain to me why it's so,

1161
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:32.490
so fun to fuck the crazy ones.
The Nice ones,

1162
01:03:32.491 --> 01:03:35.700
the nice ones that you want to settle down with and have a good time with.

1163
01:03:36.150 --> 01:03:38.850
They're not as freaky.
No,
they're not.
Right and not,

1164
01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:43.080
you know what I need to,
yeah.
I want to have,

1165
01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.970
I mean I used to watch porn just like the rest of everybody and I stopped.

1166
01:03:47.820 --> 01:03:52.650
Um,
I think that I'm just like,
after all this stuff happened,

1167
01:03:52.651 --> 01:03:56.460
I think the Depakote is sexual side effects.
I think my situation,

1168
01:03:56.461 --> 01:03:58.870
I'm coats killing you dunk a little bit thick.

1169
01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:01.710
So can you get off that gets some bone or gee,
well here's the other thing.

1170
01:04:01.711 --> 01:04:04.170
You're supposed to get off at tune.
Is that what's going on?
Yeah,
I'll be off it.

1171
01:04:04.530 --> 01:04:06.750
He said,
the doctor said,
when they put me on all this stuff,

1172
01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.700
I was at high dosages,
1500 milligrams of Depakote,
800 milligrams of Seroquel,

1173
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:15.840
which is a sleeping pill.
Antidepressants,
like a chemical free diet.

1174
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:18.390
How's your diet?
My Diet could be better.
Okay,
that's silly.

1175
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.430
His diet is horrible right now.
That's silly.

1176
01:04:20.730 --> 01:04:24.170
Anybody that has any sort of problem with their mind that the first thing that

1177
01:04:24.171 --> 01:04:26.070
you should concentrate on is your diet.
You gotta,

1178
01:04:26.071 --> 01:04:27.780
you gotta give your body healthy fuel.

1179
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:32.100
There's no way your body can function if it's pulling minerals out of your

1180
01:04:32.101 --> 01:04:35.430
fucking muscles and trying to figure out where to go cause there's no vitamin C

1181
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:39.800
here.
What?
How do I make this?
How do I fix this?
Mother fucker was,
there's no B12.

1182
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.790
I've got nothing going to get back to that.
And so I said,

1183
01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:45.450
I gave myself six months into the budget to stop all this.
I'm going to bullshit.

1184
01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:48.210
Just do it,
man.
Just write it down and fucking do it.
You,

1185
01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:51.690
all you need to do is just look at your situation and look at the things you

1186
01:04:51.691 --> 01:04:55.860
need to fix.
Diet.
Fix that exercise every fucking day.
Just force yourself,
man.

1187
01:04:56.010 --> 01:04:58.710
Force yourself and write it down.
Write down what your sets are.

1188
01:04:58.711 --> 01:05:00.900
Write down what you sit and write down every day.
Brody,

1189
01:05:00.901 --> 01:05:02.920
this is what you're going to do today.
Me,
you have no excuse.

1190
01:05:02.921 --> 01:05:04.640
It's not like you've got 15 kids running around.

1191
01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:07.050
You got a business you have to run.
You're not doing shit.

1192
01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:10.530
So the most important thing for you right now would to be for you to get
healthy,

1193
01:05:10.531 --> 01:05:15.010
right?
Just to wait.
Oh,
you should concentrate on dawn.
Don't do.
You don't need it.

1194
01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:17.710
He doesn't.
He's not fat.
But it's,
the issue is,
but he's wrong.

1195
01:05:17.711 --> 01:05:21.490
This is the issue is nutrients.
If you,
you don't have good healthy food,

1196
01:05:21.491 --> 01:05:23.230
your brain's not going to produce the proper chemicals.

1197
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.800
You're going to feel depressed.
It's just a fact.
Yeah.
I have high insulin levels.

1198
01:05:26.801 --> 01:05:29.860
I am depressed.
Yeah,
you fucks with your blood sugar.
It's not good.

1199
01:05:29.861 --> 01:05:33.700
That's super bad.
And in fact,
that's what the guy that killed Harvey milk.

1200
01:05:33.790 --> 01:05:36.030
Do you know that guy is linky damn [inaudible] he,

1201
01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.900
they said that what his excuse is part of his,
uh,
you know what they actually,

1202
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.540
I don't know how they justified this,

1203
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.660
but they gave him a lighter sentence because he said that he was addicted to

1204
01:05:46.661 --> 01:05:48.490
eating Twinkies.
Yeah.

1205
01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.550
So he got like a ridiculously light sentence for murdering this guy.

1206
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:54.880
And the idea was that his blood sugar level was so fucked up from eating

1207
01:05:54.881 --> 01:05:58.410
Twinkies that he made an irrational decision and,

1208
01:05:58.411 --> 01:06:02.620
and killed this Harvey milk guy once.
Yeah.

1209
01:06:02.621 --> 01:06:03.940
That was a crazy stuff.

1210
01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:08.610
But that just at least that there's any scientific way whatsoever that could

1211
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:13.570
actually use that as a defense should show you how fucked for your body and that

1212
01:06:13.571 --> 01:06:16.340
shit all day is especially a guy like you.

1213
01:06:16.370 --> 01:06:19.990
I know I drink a lot of water more than I should when I was more than you
should.

1214
01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:24.600
Well,
do you worry about that?
[inaudible] I'm not wanting to draw.
No,

1215
01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:27.310
I'm like I said,

1216
01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:32.340
I know I'm moving back to the valley f one eight s and represented.

1217
01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:34.470
Just got to get back.
I'm in the process of moving.

1218
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.050
I'm shooting this HBO project pilot.
We'll see what happens with it.

1219
01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:40.580
I'm focusing on podcasting.
Um,

1220
01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:42.610
you don't have to do with what we're talking about.

1221
01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.870
Why adding all this other shit to the conversation.
What's missing in your life?

1222
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:51.030
It's missing your life is diet,
exercise,
fix that shit.
Let's see.
Start,
stop,

1223
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:55.390
play cs places would help as well and just get back on.
Nice girl.
Not Pussy.

1224
01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:58.120
A nice girl.
If you want pussy,
we'll get your flashlight.
But Joe,

1225
01:06:58.121 --> 01:07:02.080
how come I'm not?
How come I don't have that drive to exercise like I did before?

1226
01:07:02.081 --> 01:07:05.770
Because you're lazy.
Just fucking do it.
Have a double espresso and do it.

1227
01:07:05.771 --> 01:07:08.230
Write it down.
Write it down and make yourself do it.
Like I told you,

1228
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:10.420
I do these body weight squats.
I don't want to fucking do them,

1229
01:07:10.780 --> 01:07:13.900
but I do them because I don't want to do them.
Just make yourself,

1230
01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:16.390
you have to force yourself on a regular basis.

1231
01:07:16.570 --> 01:07:19.780
One of the things when I was writing my book,
which I stalled out on,

1232
01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:21.130
I've got to get right back on that shit,

1233
01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:24.280
but I've been busy writing stand up lately.
Um,
when I was writing my book,

1234
01:07:24.370 --> 01:07:28.720
I noticed how difficult it is sometimes to just start to actually just sit down

1235
01:07:28.721 --> 01:07:33.030
and start in.
The way to do it is just schedule it.
What happened?

1236
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:34.620
Lost Them.
Microphone ever.
Sorry.

1237
01:07:34.930 --> 01:07:37.510
The way to do it is just schedule it at at eight o'clock today,

1238
01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:39.760
I'm going to start,
period.
Nothing else is going to stop me.

1239
01:07:39.761 --> 01:07:42.370
I'm unplugging the phone.
Everybody else can go fuck themselves.

1240
01:07:42.550 --> 01:07:43.383
This is what I'm doing.

1241
01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.060
And that's what you gotta do it when you want to do this working out thing.

1242
01:07:46.330 --> 01:07:48.640
When it comes to your diet,
just fucking,
just write it down.

1243
01:07:48.641 --> 01:07:52.660
I'm not eating any shitty food.
It's done.
Should I join a club?
The marines,

1244
01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:58.060
you think they'll take,
you know,
I could like entertain them in a positive way.

1245
01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:02.530
Check out curves.
Learn from me.
Can you do 10 chin ups?
Not right now.

1246
01:08:02.531 --> 01:08:05.290
And you can't get through bootcamp.
Why would train for it?

1247
01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.580
Are you comfortable in the locker room when you go workout?
Yeah.

1248
01:08:08.650 --> 01:08:11.300
Like you just walk around naked and every hole.
The one at crunching.

1249
01:08:11.301 --> 01:08:16.130
What's Hollywood?
Yeah.
Crunch with Hollywood.
I used to stay in Brooklyn

1250
01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:21.020
<v 4>at golds.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The one on overall Santa Monica.
Oh yeah.
Hold on.</v>

1251
01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:25.800
<v 0>The one in Santa Monica is,
was so gay that there was a guy who uh,</v>

1252
01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:28.080
was one of the managers at 24 fitness.
Yeah.

1253
01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.510
Just give a shout out to my friend Jack Manager.
24 hour fitness.
I want to go,

1254
01:08:31.570 --> 01:08:33.160
there may not be his name.
Um,

1255
01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:37.270
he was a really funny guy and he had gotten sent over to west Hollywood because

1256
01:08:37.271 --> 01:08:38.104
they had to,

1257
01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:43.320
a new straight manager had to take over because apparently there was just

1258
01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:46.240
rampant homosexual sex going on.

1259
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:48.840
Does that happen at these clubs?

1260
01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:52.780
Apparently it was just like a super gay disco.

1261
01:08:52.930 --> 01:08:57.880
Like what the 24 hour fitness had become was like just gay dudes.
Just loved it.

1262
01:08:57.881 --> 01:09:01.480
It was perfect.
And you know,
they were allegedly,
allegedly,
again,

1263
01:09:01.481 --> 01:09:04.120
this is all second and third hand information.
You know,

1264
01:09:04.121 --> 01:09:06.100
people are telling him that and then he's telling me,

1265
01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:09.250
but did he would have to fucking hose down the benches.

1266
01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:14.140
Oh she is everywhere and frequently walking on dudes blowing each other.

1267
01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:18.130
Ah,
but for them how awesome.

1268
01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:22.120
Why don't I just let people know when they enter,
just let people know go.

1269
01:09:22.121 --> 01:09:23.410
You know when they want to join,

1270
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:27.640
just specify that they have plenty of people there that can meet that change the

1271
01:09:27.641 --> 01:09:31.930
name of it.
Like 24 hour fitness gay.
Yeah.
Can I get a guest pass?

1272
01:09:31.931 --> 01:09:36.580
Simple too.
I just change it to 24 hour fitness.
Gay.
It's all gay.

1273
01:09:36.670 --> 01:09:40.750
You can work out if you're straight,
but guess what?
Some shit's going down.
Yeah.

1274
01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:43.360
All around you and you've got to deal with,
they have gay cruises.

1275
01:09:43.361 --> 01:09:45.940
So to them they're all excited about it.
That'd be awesome.

1276
01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:50.140
And someone had to come in and fuck that up and hose down the bench and kick all

1277
01:09:50.141 --> 01:09:51.670
the blown guys out of this.

1278
01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.430
<v 4>I wouldn't want to walk.
I don't think I've seen that.</v>

1279
01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.690
I would go to 24 hour in Sherman oaks.
I don't think I ever saw it,
thank God.

1280
01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.020
<v 0>But the goals on coal,</v>

1281
01:10:00.021 --> 01:10:02.490
it was almost completely guy used to have a whole bit about it.

1282
01:10:02.491 --> 01:10:05.910
In my act it was really ridiculous to get hit on like at a gym,

1283
01:10:05.940 --> 01:10:09.090
you know like guys would like guys would like offer you support,
you know,

1284
01:10:09.091 --> 01:10:12.690
like they would offer to like the spot you when you didn't need a spot.

1285
01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:18.440
No need whatsoever for a spa blatantly just wanted a dang his balls over my

1286
01:10:18.781 --> 01:10:22.860
head,
like blatantly blatantly would come over and you know,

1287
01:10:22.861 --> 01:10:25.560
and and and say,
do you know how to work this?
Do you know what you're doing?

1288
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:29.190
Like weird sort of flirty way of communicating with you while you're,

1289
01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.680
while you're working out there and you're like,
Whoa,

1290
01:10:31.681 --> 01:10:33.600
this is what it's like to be a chick.

1291
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:37.380
<v 4>Yeah.
I'm not into that.
That's what happens at that.
It's still that happens.</v>

1292
01:10:37.410 --> 01:10:37.760
Oh fuck

1293
01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:42.710
<v 0>yeah.
Oh Hey guys.
If you were gay you would love it though.
I guess you would.</v>

1294
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:43.010
Yeah,

1295
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:47.030
I guess you would imagine if you went to a gym and it was all hot chicks that

1296
01:10:47.031 --> 01:10:48.800
wanted to come over and talk to you while you're working out.

1297
01:10:49.050 --> 01:10:52.320
<v 4>Well,
I've got to get my workout in.
Oh.
But I would talk to him.
Yeah,</v>

1298
01:10:52.321 --> 01:10:52.990
I would talk to him.

1299
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:55.840
<v 0>You'd be flattered.
You'd be excited.
What if you wanted to get your workout in,</v>

1300
01:10:55.841 --> 01:10:57.190
but you also want to know,
you know,

1301
01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:59.210
get your freak on and you went there and it's all,

1302
01:10:59.270 --> 01:11:00.850
it's like a movie every way you look.

1303
01:11:00.851 --> 01:11:03.520
This girl's a great bodies and they're all flirting with you.
Well,

1304
01:11:03.521 --> 01:11:06.340
that's what it's like when you go to a gay gym.
If you're a gay dude,
if you're,

1305
01:11:06.341 --> 01:11:09.550
you know,
if you're an in shape gay party,
it's a party protein.
That's good.

1306
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:12.940
And they're actually exercising too,
hopefully.
Yeah.
And of course they,

1307
01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.620
<v 2>they're having a great time and it's a good thing,
man.
For them,</v>

1308
01:11:16.621 --> 01:11:20.790
it's a great thing.
You know,
I don't,
there's nothing wrong with gay Jim's man.

1309
01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:23.910
I fully,
I don't get it,
obviously because I'm not gay.
But if I was,

1310
01:11:23.911 --> 01:11:28.320
I would be fucking psyched if it was a gay gym.
Come on,
man,

1311
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:32.100
that would be awesome.
If you're just some crazy freak,
you know,

1312
01:11:32.101 --> 01:11:36.060
and you show up at the gym and everybody's blowing everybody and woo farting.

1313
01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.840
Yeah,
it'd be fucking great.

1314
01:11:38.170 --> 01:11:42.890
Imagine that you going to engage him in disguise like with a fake mustache,
like,

1315
01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:47.990
no,
I'm not sure.
Broken.
Like I got makeup on my tattoo show.

1316
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:51.770
Did they get blown before or after their workout?
So some guys say,
oh,
after,

1317
01:11:51.850 --> 01:11:55.830
after and get your work done in first.
Yeah.
It'll be so greedy and fucking,

1318
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.760
you know,
don't be so hasty.
Get your work on him.
Get the,
let the flirt build up.

1319
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.920
Joe,
are there.
He kinda uncomfortable.
No,
I didn't feel uncomfortable.

1320
01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:08.670
I'm just like,
I'm still thinking about,
I gotta get back in shape.

1321
01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:11.280
I'm going to do it.
Keep bringing it back to yourself.
Getting in shape.

1322
01:12:11.281 --> 01:12:15.090
Just do it.
Write it down.
Write it down.
Write it down.
Ready to tight every day.

1323
01:12:15.091 --> 01:12:17.310
Going to work out.
You have title bullets,
right?
You didn't throw them away.

1324
01:12:17.311 --> 01:12:20.700
Did you know I got him.
I have know what to do.
You know what to do.
Just work out.

1325
01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:23.670
Have you done,
what do you mean?
Getting back to a,
why am I not doing?

1326
01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:27.480
Why did all I,
is it,
I just want to know why you need someone to hold your hand.

1327
01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:30.720
Are you a man or your mouse?
Why are you sad?
I am a man.

1328
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.310
Are you in control of your own destiny?
No.

1329
01:12:32.311 --> 01:12:35.380
I'm thinking it should because I'm off.
The Lexapro is at which causes,

1330
01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:39.750
I would imagine taking that stuff is probably not the best thing for years so

1331
01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:43.590
I'm off dry him off it.
Why think when you're on those things.
One isn't.

1332
01:12:43.591 --> 01:12:46.680
One of the hallmarks of these is that they make you sort of relaxed and

1333
01:12:46.681 --> 01:12:50.280
comfortable with the way life is now.
Like for a lot of people,

1334
01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:54.000
I think I had a friend who was on Zoloft and he was saying that what it did was

1335
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:56.970
he didn't give a fuck anymore.
Like it relaxed him about it,

1336
01:12:57.090 --> 01:13:00.870
like things that used to bother him.
Now all of a sudden didn't mean shit to him.

1337
01:13:00.871 --> 01:13:03.370
Right.
But I was able to like focus and work.
Yeah,

1338
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:06.960
like not those things weren't bothered,
which I was able to,
I was like,

1339
01:13:06.961 --> 01:13:10.110
don't you think that that would also take some motivation away?
Yeah.

1340
01:13:10.111 --> 01:13:13.290
Maybe it did.
So now will you look at your belly,
you know,
and you're like,

1341
01:13:13.291 --> 01:13:16.890
I don't give a flock.
I look at it now.
It's driving me nuts.
That's why it's,

1342
01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.660
that's why I want to get back to working out.

1343
01:13:18.661 --> 01:13:23.220
So why don't you am I fuck and my fucking Dick is shrinking up.
Whoa,
Whoa,
Brody.

1344
01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:25.890
That do I need to take nitric oxide?
You know what that is?

1345
01:13:25.891 --> 01:13:28.020
Your Dick is shrinking.
Yeah.
It's like getting smile.
I was like,

1346
01:13:28.021 --> 01:13:30.930
I got a prostate thing going on.
Why?
What's happening?

1347
01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:34.890
Your prostate's getting ingredients,
pulling your Dick back in its body.

1348
01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:37.440
Is that what I,
yeah.
I don't know.
Oh,

1349
01:13:37.441 --> 01:13:41.380
I thought that sounded like a real medical term.
Yes.
I believe,
you know,

1350
01:13:41.381 --> 01:13:45.330
my doctor,
you've known as much as a lot of doctors.
I'm not sure.

1351
01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.800
I think if you're a doctor and you know as much as me,
you'd be fucking fired.

1352
01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:55.160
I think you would make sense
as we focus that on.

1353
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:59.580
Stop looking at my stuff.
Um,
yeah dude,

1354
01:13:59.610 --> 01:14:03.150
I'm sure this stuff would have,
but you got off the Lexapro and that's fine,

1355
01:14:03.151 --> 01:14:05.880
but you're on this other stuff.
What is this other stuff's supposed to do?

1356
01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:10.020
Just keep me from,
from getting manic.
Yeah.
If that happens.

1357
01:14:10.021 --> 01:14:12.280
And then if you get to certain point,
you're,

1358
01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:15.010
you're gonna slowly wean yourself off of this stuff.
Yeah.

1359
01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:18.220
When is that scheduled to do?
Um,
probably by the end of the summer.

1360
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:21.370
Why don't you just force yourself to just get,
and it'll be off every shade,

1361
01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:25.330
be off everything.
Get in tremendous shape right now while that's going on.
Right.

1362
01:14:25.331 --> 01:14:29.890
Force yourself,
not do it slowly,
you know,
make sure,
you know,
do like 10 cleans,

1363
01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:34.360
10 clean presses,
you know,
like do like a,
a short,
maybe 15,

1364
01:14:34.361 --> 01:14:37.240
20 minute Kelly,
I need to join a gym.
Have you thought about drinking?

1365
01:14:37.241 --> 01:14:40.840
Don't need to do shit,
but maybe just get out and be around people and exercise.

1366
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:45.520
Maybe Gold's on coal.
That's what you need to do.
Boil up.
Shaved down.
What's up?

1367
01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:48.460
I'm going to,
I didn't get your move.
I need to do it Joe.
Yeah.

1368
01:14:48.461 --> 01:14:51.700
Get around a bunch of gangs cause I'm feeling stress in my chest and I want to

1369
01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:55.090
learn to deal with it.
Yeah.
Dressing your chest.
Yes.
Is that your heart?

1370
01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:59.560
Were you ever a big drinker at anytime in your life?
No,
never.
I mean,

1371
01:14:59.590 --> 01:15:01.960
college I drank a couple of times.
Yes.
I mean I've,

1372
01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.750
I met a couple of times but you know,
I'm not a big drinker.
No.

1373
01:15:04.751 --> 01:15:07.330
Because I don't like to drink and drive and I,
you know,

1374
01:15:07.331 --> 01:15:11.170
I vomited a couple times in college.
I got hung over a couple of times.

1375
01:15:11.171 --> 01:15:15.250
I'm not into that.
I like pot.
I'm not anti marijuana.
I love pop.

1376
01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.490
I love alcohol too.
I just don't love what it does to your body.
But I love it.

1377
01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.530
I love getting,
I love a few shots.
Having some whiskey,
getting on stage.
Stop.
No,

1378
01:15:23.531 --> 01:15:27.220
but Joe,
you're giving me positive energy I need,
they're a positive guy,
bro.

1379
01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:29.860
I need to like get,
that's why I'm moving out of this apartment.

1380
01:15:29.861 --> 01:15:33.580
It's dark and I need to be around people.
I'm working on this HBO project.

1381
01:15:33.581 --> 01:15:34.900
That's stressful,
but I got to do,

1382
01:15:34.901 --> 01:15:37.480
it's stressful in a sense that there's like pressure on me to do this thing and

1383
01:15:37.481 --> 01:15:41.260
people were like listening to me and I'm,
I gotta do this set on Conan.

1384
01:15:41.261 --> 01:15:44.920
And have you been in the same apartment for a long time?
Six months.
Oh,

1385
01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:48.070
I'm moving out.
And it's a dark place.
It's a little dark.

1386
01:15:48.071 --> 01:15:51.160
The neighbors are kind of creeping.
I just went there.
Right.
I'd move out.

1387
01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:53.470
I like the valley.
I liked the vibe of the valley.

1388
01:15:53.470 --> 01:15:57.220
That's where all the porn stars live.
Yeah.
The valley.
So you know,

1389
01:15:57.280 --> 01:15:59.690
they talk to them,
they'll hook you up,
you're going to,

1390
01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.000
you could have like a sitcom,

1391
01:16:01.210 --> 01:16:05.740
you and a bunch of porn stars all in townhouses right next to each other.
Dude,

1392
01:16:05.741 --> 01:16:09.430
start going to school at our Karaoke with me.
I go every two cycles,
no notes.

1393
01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:13.270
Start us.
Yeah,
I want,
and then I want to be off this.
I just want to do yoga.

1394
01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.910
I want to do therapy.
I want to do and I want to do comedy.

1395
01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.130
Let me tell you something.
This is the last thing.

1396
01:16:17.150 --> 01:16:20.830
The world listening to this wants to hear the guy saying a bunch of shit that

1397
01:16:20.831 --> 01:16:22.150
he's gonna do.
I'm gonna do,

1398
01:16:22.151 --> 01:16:24.910
I'm going to do with no evidence whatsoever that he's actually going to do it.

1399
01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:27.460
Just fucking do it.
Just do one.
Just do it.
Don't talk about it.

1400
01:16:27.461 --> 01:16:29.650
But if you want my advice,
that's what you have to do.
Write it down,

1401
01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.620
write it down and make sure you fill that fucking list out before you go to bed.

1402
01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:34.210
There's a list and on that list,

1403
01:16:34.420 --> 01:16:38.020
one of the things is a bunch of fucking exercises and you don't go to sleep

1404
01:16:38.021 --> 01:16:40.420
until those get done,
period.
It's that simple.

1405
01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:44.110
You either do it or you don't do it.
Either fall your list or you don't.

1406
01:16:44.111 --> 01:16:47.440
If you fall,
you lists,
then every day you get your shit done.
If you don't,

1407
01:16:47.441 --> 01:16:48.760
you come up with a bunch of excuses.

1408
01:16:48.761 --> 01:16:51.220
Oh my feet hurt that day and I had a really big meeting the next day.

1409
01:16:51.221 --> 01:16:54.910
I wanted to make sure it was a tip top mental form.
Shut up,
bitch.
Just do it.

1410
01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:58.030
It's all,
it's written down.
Do your 30 minute kettlebell routine.

1411
01:16:58.031 --> 01:17:00.070
Do whatever the fuck you have to do,
but that's a part of your day.

1412
01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:02.920
That must be done.
Just like brushing your teeth.
Just like eating meals.

1413
01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:07.000
You don't forget to shit.
Okay,
you do it because you're supposed to do it.
Period.

1414
01:17:07.001 --> 01:17:10.240
Brody Stevens,
this is what I need.
I don't a brother.
My Dad's

1415
01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:14.030
<v 1>got,
this is what other either bitch dessert.
You don't need to have a brother.</v>

1416
01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:17.690
She's just start letting Brody hang out with you more often and work out with
it.

1417
01:17:17.691 --> 01:17:18.290
You should get him to

1418
01:17:18.290 --> 01:17:20.380
<v 0>Jesus Christ.
I'm not a fucking Tony Robbins.</v>

1419
01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.030
I can't help the guys constantly 24 seven I can help you a certain amount of

1420
01:17:25.031 --> 01:17:28.090
Brody,
but I think you've got to help yourself.
It's important that you get mad.

1421
01:17:28.091 --> 01:17:30.640
You got to get fed up and you've got to think that you don't have that much time

1422
01:17:30.641 --> 01:17:34.540
left,
but this is reality.
You don't,
yeah,
I mean how much,
what is 40 years?

1423
01:17:34.570 --> 01:17:37.720
That's what we both have.
We pulled it up about 40 years.
We'll let halfway there.

1424
01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:41.470
What is that?
That's a fucking blink of an eye.
Dammit.

1425
01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.950
A summer comes so fucking quickly and then the winter so quickly and it's

1426
01:17:44.951 --> 01:17:47.440
happening.
It feels like it's happening quicker and quicker every year.

1427
01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:50.290
There's no time to waste on [inaudible].
Yeah.

1428
01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:54.160
Fuck that shit for just write down everything you're supposed to do and do it.

1429
01:17:54.161 --> 01:17:55.030
It's that simple.

1430
01:17:55.120 --> 01:18:00.070
You must get an ethic in your head that you must continue to fulfill your list.

1431
01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:03.930
This is the list of things you're doing.
Period.
This is what I need.

1432
01:18:04.120 --> 01:18:06.670
Unless you're sick or you're injured,
I'm not chicken.

1433
01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:10.480
Don't get psychosomatic and create fake injuries or illnesses.
Good.

1434
01:18:11.010 --> 01:18:11.843
What does that mean?

1435
01:18:13.260 --> 01:18:17.460
<v 1>How much,
what percentage of your motivation in life is related to sex?</v>

1436
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:21.000
Uh,
right now,
I mean,
I would say a lot,

1437
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:25.790
but it seems like it's been,
you know,
I want,
yeah,
one,

1438
01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:27.750
of course I see.
I want to be with a good looking woman,

1439
01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.930
but I don't think about like,
I want to have sex with their banker.
I mean,
I do.

1440
01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:34.380
I see a girl with a nice ass.
I look at her ass,
I'd go,

1441
01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:39.210
I'd like to like put my face around it and had to,
can I say that?
Yes,

1442
01:18:39.330 --> 01:18:42.270
you can.
Of course.
I like a chick with a great ass,
you know,

1443
01:18:42.271 --> 01:18:46.770
on a good face and good skin and eyes.
Feet.
Yeah,
of course.

1444
01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:50.700
Do Lips.
Do you eat the ass?
Yeah,
I've done that.
Yeah.
He liked that.
I mean,

1445
01:18:50.701 --> 01:18:55.470
do you prefer,
prefer,
I don't know if I prefer it,
but it's fine.
Black girls.

1446
01:18:55.471 --> 01:19:00.360
Have you had sex with?
MM,
none.
Whoa.
I mean,

1447
01:19:00.361 --> 01:19:02.880
I think one may be one maybe,
but

1448
01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:09.570
tan are really dirty.
One.
Maybe.
Why?
Maybe I've been with chicks,

1449
01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.430
but what do you mean?

1450
01:19:11.431 --> 01:19:16.080
One may be when is you either didn't do you blacked out memory?
No,

1451
01:19:16.081 --> 01:19:18.630
there was like a,
I think she was a lady of the night and some guys,

1452
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:21.930
this team we were goofing around.
I mean,
I did some dangerous stuff.

1453
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:25.510
Did some dangerous stuff.
Yeah.
I played college baseball.
She was,
uh,
she was,
uh,

1454
01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:29.700
uh,
an African American Lady of the night,
meaning a professional sex worker.

1455
01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:33.900
I believe so.
Somebody had and we all,
we had a good time.
Oh my sous,
whoa.

1456
01:19:33.930 --> 01:19:38.340
I'm going to assume a mouth misuse.
Massage his penis with her mouth.
I like,

1457
01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:39.600
honestly,
I like,
you know,

1458
01:19:39.601 --> 01:19:44.601
like the white fair skinned light white Irish girls.

1459
01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.530
He'd like that tall.
Pretty like Nicole Kidman looking pretty Irish girls.

1460
01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:54.060
That's not bad,
but like a,
I don't want to say German type,
but like Swedish,

1461
01:19:54.230 --> 01:19:57.660
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You liked that,
huh?
Yeah,
but I don't think I have a chance.

1462
01:19:57.661 --> 01:20:00.930
I feel like we have no true,
so that's crazy.
You're thinking crazy.
All right.

1463
01:20:00.931 --> 01:20:05.190
Well then Brody Stevens,
you're hilarious.
You're a very funny guy,
man.
Yeah,

1464
01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.740
well you know me.
That's thing I think when they get know me will they,

1465
01:20:07.741 --> 01:20:08.960
I just keep doing it.
That's Brody.

1466
01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:09.550
<v 0>We need to,</v>

1467
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:12.190
we need a form of management company and take care of people like you.

1468
01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:13.660
That's what we need to do.
We need,
yeah,

1469
01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:17.440
that's quad management and sin and start booking guys like Brody on the road.

1470
01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:21.100
Send them out.
Maybe that's who will steal Shandra away from Jeff.

1471
01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:22.960
<v 1>I would only help my confident.</v>

1472
01:20:22.961 --> 01:20:25.440
Maybe she'll just open up a side business with us.
I mean when,

1473
01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:30.290
I'll tell you what,
like the reason why I think it would work out a manager,
you,

1474
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:33.820
you lazy bitch,
which is offering you a whole career in stand up comedy.

1475
01:20:33.821 --> 01:20:37.840
Like I don't want to do the route on once.
Snuggle on this game.

1476
01:20:37.930 --> 01:20:39.960
Big Noble.
Yes,

1477
01:20:40.250 --> 01:20:45.250
you can go into different cities.
You want to enjoy it if you do it every day.

1478
01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.040
I don't enjoy it as much.
I enjoy it when I,
when I work,

1479
01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:50.200
when I get things done and I enjoy all the fun stuff.

1480
01:20:50.230 --> 01:20:55.030
I like buffet of Pussy do nonstop.
But are there,

1481
01:20:55.031 --> 01:20:58.300
are there a healthy supplements and food?
The food will help with that kind of,

1482
01:20:58.450 --> 01:20:58.690
yeah.

1483
01:20:58.690 --> 01:21:03.370
<v 0>Fuck all that nonsense.
The food will certainly help,
but there's a lot of uh,</v>

1484
01:21:03.730 --> 01:21:07.330
sort of,
uh,
just mental masturbation that goes with,
you know,

1485
01:21:07.331 --> 01:21:10.840
sort of diddling around the idea of getting on a diet or diddling around with

1486
01:21:10.841 --> 01:21:15.550
the idea of getting in shape or changing your life or writing a book or anything

1487
01:21:15.551 --> 01:21:17.560
that we,
you know,
you put off and procrastinate.
This is,

1488
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:21.430
there's a bunch of different things that you can start doing to distract

1489
01:21:21.431 --> 01:21:24.370
yourself with the bottom line.
For a guy like you,

1490
01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:26.650
there's like essential things that you need in your life.

1491
01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:29.920
You need to eat healthier food and you need to get in shape because everything

1492
01:21:29.921 --> 01:21:32.800
else will come from that.
If you're in good shape and you're feeling good,

1493
01:21:32.801 --> 01:21:35.380
you'll feel better about the choices you make,
you'll you,

1494
01:21:35.381 --> 01:21:38.890
your body will function better,
your mind will function better.
You won't be,

1495
01:21:38.891 --> 01:21:41.020
you'll feel better.
You'll feel healthier if you're your brothers.

1496
01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:45.070
I know I need to do it.
Yeah,
and I guarantee you that stuff you're on.
I mean,

1497
01:21:45.071 --> 01:21:49.030
if you can substitute that with Yoga and exercise and then if it's possible for

1498
01:21:49.031 --> 01:21:50.920
you to still be happy and still be content.

1499
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.410
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

1500
01:21:52.410 --> 01:21:55.620
<v 1>Yeah.
The Oh,
noisy.
I think it's your chair.
Really.</v>

1501
01:21:58.290 --> 01:22:01.140
<v 0>No,
it's not squeezed.
If he's playing the flute outside,
it's real weird.</v>

1502
01:22:01.230 --> 01:22:03.610
I think there's some sort of a few winters you,
well,

1503
01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:06.390
it's weird because when we get folks that go on iTunes,
probably can't hear it,

1504
01:22:06.391 --> 01:22:09.690
but if,
if I get really loud or any of us do,
it cuts off.

1505
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:13.930
<v 1>Oh,
that,
yeah.
That's,
that's because it's,
it's built to do that.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

1506
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:15.100
<v 0>But it's,
it's,
that's weird.</v>

1507
01:22:15.101 --> 01:22:18.220
And then sometimes you hear like a little weird something in the background.

1508
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:21.100
I don't know what it is,
but we've got to walk you set up ladies and gentlemen.

1509
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:23.170
Okay.
Look at this tape everywhere.

1510
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:24.570
<v 1>You know,
like it,
you know,</v>

1511
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:29.410
I was listening to some fellow podcasters and I recently just kind of,
you know,

1512
01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:31.930
I just decided to try it out.
And uh,

1513
01:22:31.960 --> 01:22:35.740
it's weird I think because I always think our quality quality's kind of Shitty,

1514
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:37.780
you know,
here and there,
like it's duct tape together.

1515
01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:40.390
But then I started listening to some of the other guys,
I was like,
Oh shit,
no,

1516
01:22:40.391 --> 01:22:42.940
wait,
wait,
wait,
wait past that.
Well,

1517
01:22:42.941 --> 01:22:46.510
there's a lot of guys that just use like one of those big blue ball microphone.

1518
01:22:46.511 --> 01:22:48.880
Yeah.
And it's like half those sound right?

1519
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:51.350
We did that in the beginning when the beginning,
man we,
we uh,

1520
01:22:51.370 --> 01:22:55.510
we like cut some USB microphone shit.
It was terrible.
This,

1521
01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:58.690
this is a great setup.
We very,
it's very,
there's warmth than that.

1522
01:22:58.691 --> 01:23:01.810
You've made this place warm,
you know what I mean?

1523
01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:03.970
It's like it's broken in and it's kind of cool.

1524
01:23:03.971 --> 01:23:05.980
We liked that fact that we're at the ice house to,

1525
01:23:05.980 --> 01:23:08.560
<v 0>you know,
the ice house is just,
there's so much good vibes here.</v>

1526
01:23:08.561 --> 01:23:11.710
50 years of comedy,
so many great shows that we've had here.

1527
01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:14.380
The people that work here are so nice.
It's like,

1528
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:16.420
it's like a super warm environment.

1529
01:23:16.421 --> 01:23:18.880
When we come here it's like this is like home and I was like family,
you know,

1530
01:23:18.881 --> 01:23:23.530
everybody's hugs you here and shit.
It's a great place.
Pasadena,
a lot of history.

1531
01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:27.760
Great town,
great town.
I see some of these estates drive around and was like,

1532
01:23:27.761 --> 01:23:32.080
where are these big movie producers from like the 1950s used to live.
Dude,

1533
01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:36.340
this is like where apparently Pasedena explained by my friend Rupert who lives

1534
01:23:36.341 --> 01:23:38.860
out here said that would essentially it was created,

1535
01:23:38.861 --> 01:23:42.400
was a bunch of really rich guys wanted to give to get away from all the fucking

1536
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:45.400
Hollywood nuts.
So all the Hollywood nuts,
like all the actors,

1537
01:23:45.401 --> 01:23:48.670
they would move to the Hollywood hills and get these crazy mansion in the

1538
01:23:48.671 --> 01:23:52.270
Hollywood hills.
And everybody else was like,
fuck this,
I'm going to pass it Dina.

1539
01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:55.480
Yeah,
they moved to Pasadena and they're essentially like an hour away from,

1540
01:23:55.481 --> 01:23:59.830
you know,
uh,
Lake Arrowhead and big bear.
And though these states up there,
man,

1541
01:23:59.831 --> 01:24:04.120
I mean,
just fucking crazy lawns like the Beverly hillbillies.

1542
01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:05.770
Remember the Beverly hillbillies,
you know,

1543
01:24:05.771 --> 01:24:09.370
when you saw it like the big fucking driveway and big circular thing in the

1544
01:24:09.371 --> 01:24:12.250
middle,
like Holy Shit.
Like that's Pasadena.
Like everywhere you,

1545
01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:15.360
there's a bunch of areas where everywhere you look,

1546
01:24:15.361 --> 01:24:19.060
it's like these incredible old houses from like the 1920s and shit.

1547
01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:21.640
There's something,
something bad ass about that.

1548
01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:24.490
But you can own a house that existed in the 20s.

1549
01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:29.500
<v 1>Yeah.
These old,
uh,
just the history and it hasn't,
Dana's got ton of that stuff.</v>

1550
01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.570
I know you,
you come out here.
I love the Rose Bowl.
You drive up in these,
uh,

1551
01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:37.240
it's just,
uh,
it's green out here.
You see the mountains in the background

1552
01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:41.820
<v 0>and it's just far enough from Hollywood to not be completely infected with its</v>

1553
01:24:41.821 --> 01:24:46.050
bullshit.
Exactly.
Yeah.
They're like more regular people out here.
You know,

1554
01:24:46.051 --> 01:24:47.850
you get more,
you get a lot of like,
you know,

1555
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:50.970
just fans period that have come from anywhere.
But you get like the,

1556
01:24:50.971 --> 01:24:53.190
the folks that regular folks like the in town folks.

1557
01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:57.480
I just think there's like a per capita,
a slightly less,

1558
01:24:57.510 --> 01:25:00.450
a smaller hipster community.
Oh yeah.
There's like no hair.

1559
01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:04.620
There's like single digit hipsters out here.
Smaller actor community.
Yeah.

1560
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:08.100
<v 1>But if you want to raise a family,
be great.
Great.
You know,</v>

1561
01:25:08.101 --> 01:25:10.830
San Gabriel valley out here in these,
uh,

1562
01:25:11.730 --> 01:25:16.090
I wouldn't mind living in a big house.
You want a big house,
Brody?
Mm.
Gotcha.

1563
01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:18.030
No big getting shit.
But big house.
More.

1564
01:25:18.031 --> 01:25:20.460
You gotta pay for people to maintain the house.

1565
01:25:21.510 --> 01:25:23.780
<v 0>What is this economics one-on-one?
Brody,
what are we doing?</v>

1566
01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.400
We breaking down that bigger houses and more expensive to these people.

1567
01:25:26.401 --> 01:25:29.750
You guys talk numbers over there,
aren't you?
He just fucking Christ proud of him.

1568
01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:30.870
I don't know what I'm gonna do with you.

1569
01:25:31.050 --> 01:25:33.120
Death Squad management is going to have to get you on mushrooms,

1570
01:25:33.121 --> 01:25:34.410
but we're not sure how you would respond.

1571
01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:38.200
<v 1>I would respond.
I'm a good guy.
You'd give me stuff to play off.
I can do it.</v>

1572
01:25:38.201 --> 01:25:42.550
I enjoy.
I know you don't trims.
No,
I mean I wasn't maybe.
Oh really?

1573
01:25:42.650 --> 01:25:44.000
<v 0>Yeah.
So we need to get you on mushrooms,</v>

1574
01:25:44.270 --> 01:25:46.790
but I'm not sure how they would respond with the stuff that you're taking.

1575
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:50.170
<v 1>Yeah,
I'm going to be,
I'm gonna.
If I'm gonna Listen,
I'm gonna be,</v>

1576
01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:53.140
and I know you am I supposed to be [inaudible] Ghana,
but

1577
01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:58.780
I'm still detoxing and,
but I'm,
I'm adopting the positive things.

1578
01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:03.530
Everybody's detoxing every positive energy,
drinking water,
getting back to it.

1579
01:26:03.531 --> 01:26:04.040
Not beating

1580
01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.880
<v 2>myself up.
Maybe I'm just self genetically a Po.
I mean,
it's in my system.</v>

1581
01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:10.220
We've got to stop talking about this cause this is the homework.

1582
01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:13.730
Ready to blow their fucking brains out,
listening to one guy over and over again,

1583
01:26:13.731 --> 01:26:16.370
wanting to get his life in order on the air.
Okay.
All right.

1584
01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:19.760
Live and rehashing the same subjects.
Sorry about that.
It's cool.

1585
01:26:19.761 --> 01:26:23.920
But let me change the subject.
Yes.
Got Jokes,
jokes.
So lemon in my tea.

1586
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:25.300
This says me,

1587
01:26:25.410 --> 01:26:30.060
<v 7>this song I heard like two weeks ago,
like I'm addicted to this song.
Okay.</v>

1588
01:26:30.070 --> 01:26:33.510
We'll and talk to you.
I know what it is.
Yeah.
And I,
I did it for you.

1589
01:26:33.511 --> 01:26:38.130
I played it for you.
And uh,
it's,
to me it sucks because I,
everyone told,

1590
01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.440
like when I tell people I like the song,
they're like,
oh yeah,

1591
01:26:40.441 --> 01:26:42.130
welcome to three months ago.
And I get,
they get,

1592
01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.480
you feel kind of bad that you're the last person to hear the song,

1593
01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:50.600
but then you go on youtube and it says 122 million hits on Youtube and you're

1594
01:26:51.541 --> 01:26:54.370
like,
holy shit,
it shouldn't be that far off.
The only thing

1595
01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.930
<v 2>I feel bad of is when,
when you look at,</v>

1596
01:26:57.060 --> 01:26:59.900
when someone tells you about something or you tell someone about something and

1597
01:26:59.901 --> 01:27:02.030
they go welcome to three months ago and you feel bad.

1598
01:27:02.150 --> 01:27:05.030
The only thing you should feel bad is that that idiot is your friend.
Right.

1599
01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:06.500
That's what you should feel bad about.

1600
01:27:06.501 --> 01:27:10.430
Some Moron who's like giving me a hard time for not knowing about some stupid

1601
01:27:10.431 --> 01:27:12.860
song.
Yeah.
What,
why would you feel bad about it?

1602
01:27:13.210 --> 01:27:17.320
<v 7>Because I know,
I mean like my credit.
Like how did that get my internet credit?</v>

1603
01:27:17.321 --> 01:27:20.440
How did that get passed?
I do want to take,
I think about is that I,

1604
01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:24.120
it's the video.
It shows this guy like standing naked and people are Eric,

1605
01:27:24.130 --> 01:27:25.360
he's getting painted on and stuff.

1606
01:27:25.390 --> 01:27:27.310
And I think what happened is I started watching,
I was like,

1607
01:27:27.311 --> 01:27:29.990
I'm not watching this,
you know,
just from,
from the,

1608
01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:34.270
<v 2>well,
no,
because I'm in a,
I don't have the same Internet credit that you do,</v>

1609
01:27:34.450 --> 01:27:35.620
but I don't know.

1610
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.220
<v 7>You didn't see it either.
Song.
There's no,</v>

1611
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:40.230
and so it's weird that that has that many hits.

1612
01:27:40.231 --> 01:27:44.640
So it's called s some someone that you use someone I used to show what's up mean

1613
01:27:44.641 --> 01:27:48.180
in an accrued and it's got videos and bay.
Anyways,

1614
01:27:48.181 --> 01:27:53.181
the cover has 76 million hits and the cover in my opinion is better because it's

1615
01:27:55.351 --> 01:27:58.440
pretty crazy how these guys do this.
She'll be on the cover,

1616
01:27:58.441 --> 01:28:00.780
we'll sell the say the name of the cover.
Hold on.

1617
01:28:00.781 --> 01:28:05.720
It's a law walk off the earth is what it seems to be the name of these guys

1618
01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:08.880
<v 2>and it's a band in there.
They're holding on a guitar and the,</v>

1619
01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:14.260
there's one man who at the very end there's a woman who's above him and then

1620
01:28:14.581 --> 01:28:19.320
there's another man who is above her and then another man who's in between him

1621
01:28:19.321 --> 01:28:23.430
and the next guy who's at the very end who just touches the guitar lightly and

1622
01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:26.760
this guy singing.
It's crazy.
They're all like working the music at the same time.

1623
01:28:26.790 --> 01:28:29.700
Closing those windows with just like missile command.
Yeah.

1624
01:28:29.701 --> 01:28:34.701
This is what this watching this right now is like all this sound that you're

1625
01:28:34.801 --> 01:28:39.740
hearing is coming from one guitar and the bears guy that asked the guy beer guys

1626
01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:44.400
tee shirts
and the drums,
like somebody tapping on the end of it.

1627
01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.770
It's a really cool song.

1628
01:28:47.250 --> 01:28:50.940
And I usually don't like listening to guys saying there's a lot of people have

1629
01:28:50.941 --> 01:28:52.840
been sending me a lot of guy singers.
Right?

1630
01:28:52.841 --> 01:28:55.530
I don't like listening to the guy saying,
yeah,
these guys.

1631
01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:59.040
I like the one guy in the very right.
He's just like,
hi guys.

1632
01:28:59.041 --> 01:29:02.090
I'd like to start with a little twinkle.
And then he goes,
where

1633
01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.980
<v 1>are they from?
These guys?
You should Australia.
This is the cover band.</v>

1634
01:29:04.981 --> 01:29:08.490
I'm not sure where these guys in the,
uh,
the other one is,
um,

1635
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:11.010
what does the dude's name?
This is the hundred and 21 million.

1636
01:29:11.011 --> 01:29:15.600
It's the same as you.
Why would you he,
I think he's from Australia,
but go ta,

1637
01:29:16.230 --> 01:29:17.460
Oh,
here's the chicks thing and its mission.

1638
01:29:17.510 --> 01:29:18.343
<v 8>Do you,</v>

1639
01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:25.810
you said that you can go up somebody that you

1640
01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:32.320
<v 9>[inaudible] don't be on Ellen.</v>

1641
01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:36.470
Damn,
this is good.

1642
01:29:41.300 --> 01:29:42.133
And the right,

1643
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:49.940
I can see it.
Brody,
they set you on the right?
Yeah,
the Bareness is fucking great.

1644
01:29:50.060 --> 01:29:51.410
This is a great cover man.

1645
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:58.900
How'd they come up with this concept?
It's pretty amazing.
I just did it.

1646
01:29:58.910 --> 01:29:59.590
That's bad ass.

1647
01:29:59.590 --> 01:30:03.200
<v 1>I think they just like money.
No,
they're just awesome.
What do you mean they just,</v>

1648
01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:03.911
I mean,

1649
01:30:03.911 --> 01:30:06.790
have you seen anything like that and what the guitars like there's six people in

1650
01:30:06.791 --> 01:30:09.400
the guitar.
What does that band again,
where they call it?
All right,

1651
01:30:09.401 --> 01:30:14.290
so the original song is called somebody.
Somebody that I used to know by G,

1652
01:30:14.291 --> 01:30:18.960
o.
T.
Y.
E.
N,
that one that we were just watching what is called,

1653
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:22.210
I think the band is called walk off the earth.
But if you just,
you know,

1654
01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:23.620
youtube eight,
Google it,

1655
01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:27.220
you'll see the guitar and you see all the people lined up on the guitar
together.

1656
01:30:27.221 --> 01:30:30.810
It's fucking awesome.
And I'm sure 90% of the people are screaming at us now.

1657
01:30:32.690 --> 01:30:37.350
<v 0>Okay,
so behind set,
let's talk hamster dance.
There's this website that,</v>

1658
01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:41.260
why is it that people around forever feel like they,
uh,
I mean,

1659
01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:45.040
what is the push and the push just for more information or do the everyone is so

1660
01:30:45.041 --> 01:30:46.750
excited over the newest,
latest,

1661
01:30:46.751 --> 01:30:50.650
greatest shed that there's like an extreme backlash if you try to introduce them

1662
01:30:50.651 --> 01:30:54.430
to something they've already seen.
Like woo over dude saw three months ago.
Yeah.

1663
01:30:54.431 --> 01:30:58.720
Like there's like a,
like a righteous indignation about what,

1664
01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:01.360
how they're saying it though.
It's ranking systems,
right?

1665
01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:03.490
But what do you see you've mints but already achieved that.

1666
01:31:03.550 --> 01:31:07.840
I think that is that there's something that the universe is trying to do and

1667
01:31:07.841 --> 01:31:12.841
that the universe has the Internet in place so that people become more and more

1668
01:31:13.481 --> 01:31:17.830
fascinated by the constant influx of new information and new ideas and new songs

1669
01:31:17.831 --> 01:31:20.050
and new movies.
And Nunez knew that and it's like,

1670
01:31:20.051 --> 01:31:23.620
it's adding to the incredible amount of information that comes into your life on

1671
01:31:23.621 --> 01:31:26.020
a regular basis.
So it's moving forward.

1672
01:31:26.021 --> 01:31:28.690
Whatever technological achievements that we're,

1673
01:31:28.710 --> 01:31:31.990
we are accomplishing at a staggering rate or this crazy exponential rate.

1674
01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.380
That's why people are so addicted to the newest,
greatest shit on the Internet.

1675
01:31:35.620 --> 01:31:39.190
You know?
It's like there's a purpose to that.
The same reason why,
you know,

1676
01:31:39.191 --> 01:31:41.560
bees will go to a flower to get pollen,
you know?

1677
01:31:41.770 --> 01:31:45.170
<v 1>But do people remember this stuff or is it just like in a three months it's
like,</v>

1678
01:31:45.171 --> 01:31:45.560
yeah,

1679
01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:47.430
<v 0>let's move.
Moving on to the next thing,
man.</v>

1680
01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:52.030
The most important thing is just more shit.
More Shit.
It be exposed to more shit.

1681
01:31:52.031 --> 01:31:56.610
See the craziest shit possible and keep going and stuff and more stuff to your

1682
01:31:56.611 --> 01:32:00.340
crazy consciousness stuff and more shit to your memory.
Newest,

1683
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:03.160
<v 2>greatest,
keep moving.
Yeah.
It never stops.</v>

1684
01:32:03.250 --> 01:32:06.010
Never stops ever until we blow up the fucking universe.

1685
01:32:06.130 --> 01:32:09.740
And that's a great thing about youtube and the Internet.
Just you just,
just fuck.

1686
01:32:09.741 --> 01:32:13.240
Yeah,
spoonfeed at boom,
boom,
boom.
Fill your head,
fill your head,

1687
01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:16.150
educate all that stuff.
Yes.
Brody,

1688
01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:19.960
now are they making money off that?
Like 121 million hits?

1689
01:32:19.961 --> 01:32:23.560
That guy got on that one does seven ad.
Oh,
I didn't have an ad,

1690
01:32:23.561 --> 01:32:25.450
but I'm sure now that he's probably,

1691
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:27.910
I bought his CD immediately after hearing that song.

1692
01:32:27.970 --> 01:32:31.660
I D I think that's at least helping them.
Yeah,
it's pretty good.

1693
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:34.940
It's pretty good song.
And like I said,
I don't usually like listen to the dude's.

1694
01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:39.250
A lot of people have been sending me dude bands not really into the dude's

1695
01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:42.700
singing about love.
Yeah.
Some of them.
Some of that sounds like horse shit to me.

1696
01:32:42.700 --> 01:32:43.870
Boy.
I like it.

1697
01:32:43.871 --> 01:32:46.980
It feels this weird eighties whole that that would like sting that,

1698
01:32:46.990 --> 01:32:48.910
that sound of the 80s that you use,
you know,

1699
01:32:48.911 --> 01:32:52.360
growing up in the 80s listening to that kind of music and nothing's really like

1700
01:32:52.361 --> 01:32:54.430
that anymore.
That's good.
So that,

1701
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:58.750
that really kind of set off like an old sting or right lens or something like

1702
01:32:58.751 --> 01:33:03.280
that.
Yeah,
you're right.
It does have that sort of a authentic 80 sound to this.

1703
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:06.600
Definitely.
It's funny how there's sort of like a sound of different errors.

1704
01:33:07.060 --> 01:33:11.270
There's a 60 sound,
you know,
there's uh,
a Beatles and then the,
uh,

1705
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:15.440
Jim Morrison and Jimi Hendrix and there's a sound to that man.
It's,

1706
01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:19.300
it's fascinating that you hear like some songs like Steppenwolf,
you know,

1707
01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:23.230
magic carpet ride here,
shit like that.
And you're like,
oh,
that's a,
you know,

1708
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:25.750
that's a sound of an era where their errors,

1709
01:33:25.751 --> 01:33:30.610
like where they considered music was like a down period probably 80s,

1710
01:33:30.670 --> 01:33:33.130
the 80s.
It was like,
it was all a joke,
right?
He's,

1711
01:33:33.131 --> 01:33:36.460
a lot of people felt like hairbands and poison and all that kind of shit.

1712
01:33:36.461 --> 01:33:38.650
A lot of people thought like,
what the fuck is going on man?

1713
01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.950
We went from led Zepplin to a poison like forward.

1714
01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:46.140
We're supposed to be moving forward.
Nothing sending wrong poison.
I like it.

1715
01:33:46.141 --> 01:33:46.974
A lot of their songs,

1716
01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:54.040
but then nirvana came along and put the fucking Kabash on all that shit.

1717
01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:57.400
As soon as they heard something real again,
everybody was like,
whoa.
You know,

1718
01:33:57.401 --> 01:34:01.030
when you heard something real and intelligent and raw,
when,
when a teen smear,

1719
01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:04.900
when smells like team spirit came out,
boom.
I remember I was thinking like,

1720
01:34:04.901 --> 01:34:09.730
this is the death of all of that nonsense.
Hairband shit like this.

1721
01:34:09.731 --> 01:34:11.110
No one's going to listen to that anymore.

1722
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:15.040
It was over a buddy's house and he played it and he actually said this.
He goes,

1723
01:34:15.041 --> 01:34:18.700
dude,
I never heard nothing like this is a Boston guy.
Yeah,
dude,

1724
01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:20.980
I never heard not in like this.
Listen to this.

1725
01:34:21.130 --> 01:34:25.630
That called Nirvana and he plays and I was like,
whoa.
Yeah,
they're explosive.
Oh,

1726
01:34:25.631 --> 01:34:26.650
there were just,
yeah,

1727
01:34:26.651 --> 01:34:31.270
the whispering and then the loud chorus and the screaming,
screaming,

1728
01:34:31.271 --> 01:34:33.520
rape me.
What?
Yeah,
just,
I mean

1729
01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:40.000
there's just some powerful energy to what that fucking guy was doing.

1730
01:34:40.060 --> 01:34:43.440
How's co it was,
he was amazing to watch,
like grow up,
like,
like,

1731
01:34:43.780 --> 01:34:46.930
like he would have red hair on Saturday night live or something.
Like,
Holy Shit,

1732
01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:47.890
he's such a bad ass.

1733
01:34:48.010 --> 01:34:51.670
He was a wild motherfucker and it's so horrible when you find out that he was so

1734
01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:55.170
depressed and unhappy.
Yeah.
It's one of the saddest things ever.
It's like you,

1735
01:34:55.171 --> 01:34:58.280
you,
you,
you see this guy and he's like one of favorite musical artists

1736
01:34:58.280 --> 01:34:58.940
<v 0>ever.</v>

1737
01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:02.480
And then you realize that even though he was producing this amazing music is

1738
01:35:02.481 --> 01:35:06.590
life was just a hundred percent wrecked.
It should have been on Lexapro for us.

1739
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:09.320
Maybe not man.
You know,
maybe there was some other,

1740
01:35:09.340 --> 01:35:12.500
there maybe there was like a real imbalance,
you know,
maybe he uh,
you know,

1741
01:35:12.501 --> 01:35:13.640
could have been solved.

1742
01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:17.030
There's something but maybe the without that maybe would have never made that

1743
01:35:17.031 --> 01:35:21.440
kind of music.
And I,
hi,
I wonder what the fuck that's all about man.

1744
01:35:21.441 --> 01:35:24.980
How something that can be so bad for the host.
Like a,

1745
01:35:24.981 --> 01:35:29.330
almost like a mental illness of depression can be so staggeringly good for the

1746
01:35:29.331 --> 01:35:32.480
people that can appreciate the art form that comes out of that stress.

1747
01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:35.960
It's almost unfair is it?
Well it is unfair because,
you know,
look,

1748
01:35:35.961 --> 01:35:39.230
if you really love Kurt Cobain and he really loved his music,

1749
01:35:39.231 --> 01:35:42.110
you would want them to be healthy.
But guess what?
If he was healthy,

1750
01:35:42.111 --> 01:35:45.080
that fucking raped me songs and never been written,
you know,

1751
01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:49.580
it smells like team spirit mean that has shit came out of agony and pain.

1752
01:35:49.581 --> 01:35:53.540
He and the fucking video when he's jumping around and singing that and like,

1753
01:35:53.541 --> 01:35:58.040
Holy Shit.
I mean it was just like,
it was so powerful.
It just,

1754
01:35:58.041 --> 01:35:59.510
it was just all electric.

1755
01:35:59.570 --> 01:36:03.380
Like the whole fucking resonance of the imagery in the,
the,

1756
01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:07.790
the sound of the song and the dancing and everything.
It just boom,
like hit you.

1757
01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:11.150
Like there's a force behind it.
I don't know if that would have existed,

1758
01:36:11.151 --> 01:36:14.720
if he was a happy person.
They be more like the unplugged I CD,
which was great.

1759
01:36:14.721 --> 01:36:18.430
Yeah,
it was great quotes.
I'm pure,
purely speculating obviously of course.
But I,

1760
01:36:18.431 --> 01:36:19.730
I really do.

1761
01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:24.530
I know so many people that have come from fucked up places and because of that,

1762
01:36:24.531 --> 01:36:28.340
they're so good.
Right.
It's weird,
man.
It's really weird.

1763
01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:31.570
<v 7>But as you,
Laura,
you,
they learn to deal with it,
you know?
Yeah.</v>

1764
01:36:31.670 --> 01:36:35.210
<v 0>Well they have a massive amount of creative drive and motivation.</v>

1765
01:36:35.211 --> 01:36:38.780
A lot of them because of whatever was fucked up about their past or whatever's

1766
01:36:38.781 --> 01:36:40.760
fucked up in their mind,
you know,

1767
01:36:40.761 --> 01:36:43.910
whether it's a mental illness or an imbalance or whatever you want to call it.

1768
01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:46.610
Yeah.
You know,
but a guy like Kurt Cobain,
man,

1769
01:36:46.611 --> 01:36:50.390
I mean that shit that mean that was just,
hey,

1770
01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:54.860
no one's found this room before was like he kicked open a new room of culture.

1771
01:36:55.130 --> 01:36:58.520
It's like culture is a giant mansion and well we already had this wrap room

1772
01:36:58.521 --> 01:37:02.330
going on and no people are advancing that sort of,
that sort of genre.

1773
01:37:02.630 --> 01:37:06.080
But he like kicked open a new room,
you know,

1774
01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:10.090
and I know there's a whole grunge scene going on in Seattle,
but uh,

1775
01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:13.490
he kicked open and,
and,
and how,
how obvious is it?

1776
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:17.990
Seattle is depressing as fuck.
Seattle is so rainy and they always tell you,
hey,

1777
01:37:17.991 --> 01:37:19.400
it doesn't bother me.
Doesn't bother me.

1778
01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:22.070
I was there for four days and it bothered me.
Okay.

1779
01:37:22.071 --> 01:37:24.770
It was only there for four days.
And I was like,
where's the fucking sun?

1780
01:37:25.010 --> 01:37:29.900
I live in California.
You become a son junkie.
Yeah.
But to have so much brilliant,

1781
01:37:29.901 --> 01:37:33.950
beautiful emotional pain,
music come from some place where it's never sunny,

1782
01:37:34.340 --> 01:37:35.420
you know?
I mean,
Duh.

1783
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:37.960
<v 7>That was Ohio 75% of the time.</v>

1784
01:37:37.961 --> 01:37:42.930
Almost say it was awful gray skies every day.
It sucks.
Yeah,

1785
01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:45.760
and you don't even,
you just become a,
you don't want to leave the house.

1786
01:37:45.761 --> 01:37:46.600
She become like,
hey,

1787
01:37:46.601 --> 01:37:50.290
let's just drink and get drunk and not think about how crappy it is today.

1788
01:37:50.530 --> 01:37:54.630
Think about how many great bands coming from Ohio.
You know black keys,
breeders?

1789
01:37:54.670 --> 01:37:56.250
Yeah.
Honey,

1790
01:37:56.250 --> 01:38:00.870
<v 2>honey,
Suzanne,
she's from Ohio.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
She's got a song Ohio on that.</v>

1791
01:38:00.871 --> 01:38:03.270
Billy Jack CD.
If you haven't heard about honey honey,

1792
01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:05.850
go download our podcast with them.
They're cool as fuck.

1793
01:38:05.851 --> 01:38:06.870
There are new best friends.

1794
01:38:06.871 --> 01:38:09.270
There are besties and they're on the road right now and they might be in your

1795
01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:13.110
city and they just released some new dates.
Go on their website,
honey.
Honey,

1796
01:38:13.111 --> 01:38:15.900
band.com if you go to honey,
honey.com what is it is like honey honey,

1797
01:38:15.901 --> 01:38:19.230
band.com site.
I think honey honey is a gay porn site or something like that.

1798
01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:20.810
Or at least porn.
Yeah,

1799
01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:24.010
I told him he should try to buy that but it might be too late.
Yeah.

1800
01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:26.700
Cause as they get more and more popular,
honey,

1801
01:38:26.701 --> 01:38:29.310
honey.com is probably gonna be more and more popular as well.

1802
01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:32.700
Well chocolate honey.com is definitely,
oh,
that's porn.
Yeah,

1803
01:38:32.701 --> 01:38:34.140
it's definitely Brian,

1804
01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:35.820
you've been hanging around with a lot of porn stores lately.

1805
01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.130
I'm worried about your buddy.
I'm going to be okay.

1806
01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.750
I'm going to become a part of the industry.
Are you?

1807
01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.570
You're not going to start filming.
Uh,
there's,
there's,
you know,

1808
01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:43.650
I've always counting,

1809
01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:46.830
somebody already said something the other day about how you're not somebody

1810
01:38:46.831 --> 01:38:51.810
until you have like a naked photo that's out there or something like that.
Girls,

1811
01:38:51.811 --> 01:38:54.210
you know,
like,
hey ladies,
you know,
it was a joke.
Oh,

1812
01:38:54.211 --> 01:38:55.890
trying to get them to have a picture.
Exactly.

1813
01:38:56.160 --> 01:38:58.020
So I was thinking about it the other day.
I was like,

1814
01:38:58.021 --> 01:39:01.790
thinking how many people I know have certain things and uh,

1815
01:39:01.830 --> 01:39:03.630
it's getting worse lately.
So yeah,

1816
01:39:03.631 --> 01:39:06.840
I could see myself getting into porn very quick.
Really?
You think so?

1817
01:39:08.100 --> 01:39:10.290
There's not the stigma that you don't think I would wonder.

1818
01:39:10.291 --> 01:39:13.200
I wonder if you just released a porn for a little,
like five bucks.

1819
01:39:13.310 --> 01:39:16.690
Well let's think of Louis C K method for poor while watching this stream ate

1820
01:39:16.691 --> 01:39:21.470
shit and it's like my free cams.com shit.
It's really fascinating.
It's a,

1821
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:23.070
somebody told me about that.
I think it was,

1822
01:39:23.071 --> 01:39:26.010
you actually told me about my free cams and I just started going there.
It's,

1823
01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:29.790
it's,
it's addicting,
right?
It's crack.
Well I went there when I,
first of all,

1824
01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:33.360
I went there on an edible and I was,

1825
01:39:33.390 --> 01:39:36.780
I was sitting down in front of my computer.
I've been writing on edibles lately.

1826
01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:38.580
I like doing that.
Yeah.

1827
01:39:38.670 --> 01:39:41.610
I like riding on edibles because edibles are the best to like come out of the

1828
01:39:41.611 --> 01:39:44.970
tank,
like edibles,
hit a peak,
getting the tank,

1829
01:39:44.971 --> 01:39:47.160
get the ideas show jump out.

1830
01:39:47.190 --> 01:39:52.190
But I got fucking jacked on my way to my Microsoft word processing program by my

1831
01:39:52.501 --> 01:39:57.180
free cams.com I clicked on the link and I was,
I was so high and I was like,

1832
01:39:57.181 --> 01:39:58.890
what is this?
I was like,

1833
01:39:58.891 --> 01:40:03.000
this is some crazy interface I'm looking at literally pay,

1834
01:40:03.001 --> 01:40:04.530
if you haven't seen it folks,
it's,
it's,

1835
01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:06.870
I don't know how many windows are open at the same time,

1836
01:40:06.871 --> 01:40:10.200
but it has to be hundreds.
Yeah.
Okay.
There's hundred pages deep,

1837
01:40:10.201 --> 01:40:13.440
usually hundreds and hundreds of girls that are online naked in front of the

1838
01:40:13.441 --> 01:40:16.410
cameras and I just sit there and I just go,
what is this?

1839
01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:19.830
So I click on one boom and it's a girl and she's smoking a cigarette and she's

1840
01:40:19.831 --> 01:40:21.810
got a finger in her ass and I'm like,

1841
01:40:21.811 --> 01:40:24.510
this is the most ridiculous shit I've ever seen in my life.

1842
01:40:24.630 --> 01:40:27.420
And there's one after another after another and I'm like,

1843
01:40:27.421 --> 01:40:30.180
this is the old looking girls.

1844
01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.950
Some were amazed everybody,

1845
01:40:33.130 --> 01:40:37.350
but then I guess they make money off of it by they lure you into a dark room.

1846
01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:41.370
Better is the people that are not high is that scary ones.

1847
01:40:41.370 --> 01:40:46.200
The ones that's like that woman 70 years old and she's weighed 500 pounds and

1848
01:40:46.201 --> 01:40:49.410
she has a three cigarettes in her mouth in a lot of those too.

1849
01:40:49.620 --> 01:40:51.900
Well if you go to a porn site,
a lot of them,

1850
01:40:51.901 --> 01:40:54.520
they'll pop up a cam site in the background.
Yeah.

1851
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:56.540
And then all of a sudden you hear,
oh you like that?
Yeah.

1852
01:40:56.541 --> 01:40:59.110
And you have to pull your window down.
Go,
what is this behind my,

1853
01:40:59.290 --> 01:41:03.520
what have you gotten here?
It's new browsers opened up as a girl,

1854
01:41:03.540 --> 01:41:07.740
you know with your shitty tattoos and assets and yeah,

1855
01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.830
a lot of extra skin and,
and some of them are hot.
It's a lot of them are hot,

1856
01:41:11.831 --> 01:41:12.730
but a lot of them are not.

1857
01:41:12.910 --> 01:41:16.540
Some of the weird ones are the ones from like West Virginia or something like

1858
01:41:16.541 --> 01:41:20.170
where you could tell like that that's her dad's bedroom and he's like passed out

1859
01:41:20.171 --> 01:41:24.280
drunk on the like on the floor.
That's the scary one.
Yeah.

1860
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:27.010
There's a lot of them where you can tell they're in trailers.
Absolutely.

1861
01:41:27.011 --> 01:41:29.800
Tell them trailers and these girls are making money.
That's right.
That's right.

1862
01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:33.140
Yeah.
Apparently that's a lot of porn stars do that now too.

1863
01:41:33.400 --> 01:41:36.460
One of them I was on the other day,
it was a Jill Kelly was on it.

1864
01:41:36.461 --> 01:41:40.370
You know Jill Kelly is,
yeah.
Yeah.
And I'm like,
what is this Sammy Road?

1865
01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:44.560
I see they sit in front of the camera and then they talk to their fans and you

1866
01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:45.410
know,
the guy's like,
hey,

1867
01:41:45.411 --> 01:41:48.490
are you think you get a lick your finger and touch your butt for me?
What's up?

1868
01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:51.590
And then I guess they have to give him money to do that.
Yeah,

1869
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:53.500
well some of them just do it for free.

1870
01:41:53.501 --> 01:41:56.530
But what's really funny is like when some of them do it for free.
Yeah.
Like,
like,

1871
01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:59.110
like you'll just go and have half of those rooms are just completely naked.

1872
01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:02.290
And I girls like,
like holding up the dildo going,

1873
01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:06.100
I'll fuck this for 20 minutes and then here's the sample and just shoves us huge

1874
01:42:06.101 --> 01:42:07.450
thing in her.
Oh yeah,

1875
01:42:07.451 --> 01:42:11.470
see I'll do that if I get $100 and then,
oh,

1876
01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.440
and then there's other ones where they,
it's just ridiculous stuff.
Like,

1877
01:42:14.590 --> 01:42:18.850
I'll show you one boot for $1 or two boobs for $2 I will put this broomstick and

1878
01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.140
mighty,
but for $10 it's,
it's fun,
man.
It's,
it's weird.

1879
01:42:23.290 --> 01:42:24.220
It's very addictive.

1880
01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.120
It's just weird to get in contact with so many different people that you would

1881
01:42:28.121 --> 01:42:30.850
never be in contact with under normal circumstances.

1882
01:42:30.851 --> 01:42:35.450
The ability to just instantly be in,
uh,
West Virginia trailer.
Right.

1883
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:36.311
Just like that.

1884
01:42:36.311 --> 01:42:40.270
And you are watching this woman and she's fucking yelling at her dog and the cat

1885
01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:43.290
jumped up and look it over and over that video that you did with little Esther,

1886
01:42:43.610 --> 01:42:47.020
that's how I,
you know,
it's like a real life version of that.
Yeah.

1887
01:42:47.230 --> 01:42:49.300
But you guys did that was a parody of something else,

1888
01:42:49.301 --> 01:42:52.000
wasn't it already have another,
yeah,
this other,

1889
01:42:52.080 --> 01:42:56.080
there was a video with this girl where his dad in the background was freaking

1890
01:42:56.081 --> 01:42:59.830
out because somebody said something to her,
her video,
like on Youtube,

1891
01:42:59.831 --> 01:43:04.030
like I said some things and then she was crying and the dads and background,

1892
01:43:04.031 --> 01:43:07.280
like if I find you and blah,
blah,
blah.
And so I parodied that V,

1893
01:43:07.281 --> 01:43:09.700
I forget the actual name at the video,
but wow.

1894
01:43:09.701 --> 01:43:14.020
I could show it to you in a second.
Yeah,
that was funny.
Yeah.
There's a,

1895
01:43:14.021 --> 01:43:17.390
there's a Lotta Lotta angry fucks out there online Brody.
Yeah.

1896
01:43:17.450 --> 01:43:20.500
I mean it's a whole new,
it's a whole new world.
I mean,
we're still is there,

1897
01:43:20.501 --> 01:43:25.120
are we,
there's a learning curve on all the shorts.
Yeah.
Are we almost,
there is a,

1898
01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.240
right now it's unfair because the women are sitting there and there's a camera

1899
01:43:28.241 --> 01:43:32.500
on them and then the men could be fucking killing rabbits while they jerk off

1900
01:43:32.501 --> 01:43:34.690
and the woman doesn't see anything.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
I mean,

1901
01:43:34.691 --> 01:43:38.950
the man could be fucking snapping a kittens head as he,
you know,
he,
you know,

1902
01:43:38.980 --> 01:43:42.880
orgasms while he's watching her video and she has no idea.
She's like,
well,

1903
01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:44.440
you guys have been awesome.

1904
01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:46.780
We want you to know he's killing hookers in front of her.
You know,
who knows,

1905
01:43:46.781 --> 01:43:50.860
who knows what's going on on that end.
Eventually,
that's not gonna exist.

1906
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:52.250
Eventually when you have

1907
01:43:52.460 --> 01:43:56.330
<v 0>communication with someone like that,
it'll be like in an interface,
an interface,</v>

1908
01:43:56.470 --> 01:43:59.600
you know,
just how like for the longest time,
look at it this way.

1909
01:43:59.601 --> 01:44:04.601
For the longest time people had to have a television station or a movie to get

1910
01:44:05.391 --> 01:44:08.150
an idea across.
Like if you wanted to have a television show,

1911
01:44:08.151 --> 01:44:10.760
if you wanted to tell a story,
unless you wanted to write a play,

1912
01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:14.150
if you want to tell a story and have it broadcast in front of the whole country

1913
01:44:14.151 --> 01:44:18.450
or the world,
you had to have uh,
a television studio to do it.
Yeah.

1914
01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:23.150
Now we all have email.
We all have Twitter,

1915
01:44:23.151 --> 01:44:27.710
we all have Facebook and you can pass information almost instantly if you put up

1916
01:44:27.711 --> 01:44:32.090
a picture.
And it's so absolutely hilarious that I have to send it to my friend.

1917
01:44:32.091 --> 01:44:35.600
And so as in,
and then it keeps going back and forth and back and forth.

1918
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:38.210
What are you doing Brian?
Is that the,
uh,
the real video?
Here's the real video.

1919
01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.410
<v 5>My daughter,
does that even look like little Esther,
right?</v>

1920
01:44:40.440 --> 01:44:42.290
Anymore your comments should put on there.

1921
01:44:42.530 --> 01:44:47.530
I'm recording them all when they are being to the police department.

1922
01:44:49.010 --> 01:44:53.390
You worry males will be caught and will be bound and go,
shit,

1923
01:44:53.391 --> 01:44:54.860
you're going to beat my daughter up.

1924
01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.720
You will have to deal with the politics because you've done good

1925
01:45:00.010 --> 01:45:03.800
<v 1>duck,
duck goose and it gets really intense where him and a woman</v>

1926
01:45:04.350 --> 01:45:07.780
<v 5>scroll up my computer again.
Your p</v>

1927
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:17.490
three mustache.
So amazing.
I know my daughter

1928
01:45:20.570 --> 01:45:25.390
will never be good shame.
Y'All lie.
And what's your breath

1929
01:45:27.090 --> 01:45:31.550
like this
about me?
So yeah,

1930
01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:33.730
<v 0>this is awesome.
Wow.
Well you know,</v>

1931
01:45:34.030 --> 01:45:38.000
if you haven't on a normal scene life in your,
in your forties.
Oh you are.

1932
01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:39.860
You don't run into this Brody Stevens.

1933
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:43.070
So you need to have the Internet just to have you connected with these people.

1934
01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:46.280
But I think what I was saying was eventually we're all going to have like our

1935
01:45:46.281 --> 01:45:49.340
own channel.
That's what it's coming down to.
What's coming down to,

1936
01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.640
you're going to be able to create almost anything thinking about the,
the,
the,

1937
01:45:52.641 --> 01:45:57.170
just the,
the graphics that people can create now and do it.
And,
um,
you know,

1938
01:45:57.171 --> 01:45:59.840
there's a bunch of different three d image processing when people can make

1939
01:45:59.890 --> 01:46:01.820
essentially make their own video games they want.
Yeah.

1940
01:46:01.821 --> 01:46:04.640
There's a lot of different video game engines that you can actually even like

1941
01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:09.000
there's free demos of them and shit.
Kay Bryan,
this is distracting now,

1942
01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:13.550
but I think eventually everyone's gonna have their own channel.
I think,
you know,

1943
01:46:13.551 --> 01:46:16.330
it's just going to be like you have your own Twitter page,
you,
your,

1944
01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:16.791
it's going to,

1945
01:46:16.791 --> 01:46:21.080
there's going to be an even more emerging into your life and that's a good thing

1946
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:25.130
I would think.
Yeah.
Brian,
you have the thing playing in the background?
No,

1947
01:46:25.131 --> 01:46:29.570
I took it off.
Oh,
just topped off now how dare you.

1948
01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:33.190
<v 1>And then we'll funny and talented people are just regular people will be able to</v>

1949
01:46:33.191 --> 01:46:33.520
be,

1950
01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.290
<v 0>how the fuck do I know this might be the end of humans,
Brody,
who knows?</v>

1951
01:46:38.530 --> 01:46:39.670
We might become something different.

1952
01:46:39.820 --> 01:46:43.870
We might interface with computers and be Borg's.
That can be real shit bunny.

1953
01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:46.900
Come on.
They have tattoos that go off when your phone rings.
Yeah.

1954
01:46:46.930 --> 01:46:47.800
The fuck is that

1955
01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:51.810
<v 2>technology kind of weird like the Internet and all that has changed the game for</v>

1956
01:46:51.811 --> 01:46:54.390
everything.
Of course it has.
So I'm,
I'm,
you know,

1957
01:46:54.391 --> 01:46:57.390
we're figuring that out and it's,
so this is what you do.
You've got an iPhone.

1958
01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.760
Yes,
I do set an alarm clock every morning,

1959
01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:02.960
set it every morning and that's when you wake up and work out.
So use the,

1960
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:06.900
use the technology,
embrace it,
fill your head with it,
embrace it.
Brody,

1961
01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:09.250
do you like working out in the morning?
And I am not a fan of it.

1962
01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:11.820
That's why I do it.
It seems like I need to do it so I don't want,

1963
01:47:11.821 --> 01:47:12.654
because I don't like it.

1964
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:14.730
That's why I like to do strength and conditioning in morning.

1965
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:18.360
Fucking hate to do it.
So I like to do it forced myself,
Brodie.

1966
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:20.700
And then you get a,
how many hours did you sleep at night?

1967
01:47:21.090 --> 01:47:25.950
I got to get at least eight.
And you get those eight hours and make myself do it.

1968
01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:29.280
And then what about when you're doing stand up on the road,

1969
01:47:29.281 --> 01:47:31.860
you still use affect your sleep.
Why won't you have to get up early?

1970
01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:32.873
You're doing stand up.

1971
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:35.580
That's impressive that you'd get the eight hours and need it.

1972
01:47:35.970 --> 01:47:39.690
You need it and it's not negotiable.
You body has to rebuild itself.

1973
01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:42.660
If you don't get it in a night,
you got to get it during the day as a nap.

1974
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:44.970
You gotta get something cause he a fuck yourself up.

1975
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:47.220
Especially if you're working out,
you'll fuck yourself up.

1976
01:47:47.250 --> 01:47:50.640
You body has to have that downtime.
Yeah,
I get my sleep.

1977
01:47:50.641 --> 01:47:51.780
I've always been a good sleeper.

1978
01:47:51.810 --> 01:47:54.700
Luckily I feel like you never have a problem sleeping.
He never know.

1979
01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:58.140
Take anything.
[inaudible] that's,
that's,
that's where it gets tricky.

1980
01:47:58.170 --> 01:48:00.990
I got a lot of friends that are addicted to sleeping pills.

1981
01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:02.550
I got a lot like I know,

1982
01:48:02.551 --> 01:48:06.060
I know several people that have had real problems with sleeping pills.
Yeah.

1983
01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:08.610
Knock on wood.
I haven't had though.
I haven't had that problem.

1984
01:48:09.260 --> 01:48:12.320
Do you ever take them Brian?
Saving posts?
Yeah.
I'll take them once in awhile,

1985
01:48:12.650 --> 01:48:15.660
but I don't like it because I don't like being hung over the next morning and

1986
01:48:15.661 --> 01:48:19.470
they,
they,
they tend to have that were like the first two hours I'm awake.

1987
01:48:19.471 --> 01:48:23.060
I'm just groggy.
I don't like that.
And so I don't,
I don't,
I'm not a big,

1988
01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:25.920
the only time I ever do sleeping pills is when I like,
yes,

1989
01:48:25.921 --> 01:48:29.040
I need to make sure I fall asleep and have at least eight hours of sleep
tonight.

1990
01:48:29.070 --> 01:48:31.250
And he used to take muscle relaxants.

1991
01:48:31.760 --> 01:48:35.220
He used to take that when he would be on flights like so he could go to sleep

1992
01:48:36.090 --> 01:48:39.810
and he didn't put two and two together.
He was doing like a Jujitsu seminars.

1993
01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:40.170
Yeah.

1994
01:48:40.170 --> 01:48:44.160
So you take these muscle relaxes and then he would go roll the next day and his

1995
01:48:44.190 --> 01:48:47.550
muscles would be wracked like you would gas out immediately.

1996
01:48:47.551 --> 01:48:50.970
He was constantly getting injured and then he finally put two and two together.

1997
01:48:50.971 --> 01:48:51.421
Like,
Whoa,

1998
01:48:51.421 --> 01:48:55.170
you're not supposed to do Jujitsu on muscle relaxants because essentially that's

1999
01:48:55.171 --> 01:48:55.651
what he was doing.

2000
01:48:55.651 --> 01:48:58.620
It was like staying in his system and he fucked his back up once.

2001
01:48:58.621 --> 01:49:02.940
Hard doing that.
Wow.
Yeah.
Cause that stays in your system for a couple of days.

2002
01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:05.670
It actually pulls the nitric oxide out of your,

2003
01:49:05.671 --> 01:49:08.940
out of your muscles apparently or mine or not.
I might have just made that up.

2004
01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:11.580
That might've been something somebody told me that I didn't research it all

2005
01:49:12.270 --> 01:49:16.820
nitric oxide and no,
that's good for your upload all that stuff.
Yeah.

2006
01:49:16.821 --> 01:49:18.810
It's supposed to be,
you know,
a that three.

2007
01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:22.650
What does that Jack Three d that's I think that's also on nitric oxide

2008
01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:23.850
supplement.
I like that stuff.

2009
01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:27.060
I had such great before you left if you want to do just like regular lifting,

2010
01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:29.190
you know and you'd do that in the morning.

2011
01:49:29.191 --> 01:49:31.800
You wouldn't do that and you don't take that take stuff.
But when you,

2012
01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:34.490
first of all I liked,
I like to do,
um,

2013
01:49:34.650 --> 01:49:38.220
like a light workout in the morning is one of my favorite things to do because

2014
01:49:38.221 --> 01:49:38.581
if you,

2015
01:49:38.581 --> 01:49:42.360
if you get used to doing like real hard workouts like kettlebells or something

2016
01:49:42.361 --> 01:49:46.110
like that,
like something really brutal.
Then just doing like a set,

2017
01:49:46.111 --> 01:49:48.010
like a regular set of press and dips

2018
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:50.620
<v 0>or something like that.
It's like so easy to do in the morning cause it's not,</v>

2019
01:49:50.650 --> 01:49:52.270
it's not that intense.
Whereas you know,

2020
01:49:52.271 --> 01:49:55.570
it would be hard to motivate yourself for a workout like that.

2021
01:49:55.571 --> 01:49:58.870
If that was like the most intense he ever got.
Like God,
I don't want to lift.

2022
01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:01.330
But when you're used to doing crazy shit,

2023
01:50:01.331 --> 01:50:04.910
like an easy day of just doing bench press and dips,
that's it.

2024
01:50:04.950 --> 01:50:08.230
It's easy to do first thing in the morning before you get going,
knock it out.

2025
01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:10.120
Yeah,
just do that and do a few sets of that.

2026
01:50:10.121 --> 01:50:13.870
Just a couple of different exercises and it's better than doing nothing,

2027
01:50:14.110 --> 01:50:17.350
you know?
And,
and it might only take 1520 minutes.
You don't need much,
you know,

2028
01:50:17.351 --> 01:50:18.580
and you need to dip bar and,

2029
01:50:18.581 --> 01:50:21.790
and some and just do that consistently on a consistent basis.

2030
01:50:21.791 --> 01:50:24.010
That's the most important thing is consistency.

2031
01:50:24.011 --> 01:50:27.490
Making your body consistently have to work and then everything will just fucking

2032
01:50:27.491 --> 01:50:29.060
start getting stronger and you know,

2033
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:31.480
your heart rate will drop and you'll start getting in shape.

2034
01:50:32.070 --> 01:50:35.490
<v 1>You don't mean Michael Come back.
Yeah,
I needed to come back.
Joe.</v>

2035
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:38.040
It's in my head and said,
oh,
we'll then take some pills for it.

2036
01:50:38.310 --> 01:50:41.670
Take some Viagara fucking fire.
Right back to life.

2037
01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:44.340
I'll tell you what I feel like.
Yeah.
I like,

2038
01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:46.940
I am relaxed and I got to find that right thing.

2039
01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:51.680
I'm just going to like change my mind.
I'm changing my brain chemistry.
No.

2040
01:50:52.060 --> 01:50:55.390
Okay.
I'm doing it right now.
It's done.
It's done.
It's done.
But I,

2041
01:50:55.391 --> 01:50:58.320
that's why I love doing the podcast.
I don't want to get all sappy,

2042
01:50:58.321 --> 01:51:01.320
but all the twitters,
all the desk squad people,
they give me confidence.

2043
01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:04.050
They helped me.
They make me believe that what I'm doing is the right thing.

2044
01:51:04.290 --> 01:51:05.560
I think the podcast for you,

2045
01:51:05.740 --> 01:51:09.570
it's very interesting because it's almost to me like therapy,
you know,

2046
01:51:09.571 --> 01:51:13.260
you get to hang out with me and a couple of friends and just talk it out for two

2047
01:51:13.261 --> 01:51:15.660
to three hours straight where normally,
you know,

2048
01:51:15.661 --> 01:51:17.880
for that Coffee Cup I might say hi to you for like 10 minutes,

2049
01:51:17.881 --> 01:51:19.880
but by walk away and go do something else.
You know,

2050
01:51:19.890 --> 01:51:22.590
I'm not going to continue engaging in,
you know,

2051
01:51:22.591 --> 01:51:26.930
what your deal day is and does to that depth and detail.
You know,
I,

2052
01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:29.880
these podcasts have really helped me out.
I love coming here.

2053
01:51:29.881 --> 01:51:32.640
And then you get into Improv with Joey Diaz,
you know,

2054
01:51:32.641 --> 01:51:36.390
Greg Fitzsimmons yourself and then you go and do these shows.
It's like,
wow,

2055
01:51:36.391 --> 01:51:37.680
I love doing them,
you know,

2056
01:51:37.681 --> 01:51:42.600
and it's like does give me a help my confidence and all that and all the fans.

2057
01:51:42.670 --> 01:51:43.730
Yeah.
And I've already,

2058
01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:46.500
how do you respond to the criticism that you always bring every subject back to

2059
01:51:46.501 --> 01:51:51.480
Brody?
Uh,
sometimes I do.
Sometimes I don't have,
it depends on the setting.

2060
01:51:51.510 --> 01:51:53.460
Um,
I mean I can talk about,

2061
01:51:53.461 --> 01:51:58.350
do you ever talk to friends and give friends advice?
Are you an advice giver?

2062
01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:02.400
Yeah,
if they want it,
but I don't go out on my way doing it too much.

2063
01:52:02.490 --> 01:52:06.420
Who's the last person came to you for advice?
Who came to me for advice?

2064
01:52:06.421 --> 01:52:10.110
I've had a couple of comedians back at the comedy store.
Like to give,

2065
01:52:10.170 --> 01:52:13.880
given advice.
Yeah,
I'm okay.
Especially if somebody asked me,
you know,

2066
01:52:13.890 --> 01:52:15.000
it was fascinating,

2067
01:52:15.150 --> 01:52:18.540
the people who are super good at given advice for their lifes of mass.
Oh thanks.

2068
01:52:18.541 --> 01:52:20.760
Like fat on cigarettes all fucked up.

2069
01:52:20.910 --> 01:52:25.370
This we need to do this is what you just got to listen to me that
no I didn't,

2070
01:52:25.390 --> 01:52:27.930
I just thought you right.
You know what I'm saying?
I'm saying,

2071
01:52:27.931 --> 01:52:31.980
you know how they do force on you,
the people who want to force yeah.

2072
01:52:31.981 --> 01:52:34.080
They don't get it.
They haven't done it,
you know,
they don't,

2073
01:52:34.110 --> 01:52:35.580
they don't follow their own advice.

2074
01:52:35.581 --> 01:52:37.710
Looking at where people come up to you after shows and tell you what you should

2075
01:52:37.711 --> 01:52:41.850
have done.
Uh,
I haven't,
I haven't gotten that recently ever.

2076
01:52:42.930 --> 01:52:45.910
Um,
I got,
I mean a couple of little things.
We get that Brian,

2077
01:52:45.940 --> 01:52:49.400
we're guys come up to you after your show.
Yeah,
of course.

2078
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:53.060
But it's usually like more just like that one shit was really good,

2079
01:52:53.061 --> 01:52:55.310
but what would that one thing about that weird,
you know,

2080
01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:59.720
not like saying you should stop doing that,
but kind of like,
all right,

2081
01:52:59.721 --> 01:53:02.000
he's telling me and like a backhanded slap.

2082
01:53:02.001 --> 01:53:04.850
Like you definitely thought that shit was weird,
you know,

2083
01:53:04.851 --> 01:53:07.540
and he didn't like it or something,
you know?
Yeah.

2084
01:53:07.550 --> 01:53:09.440
You got a lot of weird jokes on.
Yeah.

2085
01:53:09.690 --> 01:53:14.210
You got a lot of bits where I have to leave the room.
Really.
I get that.

2086
01:53:14.211 --> 01:53:16.220
What's but what's wars getting ignored?

2087
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:18.620
Would you rather like have somebody be ignored?
What's worse?

2088
01:53:18.621 --> 01:53:23.120
Getting fucked by a rhino or a leopard.
A leopard,

2089
01:53:24.500 --> 01:53:28.040
Lee.
Sure.
Scratch,
you know,
the Rhino has a bigger,

2090
01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.050
bigger cock so the rhino would hurt more.

2091
01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:34.430
It's basically the same question you just asked me.
Okay.
No,
I think that,

2092
01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:37.640
I think for me,
when people don't know me and I have not bringing it back.

2093
01:53:37.670 --> 01:53:39.660
Gosh dangit yeah,

2094
01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:41.990
well we're talking about like what was going on with doing that,

2095
01:53:42.290 --> 01:53:45.740
but you gotta be aware you're doing it well.
It's going back to a question.
Oh,

2096
01:53:45.741 --> 01:53:49.760
I understand.
Most people are pretty nice to me.
After Shirley said,
good job,

2097
01:53:49.790 --> 01:53:54.740
I'm happy with that.
But I,
I,
I mean fans are weird to get a,

2098
01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:58.190
like you ever go on like one of those like super critical blogs,

2099
01:53:58.191 --> 01:54:01.280
like a special thing or something like that and listen to something somebody

2100
01:54:01.281 --> 01:54:04.550
might have to say about,
yeah,
I've stayed off those comments after I did.

2101
01:54:04.551 --> 01:54:06.950
I did some earlier.
You know,
Brian,
I were talking,
we were,

2102
01:54:06.951 --> 01:54:10.760
I did some early podcasts for a long time ago and I got negative feedback and I

2103
01:54:10.761 --> 01:54:13.480
kind of like learned my lesson and then I also said I'm not going to get

2104
01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:14.510
involved in,

2105
01:54:14.930 --> 01:54:18.790
I just started out putting up more positive energy and I didn't want to uh,

2106
01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:21.560
get involved with too much internet craziness.

2107
01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:23.660
I don't Google my name and going to chat rooms,

2108
01:54:25.670 --> 01:54:28.910
Google your name and going into the chat rooms at two completely different

2109
01:54:28.911 --> 01:54:31.160
things.
How did you connect them?
Well,

2110
01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:33.830
for however much time you spend googling your name,

2111
01:54:33.831 --> 01:54:37.220
then you have to go to this chat room and you owe them some time.

2112
01:54:37.410 --> 01:54:39.360
I may get a Google alert,
I'll be honest,
but I,

2113
01:54:39.370 --> 01:54:42.230
it's usually you get a Google alert when someone writes a story about you or

2114
01:54:42.231 --> 01:54:46.160
something.
Is that what that says?
Something like that.
It comes out.
Oh my God,

2115
01:54:46.161 --> 01:54:50.450
I don't know.
Doing you have that also?
Yeah,
for deaths gone.
Oh Wow.

2116
01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:54.470
It's mostly just like somebody promoting a show and your name's in it.
Oh,
okay.

2117
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:57.110
Oh,
somebody might be like fake promoting some shit.

2118
01:54:57.410 --> 01:54:59.540
You ever heard someone say that you're going to be somewhere and you weren't

2119
01:54:59.541 --> 01:55:03.330
really as I was just trying to promote that big of a name yet.
I just like,
Hey,

2120
01:55:03.331 --> 01:55:03.951
hope that happen.

2121
01:55:03.951 --> 01:55:07.550
I just like heavy metal music and groups of terrorists Kinda guys.

2122
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:11.480
That's the way to all my emails are about like heavy metal music and groups of

2123
01:55:11.481 --> 01:55:12.980
terrorists.
What do you mean?

2124
01:55:12.981 --> 01:55:16.790
Like I always get news reports like does the death squad out of Egypt,
you know,

2125
01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:19.130
and so you have it done and then there's,

2126
01:55:19.131 --> 01:55:21.530
there's like some band called death squad was like heavy metal.

2127
01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:23.620
There's a band called,
yeah,
it's like,

2128
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:26.870
like there's a band called fear factory too.
Yeah.

2129
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:32.360
When fear factor going on TV.
Why did they not just drop that name right?
Yeah,

2130
01:55:32.361 --> 01:55:36.260
the band.
Yeah.
I know you probably were fear factory first,
but dude,

2131
01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:40.820
come on you,
you've changed your name.
Exactly.

2132
01:55:40.940 --> 01:55:43.680
Aren't you glad you don't have to have a name?
What would you be if you a band?

2133
01:55:43.860 --> 01:55:44.160
Fewer

2134
01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:47.400
<v 2>wa if comedy was like a band,
you know,
you can't say,
hey,</v>

2135
01:55:47.401 --> 01:55:50.040
it's Brody Stevens and Joe Rogan and we're here to sing a song.
No,

2136
01:55:50.041 --> 01:55:52.440
you have to be a fucking band.
So if you are a band,

2137
01:55:52.441 --> 01:55:54.190
if every comic was like a band,
yeah,

2138
01:55:54.191 --> 01:55:57.110
it'd be tough on a mean band names that gotta be tough to come up with.

2139
01:55:57.120 --> 01:55:59.910
Kind of funny.
You know,
singers don't have to do that.
Like Sheryl Crow.

2140
01:55:59.911 --> 01:56:03.540
She can go on the road and be Sheryl Crow.
Yeah.
But you know,
I would like,

2141
01:56:03.541 --> 01:56:07.590
she can't,
by the way,
be like Raven Wolf craft.

2142
01:56:07.770 --> 01:56:11.330
She can't like make up a name either.
Joe And brode.
I buy bread,
Bro.

2143
01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:15.840
I been the bird street boy.
Broadstreet street boy.
But isn't that funny?
You know,

2144
01:56:15.841 --> 01:56:16.950
like,
uh,
if you,

2145
01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:20.550
if you're a one person and you make up a name like the queen of the world or

2146
01:56:20.551 --> 01:56:22.770
something like that,
you're a douchebag.
Yeah.
You know,

2147
01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:26.040
but if you're a band and you call yourselves the Queens of the stone age,

2148
01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:30.750
that's totally cool.
Yeah,
you're right.
Yeah,
you're right.
It's weird.

2149
01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:35.160
My aunts and individuals,
it's a bands.
You've got to be a crazier lifestyle.
Oh,

2150
01:56:35.161 --> 01:56:37.740
fuck.
Yeah.
Well,
they have to say the same songs to the,

2151
01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:40.680
what's really sucks about bands when people don't want to hear new stuff.

2152
01:56:40.710 --> 01:56:45.150
Think about that.
You know,
we,
we have to do new stuff constantly,
but bands like,

2153
01:56:45.151 --> 01:56:46.090
there's,
there's certain pretty like,

2154
01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:48.660
people go to see rolling stones and the rolling stones,
we'll have a new song.

2155
01:56:48.661 --> 01:56:52.740
People go,
oh,
like roll their eyes and go,
fuck.

2156
01:56:52.770 --> 01:56:56.220
I think Bruce Springsteen's getting that.
I hear,
I read on a couple of his,
uh,

2157
01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.480
shows like he's doing a syllabus,
new stuff.
Ooh,
that sucks.

2158
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:02.730
That's gotta be hard.
And people,
all they want to hear,

2159
01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:08.730
that's all they don't want to hear is they got to work in some new songs.
Yeah.

2160
01:57:08.731 --> 01:57:12.420
Well when you like a Kinison used to have a joke about the beach boys buck

2161
01:57:12.421 --> 01:57:16.770
seeing the beach boys after all the years and they had been like ever gone surf

2162
01:57:16.771 --> 01:57:18.150
and you could tell they were like hating it.

2163
01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:21.360
They didn't want to be singing in anymore.
They really do like these bands.

2164
01:57:21.361 --> 01:57:23.760
Some of them,
some of them are probably just happy.
They have a,

2165
01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:26.820
a fan base and the people want to come see him and they're,
you know,

2166
01:57:26.821 --> 01:57:29.040
the happy they,
they're making a living.
You know,

2167
01:57:29.041 --> 01:57:31.200
it's all depends on your attitude.
Look,
if you're,

2168
01:57:31.201 --> 01:57:33.300
if you're a band like the beach boys or something like that,

2169
01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:37.140
she could be bummed out too.
You have to sing the same songs.
Or You could go,

2170
01:57:37.141 --> 01:57:40.050
Holy Shit,
where the fucking beach boys,
you know,
think about that.

2171
01:57:40.110 --> 01:57:44.070
Not a lot of people get to be the beach boys.
We had created some iconic music.

2172
01:57:44.071 --> 01:57:48.120
They're huge stars for decade after decade and if they show up at some state

2173
01:57:48.121 --> 01:57:51.870
fair or some,
you know,
some theater somewhere,
people still want to go see them,

2174
01:57:51.900 --> 01:57:53.750
they're happy.
They'll create all that house.

2175
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:57.780
I don't know if they're bit crazy the bat back then they probably became popular

2176
01:57:57.781 --> 01:58:01.710
because people lived in shitty places in the United States and they just wanted

2177
01:58:01.711 --> 01:58:02.730
to hear surf music.

2178
01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:06.660
They wanted to feel like what it was liked being California and you know,

2179
01:58:06.661 --> 01:58:10.020
cause that's kind of what their music kind of has a feeling for it.
Right.

2180
01:58:10.050 --> 01:58:13.170
When you say that,
that's probably why two of each culture.
Yeah.

2181
01:58:13.171 --> 01:58:15.990
So the beach culture is California was like,
you know,

2182
01:58:15.991 --> 01:58:17.760
you would see it in like movies and shit.

2183
01:58:17.761 --> 01:58:22.761
People driving around convertibles and surfboards on the top of their trucks and

2184
01:58:22.771 --> 01:58:27.480
Whoa,
mayor was clear.
No smog.
Beach boys are respected.

2185
01:58:27.481 --> 01:58:30.480
People don't realize how respected the beach boys are.
You know,

2186
01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:33.750
who they affected,
like the Beatles love dumb,
all those guys.

2187
01:58:33.810 --> 01:58:37.560
That's a good point about what it must have been likely being in Ohio and you

2188
01:58:37.561 --> 01:58:40.880
know,
looking at that shit in the 1940s or whatever the hell it was that they're

2189
01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:41.770
singing those songs.

2190
01:58:42.240 --> 01:58:42.821
<v 0>They sing those songs.</v>

2191
01:58:42.821 --> 01:58:47.680
Sixties fifties seventies sixties I think it was a 50s really?
Yeah.
Beach Boys.

2192
01:58:47.710 --> 01:58:51.700
I think that was the 50s hmm.
I'm pretty sure you know,
but yeah,

2193
01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:55.480
continue all the beach boys.
I slow it down a little.

2194
01:58:55.570 --> 01:58:59.470
I think people were stupid as fuck back then.
I think it'd be fat I'm course.

2195
01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:02.380
Sure there was a few incredibly brilliant people that were way smarter than me

2196
01:59:02.381 --> 01:59:06.190
now.
But I think for the most part,
people in the 1950s they were like children,

2197
01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:10.780
you know,
their,
their perception of the world around them,
you know,

2198
01:59:10.781 --> 01:59:13.630
and what it was like,
it was very childlike.

2199
01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:18.400
I think if I could go to one point in history and watch it unfold,

2200
01:59:18.670 --> 01:59:23.560
I would love to watch the 50s become the 60s I think that would that and

2201
01:59:23.780 --> 01:59:28.210
watching it in San Francisco,
you know,
and there during the,
you know,
the whole,

2202
01:59:28.211 --> 01:59:30.930
uh,
you know,
the asset generation and you know,

2203
01:59:30.931 --> 01:59:34.510
w what was going on back then were these huge transformation of the culture from

2204
01:59:34.511 --> 01:59:39.220
the 1950s to sixties.
What set that off?
Just like real serious shit.
Acid acid.

2205
01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:43.380
Yeah,
for sure.
Now more brow.
There was a lot,

2206
01:59:43.390 --> 01:59:47.260
Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters and Timothy leary.
You know,
Timothy Leary,

2207
01:59:47.261 --> 01:59:50.380
being a professor,
professor,
I think it was a professor at Harvard,
right?

2208
01:59:50.650 --> 01:59:53.440
And you know,
a brilliant guy,
he was a scientist,

2209
01:59:53.441 --> 01:59:57.580
so all of a sudden was advocating,
turn on,
tune in,
drop out.

2210
01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:01.690
He wanted people to take acid tune into the world.

2211
02:00:01.691 --> 02:00:04.240
They're living in and drop out of this crazy culture and society.

2212
02:00:04.241 --> 02:00:07.120
And they was saying that you don't need to,
you didn't need to do it like this,

2213
02:00:07.990 --> 02:00:10.210
you know.
And uh,
of course they locked him up

2214
02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:13.770
<v 4>and that was all coming out of San Francisco.</v>

2215
02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:14.860
<v 0>I'm going to ask San Francisco.</v>

2216
02:00:14.870 --> 02:00:17.630
It was all coming out of San Francisco and it was all coming out of grass.

2217
02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:22.790
People Smoking Weed and uh,
people doing psychedelics.
People became a more,

2218
02:00:22.791 --> 02:00:25.610
uh,
I mean,
there's the reason why I was the summer of love.
Okay?

2219
02:00:25.611 --> 02:00:29.360
There's a reason why it was,
you know,
this flower child movement.

2220
02:00:29.361 --> 02:00:32.930
It was the hippies and the flower children.
I mean that,
that's all love man.

2221
02:00:32.931 --> 02:00:37.070
That's all psychedelic enhance states of consciousness where these people had

2222
02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:42.260
reached this place where they felt connected to each other and loving each
other.

2223
02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:46.130
And this is like all the stuff that like turns Mckenna had hypothesized about

2224
02:00:46.131 --> 02:00:50.000
being the actual creation or the reason for the creation of civilization in the

2225
02:00:50.001 --> 02:00:55.001
first place is that civilization rose out of psychedelic experiences that these

2226
02:00:55.011 --> 02:00:56.400
are the,
these monkeys were having,
you know,

2227
02:00:56.450 --> 02:00:59.540
millions and millions of years ago and Graham Hancock believes the same thing as

2228
02:00:59.541 --> 02:01:00.350
well.
They,
they,

2229
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:04.730
he points to the great explosion of art and culture 50,000 years ago.

2230
02:01:04.970 --> 02:01:09.230
Like how,
uh,
people from,
from a certain point in time to today,

2231
02:01:09.231 --> 02:01:14.231
there's been this unstoppable rise of like imagery in art and language and all

2232
02:01:14.691 --> 02:01:15.470
these different things.

2233
02:01:15.470 --> 02:01:20.470
And he points to it being one of the clearer cases of when people started really

2234
02:01:21.081 --> 02:01:22.820
using psychedelics on a regular basis.

2235
02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:23.620
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2236
02:01:23.620 --> 02:01:27.290
I feel like we're at that kind of stage right now with what the Internet is an

2237
02:01:27.310 --> 02:01:31.360
apple and iTunes and you can do everything.
So we're like right there.

2238
02:01:31.361 --> 02:01:33.160
So it's either you're on board or you're not.

2239
02:01:33.161 --> 02:01:35.260
I feel like more people are on board.

2240
02:01:35.261 --> 02:01:38.650
Even conservative types or non creative types.
You know,
the iPhone,

2241
02:01:38.651 --> 02:01:40.010
everyone's got it.
Everybody's on

2242
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:44.360
<v 0>Twitter.
These aren't really,
I mean,
Facebook,
everybody's got,
yeah,
so I feel like,</v>

2243
02:01:44.450 --> 02:01:47.930
well,
I think those are psychedelic.
I think the Internet is psychedelic.
I mean,

2244
02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:50.180
I think things that break down boundaries,

2245
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:54.620
things that dissolve the boundaries between you and the rest of the world,

2246
02:01:54.650 --> 02:01:58.610
whether it's through information,
imagery,
video,
music,
whatever the fuck it is,

2247
02:01:58.611 --> 02:02:02.480
the feeling that you get from connecting to whatever art form they produce or

2248
02:02:02.481 --> 02:02:06.980
whatever words they put out there,
whatever news stories they send you,
that,

2249
02:02:07.010 --> 02:02:09.860
that energy,
that that is all very psychedelic.
It's all,

2250
02:02:10.010 --> 02:02:13.890
it's all changing the culture,
you know,
it's,

2251
02:02:13.891 --> 02:02:16.110
it's changing the way your mind works and it's,

2252
02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:20.240
it's forcing new information there.
It's a very different kind of experience.

2253
02:02:20.241 --> 02:02:23.150
But if it existed a thousand years ago,
man,

2254
02:02:23.330 --> 02:02:26.390
if you thousand years ago you could somehow or another take someone and then

2255
02:02:26.391 --> 02:02:30.080
bring them to this podcast and sit them in front of a laptop and explain what's

2256
02:02:30.081 --> 02:02:34.190
happening.
They would fucking shake uncontrollably.

2257
02:02:34.191 --> 02:02:37.240
They'd be freaking out.
They wouldn't even be able to wrap their hand around.

2258
02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:40.970
They would look at the fact that I'm watching our show on Ustream and then I

2259
02:02:40.971 --> 02:02:44.240
check my email.
Oh look,
Chris Hardwick's going to do the podcast,

2260
02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:48.560
and then I checked my Twitter and Oh yeah,
this guy's right.
I did say that wrong.

2261
02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:50.960
You know what I mean?
It's,
it's it.
This is incredible.

2262
02:02:50.990 --> 02:02:54.080
What do you think the first thing they would do?
Like Marin,
Moreau,
shit,

2263
02:02:54.081 --> 02:02:58.670
their pants.
What is this?
What is this?
You mean you can't have the answer?

2264
02:02:58.700 --> 02:03:00.500
This is magic.
Where's it coming from?

2265
02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:03.260
They would go crazy if you could get Einstein,
man,

2266
02:03:03.261 --> 02:03:06.140
if you could take Einstein and he put them today and sit them in front of a

2267
02:03:06.141 --> 02:03:10.160
computer,
I guarantee you he would just have this incredible smile on his face.

2268
02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:14.780
He'd be like,
oh,
just,
oh.
It would be,
we'd be so fucking excited about this.

2269
02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:18.020
Yeah.
To us,
it just snuck up on us.
It creeped up,
Dennis,

2270
02:03:18.200 --> 02:03:22.430
to the point where we're just accepting the fact that it exists.
I mean,
this pot.

2271
02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:26.420
Look,
we,
we,
we know the impact of this podcast.
Every time we go on the road.

2272
02:03:26.610 --> 02:03:28.880
This is the weirdest thing I've ever done ever.

2273
02:03:28.881 --> 02:03:32.920
Well we just for free put this stuff out there.
Just uh,

2274
02:03:32.960 --> 02:03:36.650
just a recording of conversations and it resonates with people.

2275
02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:39.020
Then they come to see you on the road and then you have like this whole thing

2276
02:03:39.021 --> 02:03:42.150
going on and,
and all this came out of nowhere.
It all came out of the Internet.

2277
02:03:42.170 --> 02:03:46.400
This is impossible.
Impossible.
50 years ago,
a hundred years ago.

2278
02:03:46.430 --> 02:03:50.180
All this stuff that we're doing is impossible and it's complementing the live

2279
02:03:50.181 --> 02:03:52.250
performance is a real energy to,
we're not,
you know,

2280
02:03:52.251 --> 02:03:54.590
the problem is when people are on the Internet 24 hours a day,

2281
02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:58.160
I mean you are what your iPhone of course,
but like going out and seeing people,

2282
02:03:58.210 --> 02:04:00.350
you know,
you gotta you gotta do both.

2283
02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:05.000
Well I think what podcasts do is it gives people an opportunity to really

2284
02:04:05.001 --> 02:04:08.750
interact with people about like complex subjects.
You know,

2285
02:04:08.751 --> 02:04:12.410
like we've had a bunch of different people on with a bunch of really different

2286
02:04:12.411 --> 02:04:15.870
interesting viewpoints.
You know,
some,
I agreed with some that I didn't agree,

2287
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:18.860
agree with,
but to be exposed to that many of them.

2288
02:04:19.010 --> 02:04:24.010
And to expose these really open public conversations uncensored to expose it to

2289
02:04:25.431 --> 02:04:28.370
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people.
Yeah,
I mean that's a,

2290
02:04:28.371 --> 02:04:32.750
that's a rare and unique opportunity and it's all happening because of this

2291
02:04:32.751 --> 02:04:34.280
fucking crazy intranet thing,
man.

2292
02:04:34.281 --> 02:04:37.940
And this is only going to get nutty or this isn't going to stay like it's gonna.

2293
02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:42.420
It's gonna somehow or another jump from this stupid box that you have to carry

2294
02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:45.660
around with to something that you can see in front of your eyes.

2295
02:04:45.661 --> 02:04:49.170
It's going to be like some sort of a lens that gets implanted in your eyelid.

2296
02:04:49.350 --> 02:04:49.681
I mean,

2297
02:04:49.681 --> 02:04:52.080
they're gonna figure out how to do that and have figured out how to get it down

2298
02:04:52.110 --> 02:04:53.730
and it's going to be no different than getting a tattoo.

2299
02:04:53.731 --> 02:04:54.840
It's going to be so normal.

2300
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:59.060
People are going to get these inner inner faces with a lens and you're going to

2301
02:04:59.061 --> 02:05:00.360
be able to look.
They've already designed them.

2302
02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:02.520
You can look through it and seek text on it.

2303
02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:05.220
You'd be able to communicate with it through Siri will be able to pull up

2304
02:05:05.221 --> 02:05:07.530
websites for you,
show you images,

2305
02:05:07.531 --> 02:05:10.470
or should be able to show you video stream you realtime movies.

2306
02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:13.620
You're going to be a little watch movies on your fucking fake eyelids.

2307
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:18.450
Chris Brown's taxi would be like that,
like on your eye.
Exactly.

2308
02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:20.640
But is there a time where people are going to go?
That's too much.
Like,

2309
02:05:20.641 --> 02:05:22.620
of course it is right now.
They're doing it misses those.

2310
02:05:22.620 --> 02:05:24.860
The Unabomber was saying back when he was,
uh,

2311
02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:28.110
wanting to kill all those people when he was going crazy and killing all these

2312
02:05:28.111 --> 02:05:29.940
people that were involved in technology.
He was,

2313
02:05:30.060 --> 02:05:33.750
he thought that human beings were aiding and abetting an enemy and that enemy

2314
02:05:33.751 --> 02:05:37.760
was technology and that you,
you,
these people were doing it and it was,
uh,

2315
02:05:38.070 --> 02:05:41.250
it was against the human race and he was completely fucking nuts.

2316
02:05:41.430 --> 02:05:44.880
But if you look at it and you go,
well,
where's this gonna go?
How,

2317
02:05:44.881 --> 02:05:47.370
where's this going?
I mean,
it's only going in one direction.

2318
02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:52.530
It's going more complex,
more crazy,
more invasive,
and more.

2319
02:05:53.050 --> 02:05:56.270
We're digging into each other's lives more.
We're connecting with each other.

2320
02:05:56.460 --> 02:05:59.550
Just the Facebook shit and people tagging your just to start,

2321
02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:03.990
just to start and tweeting and retweeting and you know,
all this stuff.
It's,
it's,

2322
02:06:04.520 --> 02:06:07.590
it's,
it's connecting people together more and more and more.

2323
02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:10.800
And right now it's just text and then you can control a more and more.

2324
02:06:11.130 --> 02:06:11.910
I think it's going to,

2325
02:06:11.910 --> 02:06:15.210
somehow or another it's going to make a leap from texts to the next thing and

2326
02:06:15.211 --> 02:06:16.680
that's when Shit's going to get really weird.

2327
02:06:16.681 --> 02:06:19.890
But I don't know what that next thing is.
You know,
I don't think it's video.

2328
02:06:19.891 --> 02:06:23.250
I don't think it's as simple as you recording video and you distributing video.

2329
02:06:23.251 --> 02:06:26.790
I think it's going to be some sort of a streaming image,
sort of a technology,

2330
02:06:26.791 --> 02:06:31.040
sort of like a facetime type of a thing.
But like the neck level switch,

2331
02:06:31.110 --> 02:06:33.420
it's going to get weird.
I think the next level,
you know what it's going to be.

2332
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:37.720
They develop these artificial lenses and they let you see through my eyes.
Right?

2333
02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:41.770
That's going to be fucking nuts.
Could you imagine you,

2334
02:06:41.850 --> 02:06:46.260
you tune into a guy's channel and you're literally living his life through his

2335
02:06:46.261 --> 02:06:49.470
eyes.
That'd be hi.
How fucking strangers that and not,

2336
02:06:49.590 --> 02:06:54.000
not even slightly impossible.
Not even slightly.
What if you couldn't stop it?

2337
02:06:54.001 --> 02:06:58.170
Like anybody could just be anywhere and just like,
ah,
I'm,
I hacked into Joe.

2338
02:06:58.260 --> 02:07:01.200
Let's see what's going on here.
Oh Damn.
That's a lot of poop.
Yeah.

2339
02:07:01.201 --> 02:07:03.900
What if you just broadcast it on Ustream?
I can.

2340
02:07:03.901 --> 02:07:07.530
Every channel on Ustream was like you looking in the mirror beating off.

2341
02:07:07.670 --> 02:07:11.550
How about that?
So who wants to do that?
People want someone for sure.

2342
02:07:11.580 --> 02:07:14.370
And then somebody will want to watch it and somebody will make money off it.

2343
02:07:14.400 --> 02:07:17.820
If you can think of it.
Somebody wants to do it for sure.

2344
02:07:17.880 --> 02:07:22.230
There's a lot of weird fuckers out there,
man,
but they can't do stand up.

2345
02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:24.870
Not many of them.
Uh,
right.
You know,

2346
02:07:24.930 --> 02:07:27.950
some of them can't stand up is a weird thing in it.

2347
02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:31.620
You can do it or you can't do it.
Some guys get better.
I remember,
I remember it.

2348
02:07:31.621 --> 02:07:34.170
There's a few guys you saw like that we're like open miker and you're like,

2349
02:07:34.171 --> 02:07:36.600
this guy's fucked.
He's never going to be able to just poor guy.
Yeah.

2350
02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:37.540
He just can't connect to it.

2351
02:07:37.541 --> 02:07:39.820
And then all of a sudden one day they sort of figure it out and then next thing

2352
02:07:39.821 --> 02:07:42.520
you know they're competent.
That's weird,
right?
Yeah.

2353
02:07:42.521 --> 02:07:44.560
You just keep doing it though.
Some people make it,

2354
02:07:44.740 --> 02:07:46.540
some people make it despite of themselves.

2355
02:07:46.541 --> 02:07:49.750
They just sort of figure out how to be funny.
I'd never say that.

2356
02:07:49.751 --> 02:07:53.020
Some people can't do it cause I don't know how the hell I did it.
Right.
You know,

2357
02:07:53.130 --> 02:07:55.740
I'm not exactly sure how you do it either.
You know?
I'll just do it.
Yeah.

2358
02:07:55.930 --> 02:07:58.810
You know what I mean?
Um,
I don't know.
I'm saying that other people can't do it.

2359
02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:02.200
I think they going to have to figure it out.
But that's the,
that's the,

2360
02:08:02.201 --> 02:08:04.300
you can never say that a person,
a mind,

2361
02:08:04.301 --> 02:08:07.380
a thinking human could not figure something out.
You know?

2362
02:08:07.420 --> 02:08:11.380
You just have to be fucking completely engrossed in it.
Whatever it is.
Right.

2363
02:08:11.500 --> 02:08:15.560
Yeah.
I mean,
I hear other comedians will say like,
Oh,
this guy has thousands of,

2364
02:08:15.590 --> 02:08:18.580
like it got tons of hits on the Internet,
he's popular on Youtube.

2365
02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:22.270
And then they start doing,
they start doing stand up and then people go,
oh,

2366
02:08:22.271 --> 02:08:26.680
it's not that great.
You hear that guys who make videos you mean?
Yeah,
yeah.

2367
02:08:26.681 --> 02:08:29.920
There's a lot of guys did like songs and shit and they made like funny,

2368
02:08:29.921 --> 02:08:31.840
funny little videos and they tried to go on the road.

2369
02:08:32.410 --> 02:08:36.430
I feel like if you're a stand up comedian and you're like,
hopefully you're like,

2370
02:08:36.850 --> 02:08:40.300
you think like a comedian first as opposed to a video guy.
Yeah,

2371
02:08:40.301 --> 02:08:41.021
you would think that.

2372
02:08:41.021 --> 02:08:43.900
But that's because you're like kind of a real comic and you're proud of being a

2373
02:08:43.901 --> 02:08:46.910
comic.
And you know,
I think a lot of us like Joey Diaz is very,

2374
02:08:46.911 --> 02:08:48.370
this very similar in this way too.

2375
02:08:48.371 --> 02:08:52.090
It's like he achieved his status as a comedian and he's proud.

2376
02:08:52.091 --> 02:08:55.690
He's like a gunslinger.
Right.
You know what I mean?
Like,
you know,
Joey Diaz,

2377
02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:57.580
have you talked to him about something and he'll tell you,
he's like,

2378
02:08:57.581 --> 02:09:02.230
I'm cause I'm a fucking comic.
That's how I do it.
[inaudible]
comic.

2379
02:09:02.300 --> 02:09:05.830
Yeah.
Yeah.
He goes like,
dog,
you're a comic.
He goes,
that's why all the,
you know,

2380
02:09:05.831 --> 02:09:07.530
Joey will tell you about like work.
Like he's just like,

2381
02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:09.370
that's where all these people can go fuck themselves.
They're like,

2382
02:09:09.410 --> 02:09:12.880
you can't get me to do anything I don't want to do.
I'm a fucking comic.

2383
02:09:12.881 --> 02:09:16.970
I got a job already.
You know,
I'm good at it.
I get paid well hand and he died.

2384
02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:20.350
And anybody does those videos too.
He does all that,
does everything.

2385
02:09:20.410 --> 02:09:23.420
He does everything.
But he's,
you know,
Joey Diaz will always do stand up.

2386
02:09:24.010 --> 02:09:26.360
Like he says,
what do we got Doug?
Where are we going?
He's always like,

2387
02:09:26.380 --> 02:09:29.000
he's always,
you know,
I can't do that fucking comedy and Magic Club with,

2388
02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:32.260
you're trying to get Louisville,
but I'm going to be headlining somewhere.

2389
02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:36.700
Headline to my area Improv next week.
So if you're in Miami and I,

2394
02:09:52.901 --> 02:09:56.200
The hard rock,

You ever done that one?
Florida.
I've been there,

2395
02:09:56.201 --> 02:09:59.170
but I didn't do it fucking tremendous.
Next weekend.
And then Louisville,

Hermosa beach at the comedy Magic Club,

2398
02:10:04.810 --> 02:10:08.170
all gearing up for April 20th in Atlanta and a,

2399
02:10:08.171 --> 02:10:12.130
that's going to be at the Tabernacle and the dump.
I'm super excited about that.

2400
02:10:12.131 --> 02:10:14.920
That's where I'm filming my special.
So I'm writing a lot.
Brody.

2401
02:10:14.921 --> 02:10:18.100
I'm getting crazy writing.
I mean,
the group getting it out there,

2402
02:10:18.101 --> 02:10:21.070
you're just fired up.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm motivated man.
I've been having these,

2403
02:10:21.071 --> 02:10:23.230
I did like an hour and 20 here at the Ice House the other night.

2404
02:10:23.231 --> 02:10:27.460
I'm having long sets.
Um,
I'm just,
I feel like when you,

2405
02:10:27.461 --> 02:10:31.060
when you really start working on something,
man,
he really,
uh,
get some momentum.

2406
02:10:31.061 --> 02:10:34.050
You don't want it to stop that good feeling of creating things.
It could feel

2407
02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:36.440
<v 2>of like everything in that groove.
You don't want to stop.</v>

2408
02:10:36.441 --> 02:10:39.630
You just want to keep going.
So that's where I am right now.
Fucking fire it up.

2409
02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:43.490
Prouty I want to see it time and I want to see you Saturday at my seat and

2410
02:10:43.491 --> 02:10:46.470
salads doing kettlebells.
What do you want me Saturday herb shops.

2411
02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:49.370
I want to see burpees before the show.
10.
All right,

2412
02:10:49.371 --> 02:10:52.660
I'll give you 10 hardcore burpees.
I'll give you those before the show.

2413
02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:56.870
What I want.
Like burp,
burp on his chest.
You know what a burpee is?
No,

2414
02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:59.150
it's a type of exercise.
Very explosive.

2415
02:10:59.450 --> 02:11:03.790
He dropped down into like a push up position up to your knees,
up,

2416
02:11:04.190 --> 02:11:06.680
up to your feet,
like in a squat position.
Then jumped to the sky,

2417
02:11:06.681 --> 02:11:08.060
hands up in the air,
dropped down,

2418
02:11:08.061 --> 02:11:11.360
push up position and you repeat over and over and over again until exhausted.

2419
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:15.920
I was thinking of baby burpee.
Second know done.
Burpees.
I think that's burping.

2420
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:19.400
That's called burping.
Um,
you guys have a show here Friday night.

2421
02:11:19.450 --> 02:11:23.990
At Friday night we have Doug Benson,
Joey [inaudible],
and a bunch of people.

2422
02:11:24.530 --> 02:11:28.310
Doug Benson.
Powerful.
Doug Benson,
buy tickets,
discover ideas,
but powerful.

2423
02:11:28.311 --> 02:11:31.130
Doug Benson wants us to do as podcast.
But you know what,
man,

2424
02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:34.250
I don't really give a fuck about movie trivia.
I love Doug Benson.

2425
02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:37.610
I love talking to him and I love having them do our podcast.
But you know,

2426
02:11:37.640 --> 02:11:41.720
when you start talking to like,
you know what movie was Karira MMM hmm.

2427
02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:46.100
And those are hard to hit that you want you to care.
Yeah.
That's his thing.

2428
02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:49.310
I mean this thing is,
it's a movie thing.
Doug loves movies.
I mean,
he really does.

2429
02:11:49.311 --> 02:11:50.510
He fucking loves movies.
Yeah.

2430
02:11:50.690 --> 02:11:53.450
But that would be like me having him on and only talking to MMA.

2431
02:11:53.630 --> 02:11:57.230
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
I would do it.
Doug.
Brian will do it.

2432
02:11:57.560 --> 02:12:01.460
There you go Doug.
But we'd love you dog.
That's it.

2433
02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:05.690
I think the show's over.
Brody just fell asleep on us right away.
Yes.

2434
02:12:05.691 --> 02:12:10.610
Positive Energy.
You got it.
So when can we know if we see crazy tweets,

2435
02:12:10.611 --> 02:12:13.400
when can we know you're completely off of this new stuff that you're on?

2436
02:12:13.730 --> 02:12:15.590
When is this scheduled detox?

2437
02:12:15.980 --> 02:12:18.320
<v 4>Uh,
like three more months.
Three more months.</v>

2438
02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:22.250
<v 2>Why do they have it planned out like that?
He takes like a year.
Oh,</v>

2439
02:12:22.251 --> 02:12:25.790
you have to slowly do it.
Yeah,
he's cut back.
You know,
going out on your Luda.

2440
02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:30.950
Yeah.
You cut back slowly on your dosage.
Yes.
And then there's also a secret,

2441
02:12:30.951 --> 02:12:33.950
I heard that maybe like even the last couple of months that you were off at the

2442
02:12:33.951 --> 02:12:36.350
whole time they're sugar pills.
So you got to think about bad,

2443
02:12:36.530 --> 02:12:39.320
what they might be playing mind games with you.
Who's playing mind games?

2444
02:12:39.321 --> 02:12:42.020
The government,
the government,
the government's fucking with Brody said,

2445
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:46.220
try to get to Zach Galifianakis,
alien teenage mutant Ninja Turtles.
We,

2446
02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.620
there's a bunch of cameras here,
man.
I want to explore.
There's a camera here,

2447
02:12:48.650 --> 02:12:51.460
one to explain what does his HBO Qbo Project.

2448
02:12:51.460 --> 02:12:53.380
<v 4>I shot a pilot.
They seem to like it.</v>

2449
02:12:53.381 --> 02:12:56.980
So we're going to expand on it and I'm shooting these episodes and it's a little

2450
02:12:56.981 --> 02:13:00.550
bit about me going into the next level,
you know,

2451
02:13:00.551 --> 02:13:04.510
out of getting out of warm up,
going to the next level,
becoming a stand up,

2452
02:13:04.511 --> 02:13:08.980
going on the road,
being more mature,
doing it.
And also just being funny

2453
02:13:09.620 --> 02:13:12.530
<v 2>about this.
You're doing a show about it.
I think I may be.
Yeah.</v>

2454
02:13:12.590 --> 02:13:16.210
You think you may be CD did a pilot and now you're just going to start shooting

2455
02:13:16.211 --> 02:13:17.390
shows and see if they like it.

2456
02:13:17.550 --> 02:13:20.370
<v 4>Well,
there's scripts.
There's loose scripts.
It's based on,
there's one,</v>

2457
02:13:20.371 --> 02:13:22.110
it's about me getting back into comedy.

2458
02:13:22.111 --> 02:13:24.630
I'm working my way back and I'm doing a set on Conan,

2459
02:13:24.631 --> 02:13:28.590
so I'm working my way back in from that.
We document a little bit of my,
uh,

2460
02:13:28.650 --> 02:13:32.070
my meltdown that I had and how you can

2461
02:13:32.070 --> 02:13:36.900
<v 1>come back for many thing,
positive energy,
exercising,
getting back to the valley.</v>

2462
02:13:36.901 --> 02:13:41.190
Then have some fantasy segments or some scripted comedy.
Talk to my mom.

2463
02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:44.340
<v 2>We like you're writing like a Unicorn in.
Yeah.
What is going on?</v>

2464
02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:47.510
Are you in Narnia?
Um,
what is it going to be called?

2465
02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:52.000
<v 1>I think it's so far they're running titles,
all things,
Brody.
All things Brody.</v>

2466
02:13:52.001 --> 02:13:54.560
Sounds good.
Yeah.
So keeping it generic,

2467
02:13:55.100 --> 02:14:00.100
<v 2>be able to handle the waterfall of hot girls that want to have sex with you</v>

2468
02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:03.280
after you become a television star.
Hbo.
Yeah.
I get your leftovers.

2469
02:14:03.310 --> 02:14:06.640
Can I be better?
You will be the next entourage.
Is that possible?

2470
02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:10.910
<v 1>I'm not saying it's,
I mean it's possible.
I'm not saying it's probable,</v>

2471
02:14:11.710 --> 02:14:13.750
<v 2>but it's possible.
I suppose you feel it.</v>

2472
02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:18.520
I'm feeling good thing sometimes wave wave about the wash over Brody and ways of

2473
02:14:18.521 --> 02:14:22.000
success.
I'm feeling that women's tongues.
Yes.

2474
02:14:22.060 --> 02:14:24.700
You could have a lot of threesomes or you're not going to do a three term thing.

2475
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:26.200
I would do a threesome.

2476
02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:28.270
Do you think you'd get a driver or will you drive yourself around?

2477
02:14:30.350 --> 02:14:33.680
I thought about a driver right there.
Mansion in the hills?
No,
just make them.

2478
02:14:34.310 --> 02:14:35.510
Girls can like stay at your place.

2479
02:14:35.540 --> 02:14:38.000
They'll keep it cool when you're gone and a lot of them are homeless.

2480
02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:41.960
We'll ever sing in a townhouse in the valley.
Townhouse in the valley.
Dude,

2481
02:14:41.961 --> 02:14:43.820
you're going to have a mansion in the hills.
You're going to be on HBO.

2482
02:14:43.821 --> 02:14:47.990
You're going to be huge.
You think I can.
Why couldn't you would?

2483
02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:52.300
Where does Corey Haim live?
He's not alive and heaven cause he done.
Okay.

2484
02:14:52.850 --> 02:14:53.683
Bad example.

2485
02:14:55.870 --> 02:15:00.160
<v 1>I gotta believe Joel.
I mean I'm unbelieving.
Yeah,
he's not with us anymore.</v>

2486
02:15:00.800 --> 02:15:04.390
You've got to believe what I got to believe it.
And I do believe,
believe in love.

2487
02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:08.970
Yeah,
love is a good thing.
I don't listen to the news.
He believes me.

2488
02:15:10.070 --> 02:15:14.740
Um,
I know I'm fucked up.
I know I'm not perfect.
Who's coming?

2489
02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:17.620
Who's not fucked up?
Anybody who's not fucked up.
Isn't that interesting?

2490
02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:20.920
All right,
good.
Yeah,
and I'm channeling into comedy channel at Brody.

2491
02:15:20.980 --> 02:15:24.310
I'm channeling it and I'm telling you like you've been a big positive supporter

2492
02:15:24.311 --> 02:15:25.420
in my life.
I'm not kidding.

2493
02:15:25.460 --> 02:15:27.710
<v 2>Listen,
man,
I don't think it's possible in this world.</v>

2494
02:15:27.711 --> 02:15:30.110
If you're paying attention to not be fucked up because the whole world is

2495
02:15:30.111 --> 02:15:31.820
contradictory,
the whole world makes no sense.

2496
02:15:31.821 --> 02:15:35.000
We're in fucking wars that make no sense.
The war on drugs make no sense.

2497
02:15:35.001 --> 02:15:38.120
Politics make no sense.
Representative government make no sense.

2498
02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:40.850
None of it makes sense of special interest groups doesn't make any sense.

2499
02:15:40.851 --> 02:15:43.990
The amount of taxes you pay doesn't make any sense.
The amount of oil cost,

2500
02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:47.210
the fact that oil is the only way we've fucking power this whole thing.

2501
02:15:47.211 --> 02:15:49.520
That doesn't make any sense either.
What do we need to do when you run out?

2502
02:15:49.550 --> 02:15:53.180
None of this shit makes sense.
Brody.
If you are paying attention,

2503
02:15:53.181 --> 02:15:56.480
you gotta be a little crazy just to get through it.
You've got to be a little,

2504
02:15:56.481 --> 02:15:58.880
not to beat a little explosive,
a little,

2505
02:15:58.970 --> 02:16:01.910
just wanting to burst out of your fucking skin at every moment.

2506
02:16:01.911 --> 02:16:05.000
You pay attention to this crazy life we live.
You have to be fucked up.

2507
02:16:05.190 --> 02:16:08.160
<v 1>Yeah.
And I'm like,
it's a fucked up world.
It's a fucked up world.</v>

2508
02:16:08.190 --> 02:16:11.430
But we're in it and positive energy,
positive energy,

2509
02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:16.110
hard knock life for us.
And I'm following my instincts.

2510
02:16:16.111 --> 02:16:20.460
People seem to like what I'm doing.
So I'm doing it,
I'm learning it.

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:51.850
talked a lot of shit and then recorded it and then put it out there and no one

2538
02:17:51.851 --> 02:17:54.550
downloaded it ever.
That would not be fun.

2539
02:17:54.910 --> 02:17:57.880
What's fun is there's so many fucking people out there doing it.

That's my tee shirt company.
People keep asking me about it and I never promoted,

2549
02:18:29.860 --> 02:18:34.240

uh,
cool shit.
A lot of monkeys and mushrooms and a lot of stuff.

2550
02:18:34.241 --> 02:18:36.780
Very juvenile.
But that's me.
I'm very juvenile.

That's where there's a lot of monkeys as astronauts to it somehow.

2553
02:18:42.430 --> 02:18:44.860
That's a good idea,
dude.
I like what you thinking serious.

2554
02:18:44.861 --> 02:18:48.940
Should have monkeys with big tits.
Yes.
Huge big nipples.
Okay.

Is that crazy or not?
Jesus fucking Christ.
All right.
Goodnight.
