00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.367
NARRATOR: September 11,
2001, terror strikes

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:11.300
set the tone for warfare
in the 21st century.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.467
But the 21st century
has also seen the rise

00:00:13.467 --> 00:00:15.400
of another kind of warfare--

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.200
warfare that lets
nations and loners

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.500
do battle without guns or bombs.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.667
These days, the
biggest threat we face

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:24.166
may be a rogue
actor with a laptop

00:00:24.166 --> 00:00:25.734
and a desire to wreak havoc.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:34.433
Cyberwarfare is probably
the greatest challenge

00:00:34.433 --> 00:00:37.166
that we have as
far as our nation's

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.000
national security is concerned.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.500
We have an advantage over
every other form of competition

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.667
with possible allies except
one, and that is cyberwarfare.

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:51.667
And when you see the
potential of what

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:54.633
a successful
cyber-attack can achieve,

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:58.834
it's enough to make
you deeply concerned.

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:01.166
This is going to be
the new battlefield--

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.900
an unseen invisible
battlefield--

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.500
where teams of hackers from
various nations will duel.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.600
In 2010, a computer
virus named "Stuxnet"

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.934
demolished a secret Iranian
nuclear weapons plant.

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:17.533
Hackers at Symantec Corporation
unraveled its mysteries.

00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:24.934
What made Stuxnet different
was it didn't just stick

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:28.200
to the cyber world, it actually
reached and caused sort

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.533
of real world kinetic damage.

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:36.066
It's nothing that we
had ever seen before.

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:39.433
And so Stuxnet just began
spreading all around the world

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.533
onto Windows
machines everywhere.

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.533
But what it was doing
was, it was also

00:01:47.533 --> 00:01:48.967
looking for something else.

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:51.066
It was looking for these
things that are called PLCs,

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:54.400
or these small computers that
control things like factories,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.567
like the power grid.

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:01.900
What you see here is the
code that is put on to the PLC,

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.767
and this is the normal process
code goes on to the PLC

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:08.967
turns the PLC on or
off and controls it.

00:02:08.967 --> 00:02:12.266
When we first got the code,
it's literally zeros and ones.

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.066
It's sort of unintelligible.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:17.533
It was only later that we were
able to determine that actually

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.166
this code was targeted,
specifically, at Iran's uranium

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:23.266
enrichment plant in Natanz.

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:24.834
LIAM O'MURCHU: Uranium
enrichment facilities

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:26.233
are very secure facilities.

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:27.700
It's not like they're
connected to the internet.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.133
You can't get your code
in and out in that way.

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:31.767
So one of the ways
that Stuxnet was

00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:34.667
able to get into the
facility was via USB key.

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:36.834
So it was able to
infect USB keys,

00:02:36.834 --> 00:02:38.767
and then somebody would
bring the USB key with them

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:41.734
into the secure facility not
realizing it was infected,

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:44.734
plug into a computer inside,
and then that computer

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:46.500
inside would be infected.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.100
We don't know definitively
who is behind Stuxnet,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:50.734
but it's very clear that
it's a nation state,

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:54.233
and it's nation states that
had something against Iran,

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:57.567
and it's likely that it
isn't a single nation state.

00:02:57.567 --> 00:03:02.066
And remember, as well, with
cyberwarfare that the barrier

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:04.667
to entry is quite low.

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.266
If a country wants
to do something

00:03:06.266 --> 00:03:08.734
like build a nuclear
missile, that's actually

00:03:08.734 --> 00:03:11.467
quite difficult. But when
you talk about something

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:15.000
like cyberwarfare, it's actually
quite cheap and quite easy

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.333
for a country to
develop a cyber weapon,

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.533
and that cyber weapon can
have equivalent effects.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.367
You can have a cyber
weapon potentially

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.266
shut down the power
grid, for example,

00:03:23.266 --> 00:03:24.633
on the whole east coast.

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.300
New York is out.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.367
Wall Street is out.

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:33.467
All your banks are out.

00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:35.033
You can't even withdraw money.

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:36.400
You can imagine people--

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.967
panic starting-- and
people trying to get cash.

00:03:38.967 --> 00:03:39.800
You can't get cash.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.400
ATMs aren't working.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.500
And then things like your water
waste and treatment plants

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.133
aren't working,
so no clean water.

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:46.500
There's going to
be a run on stores.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.934
Stores potentially
aren't even operating.

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:50.200
Your credit card is not
going to work at the store.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.233
There will be
absolutely mass panic.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.367
If you can blind
the US military--

00:03:57.367 --> 00:04:01.500
if you could shut down our
GPS and our computer networks,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.300
our military is basically
unable to function.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.166
And it could take days or
weeks to get those systems

00:04:07.166 --> 00:04:09.100
back up and running.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.667
They can do tremendous damage.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:14.100
They can defeat your armies,
your fleets, your Air Forces,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.867
by simply blinding
them-- by taking

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:17.367
down their cyber systems.

00:04:17.367 --> 00:04:21.633
I think that's a huge
risk that we face.

00:04:21.633 --> 00:04:24.367
With cyberwar, I always think
one of the most effective ways

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:29.266
to fighting in cyber, is to find
the computer and the operator

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:32.100
and put a bullet
through both of them.
