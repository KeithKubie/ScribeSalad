Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:01          All right, great. You're listening to radio, the podcast from New York public radio and public radio. W. Y. C

Speaker 1:          00:12          n n p. R. Hello Chad here every, this is radio lab, the podcast coming to you now with, uh, not one of our big hour long situations, but rather one of those in-betweens that we do, uh, between seasons. Our next season is about two months off and one of the programs that we're going to be presenting is about people who fall in love with science and then fall out of love with science. And in that spirit we thought we'd play a conversation for you now, which is more on the falling in love side. Robert Krulwich, my esteemed cohost, who you are here in just a moment, recently interviewed maybe one of the greatest scientists alive, really e o Wilson. He is a biologist. He's an entomologist, meaning he studies bugs. He's an author, a world famous conservationist. He recently started the, um, encyclopedia of life, which tries to make a list of every single species on the planet. Pea discovered so many things about how animals communicate, which you'll hear in a moment, particularly ants. And, uh, if you heard our emergence show, you will recognize a bit, uh, from that show that repeats in this conversation. But it's really cool to hear the whole conversation that too many edits, which is where I'm going to play for you now.

Speaker 2:          01:34          So here it is. Here's Robert Chromebooks speaking with e o Wilson at the 92nd Street y here in Manhattan. I see. I prefer to, for starters, I'm just curious. Um, what did you know, do you remember the moment when you said the word scientist? Comma, I want to be one, not shy, I guess anthem biologist. You know, I just wanted to work on that entomologist blog. Oh yes. When I was about eight or nine, I discovered that there were people who actually made their living, uh, chasing bugs. Uh, and, uh, you know, I, I every kid has a bug period. I've just set now, I'll never to grow out of mine. Your right of what you said. And I, uh, down in Alabama we had, uh, people who are driving around in green trucks for the Department of Agriculture and Sullivan were exterminating intersects and I, they were made their living by finding and studying bugs. I said, well, that's what I want to do. Nevermind being a fireman or anything like that. I don't want to do that. Kill by. I was, yeah, I was, uh, uh, I was frozen in that, uh, in that ambition at the age of seven, five, eight or nine or nine when I really shuttled down four with [inaudible]. Okay.

Speaker 2:          02:49          Now did, did, did science sees you or did science rescue you cause you were you, how many schools did you go to before you were the, of 14 or whenever it was? Ah, yeah, it was about, uh, 13 or 14 schools and 11 grade. I skipped one grade. Well that made me always the runt of the class, which didn't help see what the run social skills and new kid every, a new kid in the neighborhood. Yeah. So that means what now? Do you have a choice here? You could be the class clown or something, or you could go off into the forest and make friends with a worm or something like that. Well, yeah, I guess that's the way of looking at it. Uh, I turned into, um, nature in the woods and so on. And then I discovered that this extra intricity made me a socially acceptable in an odd way.

Speaker 2:          03:41          So I had the nickname bugs when I was in my grammar school hanging, but then I had a snake period as snake period. And, uh, this was in southern Alabama, I guess I was about 15 or 16 by that time and there were about 40 species of snake sound down there. And then a period of time, about a year, I managed to find them all. I kept a lot of them in the back yard alive. And so I was now known as Snake Wilson. Uh, it wasn't because in this intense football culture, I went out for football at this point, uh, at the Bruton high school in Alabama and I weighed 112 pounds. I was second light as kid there probably couple of snakes. Have you [inaudible] story. I A I, you're a tough competitor anyway. I, uh, so, uh, it turns out your three, there was, uh, there were 23 people on the squad and I was entire third string.

Speaker 2:          04:45          But anyway, I got respect in part because, uh, I was doing all these strange things and, and uh, Alabamians are really, uh, they're really very tolerant of eccentricity. They kinda like it, you know, the old odd, the aunt that lives up in the attic and you know, that Kinda thing. I got along very well, uh, both as a naturalist, you know, fanatical collector and naturalist at the [inaudible] then in high school to any rate. Um, so I, at the age of 16, I decided that the time had come to get serious about professional with the biology. And so, uh, I decided to select the group of insects to study and I said flies. They have marvelous, tremendous diversity. And so I would start collecting flies. I wanted to become the world expert on slides, but the year was 1945. And in order to study flies, as many of you understand, you have to have insect pins, special pins to put through the body of the specimens.

Speaker 2:          05:54          It'll still, insect pins are were available at that time only from checklists of Akio and the supply had been cut off in the United States in check. Pins were unavailable. So I said, what's my favorite group of insects? You know, I don't have to stick pins through and that the ants, so I got started my collection by going down to the drugstore and collecting these little pill bottles and that was rubbing alcohol, which is ICO protocol. Alcohol got massed in my collection started. I built a large collection of events that I took with me to the University of Alabama.

Speaker 3:          06:33          Could you say that launched, but for the permit that for lack of pins and for the availability of rubbing alcohol, therefore ants or wears aunts always going to be it and you would've gotten to it by whatever route or,

Speaker 2:          06:45          well, I think I eventually would've ended up with anch, but I would've been retarded there. I don't think I would've been able to do serious research until maybe I was

Speaker 3:          06:56          Jean. Um, now let's get onto the joy of, of this may not be obvious to other people. The joy of an studies cause you know if you think about it, they do seem like somewhat indifferent to anyone that was observing them and so on and that you might not wonder exactly why somebody would get delight out of looking at ants. But I want to take you back to one moment, which I think is one of my favorites ever. The question is how do these little ants communicate with one another? The year is 1953 and you're considering the problem. We know that at least for us, most of our communication goes because of things we hear or things we see. This does not seem to be the habit of ants. So you have some fire ants and the question is you noticed that they, that a scout will go find a piece of food and somehow tell the other mans, look what I found. Come here and get the food. How do you figure out how the scout aunt tells the other aunts were that a, there is food and where it is. We had the idea,

Speaker 2:          07:57          even back then people did biologists that the ads were somehow laying a trail down and then they were telling the other ants go out and follow that trail. But nobody knew where the trail came from. And I didn't know really how it worked and I didn't know how ants communicated otherwise. And you're perfectly right. Human beings are really unusual along with birds. They, we are audio visual and, and uh, and that puts us in a tiny minority of all of the creatures on earth, which are primarily chemical in their communication. It wasn't understood or appreciated at that time. Pheromones in many of you who've heard the word pheromones, pheromones are the key to understand the communication of the vast majority of the animals species. We didn't know it then. And uh, so, uh, one day I set out, I was culturing fire ranch than in the laboratory at Harvard and I said, I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

Speaker 2:          08:56          And the way I did it was to, uh, dissect these tiny, tiny, it's very difficult to do, but I just selected them and we just say [inaudible] so you're watching the aunt going along and it's laying on its abdomen or some part of its body is mainly off the ground. That's right. I can see the ant running along and under magnification I can see that it's sticking out sting and dragging the thing. Something's coming out of that sting, like kind of like a fountain pen or something through little bit like that. Yeah. And uh, so, uh, I proceed to, um, believe me folks, this is the way science goes. I mean, it really is simple minded. It's only later when you're doing the technical paper, you know, and you're producing the mathematical models and you're describing the micro analysis and so on that it looks tough.

Speaker 2:          09:45          It's really, this is the way of thinking when you're doing something. So I said, I'm going to find out what the organs are inside this hat and I'm going to track down where that stuff is coming from. So what I did was to do and that to me, and then, uh, you know, just detected, I knew approximately what the different glands were and so on, when you snip, you snipped off the part where the glands, where you see there, well you just detect open or you opened it, you know, and, and uh, and just the way you would in the animal or it's exceedingly difficult when it's about the size of a great assault. That's the tough part. But anyway, aren't your hands going [inaudible] well, yes, your hands is vibrating. And in fact, it was down at the limit. I didn't go to a micro manipulator, you know, which is when you're doing it with me and controlled.

Speaker 2:          10:31          And, uh, I did it raw manually, but it was right at the limit. So the way I did it was I got these very fine needles in, uh, and because there was this inevitable vibration in your hand, you can see it when you put it in a microscope. Everybody has it. It's a little vibration, but the highly magnified it. Uh, it allowed me to use a needle like a Jack Hammer. I could jack it. I could do it if I did it just right. You know, and just open up the anthem. Anyway, I took out the various organs, one after the other, and I made a preparation and I made an artificial trail and we waited a second. Make strains, follow this. You know, I've got like six organs and you've got the smooshed each one of the six organs and then you're going to take, let me just see if I remember this.

Speaker 2:          11:16          You're going to take a a sharpened Birchwood applicator stick. Yes. And then I smeared out one organ after another. No effect. Well, where are there ants? Are there answers? Yes. You have brought in. Why? I'm leading, I'm leading my artificial trails from the colony that I have in the lab, so they're ants over here. You got your birch stick here and you're drawing lines of gut stuff, I guess basically what it is. Yeah, just an or different organs. I've watched each one in turn and then smeared it out. And finally I came to a little finger shaped organ, which we didn't know the function of his at the tiny little thing talk down there and I mirrored that out and incredible. It wasn't, I didn't have to tell them to follow that trail. They exploded out of them. This running along that thing. And does that mean like if you'd taken the stick, could you go, did you, did you, did you do it when all the wheels would go droop, do, do, do, do, do, do. Well I what I actually have, I started playing around with this. It was so effective for demonstrations. I would write my name and a column of 102 hundred three a hundred ants would come pouring out back and forth and they'd actually write my name and I am so, well that was the beginning. I, you know, just to show that there is some seriousness to this. That was the beginning and we were able to defended aunt lovers. We were in the roof.

Speaker 3:          12:41          Alright, now I want to finish this little section because this is my favorite story of all. When you get bad, you get bad. This is once you begin to figure out how these chemicals and the fear and the smells that they give off the com communicating devices, you discover that when an aunt dies, this doesn't happen to be exactly in a category. One man dies, aunts not being the smartest creatures around. It just sorta dies and it just sits there and for the first day or two, all the other ants just don't even notice it. And then, and when the deans to decompose, it begins to give off a smell and then the first time it gives off a smell. I guess the next ant that passes by goes whoa. And says we have a dead aunt here. And he takes the hand and puts it in the dead place, I guess the aunt.

Speaker 2:          13:25          Yeah, dead place. Yeah. I'll tell you about the experiment because I had a lot of fun with it, but first, but let me show you that my chemist colleagues and I quickly worked out that the chemical code of the ants, we found somewhere, or a good part of it, we found that the answer communicating somewhere between 10 and with tens of 20 chemical signals, they have glands all over their bodies as at the functions which were unknown. And many of these glands produce pheromones, you know, some for two alarms, some the recruit, some to identify themselves as a member of a cast and so on.

Speaker 3:          14:01          And one of them says, I am dead.

Speaker 2:          14:02          I am, I'm coming to that. Uh, well how does an ant, when it dies, how is it identified as you say, you know, the others know when an aunt dies then for a while it just lives there. You know, if we fall, wish all one of us just lying on the ground like this, we'd probably do something. Maybe not do it in New York, but I mean usually we do something because you know, we're audio, we're audio visual. But in the case of the ads in New York, most aunt likes city in America. Anyway, go ahead Eddie. Right. The um, so the aunt against the decompose, and I was really going crazy with this. We were still successful. I mean, we were making one discovery after another. It was wonderful. And uh, I was going crazy with the show. I said, how does an an identify a corpse?

Speaker 2:          14:59          It's got to be in this, the substances that are being produced by decomposition, it's gotta be, and in those days we had just hit upon animal behaviors, generally had just hit upon the idea assigned stimuli that animals don't grasp a whole lot of stimuli the way we do, you know, an assess the gestalt in a variety of signals when they usually work out of one substance or a very small number of substances or a site, and then that, that releases their a complex behavior. So I was going to find that. What's the corpse substance? It turns out, well, this is how science works across. It turned out that for some reason I never found out. The chemist had already identified a large number of decomposition substances in rotting insects. And so with that as my guide, I gathered in pure form on my laboratory shelf, a whole variety of them.

Speaker 2:          16:04          Uh, and uh, the place for a while filled like a combination between a, uh, an outhouse and a choroidal house. Cause there were, you send me the smells, you'd have rotten spit smell that know rancid body smell. Yeah. That's uh, that's uh, the uh, uh, fatty acids that you have in volume. When we were walking up the corridor at your, in your building, what did they like stay? I never tried to explain to them. Uh, but there was, it was, it was a, a very strange smelling place. Uh, you know, skate coal with, uh, one of the comments. That's, that's the essence of theses. Yes. Well, any rate. I then started with my, you know, a typical experiment. I started dobbing dummy aunts with tiny, tiny amounts of these different substances and observing and nothing happened until finally I came to one of the substances oleic acid who leak acid is a fatty acid of a particular kind.

Speaker 2:          17:07          Bingo. The, uh, then picked it up and the dummy with nothing, but the only signal they had was a leak acid and a took it and dropped that dummy on the refuse pounds. And so I had it and essentially had it. Now here's where you get bad. Ah, yeah, that's a trait. Okay, well, you know, you get to play around at this point. So I said what would happen if I put a Lia, cast it on a live amp? What happens is that nothing, this aunt says, if they said anything, you know, nothing. The ad does, uh, does any good because now it is a course and the other ants pick this live kicking ant and I'll, it goes and it's dropped on the refuse path. So it's a weekly, obviously alive and perfectly healthy and the other aunts thinking, you're dead, you're dead, you're dead all the way to the great bye.

Speaker 2:          18:01          Goodbye. What happened then was that the ant would, uh, proceed to clean itself, answer, always cleaning themselves and finally, but if it didn't clean itself enough when it got back, picked it up and brought out til finally as clean enough and then it can reenter the realm of the living of I you have one sometimes describe the process of science as you do it as, as a form of story telling. [inaudible] what did you mean by that? Well, I mean I think it's everyone here understands that, um, human beings are the storytelling species. We, the way we think is a narrative. You know, we built, we build scenarios forward hole and we, when we're making a decision, we're running one scenario. After another forward, we're telling a story to our shows. I'm going to do this, that will then that will follow and joins. What? We'll probably do this and, and I will lose that, or, oh, gain this or I will finish that.

Speaker 2:          18:56          And they tell stories of real past what happened to me. And then of course, this allows them to make fictional stories. Uh, the scientist tell stories and he hopes it will be true stories. He's thinking, oh, there's this, there's that, uh, this creature is doing this. That creature must be detecting this or have a bald instruction way. And then they make you make a series of story and these are called hypotheses. And the fancy term then for doing science by storytelling is a, the method of multiple competing hypotheses. And then you figure, you do the experiments to find out which of the two, which of the stories is true
