What's wrong with this picture is that we're missing a whole extra pair of

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.189
chromosomes. If you remember a couple exercises ago, we said that there are 46

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.870
chromosomes total. Well, here, if each pair has two chromosomes, and we go up

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.570
to pair 22, 22 times 2 is 44.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.510
But we know that there should be 46 chromosomes, so where is the 23rd pair?
