00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.360
EMILY: He basically just
said five minute

00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.610
presentation on the topic.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.880
And then the day we were
doing it, he was like,

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.845
this is very important.

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:07.040
This is serious stuff.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.860
And we're like, oh.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.420
Oops.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:40.465
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:40.465 --> 00:00:43.710
GUEST SPEAKER: Science isn't
just about doing experiments.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.170
The students have to learn
to talk about them too.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.980
Why?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.984
Because one day, any one
of them might win this.

00:00:52.984 --> 00:00:55.920
JOHN DOLHUN: You will be giving
oral presentations in

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.560
this course.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.350
And they start next Friday.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.340
Seven of you will be
going next Friday.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.319
And seven of you will be going
the following week.

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:09.880
So you'll be preparing a five
minute oral delivery on some

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.258
aspect that we'll
assign to you.

00:01:13.258 --> 00:01:15.260
GUEST SPEAKER: Let's see how
the first group does.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.590
JOHN DOLHUN: Now today we're
going to go through seven of

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.750
your presentations.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.740
This is serious business.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.730
You get scored for this.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.340
EMILY: My topic was solvent
choices and techniques for

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.060
single crystal determination.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.310
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:36.850
FRED: It's like a mathematical
puzzle.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.880
Any questions?

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.620
JOHN DOLHUN: Could you show
us your spectrum and your

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.810
interpretation of the peaks?

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.790
JASON: Dr. Dolhun was very
disappointed in a lot of

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.780
people's presentations.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.880
People would conclude, and then
they would ask if there

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:00.790
are any questions.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.690
And Dr. Dolhun would be the
first one on there.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:03.470
He's like, yeah.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.970
And he spits out the question he
gave them in the beginning.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.070
JOHN DOLHUN: Your topic
was solvent choices.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.120
Your topic was vacuum
distillation problems.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.360
So can you draw a grid
on the board?

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.655
It came out as crystals.

00:02:14.655 --> 00:02:17.810
How much of those solutions
did you use?

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.550
So could you tell us some
of the problems?

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:20.610
You have all those.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.450
Show us which solvents you
actually went through.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.440
EMILY: Um.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.900
FRED: Um.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.600
JASON: Um.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.544
DAN: Um.

00:02:27.544 --> 00:02:28.016
ROO-RA: Um.

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:29.904
PAUL: Um.

00:02:29.904 --> 00:02:30.546
IKE: I'm sorry.

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:33.755
I thought I was supposed
to do the NMR.

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:34.990
GUEST SPEAKER: What happened?

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.240
EMILY: Professor Dolhun didn't
tell us beforehand to focus

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.200
more on our results from
our experiments.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.010
So he was disappointed.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.330
FRED: I wasn't too sure what
the instructions were.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.330
So now that I know that he
wanted us to analyze our own

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.700
data, I definitely would have
done that a lot more.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.530
It was mostly improvised.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.890
I didn't prepare that much
because I was out with friends

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.630
last night.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.840
PAUL: I did everything right.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.670
It just wasn't a great
presentation.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.890
ANTHONY: I'm glad I didn't go
today, because it was nice to

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.430
see what he wanted.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.240
I guess there was
some confusion.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.690
But now I know exactly
what he wants.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.395
So I can give it to
him next week.

00:03:13.395 --> 00:03:16.140
PHIL: It was clear who put time
into the talk and clear

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.315
who didn't.

00:03:18.315 --> 00:03:21.950
EMILY: Next week the people
going will do a lot better.

00:03:24.872 --> 00:03:26.570
GUEST SPEAKER: Emily's right.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.820
They do.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.500
And Dr. Dolhun is impressed.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.475
The students really
turned it around.

00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:39.668
JOHN DOLHUN: So these were
actually very, very good.

00:03:39.668 --> 00:03:41.156
Very well done.

00:03:41.156 --> 00:03:42.644
I'm very, very happy.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.770
JASON: I didn't do so well.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.420
Oh my gosh, did I
talk too fast?

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.550
I need to take a public
speaking class next.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.350
JULIE: I did say that, yeah.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:10.150
