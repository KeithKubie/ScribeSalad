00:00:00.538 --> 00:00:02.735
My name is
Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon.

00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:05.068
This poem is called “Migration.”

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.675
“If I see something happening
which I like,

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.511
I let it happen...”
-Jacob Lawrence

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:14.313
“If it’s love flowing freely,

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.150
I’m ready.”
-Tracy Chapman

00:00:18.016 --> 00:00:20.016
Black is an ardor.

00:00:20.343 --> 00:00:23.456
Color moving as
wholeness—

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.825
yellow migrates blouse to light

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:29.361
handle to bell green

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:32.450
migrates button to satchel to wall

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:35.201
blue migrates coat to sea

00:00:35.336 --> 00:00:38.803
to night
sky—finds an order.

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:41.306
Black is
an ardor

00:00:41.675 --> 00:00:45.145
of smokestack cirrus bird flight

00:00:45.278 --> 00:00:47.278
blanket
boll stem.

00:00:47.715 --> 00:00:50.760
Against spike head
slipper

00:00:50.983 --> 00:00:54.453
judge robe noose rope—: Hair.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.523
Fatback sliced on a table

00:00:57.656 --> 00:01:00.326
is a block
of pink stripes falling

00:01:00.495 --> 00:01:02.661
open as a story’s pages

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:05.198
bout to be sliced and served.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.368
Please, pass me the last bit

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:12.071
of summer. August’s green
glide

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.573
into overlays of gold

00:01:14.708 --> 00:01:17.210
shivers of goldenrod borders

00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:20.513
against a shirring sun-gilt pond.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.848
Here I sit.

00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:26.586
See
if you can’t find Jacob’s process

00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:29.030
in the snake-anxious way

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:32.691
I crossed the grass
to get at shade—

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:36.276
I’m still southern—
in the silver grey whisper

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:39.398
of underleaf
the breeze brings up.

00:01:40.001 --> 00:01:43.836
Green is a table
upon which that narrative

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.858
of pig
and hunger sits until green

00:01:47.991 --> 00:01:52.411
is the sky at the top of
a labor camp stairwell

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:56.883
holding the moon. Or
is green the door

00:01:57.018 --> 00:02:00.353
the yellow
moon a large bright knob

00:02:00.488 --> 00:02:03.523
to turn to exit these quarters?

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:07.226
If yellow is a question—:

00:02:07.538 --> 00:02:12.050
of travel of red
of orange alerts—:

00:02:12.183 --> 00:02:16.403
key suddenly
something from the bottom of the pond

00:02:16.805 --> 00:02:21.250
something as simple as caution
or koi—:

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.901
at first one giant
one.

00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:29.615
Then
the vibrancy beneath the surface splits.

00:02:29.885 --> 00:02:34.821
Its forty fish making that orange
glide == divide.

00:02:35.358 --> 00:02:39.358
I realize—
and one flips its silver-bellied self

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:43.630
out of the water— praise my recognition—
belied.

00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:48.268
I’m dying to say each soul
almost isosceles

00:02:48.405 --> 00:02:51.436
in her flair, in his onward press

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.908
slants in slant rhyme
to Mississippi’s mouth—:

00:02:56.641 --> 00:02:59.478
if I’m lying
I’m dying to count

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.830
every dropped leaf
every spent petal

00:03:02.963 --> 00:03:04.963
towards black potential—:

00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:08.755
say pre-
historic swamp heat—

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:11.771
black process burns

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:14.928
a fossil fuel. Say
peat—

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:16.563
to make a seam—

00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:21.735
the total black pealing
outside St. Louis all week

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.105
beneath a hard blue
repetition—:

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.241
young black men
dealt death ==

00:03:28.586 --> 00:03:29.676
unseemly.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:33.311
What’s true about this man at 23?

00:03:33.446 --> 00:03:36.381
He’s gone: to books in fall,

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:38.816
to studio
in spring

00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:41.520
gessoing boards with Gwendolyn

00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:44.823
with whiting
and rabbit skin glue to keep

00:03:44.956 --> 00:03:47.960
the fibers of a story in his head

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:50.430
set when it’s cooled and dried.

00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:54.066
He moves to set
its rhythms to a palette

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.236
set its tones
in casein colors.

00:03:58.105 --> 00:04:01.040
What it means to move—:
prepare.

00:04:01.238 --> 00:04:04.343
Then let the living thing beneath
a scene

00:04:04.478 --> 00:04:08.348
still breathing breathe, as memory does,

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.185
alive, beneath the egg, and milk,

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:13.820
and pigment—:

00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:17.993
Four hours in the street a body lies

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.603
between dimensions—: Jacob’s :— north

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.166
whose figment
the finished :— panels draw him—:

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:30.103
south :— he flies...

00:04:32.238 --> 00:04:34.840
Write about movement
where it is most still.

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:39.178
Black
is arduous: in riot a raised baton

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:43.283
in burning
building what’s behind the cracked window.

00:04:43.883 --> 00:04:47.853
The SWAT van that appeared suddenly
and sat for twenty minutes

00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:52.091
outside your house drove
you from porch to pond.

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:56.061
You wondered where a sister
might find some peace

00:04:56.195 --> 00:05:00.300
though you know
you never use the word sister like that.

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:04.803
You wrote where I sister
might find some peace

00:05:04.936 --> 00:05:06.406
then revised
it.

00:05:06.871 --> 00:05:09.676
You’re telling the truth—a correction.

00:05:10.158 --> 00:05:12.311
The I in you corrects.

00:05:12.648 --> 00:05:15.915
It rises like something from the
deep.

00:05:16.485 --> 00:05:18.851
You’re not even at the pond anymore

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.386
but still you want to feel outside

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.291
like you want to
write rise over run.

00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:30.396
Like water you’re in a rush
to work some delta in

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.165
if you’re me

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:35.098
Dirt moves you.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.836
In music the dirty
writhes you

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.206
further into this writing—

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.876
prof you are the proof is in the Plies

00:05:44.011 --> 00:05:45.745
though it’s hard to admit.

00:05:46.155 --> 00:05:48.833
How his
what that mean tickles your

00:05:48.966 --> 00:05:51.485
that—:
means you :— recognize

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.085
What you do
to me baby

00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:56.523
it never gets out of me

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:00.288
You want him in the picture
so write him too

00:06:00.425 --> 00:06:01.961
through Jacob’s rows.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:06.631
Like flames of green
crop streak squash blossomed color

00:06:06.768 --> 00:06:09.970
stripes soil
go with your ratchet—:

00:06:10.235 --> 00:06:12.823
Negro
who had been part of the soil...

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:17.510
now going into and leaving
a new life in the urban centers—:

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.213
go
with what moves you.

00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:23.233
What you do
to me baby

00:06:23.368 --> 00:06:25.751
it never gets out of
me

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.121
Reaching ...2...3...4...

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:33.126
pigtailed girls at a chalkboard,
stretch reach.

00:06:33.728 --> 00:06:36.328
Mark this black—: river this :—

00:06:36.463 --> 00:06:40.441
Black is ==
an ardor, from dirt summer

00:06:40.575 --> 00:06:43.370
scent of slate scratched up—

00:06:43.671 --> 00:06:47.206
Rock with what moves black
bodies

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:51.945
What you do to me
baby’s beyond chalk borders

00:06:52.346 --> 00:06:56.441
Freely
filling its it it’s == black]

00:06:56.683 --> 00:06:58.785
black [-fully free

00:06:59.418 --> 00:07:01.418
it never gets out of me.
