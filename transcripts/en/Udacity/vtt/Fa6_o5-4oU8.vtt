00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.000
In the last lesson, you heard about
different types of monetization methods

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.800
available to you, but
we kept things at a pretty high level.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.000
&gt;&gt; So now in this lesson we'll
dive into the nitty gritty of what

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.520
you'll need to know
to monetize your app.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.890
By the end, you'll be able to
develop an implementation plan for

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.380
your model, relevant to your product.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.410
You're encouraged to jump
around in this lesson.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.980
I mean, after all, not all of these
methods are applicable to your product.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.640
We'll provide more information later on,
on where to jump,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.640
if you know what method you want to use.
