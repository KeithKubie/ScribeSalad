00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.458
In the programs that you've seen so far, you've used a single loop to solve a

00:00:03.458 --> 00:00:07.089
problem. Sometimes, you need to have more than one loop, and in fact it can

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.014
happen that you have one loop sitting inside another. Such loops are called

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:14.769
nested loops. Let me give you an example. We want to write a program that draws

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.795
this square of colors starting with the black one, increasing the greenness in

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:24.280
this direction. Increasing the blueness in that direction. How can we draw all

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.886
of these squares? Let's think of it a row at a time. For example, to draw this

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:33.960
row here, I need to go from x equals 0 then to x equal whatever the width of

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.849
this square is, which is 30 in our example. So the x equals 30, 60, 90 and so

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:46.742
on. And that'll be a loop. That loop will draw on all of the squares in a

00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:52.366
particular row. To get to all rows, I need another loop. And there you have it, a

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:57.458
loop inside a loop, nested loops. Now, the only tricky task remains. If I have

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:05.670
row i and column j. How do I find out the position and the color of this square.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.888
You'll get to try that out in the next exercise. Just keep in mind, that as the

00:01:10.888 --> 00:01:19.076
row index i goes 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on. You want the y position to be 0, 30, 60,

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:27.275
90, hence on. And as J, the colon index goes from 0 to the number of colon. You

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:33.766
want the x offset also to be 0, 30, 60 and so on. How about the colors. We want

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:40.442
this square down here to have green 255 and blue 255. All the reds are 0. So,

00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:44.154
you want the greenness to vary from 0 to 255 in equal increments in this

00:01:44.154 --> 00:01:48.633
direction. And you want the blueness to vary from zero to 255 in equal

00:01:48.633 --> 00:01:52.870
increments in that direction. You just have to figure out the increments.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.536
Alright, go ahead and give that a try and as you do that closely look at those

00:01:55.536 --> 00:01:58.220
two nested loops that you'll be working with.
