00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the answer here is that, well, this approach, number one,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
it in principle works for any problem in NP,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so that is not the issue with this approach,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and this approach is, of course, is also always correct

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because if you can show that you can reduce

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
an NP-complete problem to another problem,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that problem here becomes NP-complete as well.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The issue is that it's a bit of a chick in an egg problem,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because in order to be able to use this approach,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you must first have an NP-complete problem,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and unless you have one NP-complete problem,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
this approach here will fail,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so you need a kind of seed problem

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that you show to be NP-complete using this approach here

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
before you can use the more convenient approach down here.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So unfortunately, while we would always like to work with approach number one,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
we can only do so if we have had success with approach number two

00:00:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
at least once.
