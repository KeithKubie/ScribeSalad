00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:11.950
On 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.240
June 8, 2017, Greek-born, Canadian-bred pizza
maker Sam Panopoulos died.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.660
His career slinging pies was rather unremarkable
save for one notable thing – he was the

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.099
inventor of the popular, yet infamous pineapple-topped
“Hawaiian Pizza,” named as such because

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.410
of the brand of canned fruit he used.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.400
Loved by some and hated by others, the sweet
and salty pizza is so controversial that it

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.700
once triggered an argument between friendly
nations.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.700
While such arguments rage on both sides of
it being a delicacy or an abomination, the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.900
fact is that the Hawaiian pizza is actually
not Hawaiian- it’s Canadian.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.370
Here now is the story of pizza and the man
who decided to add pineapples to it.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.030
Sam Panopoulos left his Greek home with his
two brothers in 1956 at the age of 20, bound

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.800
for a new life in North America.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.320
However, on the boat ride over, they made
a pitstop – one that forever changed Panopoulos’

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.050
life and pizza history.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.530
Getting off the boat in Naples, Italy, Panopoulos
was overwhelmed by the sights, sounds and

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.490
smells of a city known for its food.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.370
But that wasn’t the case with its pizza.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.390
According to the Washington Post, Panopoulos’
first ever bite of pizza was something of

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.610
a spaghetti-like concoction that left him
disappointed in the food item.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.830
Truth be told, pizza at this point had never
really been considered a delicacy in the Naples’

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.830
food scene.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.460
It is often claimed to have been invented
in the 18th century, though this is a matter

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.740
of debate as it all depends on your definition
of what pizza is.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.070
If you choose to loosely define pizza as flat
bread with toppings strewn on it, there is

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.270
evidence that the Persian army around the
5th and 6th centuries B.C. used their shields

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.350
to cook flat bread in this way out in the
field.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.400
The soldiers would then cover the bread with
things like cheese and dates for a quick meal.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.950
Further, it is very likely that people have
been putting various toppings like cheese

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.729
on bread as long as there has been cheese
and bread (which is a really long time, see:

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.360
The History of Cheese and The History of Toast).

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.370
However, many argue that these many references
to ancient forms of “pizza” aren’t truly

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.920
pizza as we think of it.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.840
Fast-forwarding a little, Mount Vesuvius leveled
Pompeii on August 24, 79 A.D.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.480
Why is this important when talking about the
history of pizza?

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.250
Archeologists excavating the site have uncovered
flat cakes made of flour that were a popular

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.370
staple of the diet of the inhabitants in Pompeii
and nearby Neopolis, a Greek settlement that

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.010
later became Naples.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.120
Shops were also found in Pompeii that contained
equipment and tools that would be consistent

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.620
with those used in pizzerias.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.290
As to specific early pizza recipes around
this time, we are lucky enough to have a cookbook

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.280
of Marcus Gavius Apicius.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.880
It contains several recipes that instruct
the cook to put various ingredients on a flat

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.910
bread base.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.470
One recipe specifically calls for chicken,
garlic, cheese, pepper and oil placed on flat

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.620
bread, which is about as close as you can
get to a modern pizza without the now traditional

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.540
tomato sauce.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.060
(Tomatoes at this point in history were only
found in the Americas.)

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.540
By the early 1500s, tomatoes had made their
way over from the New World to Europe.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.920
The tomato did not receive a warm welcome
in its new home; rather, it was greeted with

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.300
disdain and outright fear – rumors even
circulated that tomatoes were poisonous.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.390
(A similar thing happened with potatoes, with
this tuber not becoming widely popular until

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.410
some clever tricks and antics used by Frenchman
Antoine-Augustine Parmentier in which he managed

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.700
to convince the masses that potatoes were
just fine to eat- see: The History of French

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.670
Fries.)

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.470
This all brings us back to Naples.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.989
Not long after the tomato was introduced to
Europe, the poor folk of Naples added the

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.730
demonized tomatoes (often in overripe form)
to their pizza-like food item and gave the

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.780
world the first basic tomato sauce pizza,
considered by many to be the birth of the

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.461
“modern” pizza, known as a “Napoletana”
pizza- defined as flat bread topped by tomato

00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:46.910
sauce and cheese.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.060
Often bought from street vendors, professor
of history at the University of Denver, Dr.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.069
Carol Helstosky, in her book Pizza: A Global
History, notes, pizza at this time was considered

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.460
a “weekday food” because it was cheap
and helped people save money for their Sunday

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.460
macaroni.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:06.150
To quote, “It was a cuisine of scarcity:
Whatever you had, you tossed it on — garlic,

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.280
anchovies, other little fish bits.”

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.610
In the 1830s, American Samuel Morse, of Morse-Code
fame, visited Naples and looked upon the pizza

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.099
being sold on the streets with disgust.

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.579
“A species of most nauseating cake….

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.609
like a piece of bread that had been taken
reeking of the sewer.”

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.960
This sentiment about pizza seemed to be the
norm for quite some time among the affluent.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.289
As to how it spread to be a popular dish among
those who weren’t poor, a very popular myth

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.919
(of which there are a few variations) is that,
in 1889, King Umberto and his cousin Margherita

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.199
(and, also, his Queen) were traveling the
country in hopes of calming the advancing

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.729
tide of revolution in newly reunited Italy.

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:47.319
They arrived in Naples after many long nights
on the road eating the same fancy food (much

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.789
of it French-inspired).

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.189
Tired of overly rich dinners, the Queen demanded
something simpler- a commoner meal.

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:58.360
So, she was delivered three pizzas by then
famed pizza maker Raffaele Esposito, one of

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.830
which was a supposedly new concoction of mozzarella,
tomato sauce and basil pizza.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.020
The Queen loved it so much that she popularized
it among the elite, with the chef himself

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.809
naming that particular pizza after her- hence,
Pizza Margherita and Esposito often being

00:05:11.809 --> 00:05:13.659
dubbed the “father of modern pizza”…

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.270
Or so the story goes.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.840
The truth is that pizza made in that exact
way was already present going back almost

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.020
a century before this supposed event.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.059
On top of that, in 1849 such a dish is noted
by Emanuele Rocco with it stated that the

00:05:27.059 --> 00:05:32.419
mozzarella should be arrayed out in a flower-shape
over the sauce, which gives an alternate potential

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.430
origin to the name of this particular pizza,
with “Margherita” meaning “daisy”.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.509
That said, it is always possible the Queen
really did order such a dish from Esposito.

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:45.569
As evidence to support this event having actually
occurred, a thank you letter from the Queen

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.689
herself with the official royal seal is still
on display to this day at Pizzeria Brandi,

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:53.100
once owned by the descendants of Esposito.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.969
Esposito is also known to have received permission
to display the royal seal in his shop…

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.539
Unfortunately upon closer scrutiny, Raffaele
Esposito received the aforementioned permission

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:06.779
in 1871 for a shop that sold wine, rather
than a pizzeria.

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:11.380
Then there’s the problems with the letter
he supposedly received from the Queen in 1889.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.659
Beyond no record of such a letter being sent
in the palace archives (which do still have

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.849
records for many other mundane correspondence
that occurred that day, including even noting

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.240
the paying of washerwomen on the day in question),
the royal seal on the letter is only similar

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.810
to the real deal and very clearly was stamped
on, not printed as was the case for actual

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.639
royal correspondents of the time.

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.620
Further, rather than official stationary normally
used by the Queen, this letter had handwritten

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.979
“House of Her Royal Majesty” on the top.

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.860
Comparisons between actual letters from the
Queen and this one also show a difference

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:44.770
in handwriting, general format, and signature.

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.780
The smoking gun, however, is the fact that
the person who wrote the letter started it

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.619
off by writing, “Dear Mr Raffaele Esposito
Brandi…”

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:56.150
Raffaele Esposito never went by his wife’s
maiden name.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:00.689
Who did was Esposito’s brother-in-law’s
sons who took over Esposito’s restaurant

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:06.050
in 1932 and renamed it from “Pizzeria of
the Queen of Italy” (the name Esposito gave

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.089
it over a decade before the supposed Queen
event) to Pizzeria Brandi.

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:15.589
After they took over the establishment, according
to historian Dr. Antonio Mattozzi, they attempted

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:19.780
in a variety of ways to connect the restaurant’s
history with “eminent guests”.

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.990
Had they gone with Esposito’s actual name,
the connection between themselves, their restaurant,

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:28.309
and their famed pizza making uncle wouldn’t
have been clear to patrons.

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:36.449
In truth, it would seem the popularity of
various pizzas simply slowly spread from a

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:40.699
dish of the poor to something most enjoy,
all without any royal approval.

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.949
Pertinent to the story at hand, pizza made
its way to North America around the dawn of

00:07:44.949 --> 00:07:47.759
the 20th century, though only in a limited
fashion.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:52.319
It wouldn’t be until the 1950s that pizza
would start to become widely noticed outside

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:57.020
of the Italian-American community, thanks
in part to certain Italian-American celebrities

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:02.839
publicly enjoying the dish, and very notably
Harry Warren and Jack Brooks’ 1952 song,

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:07.369
sung by Dean Martin on the soundtrack for
the 1953 film, The Caddy, “That’s Amore,”

00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:13.259
which contained the famous line: “When the
moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie – that’s

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:14.259
amore.”

00:08:14.259 --> 00:08:15.969
This all brings us back to Panopoulos.

00:08:15.969 --> 00:08:19.929
With his brothers, he arrived in the Ontario
town of Chatham (about an hour’s drive from

00:08:19.929 --> 00:08:24.439
the US and Michigan border) in 1956 where
they opened a diner together.

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:25.699
They called it the Satellite.

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:27.779
(It’s still there, but under different management.)

00:08:27.779 --> 00:08:30.599
What they served there was… well, rather
eclectic.

00:08:30.599 --> 00:08:34.880
In an effort to distinguish their restaurant
from others, Panopoulos and co. began offering

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.060
Chinese food (also, relatively foreign to
North American palates at the time) along

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.310
with things like burgers; Spanish rice with
fried eggs; traditional Greek delicacies with

00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:46.360
bacon strips; and then came pizza.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:52.750
As we just alluded to and the man himself
explained in an interview with Atlas Obscura

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.250
in 2015, pizza was a relatively unknown food
in much of North America at the time, and

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.820
particularly Canada.

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.550
According to Panopoulos, the only places nearby
people could get pizza was in Windsor or Detroit,

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.320
both about 50 miles away from his restaurant.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.760
Panopoulos goes on, “The pizza in Canada
in those days was primitive, you know…

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.750
Dough, sauce, cheese, and mushroom, bacon,
or pepperoni.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:12.750
That was it.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:16.560
You had no choices; you could get one of the
three [toppings] or more of them together.”

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.630
Again attempting to distinguish his fare from
his competitors, he served customers pizza

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.460
with things like Vienna sausage, rice, olives
and anchovies (just like in Naples).

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.790
But it wouldn’t be until 1962 when he first
put pineapple and ham on a pizza and called

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:33.200
it “Hawaiian,” with Panopoulos claiming
he named it after the brand of canned pineapple

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.760
he had taken off the shelf.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.750
As to his inspiration here, Panopoulos noted
“those days nobody was mixing sweets and

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:43.020
sours and all that… the only sweet and sour
thing you would get is Chinese pork, you know,

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.500
with the sweet and sour sauce.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.380
Otherwise there was no mix.”

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:49.780
As they already were serving such Chinese
food with good results, he thought they should

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.510
attempt to find other sweet and sour mixes.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:56.300
With regards to such an experiment with pizza,
he stated, “We just put it on, just for

00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.920
the fun of it, see how it was going to taste.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.000
We were young in the business and we were
doing a lot of experiments.”

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.650
It also helped, and perhaps partially inspired
him, that it was in the 1950s and 1960s when

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:10.630
not only pizza was beginning to come into
its own in North America, but a very Americanized

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.960
version of “Tiki” culture was also sweeping
through the region.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.640
It popularly started with millions of young
men returning home from the Pacific Theater

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.150
after experiencing South Pacific culture for
the first time.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:25.210
Soon barrels of rum, girls in hula skirts,
and tiki torches were a popular entertaining

00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:27.530
form of escapism and relaxation.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.430
Of course, the North American version of tiki
culture then and now bears little resemblance

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.510
to the real thing, and the actual origins
are very religious in nature.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:39.840
tores began advertising pineapples as a way
to add a tropical dash to everyday life.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.260
So it’s perhaps no surprise that Panopoulos’
“Hawaiian” Pizza debuting at this time

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:49.070
saw his customers quite literally eat it up,
though Panopoulos noted “nobody liked it

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.070
at first.

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.300
But after that, they went crazy about it.”

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.740
Panopoulos would ultimately sell his restaurant
in 1972, and in interviews shortly before

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.770
his death lamented he hadn’t attempted to
patent Hawaiian Pizza.

00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:06.470
It is claimed by some that famed German TV
chef Clemens Wilmenrod is actually the inventor

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:11.880
of the Hawaiian pizza as he introduced Toast
Hawaii to the world on his show in 1955.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.130
However, this seems a bit of a stretch.

00:11:14.130 --> 00:11:19.370
Beyond the fact that it is unequivocally Panopoulos’
Hawaiian Pizza that popularized the dish,

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:23.770
Toast Hawaii is considered more of an open
sandwich, comprising of a piece of toast topped

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:28.480
with ham, cheese, pineapple, and a maraschino
cherry on top, all grilled until the cheese

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:50.779
melts.
