00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.580
It is impossible for a Disney film to be released
without garnering attention, whether it be

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.360
from the massive ticket sales, the indelible
mark on pop culture, or the continued dedication

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.080
by children and adults who become entranced
by the characters and music featured in the

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080
films.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.200
Even with Disney’s most beloved films, controversy
often looms.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.430
Here are 10 Famous Disney Movies that Caused
Serious Controversy.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.660
Zootopia
Zootopia is the 2016 film that endeared itself

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.780
to children and adults with its lovable characters
and its meaningful tale of two unlikely animals

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.610
solving a case, forging a friendship, and
reaching for what they want despite their

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:43.610
limitations.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.500
Judy Hopps is the bunny with the determination
to become a police officer for the big city

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.500
of Zootopia.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.720
Zootopia raised controversy for its attempts
to speak about sexism, racism and the war

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.010
on drugs through the lens of a family friendly
film.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.650
Judy is considered weak, the predator animals
considered violent and prone to crime, and

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.090
the growing of plants that only aggravate
an aggressive response, are all included in

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.090
Zootopia.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.850
While some critics and viewers found the film
desperate to comment on too many societal

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.980
issues, the box-office persevered.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.920
Mulan
1998’s Mulan follows the story of real life

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.340
Chinese legend, Hua Mulan.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.890
Mulan is a young woman who disguises herself
as a man to take the place of her father in

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.890
battle.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.420
Some critics found the gender roles to be
troubling but the primary controversy revolved

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.659
around the way Asian culture was portrayed.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.610
Some of the Asian stereotypes depicted in
the film bothered viewers especially once

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.179
it was released in China.

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.549
Most recently a new controversy over the upcoming
live action version of Mulan has sprouted.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.579
An online petition has been conceived asking
Disney to not “whitewash” the character

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:47.149
by casting a white actress when there are
so many underrepresented minority actors who

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.689
would be better suited for the role.

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.890
101 Dalmatians
In 1996 Disney gave their 1961 classic film,

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.170
101 Dalmatians a live action update.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.329
It was a much different time with a whole
new set of expectations and controversy that

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.329
came along with it.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.140
While animal rights groups were troubled with
the dog snatching Cruella De Vil, most were

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.670
already familiar with her villainous motivations
in the decades since the original film’s

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.670
release.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.530
The real problem came from the audience's
perception of the adorable Dalmatian puppies

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.430
featured in the film.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.420
After the release, Dalmatian puppies became
the must-have Christmas gift for children.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.220
However, the new dog owners failed to realize
that those pups grow to be much bigger and

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.120
the breed of Dalmatians may not have the most
ideal temperament for small children.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.060
The Humane Society was overwhelmed with the
breed months after the release of the film.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.739
It became even more of an issue when the animated
series debuted not long after.

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.819
Alice in Wonderland
The 1951 animated film, Alice in Wonderland,

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.620
based on Lewis Carroll’s Alice Books, is
one of the most surreal films and features

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.409
many instances of drug use by most of the
characters in the film.

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.720
While there wasn’t much discussion of Alice’s
use of Mushrooms, Caterpillars constant Hookah

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.690
usage, or the trippy images in the film after
its initial release, controversy arose in

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.379
the late 60s when drug culture became common.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.319
After 1968’s Yellow Submarine was released,
there was a surge of interest in Alice in

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.770
Wonderland as it was considered ahead of its
time.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.590
Parents to an entire new generation of Wonderland
watchers became concerned that the loopy imagery

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:24.000
and prevalent drug suggestions throughout
the film were harmful to young viewers.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.959
Toy Story 2
Sometimes there are controversies that arise

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.409
within the confines of Disney studios but
through the power of the internet, become

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:31.409
public.

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:32.730
This was the case with Toy Story 2.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.150
After the success of the first film, Disney
and Pixar began working on a sequel.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.720
The film was expected to be a straight-to-video
but when executives were impressed with the

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.980
footage, they pushed for a theatrical release.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.760
The animators were not fond of the footage
that had been completed causing tension between

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.230
the creatives and executives.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.459
Things became even more complicated when a
Pixar employee accidentally erased the Toy

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:52.510
Story data.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.849
Millions of dollars and years of work deleted
in a moment.

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.680
What the studio didn’t know was that the
film’s supervising technical director had

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.379
a copy with her as she had recently had a
baby and was working from home.

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:06.640
With the relief of the saved footage, the
continued arguments between the suits and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.170
animators dissipated.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.879
Tangled
In the 20th century Disney films have been

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:16.450
filled with Princesses who need the help of
a Prince to save them from whatever or whomever

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.670
they need to be saved from.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:22.050
Ariel only desired to walk among the humans
in exchange for her voice, Snow White tended

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.759
to seven small strangers until she was poisoned
and had to be revived by the kiss of a prince.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.790
The list goes on.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.770
The 21st century appeared to be making strides
toward feminism.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.240
2010’s Tangled was expected to turn things
around but Disney still managed to miss the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.440
mark.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:42.970
Female and Male viewers alike were dumbfounded
by the perpetuation of the patriarchy as Rapunzel

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.600
still needed to be saved by the male lead,
Flynn Rider.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.900
He wasn’t a prince but just a capable man
who seemed to be the only one who could save

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.780
the damsel in distress from her castle.

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.250
Even with the question of gender roles, many
observers noted that Tangled was at least

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.460
a step in the right direction.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.860
Pocahontas
Disney has a history of using existing material

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.580
and giving it a lighthearted makeover that
will appeal to a mass audience.

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.750
1995’s Pocahontas is a film guilty of taking
a real person and completely overhauling her

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.750
story.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.240
In the film, Pocahontas is shown as a young
Native American woman who saves and then falls

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.470
in love with Colonist John Smith, but in real
life she was only a ten year-old child when

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.030
Smith arrived and there was no romance between
the two.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.490
The real Pocahontas was abducted by colonists
not long after and married off to a tobacco

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.490
magnate.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.990
Disney dismissing the actual events of her
life disappointed and angered historians who

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.729
found the film to be a way to tie a family-friendly
and romantic bow on historical events that

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.009
did not end with a happily ever after.

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.669
Finding Dory
Finding Dory, the sequel to 2003’s massively

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:45.819
successful Finding Nemo, was another hit for
Disney with the story centering on the forgetful

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.520
fish who goes on her own adventure.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.580
Prior to the film’s release, there was buzz
that a same-sex couple would make an appearance,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.740
a first for Disney.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.890
There was controversy with the appearance
alone, but once the film was released, there

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.240
was another reason the film raised a few eyebrows.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.610
The so-called same sex couples characters
were simply a brief moment in which two women

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.009
who may or may not be a couple, make a blink-and-you’ll
miss-it appearance.

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.860
The Controversy of Finding Dory came from
two opposing groups concerning the same issue

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:18.629
but with Disney’s lack of committing to
either side, ended up angering both.

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.099
Aladdin
1992’s Aladdin has provided a wealth of

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:26.470
controversy due to its Arabian stereotypes
and the questionable skin color and features

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.520
of its two leads.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.260
The controversy that concluded with Disney
making an alteration is the song “Arabian

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.260
Nights”.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.410
The original release of film included the
lyrics “Where they cut off your ear if they

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.729
don’t like your face”.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:41.410
The American-Arab anti-Defamation league rightly
took issue with this offensive line resulting

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:43.610
in Disney changing it for the home video release.

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.470
While the lyrics were changed to “Where
it’s flat and immense and the heat is intense”

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.699
a scene in which Jasmine nearly gets her hand
chopped off for stealing an apple and the

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:55.000
line “It’s barbaric, but, hey, it’s
home” remain in the film.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.240
Moana
Disney is known for raking in money from not

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.040
only movie tickets but from the merchandise
inspired by their popular movies.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.621
Even before a film’s release, fans are able
to purchase items at the company’s store

00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:06.810
and other retailers.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.849
The upcoming film Moana, about a teenage girl
who goes on a daring adventure to save her

00:07:10.849 --> 00:07:14.780
people, is the subject of Disney’s most
recent controversy for a Halloween costume

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.069
based on the character Maui.

00:07:16.069 --> 00:07:20.400
The costume features a brown bodysuit adorned
with Polynesian tattoos to better resemble

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.680
the character who is a Polynesian Demigod,
This angered many on social media, calling

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.020
it cultural appropriation.

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.650
Disney was quick to react to the complaints
and immediately removed the costume from the

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.650
stores.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.270
While issues of race insensitivity are not
new for the house of mouse, it is less common

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.780
in recent years and the company has used social
media as a way to fix their missteps.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.789
There’s our list.

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:40.129
What do you think?

00:07:40.129 --> 00:07:41.750
