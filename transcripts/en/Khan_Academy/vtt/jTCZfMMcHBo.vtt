00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:04.750
Find the slope of the linear
function defined by the table.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.110
And they give us a table here.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.130
They define certain amount, I
guess these are shift lengths,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:12.720
and then they say how many hours
is a half a day, is a

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.330
full day, is two days, is
a week, is a month.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.670
And then they tell us how much
money do we make in each of

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.940
those time periods.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.800
If we work four hours, we make
$54, if we work eight hours,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.640
we make $108, so forth
and so on.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.880
And then they say what
does the slope

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.900
represent in this situation?

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.369
So we have to find the slope
and figure out what it

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.780
represents.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.250
So just as a bit of review,
slope just equals the change

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.080
in the dependent variable
divided by the change in the

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.040
independent variable.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.330
So how much does a dependent
variable change for any amount

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.310
of change of the independent
variable?

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.240
In this situation, the dependent
variable is the

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.660
amount of money you make because
it is dependent on how

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.140
much time you work, this
is independent.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.110
So let's call the independent
variable x, the dependent

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.860
variable y.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:07.600
So our slope in this situation
would be change in y divided

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.170
by change in x.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.530
So how much does the amount of
money I make change when I

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.560
work a certain number of hours,
when my hours worked

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.450
change by a certain amount.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.640
So let's just take some
data points here.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.780
We could take really any of
these data points, I'll take

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.740
some of the smaller numbers.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.750
So let's say if when I go from
four to eight hours, so my

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.200
change in x is going
to be what?

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.330
If I go from four to eight,
might change in x is going to

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.660
be eight minus four,
four hours, right?

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.280
So this is going to
be my change in x.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.070
I'm just picking these two
points, I could have picked

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.490
four and forty if I wanted, but
the math would become more

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.460
complicated.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.620
But how much does the amount of
money earn change if I go

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.600
from four hours to
eight hours?

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.110
Well, I go from $54 to $108,
so the difference in the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:03.730
amount of money I make
is $108 minus $54.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.380
So what is my change in
my dependent variable?

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.630
Well, that's going to be $108
minus $54, that's just $54.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.130
And then what was the
change in the

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.340
amount of hours I worked?

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.300
Well, the change in the hours
I worked was four hours.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.940
So, if I work four more hours,
I make 54 more dollars.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.840
Let me put a little
equal sign there.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.860
So what is 54 divided by four?

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.780
So four goes into 54-- looks
like there's going to be

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.950
decimal here-- four goes
into five one time, one

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.560
times four is four.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.950
Subtract, you get five minus
four is one, bring down this

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.710
four you get 14.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.220
Four goes into 14 three times,
three times four is 12.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.880
Fourteen minus 12 is two, bring
down a 0 right here,

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.460
four goes into 20 five times.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.900
And of course you have this
decimal right here.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.890
Five times four is 20.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.170
Subtract, no remainder.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:10.050
So this is equal to 13.5, but
since we're talking in terms

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.530
of dollars, maybe say $13.50,
because that's

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.630
our numerator, right?

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.730
This is money earned, dollars
per hour, because that's our

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.260
denominator, dollars per hour.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.040
So that essentially answers
our question.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.760
What does the slope represent
in this situation?

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:35.050
It represents the hourly
wage for working at

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.570
wherever this might be.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.160
Frankly, for this problem, you
didn't even have to take two

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.690
data points.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.440
We could have said hey, if you
work four hours and make $54,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.530
54 divided by four is 13.50.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.080
Or we could have said hey, if
we work eight hours, we get

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.870
$108, 108 divided by
eight is 13.50.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.670
So you didn't even have to take
two data points here, you

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.950
could have just taken any of
these numbers divided by any

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.860
of these numbers.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.790
But hopefully we also
learned a little bit

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.260
about what slope is.
