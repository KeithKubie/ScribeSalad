00:00:01.808 --> 00:00:03.080
MALE SPEAKER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.240
Thanks again for coming to
another Authors at Google event

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.890
at the San Francisco office.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.140
We're very psyched today to
welcome Rob Baedeker and Chris

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:15.520
Colin, both of whom are local
Bay-Areans, if that's a word.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.016
Chris is an author
and a journalist

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:19.390
whose work has appeared in
the "New York Times," "Wired,"

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.810
and "McSweeney's,"
and he lives in SF.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.050
Rob Baedeker is a performer and
a co-founder of Kasper Hauser

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.310
comedy troupe, famed for
many things, including

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.210
"Obama's BlackBerry"
and "SkyMaul,"

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.970
and also famed for
not much of anything.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.210
He lives in Oakland.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.960
Tony Millionaire, who's
actually not here,

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.710
but he's an illustrator who's
part of the book which they're

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.050
going to talk about today
called "What To Talk About,"

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.520
is famous for the "Sock
Monkey" series of comics

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.520
and the syndicated comic
strip "Maakies," and he

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.415
lives down south, but we
won't hold that against him.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.790
So thanks very much, again,
for Rob and Chris, for coming

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:53.561
today, and please
welcome them to Google.

00:00:53.561 --> 00:00:59.453
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:59.453 --> 00:01:01.417
ROB BAEDEKER: Hello.

00:01:01.417 --> 00:01:02.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.034
ROB BAEDEKER: Oh good,
we're off to a good start.

00:01:05.034 --> 00:01:05.950
Thanks for coming out.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.699
We're the authors of
"What To Talk About."

00:01:07.699 --> 00:01:11.550
And we wrote this book that
is a little bit absurd,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.920
but it also has a
practical element.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.820
It's our belief that most of us
are doing all right at talking.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.390
If you're here, you
have a job at Google,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.190
you're doing pretty well
to have gotten here.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.300
But most of us, we think,
have about a 10% gap

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.300
where we could improve--

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.216
CHRIS COLIN: 10 to 12.

00:01:30.216 --> 00:01:32.200
ROB BAEDEKER: --10
to 12, thank you--

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.970
where we could push a
conversation further, start

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.980
a conversation
where we get stuck,

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.939
or take it to a memorable place.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.730
And so we hope that
this book will give you

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:45.850
some tools to take
away and actually use,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.730
as well as some flights
of absurd fancy.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:50.440
Does that sound good?

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.110
All right.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.770
We'll start with-- we have
some case studies here,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.560
and we'll start with
one about Rachel.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.200
Anybody know Tony Millionaire?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.610
He does a strip called "Maakies"
and a bunch of other stuff.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.860
Great illustrator.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.770
CHRIS COLIN: That's a drawing.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.650
It's not a photo.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:12.840
ROB BAEDEKER: Thanks.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.770
Virtual reality.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.380
This is about Raquel.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.630
Case study Raquel. "Raquel
R., a graphic designer

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.830
and aspiring artist, went
to an album release party

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.734
for a friend of a friend.

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:26.150
Everyone at the
party was engaging

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.020
in small talk about the
weather, their favorite bands,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.710
and so on.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.300
But Raquel wanted no part of it.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.520
'Lame,' thought Raquel, popping
in earbuds and listening to her

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.650
iTunes.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.480
'What a waste of
time.' A week later,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.060
Raquel died in a
skydiving accident.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.560
Raquel didn't really die.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.270
She never existed.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.790
We invented her to
teach you a lesson.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.940
Life is too short to
judge other people,

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.250
or to write off opportunities
to learn from them."

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.030
CHRIS COLIN: So
yeah, I mean, you

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.690
can tell now this is sort
of a scientific enterprise.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.560
We tried to have fun,
but that is science.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.940
And because we
feel like we wanted

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.240
to write a fun, funny book.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.360
But deep inside, we wanted
to get better at talking.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.630
Like Rob said, I think
most of us are fine,

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.200
but there are those
moments-- I think

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.910
there are two key
moments in my mind

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.680
when I wanted a book like this.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.980
One is when you're
freaking out, you're

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.309
in the elevator with someone
who you sort of remember

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:35.600
but you don't know their name
and you're just-- I mean,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.780
like, every thought
drains from your head.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.860
You cannot summon a single brain
cell to put together a word.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.820
So there's those panic moments.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.300
But then there's this other
kind of moment where you think,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.970
I'm only going to
live once, probably,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:56.130
and why can't every
conversation be

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.360
like that incredible,
moving, memorable one

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.750
I had in 2011 outside that
tire shop with my friend?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.670
We went on for hours.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.830
We went to deep places.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.800
It was a little funny.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.489
We got to know each other.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.780
I've hung out with that guy,
like, 10 times since then.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.019
Why is it sort of middling
when I see him now?

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.750
Like, I've got the
same brain, so why

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.019
can't I go back to those
great conversations?

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.620
Why can't I always have
a great dinner party?

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.000
So that's sort of
the other side of us

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.839
that I was hoping
we would write for.

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:31.630
I'm going to read
another case study again.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.420
This is science.

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.800
This is from Chapter
10, our "Work" chapter.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.950
Work is a realm where we all
need to make conversation.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.990
This is about Marvin--
Marvin C. We changed--

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.220
we disguised their identities.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.160
"Marvin C. has worked for
nearly two years as a software

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.090
engineer at some kind
of huge software place.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.830
But do you want to know
Marvin's dirty little secret?

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.070
He has no idea what
software is, or engineering.

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.930
So what does Marvin know?

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.000
He knows what to talk about.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.840
People like to see Marvin.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.840
He's curious about them.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.110
He's generous with his
attention, his interests.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.640
He's even honest.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.440
'I have no idea what software
is,' he says to co-workers.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.320
'Tell me about it' they
laugh, as Marvin leaves.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.100
'See you on Monday, Marvin.'"

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.687
So yeah.

00:05:21.687 --> 00:05:22.270
Let's face it.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.645
A lot of success
in the workplace

00:05:23.645 --> 00:05:25.450
has nothing to do
with so-called skills.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.810
It comes down to knowing
what to talk about

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.940
and how to talk about it.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.840
And that's what we want
to talk about today.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.690
ROB BAEDEKER: Marvin is
based on someone we met here.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.660
No, he's not.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.160
He's not.

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:37.140
He is.

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.920
Do you ever have
that situation where

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.730
you run into somebody here,
or at a different job,

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.450
where you feel like you
should know their name

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.920
but it's way past
the time you can ask?

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.410
We've got a strategy for that.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.650
The Social Security
website has a list

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.910
of the most popular
birth names by year.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.630
So all you've got to
do is guess their age,

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:09.500
and if you think they
were born around 1980,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.170
you look at the top names.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.080
And it's like, Michael,
David, and Jeffrey.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.670
And just go bold.

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.470
Hey, Mike, how's it going?

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:22.310
And there's a good
chance you'll be right.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:22.905
CHRIS COLIN: It's
probably right.

00:06:22.905 --> 00:06:24.450
ROB BAEDEKER: You're
probably right.

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.100
And if you're not,
you'll probably

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.380
start a conversation anyway.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.350
Or if it's your
boss, you'll find

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.380
a new job that's
even more exciting.

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:36.510
One of the big things
we all worry about

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.050
is what to say when
you're on your deathbed.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.180
How do you find
that perfect line

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.550
that's clever, a little
enigmatic, sweet,

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.560
not too dark, inspiring?

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.060
And so--

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.870
CHRIS COLIN: 'Cause this
is your last moment.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:53.650
It's your moment.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.520
You don't want to go out with a
whimper or say something lame.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.800
ROB BAEDEKER: So we
put together a table

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.250
that, really, any combination
of these will work.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.170
So if you just pick randomly
from column A, B, C, and D,

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.400
you get, what sled shadows.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.360
Perfectly mysterious, right?

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.490
What did he mean?

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.590
And you can keep your
survivors entertained.

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:20.640
Keep this laminated
card in your pocket.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.530
You never know when the
time's going to come.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.170
And you'll say something
memorable, something

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.760
inspiring for your loved ones.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.760
CHRIS COLIN: Because we
do want to be memorable.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.990
That is what we want in life.

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:32.340
We want to connect with people.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.590
We want to make an impression.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:37.052
We want them to make
an impression on us.

00:07:37.052 --> 00:07:38.700
ROB BAEDEKER: "The
mirror life beagle."

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:42.820
Again, perfectly appropriate.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.570
We're not only-- it's kind of
a "physician, heal thyself"

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.360
situation.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.540
Chris and I need to work
on this, as you can tell.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.440
And so we wrote a book,
but we're doing research

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.180
and we're finding out
what are the roadblocks.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.730
Where do people get stuck
when you have talk to people?

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.710
So we want to hear from you now.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:05.190
And we just want to
gather some data.

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:07.370
When you're at a party,
when you're at work,

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:10.780
think about a situation where
you're talking to someone,

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.330
or trying to talk to someone,
and think about them.

00:08:13.330 --> 00:08:18.140
And we'd like to hear a
few reports from the field.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:19.140
Where does it get stuck?

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:22.590
What does the other person do
that makes conversations stall

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.200
or not start in the first place?

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.560
What have you experienced?

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.190
CHRIS COLIN: Your conversation
partner gives quick answers.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:30.600
They don't elaborate.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.770
It's like no forward
progress has occurred.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.270
Yes.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.678
ROB BAEDEKER: Thank you.

00:08:35.678 --> 00:08:36.260
What else?

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:38.385
AUDIENCE: They don't stop
talking about themselves.

00:08:38.385 --> 00:08:39.520
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.270
They can't stop talking
about themselves.

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:45.290
Number one complaint we've
heard in our research.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.830
What else?

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.184
AUDIENCE: Sometimes it's a
dog that I try to talk to.

00:08:50.184 --> 00:08:51.600
CHRIS COLIN:
Sometimes it's a dog.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.360
And what happens?

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.350
AUDIENCE: They usually
don't say anything.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.520
CHRIS COLIN: You get nowhere.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:00.840
That's not as common, but
that is a real problem.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.460
ROB BAEDEKER: The "mirror life
beagle," Dogs love that one.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.300
What else?

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.300
AUDIENCE: Sometimes I
lose track of what they're

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.335
talking about after the
third or fourth kid.

00:09:09.335 --> 00:09:10.126
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah.

00:09:10.126 --> 00:09:12.320
They-- third or fourth what?

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:12.820
Kid?

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.580
AUDIENCE: Third or
fourth kid, yeah.

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.496
ROB BAEDEKER: Oh yeah.

00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:17.070
It's adjacent to
the self-involvement

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.010
that it's all about their kids.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.260
They can be cute, for a while.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.010
AUDIENCE: Stuff you
just don't care about.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:25.740
ROB BAEDEKER: Stuff you
just don't care about.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.440
For example?

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.416
AUDIENCE: Kardashians.

00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:30.350
ROB BAEDEKER: Kardashians.

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.730
Let's skip our
Kardashian chapter.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.490
CHRIS COLIN: OK, yeah.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.390
ROB BAEDEKER: It's
irrelevant to you, right?

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.460
But they go on and on.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.884
What else?

00:09:38.884 --> 00:09:39.550
CHRIS COLIN: OK.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.230
What about you?

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.755
What about when things
go south on your end,

00:09:42.755 --> 00:09:44.760
and you don't--
you're panicking,

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.970
or you're just sort of not
doing as well as you want,

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.540
or maybe in retrospect you
wish you had done better.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.670
Are there things that
you feel like you--

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.820
areas where you sort of blow it?

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:57.342
No shame.

00:09:57.342 --> 00:09:58.300
We're all friends here.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:09:58.660
AUDIENCE: Swearing.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:09:59.110
CHRIS COLIN: What's that?

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:00.443
AUDIENCE: Swearing accidentally.

00:10:00.443 --> 00:10:03.240
CHRIS COLIN: Swearing
accidentally?

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.589
ROB BAEDEKER: We can
help you with that.

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:06.630
CHRIS COLIN: What's that?

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:08.342
AUDIENCE: Swearing
intentionally.

00:10:08.342 --> 00:10:09.425
ROB BAEDEKER: In the back?

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:11.231
AUDIENCE: Adding
too much detail,

00:10:11.231 --> 00:10:12.995
so you're losing your audience.

00:10:12.995 --> 00:10:15.520
CHRIS COLIN: That's a good
one, adding too much detail.

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.280
You say too much,
and pretty soon you

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.572
realize they're not even
standing there anymore.

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:21.479
AUDIENCE: Not knowing
a good question to ask.

00:10:21.479 --> 00:10:23.770
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah, not
knowing a good question to ask.

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.810
That sort of bonking that
cyclists and runners talk

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:27.310
about?

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.580
You're just sort of--
the blood sugar drains,

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.620
and you're left frozen.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:32.250
That happens to me sometimes.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.420
And the rabbit hole, right?

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.070
You go down your own
rabbit hole of detail.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.882
Any others that you see in
other people, or that you do?

00:10:38.882 --> 00:10:41.340
AUDIENCE: And to be fair, I
should probably say that I also

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.215
talk about things that
they don't care about.

00:10:43.215 --> 00:10:44.155
Just to be fair.

00:10:44.155 --> 00:10:45.810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
distracted?

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:47.280
ROB BAEDEKER: Being distracted?

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.182
You're distracted, or
they're distracted?

00:10:49.182 --> 00:10:50.026
AUDIENCE: Either.

00:10:50.026 --> 00:10:51.590
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:52.130
Yeah.

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.886
Hold on, I want--
yeah, what was it?

00:10:55.886 --> 00:10:57.318
That one?

00:10:57.318 --> 00:10:57.818
Yeah.

00:10:57.818 --> 00:11:00.716
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
simple question,

00:11:00.716 --> 00:11:02.387
and you can't answer it.

00:11:02.387 --> 00:11:04.470
ROB BAEDEKER: They ask you
a simple question you--

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:06.026
AUDIENCE: Even when you have
plenty of things to talk about.

00:11:06.026 --> 00:11:07.775
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah,
like what's your name?

00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:11.407
AUDIENCE: Maybe
the hardest is when

00:11:11.407 --> 00:11:12.650
someone asks about
something I have

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.210
no idea about the
subject matter.

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.129
So that's usually where I stall.

00:11:16.129 --> 00:11:16.920
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah.

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.524
When you don't
know-- and I don't

00:11:18.524 --> 00:11:20.190
know if you're saying
this-- but for me,

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.950
I'm afraid of not
knowing the answer

00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.742
or saying something stupid.

00:11:25.742 --> 00:11:27.033
Is there another one over here?

00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:27.533
Yeah.

00:11:27.533 --> 00:11:29.260
AUDIENCE: I have a
tendency to start

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.744
thinking about something
else when somebody's talking,

00:11:31.744 --> 00:11:35.510
and realize afterwards
that I don't actually

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.710
know what they said.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.960
CHRIS COLIN: Do you always
think about the same thing?

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.825
Is it always one
topic you go to?

00:11:40.825 --> 00:11:42.980
AUDIENCE: Whatever
tends to be on my mind

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:45.470
or something I'm worrying about.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:47.190
ROB BAEDEKER: So your
mind's wandering.

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:49.200
Does that happen even
if they're interesting,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.222
or do they do something
that makes you tune out?

00:11:53.222 --> 00:11:54.670
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.977
I think sometimes it
might be that I'm not

00:11:58.977 --> 00:12:00.810
extremely interested
in what they're saying,

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.200
or there's something else
that's kind of on my mind.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.820
But it doesn't mean I
didn't want to listen.

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.921
It's just that I accidentally
stopped listening.

00:12:09.921 --> 00:12:11.850
ROB BAEDEKER: I love this point.

00:12:11.850 --> 00:12:12.673
What's your name?

00:12:12.673 --> 00:12:13.360
AUDIENCE: Jeff.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.151
ROB BAEDEKER: Jeff?

00:12:14.151 --> 00:12:16.100
So Jeff's saying
something key here.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.330
I didn't want to stop listening,
but my mind just went away.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:21.970
That's what this is about,
those moments where you actually

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.020
want to listen.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.010
We're going to give you some
ideas for that in a minute.

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.535
AUDIENCE: When
you're trying to find

00:12:27.535 --> 00:12:29.694
a topic that both people
are interested in,

00:12:29.694 --> 00:12:32.395
and it just comes off as awkward
standing there [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:32.395 --> 00:12:34.310
ROB BAEDEKER: Trying to find
a mutually interesting topic.

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:35.500
Do you have an example in mind?

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:37.288
AUDIENCE: If you're meeting
with someone you don't really

00:12:37.288 --> 00:12:39.077
know very well,
you're at a conference

00:12:39.077 --> 00:12:40.985
or on a first date
or something, you're

00:12:40.985 --> 00:12:42.655
trying to start a conversation.

00:12:42.655 --> 00:12:45.910
And sometimes things
just get awkward.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.490
[INAUDIBLE] how's the weather?

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.896
Eventually that gets boring.

00:12:49.896 --> 00:12:51.312
ROB BAEDEKER:
"How's the weather?"

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:53.905
gets boring pretty
quickly, especially here.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.930
AUDIENCE: When you use up
those four words of Russian

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.350
that you knew and
then you're at a loss

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.940
because you can't
communicate anymore.

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.949
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah,
travel situations

00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:07.240
where your language is limited.

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.320
We have a chapter on that.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.230
AUDIENCE: For me,
sometimes when I'm at work,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.625
and someone will ask me a
question about something,

00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:20.505
and my mind will go to a
not-safe-for-work story.

00:13:20.505 --> 00:13:22.202
I get stuck on it,
and I can't think

00:13:22.202 --> 00:13:23.920
of how to say something else.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.260
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah, so how
do you keep it appropriately

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:30.750
work respectable but
still interesting?

00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:34.720
So, Chris, you've been
parsing this data.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.712
And I think we hear
these patterns a lot

00:13:37.712 --> 00:13:40.170
when we were writing the book
and when we talked to people.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.421
And they're pretty
common patterns.

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:43.170
CHRIS COLIN: Yeah.

00:13:43.170 --> 00:13:47.862
I mean, what I'm hearing
is stuff that we heard all

00:13:47.862 --> 00:13:50.320
over the course of the 12 years
it took to write this book.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.400
It's similar stuff.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.290
And I think it's sort
of-- what I'm hearing

00:13:54.290 --> 00:14:00.560
is it breaks down into sort of
two or maybe three sections.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.300
There's how do you
start a conversation?

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.300
How do you get it going?

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.160
How do you just get
it into first gear?

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.450
And then once you're going,
how do you remain interesting,

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:10.960
how do you remain
interested, how do you not

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.565
curse accidentally
or intentionally?

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:18.044
Once things are sort of humming,
how do you keep it there?

00:14:18.044 --> 00:14:20.210
And then there's one that
didn't really come up yet,

00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.220
but I feel like you
were about to say this.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:25.810
How do you get out
of a conversation?

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:26.518
Either one that--

00:14:26.518 --> 00:14:29.210
ROB BAEDEKER: Anyone
have that challenge?

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:31.740
CHRIS COLIN: How do you get
out of a great conversation,

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.240
but you're just done?

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.794
Or, how do you get out
of a crappy conversation?

00:14:35.794 --> 00:14:37.460
ROB BAEDEKER: So we're
going to give you

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:41.560
some tools that will help you in
the beginning, middle, and end.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:44.550
You can put these
to work right now

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.610
and automatically elevate the
quality of your conversations

00:14:48.610 --> 00:14:50.040
by about 6%.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.320
You guys interested?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.990
Great.

00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:57.671
First one is beginnings.

00:14:57.671 --> 00:15:00.360
CHRIS COLIN: So getting
into a conversation,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.560
I think that's where we--
maybe that's the highest

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.690
concentration of panic.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:07.270
They're standing there, you're
at a party, you're at work,

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:10.030
you're at a family
gathering, and there's

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.810
someone you don't
really know that well.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:16.207
It's a glancing
relationship with the woman

00:15:16.207 --> 00:15:17.790
who checks your gas
meter or whatever,

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.660
and you feel like you've
got to say something.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:24.520
And I think a lot of us--
that panic sort of morphs

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.340
into the sense that
the stakes are high.

00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.420
This has got to be something
really good that I'm saying.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.100
And the more seconds that
pass, the higher the bar

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:37.297
goes-- oh my god, I've
now waited four seconds.

00:15:37.297 --> 00:15:38.880
I've got to say
something really good.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.170
This is getting weird.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:44.240
I definitely can't ask
about the weather right now.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.000
And that's where we feel
like, actually-- well,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.120
the first step is
lowering the bar.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:52.240
And the way you do that
is understanding something

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.170
that I think we all
know and lose sight of.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:59.030
Everyone wants to connect.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.220
We're all idiots.

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.010
No one knows what we're-- we
don't know what we're doing.

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:05.340
We're all winging it.

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:08.230
When you think about it,
conversation is this thing.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:13.030
It's the glue in every
situation-- professional,

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:19.170
social, romantic, other things
that don't have words for them.

00:16:19.170 --> 00:16:20.800
And yet no one really
teaches it to us.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.680
There's no finishing
school for conversation.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.080
They teach you to talk up
until, like, age three,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.400
and then they just sort
of throw you in the water.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.760
And I think what
bears remembering

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.340
is that we're all in
the same situation.

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:38.880
Some of us pass better
as competent people,

00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.720
but none of us is
actually competent.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.730
So when you go into a
social situation with that

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:50.450
in mind, that can help sort of
take the edge off a little bit.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.040
And then you do
what we recommend,

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:56.020
which is like an on-ramp.

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.570
Picture getting
onto the highway.

00:16:57.570 --> 00:16:59.440
You don't start at 60.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.080
You go slow.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:03.960
Small talk gets sort of
pooh-poohed in our culture.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.740
We pooh-pooh the
pooh-poohing because we

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.970
think small talk is actually a
very safe, nonthreatening way

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:19.800
to establish really important
visual, nonverbal information

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.140
about ourselves.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.589
I'm not a threatening person.

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:26.500
I am a threatening person.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.289
I would like to have a serious
conversation right here.

00:17:29.289 --> 00:17:30.580
This is going to be very brief.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:31.630
Let's not get into it.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.870
We're establishing all
these things just by saying,

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:38.430
I really like the weather, or
where did you get those shoes.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:42.669
And so no shame in saying really
boring things because it's

00:17:42.669 --> 00:17:44.210
just going to last
for a few moments.

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.975
And pretty soon you're on
your way to something else.

00:17:46.975 --> 00:17:51.760
ROB BAEDEKER: Who had the
point about closed-off answers

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.540
that close the conversation?

00:17:54.540 --> 00:17:58.550
This is our next tool, which
is cold openings-- questions

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:01.210
or starting lines that
are a little more open,

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.920
that allow people
to tell stories,

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.701
get beyond the weather, get
beyond yes and no questions.

00:18:06.701 --> 00:18:08.450
And we're going to
give you a few examples

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.760
and actually let you try them.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.070
Here's one we recommend.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.050
If you had an additional eye
in the middle of your back,

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.750
and you were online
dating, would you

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:21.390
mention it in your profile
or wait till the first date?

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:24.230
We want to see what you think.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:26.900
Take 20 seconds, if
you would, and turn

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:28.974
to someone sitting next
to you, and ask them

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:29.890
and get their opinion.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:32.180
We're going to see
what the results are.

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:33.710
Literally 20 seconds.

00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:34.570
20 seconds each.

00:18:34.570 --> 00:18:35.930
Ask someone sitting next to you.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:47.055
[CHATTER]

00:18:47.055 --> 00:18:50.470
Who said mention
it in your profile?

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:52.550
You're the only guy that's
going to mention it?

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.450
Two people.

00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.059
Who said wait till
the first date?

00:18:56.059 --> 00:18:57.100
A lot of you didn't vote.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.600
AUDIENCE: Third date.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.600
ROB BAEDEKER: Oh, third date.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.530
Thinking outside the question.

00:19:02.530 --> 00:19:04.570
Let me get another read.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:08.080
Who said mention
it in your profile?

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.810
About 27%.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:13.030
Who said mention it
when you have the date?

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.360
First date?

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.300
Still not voting.

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:15.960
Second date?

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.223
Third date, is that-- oh, OK.

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:20.150
Wow.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.412
For those of you said
online profile, why?

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:25.491
AUDIENCE: Because it
weeds out all the people

00:19:25.491 --> 00:19:28.032
that wouldn't be cool with
it in the first place.

00:19:28.032 --> 00:19:29.112
Just get it out front.

00:19:29.112 --> 00:19:30.570
It's going to happen
at some point.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.090
You might as well just
weed out the people

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.870
before you start having
three dates with them.

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:34.460
CHRIS COLIN: A sieve.

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.157
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
attract weirdos

00:19:36.157 --> 00:19:38.580
who just want to see it.

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.170
ROB BAEDEKER: It
won't attract weirdos

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:43.460
who just want to see it?

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.410
AUDIENCE: Well, um--

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:46.493
AUDIENCE: That's pretty
discriminatory to weirdos.

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:51.590
AUDIENCE: So for those that
would wait till the first date,

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:53.450
how would you just
bring it out there?

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.414
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah, let's
hear your logic here.

00:19:55.414 --> 00:19:56.830
Who said wait till
the first date?

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:57.690
How would you bring it up?

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.050
AUDIENCE: Or third or fourth.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.115
Being that my third eye
isn't that big of a deal,

00:20:01.115 --> 00:20:03.275
so I don't want to
be prejudged for it.

00:20:03.275 --> 00:20:06.870
I'd like them to like me first
before they judge my third eye.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:08.905
ROB BAEDEKER: Did you hear that?

00:20:08.905 --> 00:20:10.280
Try to downplay
the significance.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.460
AUDIENCE: What is your date
that your back is exposed?

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.777
What are you doing?

00:20:14.777 --> 00:20:16.610
ROB BAEDEKER: What are
you doing on the date

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:17.785
that your back is exposed?

00:20:17.785 --> 00:20:18.655
AUDIENCE: As a first date.

00:20:18.655 --> 00:20:19.960
Yeah, let's go swimming
for the first date, whoo.

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.210
ROB BAEDEKER: You're riding
a tandem bike shirtless

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:24.632
up Telegraph Hill.

00:20:24.632 --> 00:20:26.790
Obviously.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.300
Here's the second question.

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:30.650
Worst sunburn you've ever had?

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.680
20 seconds.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.710
Exchange stories.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:33.210
Go.

00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:38.360
[CHATTER]

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.080
Do you have a good
sunburn story?

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.110
Or did you hear one?

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:45.570
AUDIENCE: As a kid running
around for hours [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.530
CHRIS COLIN: We're
hearing a sunburn story.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.390
AUDIENCE: The one blister
kind of experience on my back.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:52.960
Kind of a couple of blisters,
but that was the worst,

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.340
and I'll never do it again.

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.910
Probably took five
years off my life.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.385
ROB BAEDEKER: How old were
you during this sunburn?

00:20:57.385 --> 00:20:58.660
AUDIENCE: Must have been
about eight or nine or so.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:20:59.750
ROB BAEDEKER: Eight or nine.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.345
Anybody else?

00:21:00.345 --> 00:21:01.530
CHRIS COLIN: And I'm
sorry, where was this?

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:02.779
AUDIENCE: It was in Argentina.

00:21:02.779 --> 00:21:03.460
CHRIS COLIN: OK.

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.022
All right.

00:21:04.022 --> 00:21:05.980
ROB BAEDEKER: There's a
lot more there, I feel.

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.989
AUDIENCE: There's a lot
more sun, and I was a kid.

00:21:08.989 --> 00:21:10.530
Back in those days,
you didn't really

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:12.380
put so much suntan cream on.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.850
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah,
our parents just-- go.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:15.570
Go in the sun.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:16.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:18.480
ROB BAEDEKER:
Shouldn't be a problem.

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:21.020
Did anybody hear a good
one, or tell a good one?

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:22.652
Worst sunburn?

00:21:22.652 --> 00:21:23.427
CHRIS COLIN: OK.

00:21:23.427 --> 00:21:24.510
Let's dive in right there.

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:29.200
I mean, already, let's say
that you said this question

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:35.262
to someone at a--
like a roller disco.

00:21:35.262 --> 00:21:36.470
And someone says this to you.

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:38.180
Already, you're
off to the races.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:39.770
You can ask-- what's your name?

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:40.529
AUDIENCE: James.

00:21:40.529 --> 00:21:41.320
CHRIS COLIN: James?

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.640
You can ask James
about Argentina.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.460
You can ask about childhood.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:50.650
You can ask about sun.

00:21:50.650 --> 00:21:56.100
You can ask about what kind
of parenting strategies

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.400
he grew up under.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.650
Pretty soon, you're taking
sort of a jokey thing

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.900
and you are connecting it
to the stuff we care about,

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.385
which is life.

00:22:05.385 --> 00:22:06.220
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.050
The possibilities
start to branch out.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:11.610
Here's the last one.

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.070
How do you pronounce this word?

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.730
Everybody see it?

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.660
Five seconds.

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.280
See if your partner knows.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:19.476
Go.

00:22:19.476 --> 00:22:26.280
[CHATTER]

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.797
CHRIS COLIN: I want to know
who feels the most confident.

00:22:28.797 --> 00:22:31.297
Raise your hand if you feel
like you might be the person who

00:22:31.297 --> 00:22:34.862
can say it with the
most confidence.

00:22:34.862 --> 00:22:36.320
You feel very
confident about this.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.400
AUDIENCE: "In-cho-ate."

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.720
ROB BAEDEKER: "In-ko-ate."
"In-ko-ate" or "in-cho-ate?"

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.700
AUDIENCE: "In-cho-ate."

00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.366
CHRIS COLIN: OK.

00:22:41.366 --> 00:22:43.580
So already we have
something we can talk about.

00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.200
Why does this woman
feel so confident?

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.030
What's her deal?

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:49.660
Like, where did she grow up?

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.610
What contributed to
this weird personality

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.840
where she just feels so
confident about the way she

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.423
says this word?

00:22:56.423 --> 00:22:58.080
AUDIENCE: It also means--

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:58.788
ROB BAEDEKER: Go.

00:22:58.788 --> 00:23:04.650
AUDIENCE: Origin of German, and
it means to-- when you drive

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:05.947
and suddenly stop.

00:23:05.947 --> 00:23:06.841
That's what it means.

00:23:06.841 --> 00:23:09.080
ROB BAEDEKER: It means when
you drive and suddenly stop?

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.621
AUDIENCE: It's like
[INAUDIBLE] stop.

00:23:10.621 --> 00:23:13.112
You have a bad brake
at a stop sign.

00:23:13.112 --> 00:23:14.591
That person didn't [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:14.591 --> 00:23:15.610
CHRIS COLIN: OK.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:22.184
So now we know she's got some
real issues, like with honesty.

00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:23.600
So that's something--
pretty soon,

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.730
you would be having a
pretty intense conversation,

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:26.230
I imagine.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.521
A pretty inchoate conversation.

00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:31.685
AUDIENCE: So how
do you suggest we

00:23:31.685 --> 00:23:33.240
go about using this as
a cold opening, though?

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.490
Because it seems like
we'd have to walk around

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.159
with little note
cards, be like--

00:23:36.159 --> 00:23:36.950
CHRIS COLIN: Bingo.

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:37.490
AUDIENCE: --pronounce
this for me.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:37.810
It's important.

00:23:37.810 --> 00:23:39.435
ROB BAEDEKER: You
got to write it down.

00:23:39.435 --> 00:23:40.490
You got to write it down.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.990
Yeah.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:43.531
AUDIENCE: Well, I actually have
a friend who has a shirt with

00:23:43.531 --> 00:23:47.415
the letters N-I-C-H-E on it
that he likes to wear and go up

00:23:47.415 --> 00:23:49.290
to people and say, how
do you pronounce this?

00:23:49.290 --> 00:23:50.882
CHRIS COLIN: That's good.

00:23:50.882 --> 00:23:52.340
So I know what
you're asking, and I

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.756
think it's a really
good question.

00:23:53.756 --> 00:23:56.470
Because you don't want to seem
like sort of a skeezy person

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:58.082
who goes around
with lines, right?

00:23:58.082 --> 00:23:59.790
Because who wants to
talk to that person?

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.740
That's disingenuous.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.190
So I think this
gets at something

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:08.001
that I think is sort
of core to our book.

00:24:08.001 --> 00:24:09.750
You sort of have to
check in with yourself

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:11.205
before you have a conversation.

00:24:11.205 --> 00:24:12.580
And I think it
can be hard to do,

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:16.130
because you do get caught
up in the pacing of it

00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:18.720
or the anxiety, if it's
an anxious conversation.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.790
And you sort of forget every
single thing about yourself.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.060
Like, what do I think?

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.700
What are my actual interests?

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.700
I'm just trying to keep
this conversation going.

00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:28.760
You forget who you are.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.950
But I think if you can
take a moment-- and one

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:32.544
thing I recommend,
if you're, say,

00:24:32.544 --> 00:24:34.710
meeting someone for a beer,
instead of getting there

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:37.211
four minutes late, get
there four minutes early.

00:24:37.211 --> 00:24:38.460
Put your phone in your pocket.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:40.260
Walk around the block.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.096
You don't actually to
try to have a thought.

00:24:42.096 --> 00:24:43.720
You just have to walk
around the block.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.380
And the systems will start
to sort of come online again.

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.230
And instead of taking in
information while you wait,

00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:55.220
you will sort of, even without
trying, check in with yourself.

00:24:55.220 --> 00:24:59.220
So why does this matter in
terms of saying skeezy opening

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:00.510
lines to people?

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:06.080
Because you'll be checking
in with that core curiosity

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:12.900
and that sort of genuine
interest in people.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:17.169
You really do want to
know about their sunburn.

00:25:17.169 --> 00:25:18.710
If we're all honest,
if we can really

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.160
sort of check in with ourselves,
just to use some Northern

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.630
California language
there, I think

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.390
we'll find that we
care about people.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:26.750
We want to connect.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.200
We're not skeezy.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.310
I mean, maybe a
couple people, but--

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:32.006
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:32.006 --> 00:25:33.880
No, but in all seriousness,
we're not skeezy.

00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.600
We just want to
make conversation.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.000
And I think that if you ask
the same question, having

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
sort of connected with that
genuine part of yourself,

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.750
it will not seem
like a canned line.

00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:47.717
Or it will, but it
will be forgiven.

00:25:47.717 --> 00:25:48.550
ROB BAEDEKER: Great.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.980
Let's go on to the middle.

00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:53.290
What happens in the middle
is you bonk out, right?

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:54.340
Somebody said it.

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.470
You draw a blank.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:58.380
You have an awkward moment.

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.540
And you bail.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.220
Or you say something
work-inappropriate.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:06.370
Or something else gets
you off the rails.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:07.760
So strategies for the middle.

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.760
To keep the momentum going,
to keep their interest,

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.510
to keep your interest-- if
your mind is wandering-- here

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.860
are a few.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.020
The first one is
do your homework.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.350
Do some research.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:22.220
And you can think about three
things to bring to a party,

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:24.470
or to a lunch, or
anywhere where you

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.890
know you might need
something to talk about.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.925
And we're going to give
you some things as well.

00:26:28.925 --> 00:26:31.821
The first one is--
and these are obvious,

00:26:31.821 --> 00:26:34.070
but we don't do this--
something you read in the news.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.465
Something's going on about
that plane in Malaysia,

00:26:36.465 --> 00:26:38.420
about Crimea.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:39.504
Read the first paragraph.

00:26:39.504 --> 00:26:41.045
That'll jump start
your conversation,

00:26:41.045 --> 00:26:43.710
and you can ask questions.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:44.640
A big idea.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.430
So it doesn't need
to be topical,

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:50.830
but something happening
in the world, a trend,

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.330
something you want the other
person's opinion about.

00:26:53.330 --> 00:26:56.750
And finally, fail
safe, something cute

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.140
your pet did or your kid did.

00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:00.690
Three or four kids, it gets old.

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:04.450
But it's usually interesting
for at least one, especially

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.060
if the other person
has a pet or a kid.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:10.670
Now, we've got
here some research

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:13.630
for you and some tools.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:17.560
Maybe you could just
pass these back.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:21.860
These are cards that you
can use in the middle.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.897
And you'll find prompts on them.

00:27:23.897 --> 00:27:25.980
And there's something to
notice about the prompts.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.646
And it's the same
idea behind how do you

00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:29.650
pronounce "inchoate"?

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:33.260
There's a comfort
with ignorance.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.740
We've got to admit we
don't know everything.

00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:38.670
And even point that
out in ourselves,

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.510
because it lowers the bar.

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.440
Too many people
get hung up on how

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.340
to feel like they're
smart, whether they come

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.220
across as intelligent,
that they know everything.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:47.637
And we're afraid
to admit I don't

00:27:47.637 --> 00:27:48.970
know how to pronounce this word.

00:27:48.970 --> 00:27:51.720
Or I don't know what's
going on in Crimea.

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.470
Or I don't know
what a tornado is.

00:27:55.470 --> 00:27:57.380
Help me out, right?

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:59.590
If you've got a card,
and you're sitting

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:03.810
next to someone who also
has a card, pass it back.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:06.320
So every pair should
have one card.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.340
And if you don't have a
card, raise your hand,

00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:11.910
so the folks in the
back can get one.

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.470
And, again, we want to gather
data on what works here

00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:15.540
and what doesn't work.

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.580
So pair up, find
somebody with a card,

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:20.840
and take 20 seconds
each to weigh

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.454
in on the question on your card.

00:28:22.454 --> 00:28:23.870
And we're going
to see what works.

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:26.296
So, 20 seconds, go for it.

00:28:26.296 --> 00:28:41.460
[CHATTER]

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:42.649
What's your name?

00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:43.440
AUDIENCE: Victoria.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.840
ROB BAEDEKER: Victoria,
what was your question?

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.430
AUDIENCE: Oh, so we
didn't get to mine--

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.638
AUDIENCE: We did my question.

00:28:47.638 --> 00:28:48.790
AUDIENCE: Oh, thank you.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:51.390
Mine was the best
thing you've ever done,

00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:54.480
but we actually used
Louella's question.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:56.334
ROB BAEDEKER: Louella,
what was yours?

00:28:56.334 --> 00:28:58.750
AUDIENCE: Who do you think
talked about you most recently,

00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:59.760
and what did they say?

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.510
ROB BAEDEKER: Ooh.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:02.050
Juicy.

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:04.159
Do you want to
share your answer?

00:29:04.159 --> 00:29:05.034
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:05.034 --> 00:29:05.900
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah?

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.570
AUDIENCE: So we
decided it had to be

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:09.675
something bad that was said.

00:29:09.675 --> 00:29:12.510
So we go into this juice--
so I'm from the Bay Area.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:15.910
And there was this girl
from my high school

00:29:15.910 --> 00:29:18.860
who had a falling out with
me like three years ago.

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:20.400
And I recently
went out to drinks

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.370
with one of our mutual friends,
completely separate from her,

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:28.230
and she freaked out about it and
was trying to basically swing

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:29.850
this girl to not
be friends with me.

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:30.975
So that was like the juice.

00:29:30.975 --> 00:29:34.089
ROB BAEDEKER: Wow, a
campaign of terror.

00:29:34.089 --> 00:29:35.630
That opens up a lot
of possibilities.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:38.980
Bay Area, high school, you
can go in many directions.

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:43.390
How about you guys here, UCLA?

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.621
What did you guys talk about?

00:29:45.621 --> 00:29:46.620
AUDIENCE: True or false?

00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:49.190
Washing your chicken just
splatters the bacteria

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:50.420
everywhere.

00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:53.430
ROB BAEDEKER: Washing your
chicken, before you cook it,

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:55.710
just splatters the
bacteria everywhere.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.262
CHRIS COLIN: Works against you.

00:29:57.262 --> 00:29:58.053
ROB BAEDEKER: True.

00:29:58.053 --> 00:30:00.300
AUDIENCE: And we
basically talked

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.860
about how you
wouldn't necessarily

00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.730
wash your chicken for bacteria.

00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:10.307
It would just-- as you
cook it, it would just die.

00:30:10.307 --> 00:30:11.140
ROB BAEDEKER: Great.

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:11.664
I love this.

00:30:11.664 --> 00:30:13.330
Questioning the premise
of the question.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.016
Right?

00:30:15.016 --> 00:30:17.140
And that led you to-- did
you get into any cooking?

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.280
AUDIENCE: So we're
wondering why you

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.602
would wash your chicken
for other reasons.

00:30:23.602 --> 00:30:25.310
ROB BAEDEKER: You have
the myriad reasons

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.720
you would wash your
chicken, aside from cooking.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.610
So this is an actual
thing, that we're

00:30:31.610 --> 00:30:34.338
used to washing our chicken,
but it's counterproductive.

00:30:34.338 --> 00:30:35.588
AUDIENCE: I grew up on a farm.

00:30:35.588 --> 00:30:38.757
I was thinking actual chicken.

00:30:38.757 --> 00:30:39.590
ROB BAEDEKER: Great.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:41.631
Now I want to hear about
the farm you grew up on.

00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:42.660
We're off and running.

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.990
Or that stalled conversation
has suddenly got some momentum.

00:30:45.990 --> 00:30:46.640
OK.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.390
We're going to look
at two more strategies

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.254
quickly for jump starting a
conversation in the middle.

00:30:51.254 --> 00:30:52.920
Chris is going to
walk us through these.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.010
CHRIS COLIN: So curiosity.

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.180
Like I said, curiosity
has got to be

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:59.630
at the heart of your heart
when you talk to someone.

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:03.220
And it's not just any curiosity.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.780
I think the kind
of curiosity that

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:07.430
works best, that elicits
the best kind of responses,

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.170
is a curiosity for stories.

00:31:09.170 --> 00:31:11.020
I think that's what
we all want to hear.

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:12.460
Everyone likes a story.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.900
What we don't like is boring,
sort of abstract ideas,

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:19.420
if they're not couched
in terms of a story.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.130
Let's say you're camping.

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.380
You've got two campfires here.

00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:26.345
Everyone can picture a campfire.

00:31:26.345 --> 00:31:28.470
Here's one, and someone's
just about to talk around

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.856
the campfire about
(MOCK WEARY TONE) god,

00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:33.975
San Francisco's not
the same anymore.

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:35.470
It's all changing.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:37.880
All this new money's coming in.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:40.130
So you could hear
that conversation.

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:44.334
Or you go to this campfire and
someone says, once upon a time.

00:31:44.334 --> 00:31:45.250
Which one do you like?

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.708
Having heard those
little snippets,

00:31:46.708 --> 00:31:47.709
which one do you choose?

00:31:47.709 --> 00:31:48.833
AUDIENCE: Once upon a time.

00:31:48.833 --> 00:31:50.410
CHRIS COLIN: Once
upon a time, right?

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:51.980
What we like is sequence.

00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.700
This is our theory at
what to talk about.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.570
People like to hear
a sequence of events.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.720
They like to hear a narrative.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.690
So when you're
deploying your curiosity

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:03.980
in a conversation, don't just
say, what are you all about?

00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:05.330
That's too abstract.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:07.630
What do you think about
San Francisco these days?

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.190
Too abstract.

00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:11.480
I prefer something
smaller but concrete,

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.385
with a sequence involved.

00:32:14.385 --> 00:32:15.504
What's your morning like?

00:32:15.504 --> 00:32:16.670
What's your morning routine?

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:17.640
Mine is sort of screwy.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.014
I don't know, I'm
running around,

00:32:19.014 --> 00:32:22.660
trying to get breakfast,
get the kids' lunch made,

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.110
have to have a little
argument with my wife.

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:27.620
And then find--
then run to the bus.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.630
Why am I always
running to the bus?

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:29.000
I don't know.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.083
I know what time it comes.

00:32:30.083 --> 00:32:31.100
Why am I always late?

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.730
Pretty soon you get sort
of a narrative going.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:39.180
And you can ask someone, what's
your standard morning like?

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:41.332
How did you get to
this party tonight?

00:32:41.332 --> 00:32:43.040
And pretty soon,
they're saying something

00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:46.140
that ostensibly doesn't
seem interesting.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.960
But they're walking you
through concrete steps.

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:52.667
And then pretty soon, you're
both on each other's hooks.

00:32:52.667 --> 00:32:53.500
ROB BAEDEKER: Great.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.800
And the final strategy
for the middle?

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.300
Shoes.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:57.091
CHRIS COLIN: Shoes.

00:32:57.091 --> 00:32:57.650
You do shoes.

00:32:57.650 --> 00:32:59.370
ROB BAEDEKER: Shoes
are about noticing

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:02.172
what's going on in the
moment and generating

00:33:02.172 --> 00:33:03.130
conversation out of it.

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:06.580
So everybody's wearing
shoes or not wearing shoes.

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:08.760
Something's going on down there.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:09.940
Ask a question about it.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.570
Where did you get your shoes?

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:12.690
That's a cool color.

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:13.800
What do you call it?

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.860
What's your favorite
pair of shoes?

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.540
There are a million
stories in footwear.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.260
There's something kind
of primal about it.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:22.300
But don't limit
yourself to shoes.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:23.750
Notice what's going on.

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:25.590
I see that you're
holding your back.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:29.650
Have you had back
trouble lately?

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:31.060
You're smiling.

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.560
Are you thinking
of something funny?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.080
This is the
in-the-moment strategy.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.800
And there are a billion offers.

00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.830
We call these offers in the
world of improvisation--

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:42.980
noticing what's going
on and giving someone

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:44.690
the gift of curiosity.

00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:46.800
Asking about those real things.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.420
OK.

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:49.160
We're going to give
you one more tool.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.150
And this is a tool, again,
you can pull out at a party,

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.410
at lunch, when you
go back to your desk.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:58.750
We're going to ask you
to create a life motto.

00:33:58.750 --> 00:33:59.960
A life motto.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:01.910
But the trick is it
doesn't have to be

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.954
clever or funny or interesting.

00:34:03.954 --> 00:34:05.370
It just has to be
a collaboration.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.950
And Chris and I will
demonstrate this for you.

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:10.634
But you're going to do
it one word at a time.

00:34:10.634 --> 00:34:12.050
And we'll show you
how this works.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:13.770
And you'll do it
either with one or two

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:16.010
partners, so two
or three of you.

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.239
And the life motto is
just one word at a time.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:20.500
And again, you follow
whatever's going on.

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:21.370
We'll try it now.

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:22.703
CHRIS COLIN: No overthinking it.

00:34:22.703 --> 00:34:23.580
You just go for it.

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.315
ROB BAEDEKER: Our
life motto is--

00:34:25.315 --> 00:34:26.190
CHRIS COLIN: Always--

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:26.909
ROB BAEDEKER: Go--

00:34:26.909 --> 00:34:27.370
CHRIS COLIN: To--

00:34:27.370 --> 00:34:27.940
ROB BAEDEKER: The--

00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:28.469
CHRIS COLIN: Store--

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:29.139
ROB BAEDEKER: When--

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:29.394
CHRIS COLIN: You're--

00:34:29.394 --> 00:34:30.395
ROB BAEDEKER: Hungry.

00:34:30.395 --> 00:34:30.830
CHRIS COLIN: Done.

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:31.265
Life motto.

00:34:31.265 --> 00:34:31.700
ROB BAEDEKER: There you go.

00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.840
That's our life motto.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:34.600
It's good advice, right?

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.139
And we just discovered
that together.

00:34:37.139 --> 00:34:37.639
Pair up.

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:40.100
You only have 10
seconds to do this.

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:42.710
A life motto doesn't have
to be funny or clever

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.179
or even make sense.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:47.469
You just have to come up with
whatever you create together.

00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:49.429
Life motto, one word at a time.

00:34:49.429 --> 00:34:50.940
Everybody got it?

00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:51.805
Go.

00:34:51.805 --> 00:35:00.800
[CHATTER]

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.330
So Robin, would you mind
sharing the life motto you

00:35:04.330 --> 00:35:05.937
and-- what's your name?

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:06.520
AUDIENCE: Rob.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.271
ROB BAEDEKER: Rob?

00:35:07.271 --> 00:35:08.186
AUDIENCE: Life motto--

00:35:08.186 --> 00:35:10.760
ROB BAEDEKER: So Robin and
Rob put together a life motto.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.660
And here it is.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:15.444
AUDIENCE: When the sun sets
over the city, smile heavily.

00:35:15.444 --> 00:35:17.985
ROB BAEDEKER: When the sun sets
over the city, smile heavily.

00:35:17.985 --> 00:35:18.610
Bravo.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.305
CHRIS COLIN: Nice, nice.

00:35:20.305 --> 00:35:21.441
Good one.

00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:22.940
ROB BAEDEKER: Anybody
else have one?

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.591
AUDIENCE: Life is a
beach ball of sand.

00:35:25.591 --> 00:35:27.382
ROB BAEDEKER: Life is
a beach ball of sand.

00:35:27.382 --> 00:35:28.246
Bravo.

00:35:28.246 --> 00:35:29.110
CHRIS COLIN: True.

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.322
ROB BAEDEKER: One more, to
cap off our life mottoes?

00:35:31.322 --> 00:35:32.030
You guys got one?

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.270
CHRIS COLIN: We
got one right here.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.324
AUDIENCE: Don't wear pink
if your father says so.

00:35:35.324 --> 00:35:37.532
ROB BAEDEKER: Don't wear
pink if your father says so.

00:35:37.532 --> 00:35:38.330
Bravo.

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:40.070
CHRIS COLIN: Unassailable.

00:35:40.070 --> 00:35:42.700
ROB BAEDEKER: Which brings us
to the end of conversations.

00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:46.650
CHRIS COLIN: OK, you're having
a wonderful conversation

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:49.220
at a friend of a friend's party.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.690
It's been going on
for six minutes.

00:35:51.690 --> 00:35:53.820
You can't believe how
interesting this thing is.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.486
And you just got to--
you got to end it.

00:35:55.486 --> 00:35:56.720
You're sick of it.

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.660
You're having fun.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.920
There's nothing wrong with
it, but you're sick of it.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.670
You got to get out of there.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.740
Or you're just so--
you can't believe

00:36:03.740 --> 00:36:06.510
you're stuck talking this
person that's so boring.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:08.181
I mean, it's like
they just don't

00:36:08.181 --> 00:36:09.680
have a single thought
in their head.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.640
They're not interesting.

00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.640
What do they do all day?

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.972
I mean, it seems like they've
never had a life experience.

00:36:14.972 --> 00:36:16.180
You want to get out of there.

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.940
Both situations, you
don't want to be rude.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:18.814
You're not an animal.

00:36:18.814 --> 00:36:20.640
You're not a monster.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:22.160
How do you end it?

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:25.105
It's the same for any
situation, any conversation.

00:36:25.105 --> 00:36:27.301
It was so nice talking to you.

00:36:27.301 --> 00:36:27.801
Exit.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:32.462
ROB BAEDEKER: And
that's the end.

00:36:32.462 --> 00:36:33.920
CHRIS COLIN: And
what does that do?

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:37.400
You're ending with confidence.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.915
It's a decisive, clean break.

00:36:38.915 --> 00:36:40.040
Look, you've been friendly.

00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.480
You've been disarming.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.580
You've exposed yourself
during this conversation.

00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.910
You connected as a human.

00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:49.170
Those are all great things.

00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:51.530
But you want to end
confidently and cleanly

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:54.710
and walk away and do what?

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.432
ROB BAEDEKER: Go ride your
bike up Telegraph Hill

00:36:57.432 --> 00:36:58.390
without your shirts on.

00:36:58.390 --> 00:37:00.250
CHRIS COLIN: Right.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:01.750
ROB BAEDEKER: Thanks
for coming out.

00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:03.670
Do you guys have questions?

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:04.290
Yes.

00:37:04.290 --> 00:37:06.050
AUDIENCE: It was so
nice talking to you,

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.467
but now I have to--
or just full-stop?

00:37:08.467 --> 00:37:10.300
ROB BAEDEKER: It was
so nice talking to you.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:10.840
Full stop.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.500
AUDIENCE: So no excuse, nothing.

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.927
ROB BAEDEKER:
That's the bold way.

00:37:12.927 --> 00:37:14.510
But "now I have to"
is another option.

00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:15.917
Now I have to go to a movie.

00:37:15.917 --> 00:37:17.380
Bye.

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:18.090
Yes?

00:37:18.090 --> 00:37:20.117
AUDIENCE: What about
when you can't walk away?

00:37:20.117 --> 00:37:22.200
ROB BAEDEKER: What about
when you can't walk away.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:22.560
You're in an elevator
or a submarine.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.480
AUDIENCE: Like, the person
next to you on an airplane.

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.230
ROB BAEDEKER: Yes.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:28.180
AUDIENCE: You strike up the
conversation before takeoff.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.130
CHRIS COLIN: That's
why you have this book.

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:29.735
AUDIENCE: But you [LAUGHS]

00:37:29.735 --> 00:37:30.401
CHRIS COLIN: OK?

00:37:30.401 --> 00:37:34.190
You can open it-- it was
so nice talking to you.

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.940
AUDIENCE: Some people
don't take the hint.

00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:37.606
ROB BAEDEKER: You
guys said what to her?

00:37:37.606 --> 00:37:38.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.699
ROB BAEDEKER: You can
still use the line, right?

00:37:40.699 --> 00:37:43.548
You have to find a way to
break that's not walking away.

00:37:43.548 --> 00:37:45.861
AUDIENCE: Go to the
bathroom, I guess.

00:37:45.861 --> 00:37:47.860
CHRIS COLIN: Slippery
slope, the bathroom thing.

00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:50.235
AUDIENCE: So could you talk
about the meticulous research

00:37:50.235 --> 00:37:53.759
and the shockingly
over-specific numbers you quote?

00:37:53.759 --> 00:37:55.925
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah, how did
we do our research and--

00:37:55.925 --> 00:37:57.020
AUDIENCE: How did
you arrive at that?

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.480
ROB BAEDEKER: How did we
arrive at those numbers?

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:02.856
Well, we used big data.

00:38:02.856 --> 00:38:08.202
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:08.202 --> 00:38:09.370
What else?

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:11.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
that's really weird.

00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:12.870
CHRIS COLIN: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.640
How do you get into
these weird questions?

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:15.360
I would say two things.

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:17.000
One, don't be afraid
of being weird.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.980
We're all weird.

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:19.510
Let it show.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:22.582
And two, you can create a
little segue, a little pivot.

00:38:22.582 --> 00:38:24.540
Wow, I was just-- this
is going to sound weird.

00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:26.800
I was having this question--
this question in my mind.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.450
Or I was-- refer
to a conversation

00:38:28.450 --> 00:38:30.130
you had the other
day with your aunt.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.380
We were talking about chicken.

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:34.612
Can I ask you this question
we were talking about?

00:38:34.612 --> 00:38:36.320
ROB BAEDEKER: But
context matters, right?

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:41.726
The chicken question might
not work in a job interview.

00:38:41.726 --> 00:38:43.100
You've got to read
your audience.

00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:43.990
Yeah?

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:46.489
AUDIENCE: A friend of mine was
in his med school interviews,

00:38:46.489 --> 00:38:48.150
or maybe residency,
one of the two.

00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:50.850
And the person interviewing
him asked about his hobbies.

00:38:50.850 --> 00:38:53.086
And he's like, oh, well,
I really love to juggle,

00:38:53.086 --> 00:38:54.210
and he was being facetious.

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.830
And this guy goes on to talk
about how he is basically

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.146
a semi-professional juggler.

00:38:59.146 --> 00:39:00.520
ROB BAEDEKER:
That's what we call

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.730
in the business the
Juggler's Conundrum.

00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:04.740
There's no way out.

00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:05.872
It's checkmate.

00:39:05.872 --> 00:39:07.180
You're done.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.430
AUDIENCE: I think it's great
that you wrote this book.

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:12.260
But what about the
conversation haters?

00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.710
For instance, libraries.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:16.930
You can't have a
conversation there.

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:18.060
Muni.

00:39:18.060 --> 00:39:20.301
Even Google buses
have banned it.

00:39:20.301 --> 00:39:21.800
CHRIS COLIN: That's
a good question.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.270
ROB BAEDEKER: Great question.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:24.936
CHRIS COLIN: I mean,
in all seriousness,

00:39:24.936 --> 00:39:26.996
there's lots of
situations where you don't

00:39:26.996 --> 00:39:28.370
want to be having
a conversation.

00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:30.712
Maybe you are in a library.

00:39:30.712 --> 00:39:31.420
Maybe you're shy.

00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:33.590
You don't feel like talking.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:35.996
Yeah, these are things that
we address in the book.

00:39:35.996 --> 00:39:37.370
ROB BAEDEKER: The
important thing

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:41.060
is when you want to have a
conversation and you're not.

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:42.100
It's not happening.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:45.330
So if you don't want to talk,
and that's working for you,

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:46.070
carry on.

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.200
It's great.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.970
But our theory is
that most of us

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:52.230
have that 10%, 11% of time where
we wish we could've connected,

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:55.100
where we feel like we
missed an interesting story

00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:56.880
or the opportunity
to meet someone.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.230
So that's what this book is for.

00:39:58.230 --> 00:39:58.660
CHRIS COLIN: But it's true.

00:39:58.660 --> 00:40:01.290
You know, if you're a situation
where you don't want to talk

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:03.740
or it feels
inappropriate, own it.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.561
No apologies for
not wanting to talk.

00:40:05.561 --> 00:40:06.060
That's fine.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:06.851
ROB BAEDEKER: Yeah.

00:40:09.235 --> 00:40:10.610
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious if you have

00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:13.080
a chapter on how to navigate
awkward conversations.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.496
Because once my sister was on
a date, and the guy kept on,

00:40:15.496 --> 00:40:18.136
any time there was a silence,
he was like "awkward silence.

00:40:18.136 --> 00:40:20.040
Awkward silence."

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:23.070
And then I also, even with the
"it's nice talking to you,"

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.170
I'm an admin, and so
people always come up to me

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:27.760
and feel like they can chat
with me for hours on end,

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.590
which is nice.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:31.200
But I've gotten really good
at being like, oh, so nice

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:31.840
talking to you.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.631
I'll see you later.

00:40:32.631 --> 00:40:34.666
And they're like (MOCK
DOOFUS VOICE) OK.

00:40:34.666 --> 00:40:37.115
And they'll just linger.

00:40:37.115 --> 00:40:39.580
And I've gotten good at
putting on my headphones

00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:42.630
and being like, OK, I really
have to do some work now.

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.964
So do you have any suggestions
or anything in your book?

00:40:44.964 --> 00:40:47.504
ROB BAEDEKER: Well, I think you
answered your second question

00:40:47.504 --> 00:40:48.070
for yourself.

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.360
I have to do some work.

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:50.400
I'll see you later.

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.940
For the first one, the guy
that fills every silence

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:57.590
with "awkward," a
recommendation is this.

00:40:57.590 --> 00:41:00.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.170
Is there one more question?

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:05.530
AUDIENCE: Topics to bring
up with your boss's boss's

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:07.872
boss in the elevator.

00:41:07.872 --> 00:41:09.330
ROB BAEDEKER: Best
and worst topics

00:41:09.330 --> 00:41:14.910
to bring up with your
boss's boss's boss's boss.

00:41:14.910 --> 00:41:17.470
They've probably got
some interesting shoes.

00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.180
So that's a good place to start.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:22.050
The context matters, right?

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:23.800
A, do you want to talk to them?

00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.540
And B, what your purpose here?

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.450
If it's just to connect,
then something small.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:34.720
Shoes, a news story, a question,
of which you have many.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.290
If you've got a broader
context, then you

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:38.450
need to be ready for that.

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:40.870
You need to prepare,
depending on what

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:42.870
you want to have happen.

00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:46.179
If you've got a goal in
mind, be strategic about it

00:41:46.179 --> 00:41:47.220
and prepare those topics.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:49.511
CHRIS COLIN: Well, let's talk
about goals, for example.

00:41:49.511 --> 00:41:51.500
Let's say you're
angling for something.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:55.960
You want to do a little sort
of jujitsu or something.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.550
Maybe you want to
undermine the boss.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:41:59.950
This is a controversial
recommendation,

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:02.360
but maybe you want to
do a subtle undermining

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.660
to throw off the
power differential.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:06.947
Tell me your question again.

00:42:06.947 --> 00:42:07.780
AUDIENCE: Seriously?

00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.874
CHRIS COLIN: No, no, I
mean, repeat the question.

00:42:09.874 --> 00:42:12.040
AUDIENCE: I wanted to know
the best and worst topics

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.390
that you should bring--

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:14.490
CHRIS COLIN: What?

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:14.990
See?

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:17.130
See, when I say "what,"
it throws things off.

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:19.750
So your boss's boss's
boss's boss says something.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.330
I'm sorry, what?

00:42:22.330 --> 00:42:23.690
They're not accustomed to that.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:26.442
It throws things off.

00:42:26.442 --> 00:42:28.400
And then the playing
field is a little leveler.

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.870
ROB BAEDEKER: That
brings us to our end.

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:34.720
It was so nice talking to you.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:38.670
CHRIS COLIN: Thanks, guys.
