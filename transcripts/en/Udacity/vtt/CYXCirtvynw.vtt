00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.107
Now we've learned a lot about some basic functions, like this one, y equals x

00:00:04.107 --> 00:00:09.522
squared, who's graph is this lovely purple parabola. You also learned about

00:00:09.522 --> 00:00:13.321
some other polynomial functions. For example, we have y equals x cubed also,

00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:18.316
which produced this really different and really interesting graph. So clearly

00:00:18.316 --> 00:00:21.772
the large scale behavior of different functions Is really different on what

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:25.833
their equation looks like. And it also changes from region to region of the

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:29.224
domain. I wonder what would happen if we increased the degree of polynomial

00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:34.124
function even more. Like, let's say we have y to the x to the fourth. Well

00:00:34.124 --> 00:00:37.182
that's totally different again, that's really interesting. Maybe I'll just get

00:00:37.182 --> 00:00:40.250
rid of these two that we already know a lot about and just focus on this one.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.721
Let's do something else, y equals x to the fourth plus. x. Well that's cool.

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:49.872
That's totally different from anything we've ever seen before, together. Of

00:00:49.872 --> 00:00:53.530
course we can add and change terms. If we made this x squared, that changes the

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.954
behavior again. What if I made this x cubed instead? Everything makes these

00:00:57.954 --> 00:01:02.580
little, minute adjustments in the middle of the graph here. That's pretty cool.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.600
Now I wonder, I just changed one exponent. What if I change this first one? The

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.120
exponent of the leading term. Wow, now this graph is completely different. Once

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.228
again changing the degree of the polynomial, seems to really change the overall

00:01:15.228 --> 00:01:19.830
behavior. What if I make this sign negative? Well that's really interesting, oh

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.558
my gosh. Clearly changing different terms in polynomials, especially the

00:01:23.558 --> 00:01:28.310
leading term, the term at the highest power has major affects on the graph. I

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.668
think this merits some more exploration. In this lesson we're going to

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:34.864
investigate the overall appearance of different polynomial functions in terms

00:01:34.864 --> 00:01:37.731
of how they look when we're zoomed way, way out, and when we're zoomed in on

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:42.934
the middle of the graph. In particular we're going to see where these functions

00:01:42.934 --> 00:01:47.300
intersect the x axis. And how this relates to factors in routes of

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.243
polynominals. I'm really exicted about the content of this lesson.
