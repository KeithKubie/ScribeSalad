00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.890
I have this figure here.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.860
You could call it a
rectangular prism.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:05.560
And I want to
measure its volume.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.240
And I'm defining my unit cube
as being a 1 centimeter by 1

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.130
centimeter by 1 centimeter cube.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.070
It has 1 centimeter width, 1
centimeter depth, 1 centimeter

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.760
height.

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:21.780
And I will call this, this is
equal to 1 cubic centimeter.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.640
So I want to measure this volume
in terms of cubic centimeters.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.340
We've already seen that we
can do that by saying, hey,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.040
how many of these
cubic centimeters

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.060
can fit into this figure without
them overlapping in any way?

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.170
So if we had this in our
hands, we could kind of

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.872
try to go around it
and try to count it,

00:00:35.872 --> 00:00:37.580
but it's hard to see
here because there's

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.210
some cubes that we can't
see behind the ones

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.550
that we are seeing.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.880
So I'm going to try
different tactics at it.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.950
So first, let's just think
about what we can observe.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.780
So we see that this
one, if we measure

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.300
its different
dimensions, its width,

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.760
it's 2 of the unit length wide.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.030
So it's 2 centimeters wide.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.700
It's 4 of our unit length--
we're defining our unit length

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.810
as a centimeter-- it's 4
of our unit length high.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.470
So this dimension right
over here is 4 centimeters.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.940
And it is 3 of our
unit length deep.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.280
So this dimension right
over here is 3 centimeters.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.170
So I want to explore
if we can somehow

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.140
use these numbers
to figure out how

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.330
many of these cubic centimeters
would fit into this figure.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.240
And the first way I'm
going to think about it

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.160
is by looking at slices.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.190
So I'm going to take
this slice right

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.070
over here of our
original figure.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.670
And let's think about
how using these numbers,

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.130
we can figure out how many
unit cubes were in that slice.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.010
Well this is 2 centimeters wide
and it is 4 centimeters high.

00:01:51.676 --> 00:01:53.050
And you might be
saying, hey Sal,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.383
I could just count these things.

00:01:54.383 --> 00:01:57.344
I could get 8 squares here.

00:01:57.344 --> 00:01:58.760
But what if there
was a ton there?

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.760
It would be a lot harder.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.384
And you might realize
well I could just

00:02:01.384 --> 00:02:03.740
multiply the width times the
height, that would give me

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.630
the area of this
surface right over here.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.280
And it's only 1
deep so that also

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.190
will give me the
number of cubes.

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.930
So let's do that.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.530
Let's find the area here.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.416
Well that's going to be
2 centimeters times 4

00:02:14.416 --> 00:02:14.916
centimeters.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.950
That gives us the area of this.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.000
And then if we want to find
out the number of cubes,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.450
well that's also going to
be equivalent to the number

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.090
of cubes.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.020
So we have 8 square
centimeters is this area,

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.640
and the number of cubes is 8.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.890
And if we want the number
of cubes in the whole thing,

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.420
we just have to multiply
by the number of slices.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.600
And we see that we need
one, two, three slices.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.110
This is 3 centimeters deep.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.500
So we're going to
multiply that times 3.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.790
So we took the area
of one surface.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.790
We took the area of this
surface right over here.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.310
And then we multiply by the
depth, that essentially gives

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.660
us the number of cubes because
the area of this surface

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.240
gives us the number of cubes in
an slice that is 1 cube deep.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.530
And then we would have to
have 3 slices like that.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.550
So we would have to
have this is 1 slice.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.710
We would have to have another
slice, another slice and then

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.360
another slice in order to
construct the original figure.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.510
So 2 centimeters times 4
centimeters times 3 centimeters

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.934
would give us our volume.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.100
Let's see if that works out.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.550
2 times 4 is 8 times 3 is 24.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.000
Let me do that in
that pink color.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.340
24 centimeters cubed, or I
could say cubic centimeters.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.410
So that's one way to
measure the volume.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.097
Now there's multiple
surfaces here.

00:03:41.097 --> 00:03:42.680
I happened to pick
this surface, but I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.950
could have picked another one.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.950
I could have picked this
surface right over here

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.950
and done the exact same thing.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.070
So let's pick this surface
and do the exact same thing.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.996
This surface is 3
centimeters by 4 centimeters.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.890
Let me do that in
that blue color.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.530
Color changing is
always difficult.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.300
So its area is going to
be 12 square centimeters

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:10.980
is the area of this surface.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.370
And 12 is also the
number of cubes

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.853
that we have in that slice.

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:17.019
And so how many slices do
we need like this in order

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.769
to construct the
original figure?

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.050
Well we need, it's
2 centimeters deep.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.530
This is only 1 centimeter
deep so we need two of them

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.140
to construct the
original figure.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.410
So we can essentially find
the area of that first surface

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.410
which was 3 times
4, and then multiply

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.320
that times the width, times how
many of those slices you need,

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.850
so times 2.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.730
And once again, this is
going to be 3 times 4

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.227
is 12 times 2 is 24.

00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:50.935
I didn't write the
units this first time.

00:04:50.935 --> 00:04:52.640
But that's going to
give us the count

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.960
of how many cubic
centimeters we have,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.470
how many unit cubes we can fit.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.846
So once again, this is
24 cubic centimeters.

00:04:59.846 --> 00:05:01.970
And you could imagine, you
could do the same thing,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.820
not with this surface,
not with this surface,

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.480
but with the top surface.

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.300
The top surface is
3 centimeters deep.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.610
And 2 centimeters wide.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.180
So you could view
its area or its area

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.550
is going to be 3 centimeters
times 2 centimeters.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.096
So that area is-- let me do
it in the same colors-- 3

00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:34.670
centimeters times 2 centimeters
which is 6 square centimeters.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.170
And that also tells
you that there's

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:39.820
going to be 6 cubes in
this one cube deep slice.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.140
But how many of these
slices do you need?

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.202
Well you have this whole
thing is 4 centimeters tall,

00:05:46.202 --> 00:05:47.660
and this thing is
only 1 centimeter

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.201
so you're going to
need four of them.

00:05:49.201 --> 00:06:00.620
So that's 2, 3, try to draw
it as neatly as I can, and 4.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.120
You're going to need 4 of these.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:03.200
So to figure out
the whole volume,

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.991
you going to have to
take that and multiply

00:06:04.991 --> 00:06:07.050
that times 4 centimeters.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.865
So once again, 3 times 2 is
6 square centimeters times 4

00:06:10.865 --> 00:06:15.140
centimeters is 24
cubic centimeters.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.130
So it doesn't matter what
order you multiply these in.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.510
You could view this and
take the area of one side

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:22.764
then multiply it
times the depth.

00:06:22.764 --> 00:06:24.930
Or you could take the surface
area of another height

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.880
and multiply it times the height
or the width or the depth.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.450
And these are all the scenarios.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.500
But what it shows is that it
doesn't matter what order we

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.820
multiply these
three dimensions in.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.780
You could take the 2
times the 4 first and then

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.170
multiply it by the 3.

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.595
Or you take the 3 times the
4 first and then multiply it

00:06:42.595 --> 00:06:43.500
by the 2.

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.540
And or you could take
the 2 times the 3 first,

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.182
and then multiply by the 4.

00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:49.640
When you're
multiplying, it doesn't

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.450
matter what order
you're doing these in.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.800
And so if you have a
rectangular prism like this

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.390
and you know it's
three dimensions,

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.689
you know it's 2 centimeters
wide, 3 centimeters deep, and 4

00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:02.230
centimeters tall,
you could say, hey,

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.270
the volume of this thing,
the number of unit cubes,

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.680
the number of cubic
centimeters it can fit

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:16.070
is going to be 2 centimeters
times 4 centimeters times 3

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.780
centimeters, which
we've seen three times

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:21.870
already is 24 cubic centimeters.
