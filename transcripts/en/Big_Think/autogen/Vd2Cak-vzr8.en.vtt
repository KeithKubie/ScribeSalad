I think it will be remembered as an age
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.720
I think it will be remembered as an age
of asymmetric warfare a great deal of

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730
of asymmetric warfare a great deal of
 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.560
of asymmetric warfare a great deal of
violence just just the number of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570
violence just just the number of
 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.870
violence just just the number of
casualties and deaths that have that

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
casualties and deaths that have that
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.160
casualties and deaths that have that
we've witnessed is is huge and and I

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170
we've witnessed is is huge and and I

think it will also be an age of great

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560
think it will also be an age of great
 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.440
think it will also be an age of great
disparities in in terms of economic

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450
 
 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.690
 
differences in terms of wealth as well

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700
differences in terms of wealth as well
 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.910
differences in terms of wealth as well
as poverty it's an age of paradoxes and

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920
as poverty it's an age of paradoxes and
 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.369
as poverty it's an age of paradoxes and
contradictions on one hand the most

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
contradictions on one hand the most
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.170
contradictions on one hand the most
advanced technologically and on the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
advanced technologically and on the
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.139
advanced technologically and on the
other hand simple things that we that we

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
other hand simple things that we that we
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.350
other hand simple things that we that we
can't find solutions to so it's really

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
can't find solutions to so it's really
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.309
can't find solutions to so it's really
an age of contrasts and contradiction
