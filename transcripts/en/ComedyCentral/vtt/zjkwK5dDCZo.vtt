- Hey, come on it.
(pop music)

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:22.222 line:0%
Yes, Push &amp; Believe, you got it.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:23.523
You know, I don't
need these notes.

00:00:23.523 --> 00:00:24.657 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Go on, go on,
look at your notes.

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:26.593 line:0%
- My writers are good, okay?

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:27.560
Born and raised in LA.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.795
- Born and raised in LA, got it.

00:00:28.795 --> 00:00:30.330
- I was raised in
LA, so were you.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.233 align:start size:94% position:6%
Very close to your mother,
and she remembers that,

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.534
as a child,

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.769
you always wanted
to be a comedian.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.970 align:start size:84% position:16%
- She asked me what
I wanted to be,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.238 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I said I wanted
to be a comic.

00:00:38.238 --> 00:00:39.739
When you're young,
you're insecure,

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.841
and you don't know what's
going on in the world.

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.911
I mean, I use humor to
deal with everything,

00:00:44.911 --> 00:00:47.881
so it became natural later
to become a stand up comic.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.549
- You quit your job.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.184
You had a day job.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.852
- Yeah, well I feel like,
if you really want to be

00:00:52.852 --> 00:00:54.754
an actor, comedian, or
anything in the arts,

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.923 align:start size:97% position:3%
if you have a job or
whatever else you're doing.

00:00:56.923 --> 00:01:00.493 align:start size:94% position:6%
If you have to ask someone
permission to go do

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:02.328
stand-up or an acting gig,

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.930
that means that's
your real priority.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.432
So I say that, like,

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:07.367 align:start size:97% position:3%
if you have the opportunity
to chase after whatever it is,

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:08.868
go after that, you know,

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:10.870
because, when you're a comic,
you learn how to be frugal.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.206
You know, we can live
off of $10,000 a year,

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.575
just learned how to... (laughs)

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:16.910
- It's hard to do.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.011
I need my coffee.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:19.546
I've got...

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:20.814
Wait, what was your job?

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:23.049
You were a CEO at a...

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:23.950
- I know, right.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.185
Fortune 500 company.

00:01:25.185 --> 00:01:26.419
- You're on the road
every weekend now.

00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.854
Now you're not playing Montana.

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:29.923 align:start size:97% position:3%
You're playing the big clubs,
you're selling them out.

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:33.059 align:start size:97% position:3%
They know you from
Workaholics, you're Montez.

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:34.227
Question.

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:37.363 align:start size:97% position:3%
What does tight butthole mean.
(laughs)

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:40.200 align:start size:97% position:3%
That's one of your taglines,
I've seen it on Twitter.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.468
Montez.

00:01:41.468 --> 00:01:43.369
- You saying that is
so frickin' hilarious.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.537
Alright, on the show,

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.072 align:start size:84% position:16%
if something's good,
- Uh-huh.

00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:48.007
the boys call it tight butthole.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.576
- Tight butthole.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.511
- They like your shirt, that
shirt's very tight butthole.

00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:54.380
If something's bad, they
call it loose butthole.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.249 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Loose butthole.
(laughs)

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:57.817
But, you're tight butthole.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:01:59.352
- So this interview right now,

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.787
you're getting a special
with very tight butthole.

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:03.923 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, and I'm
into anal energies.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:07.827
I heard recently, and it was
shocking when I heard this,

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:10.730
that you actually got into a
fight, you punched a heckler.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.831
- Like me in a fight, right?

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:13.066
- Yeah.

00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:14.467
You wear glasses,
you're not violent.

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:17.070 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Sweetest guy in
America right here, okay.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.571 align:start size:88% position:13%
They already tried to
tell the guy to shut up,

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:19.506
but he wouldn't shut up.

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:21.040
So, then he starts in with me.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.343 align:start size:84% position:16%
And then I lit
into him, you know.

00:02:23.343 --> 00:02:25.145
- Lit into him, you got in.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:28.481 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I was on fire and I was
antagonizing him on purpose.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.816 align:start size:81% position:19%
I actually got the
reaction that I

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.018
probably subconsciously wanted.

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:33.887
Then the guy rushed the stage.

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:37.690
- How'd he get up there
with his wheelchair?

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.460
- You motherfucker, you're
not supposed to tell people.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.529
- Alright, both you and
I, we mentioned earlier,

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:43.997
we grew up in LA.
- Grew up in LA.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.533 align:start size:97% position:3%
Similar energies, positivity.
- Tryin' to be.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:48.201
I say, we're both on Instagram.

00:02:48.201 --> 00:02:50.503
I wanna feel like I
can read your body,

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.071
read your...

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.140
- What are you sayin', like
you're gonna be able to see

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.275
you know what's going
on on my Instagram

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.476
without even looking at it,

00:02:56.476 --> 00:02:57.310 align:start size:84% position:16%
is that what you're
trying to say?

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.379
- Yeah. Let's go for it.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.915
This will test how close we are

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:04.083
in terms of two Angelinos.

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.587
Okay, I have my photo chosen.

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.422
- Alright, well let
me pick a photo.

00:03:09.422 --> 00:03:11.958
Oh, I know exactly
what photo to pick.

00:03:11.958 --> 00:03:16.362
- Alright, look at my photo,
I'm gonna guess yours first.

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.965 align:start size:94% position:6%
You're lookin' at, there's
a guy with glasses.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.633
A mustache.

00:03:20.633 --> 00:03:21.467
Cool hair.

00:03:22.335 --> 00:03:23.736
- Really?

00:03:23.736 --> 00:03:24.571
- So, me?

00:03:24.571 --> 00:03:25.772
You're saying it's me.

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.607
On my Instagram, you're
saying that it's me.

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:28.808
Okay, very good.

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:30.510
Let me, let me...
- Was I right?

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.511
Yeah, it's actually...

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:33.046
- It is you!

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:33.980
I was right!

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.315
Okay, now try and read mine.

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:37.717 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yours it probably
like, you know,

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.519
there's a beard.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:40.353
Glasses.

00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:42.589
Probably hair.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:47.393 align:start size:88% position:13%
Maybe it's like an aunt
that you look like.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.761 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Brody] You know what?
- [Eric] Let's see.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.964
- I don't know how you did that

00:03:50.964 --> 00:03:53.533 align:start size:84% position:16%
but, check that out.
- Yes!

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.901
That is my Aunt.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.137
You got it. You read the energy.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:03:59.739 align:start size:84% position:16%
Ladies and gentleman,
- 818 til I die.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.140
my aunt.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.176
There she is, my
father's brother.

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.078
We have Eric Griffin.

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:08.147
Brody and Griffin LA united.

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:09.215
Yeah!

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:10.550 line:0%
Push &amp; Believe.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:11.784 line:0%
(laughs)

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.286 line:0%
- Push and believe?

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.788 line:0%
That's what you say in the
delivery room to your wife.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:17.357 line:0%
- [Both] Push and believe.

00:04:17.357 --> 00:04:19.158 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- Here she is, let me
cut the umbilical chord.

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:20.793 line:0%
- Until a black baby comes out.

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:23.062 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
- You got it. Push
and confusion.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:25.632
