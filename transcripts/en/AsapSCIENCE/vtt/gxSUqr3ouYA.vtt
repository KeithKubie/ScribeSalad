00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Have you ever wondered how related the number of people

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.920
that drown in pools each year is

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.080
to how many Nicolas Cage films are released at the same year?

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:11.160
Turns out the 66.6% 
correlation between the two

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.140
or how about the fact that there is 99.26% correlation between the divorce rate in Maine

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.620
and the per capita consumption margarine

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.860
or %99.79 correlation between spending on science, space and technology

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.180
and the number of suicides by hanging, strangulation and suffocation.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.400
Just because there is a correlation between too variables doesn't mean

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.980
that one causes the other.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.320
This assumption is a logical fallacy

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.060
and yet we are drawn to headlines like

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.680
"People who have more sex make the most money."

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.920
Unfortunately "this" does not always equal "that".

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.680
Even though it may look like it cheese consumption probably isn't related to

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.220
how many people died tangled in their bedsheets.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.480
But sometimes isn't so obvious.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.060
Numerous studies found that menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.020
had a lower than average incidence of heart disease.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.840
Leading doctors to believe that hormone replacement could protect against heart disease.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.100
However when women underwent randomized controlled trials

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.520
they found that hormone replacement therapy actually increased the risk of heart disease.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.640
When the original data was finally reanalysed, it was found that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.620
women who took the therapy were of a higher socio-economic group

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.160
with a better diet and exercise regime.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.600
This was the real cause behind decreased risk of heart disease.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.260
Another case found that those  who used nightlights as a kid were more likely to develop myopia.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.100
But there is actually strong link between parenatal myopia

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.940
and the development of child myopia so in reality myopic parents simply more likely

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.900
to leave light on in their child's bedroom.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.540
These are examples of lurking variable where A does not cause B

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900
but rather C causes them both.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.320
It's a little like taking people who have lung cancer

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.680
and thinking "Hey, they all carrying lighters in their pockets

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.820
so lighters must cause cancer."

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.080
While not realizing that smoking is the confounding variable.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.040
And scientists worked hard in their studies to try avoid this.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.440
But it gets worse when popular media takes advantage of these potentially coincidental correlations.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.240
And one study about chocolate weight-loss connection was actually designed as

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.200
a way to expose how science reporting can be sensationalized.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.160
A science writer with a PhD in Microbiology ran a real clinical trial

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.420
where participants were assigned to three groups.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.480
A low carb diet, a low carb diet plus a 1.5 ounce chocolate bar

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.860
and the group that maintains their regular diet.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.140
At the and of three weeks, the chocolate group did lose the most weight

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.000
but the journalists consciously used terrible science.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.460
He used 15 participants and measured 18 different measurements including weight loss

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.340
cholesteral, sleep quality, blood pressure, well-being etc

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.460
and when you use small group of people and measure a large number of things

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.020
you're pretty much guaranteed to get a statistically significant results

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.440
which Veritasium has an amazing video on here if you wanna check out.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.860
The result could have easily been something different

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.420
such as chocolate correlates to lower blood pressure.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.380
If the study had been peer-reviewed by other researchers

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.320
it would've been called out

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.880
so instead he submitted it to a journal for a fee 600 Euros

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.000
making up a fake instutition name.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.300
The Institute of diet and health.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.420
He then sent out a press release to dozens of the media publications

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.500
and very quickly getting slim by chocolate was front page news.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.980
With that in mind however we can't dismiss correlation entirely.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.900
Correlative evidence is an essential part of science.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.140
Double-blind studies are not always possible or ethical to run

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.060
often leaving correlation is the best evidence available.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.640
When every possible causative relationship is systematically explored

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.620
correlation can be use as a powerful tool for assessing cause and effect relationships

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.540
and progressing science even further.

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.300
Big thanks to Tyler Vigen for providing his charts on this interesting correlations.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.940
