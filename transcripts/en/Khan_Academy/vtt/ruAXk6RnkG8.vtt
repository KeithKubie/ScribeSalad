00:00:00.865 --> 00:00:03.152
- [Voiceover] When
counting by 100s from 43

00:00:03.152 --> 00:00:07.432
to 1,043, which numbers will we say?

00:00:07.432 --> 00:00:09.081
Select all that apply.

00:00:09.081 --> 00:00:10.359
So let's do that.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:14.851
Let's start with 43 , and then

00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:17.196
let's just keep adding 100 to 43.

00:00:17.196 --> 00:00:22.196
So if we add 100 to 43,
we're going to get 143.

00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.539
Now let's keep adding 100 to it.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.956
If we add another 100, we're now going to

00:00:28.956 --> 00:00:33.956
have two hundreds and 43, or 243.

00:00:34.458 --> 00:00:37.198
Now let's keep adding 100 to it.

00:00:37.198 --> 00:00:42.198
So if we add another 100
we're going to have 343.

00:00:43.595 --> 00:00:45.010
I think you see what's going on here.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:50.010
You add 100 again,
you're going to have 443.

00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:52.092
I'm coloring in the 100s place

00:00:52.092 --> 00:00:53.473
so that we can keep track of that.

00:00:53.473 --> 00:00:58.473
You add another 100,
you're going to have 543.

00:00:59.683 --> 00:01:04.683
Then add another 100,
you're going to have 643.

00:01:05.791 --> 00:01:10.791
Add another 100, you're going to have 743.

00:01:12.694 --> 00:01:16.478
Let's keep adding 100, keep adding 100.

00:01:16.478 --> 00:01:21.338
Add another 100, you're going to have 843.

00:01:21.338 --> 00:01:25.896
Add another 100, you're going to have 943.

00:01:25.896 --> 00:01:28.858
Or you can do that as
nine hundreds and 43.

00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:31.668
Or nine hundreds and
four tens and three ones.

00:01:31.668 --> 00:01:33.757
And let's add another 100.

00:01:33.757 --> 00:01:35.754
So if you add another
100, you could view this

00:01:35.754 --> 00:01:40.754
as 10 hundreds and 43.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:45.005
But 10 hundreds is the
same thing as 1,000.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:46.984
So we would read this as 1,043.

00:01:46.984 --> 00:01:49.223
And that's what they
wanted us to count up to

00:01:49.223 --> 00:01:54.223
1,043 is the same thing
as 10 hundreds and 43.

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:56.955
So which of these numbers did we see

00:01:56.955 --> 00:02:01.608
when we counted from 43 to 1,043?

00:02:01.608 --> 00:02:03.599
Well we didn't see 44.

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:05.539
We didn't see 123.

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.858
But we did see 143, so we did see 143.

00:02:09.858 --> 00:02:14.745
We saw 543, we saw 543.

00:02:14.745 --> 00:02:17.858
And we saw 843.

00:02:17.858 --> 00:02:19.657
So we saw these numbers.

00:02:19.657 --> 00:02:20.817
Now you might have been able
to do this in your head.

00:02:20.817 --> 00:02:24.799
You might have said, "OK
43, then 143, then 243,

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.799
343, 443, 543, 643, 743,
843, then 943 and then 1,043.

00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:39.441
Either way, these are the numbers

00:02:39.441 --> 00:02:44.441
that we said when we
counted from 43 to 1,043.

00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.924
These are three of the
numbers that we said.
