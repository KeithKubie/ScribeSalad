00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.620
The answer is that this third
step here is problematic.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.710
And it's problematic because there
are languages where the maximum string

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.490
length is unbounded.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:11.750
Remember that languages can have
an infinite number of strings.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.760
So there are languages where,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.830
no matter what length you pick, there is
a string in the language that is longer.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.450
This union excludes any such language,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:25.440
because each Si is restricted to
having strings of length at most i.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.190
In fact,
none of the languages in this union

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.780
even contain an infinite
number of strings.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.840
One particular language that is
not in this union is sigma star,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.480
the language containing every string.
