PHILIP MORIARTY: We all
know what pi, the

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:03.150
number, looks like.

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.532
But this is what
it sounds like.

00:00:07.532 --> 00:00:11.300
[COMPUTER TONES]

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.920
PHILIP MORIARTY: SO what I've
done is I've taken the digits

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.900
of pi to 3.1415, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.800
And I've mapped those onto
a C major scale.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.380
So basically I've said 1 is C,
2 is D, 3 is E, 4 is F, 5 is

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:28.560
G, et cetera.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.670
And I've gone all the way up--

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.920
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.470
And what you can hear in the
background is the result of a

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.350
computer program, which takes
those digits, converts them to

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.750
the frequencies of those notes,
converts them to the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.190
sound of those notes, and
then plays it back.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.600
And so that's what you're
hearing in the background

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.360
which, when I first did it, I
guess I thought it was going

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.400
to sound not particularly
musical.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.360
But it's remarkable just
in some places how

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.720
musical it can sound.

PHILIP MORIARTY: Pi is a
transcendental number.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:14.330
It's this jumble of digits.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.290
You'd expect it would sign very,
very random, almost like

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.670

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.460
well, if we speak that up quite
a bit, it will sound

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.570
quite atonal--

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.785

[FAST PLAY OF NOTES]

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.130
PHILIP MORIARTY: But because
I've mapped onto a very simple

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.740
musical scale, C major,
you get this--

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.020
on occasion, you get these nice,
little musical motifs, I

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.910
would argue.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:45.890
They don't repeat.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.390
We can't play it on
other instruments.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.880
And then you start to get a bit
more character, and a bit

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.040
more feel as well.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.680
I have really geeked out here.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.610
I've taken the first
42 digits of pi.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.630
And then what I've does
is-- then this is--

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.550
so I learned to play guitar.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.120
I'd no lessons, so those
guitarists who aren't

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.289

standard music notation do

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.530

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.620

[REPLAYS PI MELODY]

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:15.960
PHILIP MORIARTY: Richard
Feynman, who was a really,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.600
really important 20th century
physicist, made contributions

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.680
right across the board.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.185
He had this really very
interesting point about pi

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:27.500
that he brought up, a quite
amusing point in some regards.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.940
And he noted that at the 762nd
digit of pi, you get this six

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.370
nines in a row.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.320
If you look at that, given that
pi is meant to be this

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.840
irrational number, that seems
very, very, very unusual,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.410
particularly because it occurs
so early on in this sequence.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.300
The next time that set of
recurring set of numbers

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.100
occurs, it's something
like-- if I remember,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.040
the 190,000th digit.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.580
And again, it turns out to be
nine, which is, from some

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.810
aspects, rather, rather
surprising.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.870
And so Feynman made the joke
that what he'd really like to

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.430
do is to learn pi off-- and
there's obviously very many

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.910
people who'd like to learn pi
off to x number of digits.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.910
I know it barely past
the sixth digit.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.420
But people can learn it off to
many hundreds of digits.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.960
Feynman wanted to learn it off
to the 762nd digit, and then

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:20.110
go "pi is 3.1415 (TRAILS OFF)
99999 and so on," sort of

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.640
pretending that it's rational
beyond that point, and

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.560
irritating all those people
who've learned off all the

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.740
rest of the digits,
because it's

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.210
irrational beyond that point.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.130
So what we're going to
do now is listen

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.316

That was it.

because they all bleed into

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.145
The only reason you can
differentiate them is because

00:04:46.145 --> 00:04:46.900
the pitch is changing.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:47.620

BRADY HARAN: pi is random.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.360
pi goes forever.

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.350
So somewhere in pi is
Beethoven's Fifth.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.000
PHILIP MORIARTY: Yeah, but
you've got to remember that

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.900
we're actually in the
key of C major here.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.930
So I've mapped that onto
a particular key.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.420
So things outside that key,
like Beethoven's Fifth for

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.850
example, it's impossible
for them to come in

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:22.690
here, because you need--

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.830
in basically in the key
of C, you don't have

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.360
any flats or sharps.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.990
For Beethoven's Fifth, you have
to have those flats and

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.490
sharps in there.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:30.540
So you don't have those there.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.060

like, for example, doe a deer,

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.930

PHILIP MORIARTY: Well, if
it repeats to infin--

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.020
it doesn't repeat.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.040
If it extends to infinity, then,
yes, there's a finite

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.050
probability of finding those
numbers somewhere in there.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.530
Indeed you might argue that if
you code our DNA structure,

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.320
you can code the genome, perhaps
if it extends to

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.340

coded somewhere in pi.
