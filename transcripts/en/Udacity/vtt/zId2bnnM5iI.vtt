00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.137
Now, the only thing that we wanted to
change with this new equation was to plug

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.531
in the symbols square and triangle for the
words that we had before. So, that means

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:12.701
that we only want to change what's right
here and what's right here. That means

00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:16.887
that we can keep the numbers that are
already in the equation in the same

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:22.004
places. So let's just go ahead and bubble
those in. Our substitution rule said that

00:00:22.016 --> 00:00:26.620
we can replace money Grant has left with a
square and number of months with a

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:31.669
triangle, so let's bubble those in. Money
Grant has left comes first so that means

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:37.715
that this square comes first And number of
months comes very last. So that means, the

00:00:37.727 --> 00:00:43.605
triangle, comes at the end. So now, our
equation reads, square = $3,000,000 -

00:00:43.617 --> 00:00:45.125
$100,000 times triangle.
