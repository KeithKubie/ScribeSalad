we've got the hardware selection
 

00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:20.780
we've got the hardware selection
underway and we're nearly ready to get

underway and we're nearly ready to get
 

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.369
underway and we're nearly ready to get
started on the application software

00:11:22.369 --> 00:11:22.379
started on the application software
 

00:11:22.379 --> 00:11:25.009
started on the application software
development in earnest but in order to

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019
development in earnest but in order to
 

00:11:25.019 --> 00:11:27.019
development in earnest but in order to
really kickstart development we need to

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:27.029
really kickstart development we need to
 

00:11:27.029 --> 00:11:29.360
really kickstart development we need to
get some actual hardware into the hands

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:29.370
get some actual hardware into the hands
 

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:31.129
get some actual hardware into the hands
of engineers and product managers and

of engineers and product managers and
 

00:11:31.139 --> 00:11:32.239
of engineers and product managers and
other folks at Google who are going to

other folks at Google who are going to
 

00:11:32.249 --> 00:11:34.759
other folks at Google who are going to
actually build this out but as we said

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:34.769
actually build this out but as we said
 

00:11:34.769 --> 00:11:36.739
actually build this out but as we said
before the hardware that we used in that

00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:36.749
before the hardware that we used in that
 

00:11:36.749 --> 00:11:38.449

proof-of-concept device was just a

00:11:38.449 --> 00:11:38.459
proof-of-concept device was just a
 

00:11:38.459 --> 00:11:40.160
proof-of-concept device was just a
little too slow to use for more than

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.170
little too slow to use for more than
 

00:11:40.170 --> 00:11:42.439
little too slow to use for more than
just a demo so we looked through the

00:11:42.439 --> 00:11:42.449
just a demo so we looked through the
 

00:11:42.449 --> 00:11:44.600
just a demo so we looked through the
Psalms that we had in our pipeline and

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:44.610
Psalms that we had in our pipeline and
 

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.220
Psalms that we had in our pipeline and
found one that met the requirements for

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:46.230
found one that met the requirements for
 

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:49.519
found one that met the requirements for
this category of devices and it happened

00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:49.529
this category of devices and it happened
 

00:11:49.529 --> 00:11:51.590
this category of devices and it happened
to also be very easy to buy in quantity

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600
to also be very easy to buy in quantity
 

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.540
to also be very easy to buy in quantity
over the Internet and we had Android

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:53.550
over the Internet and we had Android
 

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.009
over the Internet and we had Android
things already kind of running pretty

00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019
things already kind of running pretty
 

00:11:55.019 --> 00:11:57.350
things already kind of running pretty
well on it so we decided to use this as

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360
well on it so we decided to use this as
 

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.329
well on it so we decided to use this as
the basis for some provisional hardware

00:11:59.329 --> 00:11:59.339
the basis for some provisional hardware
 

00:11:59.339 --> 00:12:00.920
the basis for some provisional hardware
that we would build to unblock the

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:00.930
that we would build to unblock the
 

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:02.660
that we would build to unblock the
application engineers so that they could

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:02.670
application engineers so that they could
 

00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:05.239
application engineers so that they could
get started on that on their job well we

00:12:05.239 --> 00:12:05.249
get started on that on their job well we
 

00:12:05.249 --> 00:12:07.160
get started on that on their job well we
finished out the hardware bring up we

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:07.170
finished out the hardware bring up we
 

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:08.569
finished out the hardware bring up we
knew that we would swap this hardware

00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579
knew that we would swap this hardware
 

00:12:08.579 --> 00:12:09.829
knew that we would swap this hardware
out later when it got closer to

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839
out later when it got closer to
 

00:12:09.839 --> 00:12:11.989
out later when it got closer to
production but that would didn't that

00:12:11.989 --> 00:12:11.999
production but that would didn't that
 

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:13.759
production but that would didn't that
didn't worry us because as we've said

00:12:13.759 --> 00:12:13.769
didn't worry us because as we've said
 

00:12:13.769 --> 00:12:15.110
didn't worry us because as we've said
we're building on Android things and

00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120
we're building on Android things and
 

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.790
we're building on Android things and
that gives you the isolation from the

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800
that gives you the isolation from the
 

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.590
that gives you the isolation from the
hardware that you need to be able to do

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600
hardware that you need to be able to do
 

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.379
hardware that you need to be able to do
that

00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:23.150
 
the second problem ly we had though with

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160
the second problem ly we had though with
 

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.189
the second problem ly we had though with
the provisional hardware was that it was

00:12:25.189 --> 00:12:25.199
the provisional hardware was that it was
 

00:12:25.199 --> 00:12:26.780
the provisional hardware was that it was
a development board kit similar to the

00:12:26.780 --> 00:12:26.790
a development board kit similar to the
 

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.939
a development board kit similar to the
imx7 kits that were giving out here at

00:12:28.939 --> 00:12:28.949
imx7 kits that were giving out here at
 

00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:31.189
imx7 kits that were giving out here at
i/o which means that it had a display

00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199
i/o which means that it had a display
 

00:12:31.199 --> 00:12:33.379
i/o which means that it had a display
and a camera connected to the baseboard

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:33.389
and a camera connected to the baseboard
 

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:36.199

through flat flex ribbon cables you can

00:12:36.199 --> 00:12:36.209
through flat flex ribbon cables you can
 

00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:37.730
through flat flex ribbon cables you can
obviously work like this but it's a

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:37.740
obviously work like this but it's a
 

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.259
obviously work like this but it's a
little difficult to manage if you have

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:39.269
little difficult to manage if you have
 

00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:40.970
little difficult to manage if you have
more than one on your desk for example

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980
more than one on your desk for example
 

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:43.730
more than one on your desk for example
and we wanted to give these out to a lot

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:43.740
and we wanted to give these out to a lot
 

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.189
and we wanted to give these out to a lot
of Googlers for the first few weeks we

00:12:46.189 --> 00:12:46.199
of Googlers for the first few weeks we
 

00:12:46.199 --> 00:12:47.509
of Googlers for the first few weeks we
literally held the thing together that

00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519
literally held the thing together that
 

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:49.610
literally held the thing together that
are at our desks with cardboard and

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620
are at our desks with cardboard and
 

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.549
are at our desks with cardboard and
rubber bands but that wasn't gonna scale

00:12:52.549 --> 00:12:52.559
rubber bands but that wasn't gonna scale
 

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:54.499
rubber bands but that wasn't gonna scale
to the quantity that we wanted to

00:12:54.499 --> 00:12:54.509
to the quantity that we wanted to
 

00:12:54.509 --> 00:12:57.290
to the quantity that we wanted to
deliver for that we needed a more solid

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.300
deliver for that we needed a more solid
 

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.290
deliver for that we needed a more solid
enclosure to keep everything in one spot

00:12:59.290 --> 00:12:59.300
enclosure to keep everything in one spot
 

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.579
enclosure to keep everything in one spot
and by the way if you do complete the

00:13:01.579 --> 00:13:01.589
and by the way if you do complete the
 

00:13:01.589 --> 00:13:03.319
and by the way if you do complete the
scavenger hunt here at i/o and you get

00:13:03.319 --> 00:13:03.329
scavenger hunt here at i/o and you get
 

00:13:03.329 --> 00:13:05.299
scavenger hunt here at i/o and you get
an imx7 kit make sure to keep the

00:13:05.299 --> 00:13:05.309
an imx7 kit make sure to keep the
 

00:13:05.309 --> 00:13:07.669
an imx7 kit make sure to keep the
packaging it turns into a handy stand so

00:13:07.669 --> 00:13:07.679
packaging it turns into a handy stand so
 

00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:10.549
packaging it turns into a handy stand so
you don't have to build one yourself so

00:13:10.549 --> 00:13:10.559
you don't have to build one yourself so
 

00:13:10.559 --> 00:13:11.960
you don't have to build one yourself so
this is the enclosure we came up with

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:11.970
this is the enclosure we came up with
 

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:14.179
this is the enclosure we came up with
for our first provisional hardware

00:13:14.179 --> 00:13:14.189
for our first provisional hardware
 

00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:16.759
for our first provisional hardware
honestly Android things didn't really

00:13:16.759 --> 00:13:16.769
honestly Android things didn't really
 

00:13:16.769 --> 00:13:18.829
honestly Android things didn't really
help or hurt either way in the building

00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839
help or hurt either way in the building
 

00:13:18.839 --> 00:13:20.780
help or hurt either way in the building
of this case but I had a lot of fun

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:20.790
of this case but I had a lot of fun
 

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:21.800
of this case but I had a lot of fun
making it and I learned

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:21.810
making it and I learned
 

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:24.170
making it and I learned
in the progress in the process so I hope

00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:24.180
in the progress in the process so I hope
 

00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:25.670
in the progress in the process so I hope
you don't mind if I get gout for a few

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680
you don't mind if I get gout for a few
 

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.869
you don't mind if I get gout for a few
minutes and tell you a little bit more

00:13:26.869 --> 00:13:26.879
minutes and tell you a little bit more
 

00:13:26.879 --> 00:13:30.350
minutes and tell you a little bit more
about this design and how we built it it

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360
about this design and how we built it it
 

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.879
about this design and how we built it it
looks pretty plain from the front the

00:13:31.879 --> 00:13:31.889
looks pretty plain from the front the
 

00:13:31.889 --> 00:13:33.259
looks pretty plain from the front the
point is that it's just enough to keep

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:33.269
point is that it's just enough to keep
 

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:34.970
point is that it's just enough to keep
the hardware together and give you a

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:34.980
the hardware together and give you a
 

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.650
the hardware together and give you a
rough sense of the form factor that we

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:36.660
rough sense of the form factor that we
 

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.350
rough sense of the form factor that we
had in mind there is a camera module at

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360
had in mind there is a camera module at
 

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.689
had in mind there is a camera module at
the top some microphones that we had

that I called the bezel here just like

00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399
that I called the bezel here just like
 

00:13:56.399 --> 00:13:57.799

most of the rest of the hardware you can

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:57.809
most of the rest of the hardware you can
 

00:13:57.809 --> 00:13:59.420
most of the rest of the hardware you can
get to most of the ports easily from the

00:13:59.420 --> 00:13:59.430
get to most of the ports easily from the
 

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.970
get to most of the ports easily from the
top and there's a little access for the

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:01.980
top and there's a little access for the
 

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.290
top and there's a little access for the
reset button on the side which is very

00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300
reset button on the side which is very
 

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.509

important when prototyping I want to

00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519
important when prototyping I want to
 

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:07.009

point out here though that pretty much

00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019
point out here though that pretty much
 

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:09.230
point out here though that pretty much
none of these components match the final

00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240
none of these components match the final
 

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.420
none of these components match the final
hardware obviously as we've said the

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:11.430
hardware obviously as we've said the
 

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.160
hardware obviously as we've said the
psalm is different so is the camera so

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:13.170
psalm is different so is the camera so
 

00:14:13.170 --> 00:14:16.220
psalm is different so is the camera so
are the mics so is the display but again

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:16.230
are the mics so is the display but again
 

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:17.449
are the mics so is the display but again
not an issue because we're building

00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459
not an issue because we're building
 

00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:19.429
not an issue because we're building
Android apps on this and they don't

00:14:19.429 --> 00:14:19.439
Android apps on this and they don't
 

00:14:19.439 --> 00:14:21.259
Android apps on this and they don't
really care so much about the specific

00:14:21.259 --> 00:14:21.269
really care so much about the specific

building this prototype was my favorite

00:14:25.429 --> 00:14:25.439
building this prototype was my favorite
 

00:14:25.439 --> 00:14:27.319
building this prototype was my favorite
part of the project because at the time

00:14:27.319 --> 00:14:27.329
part of the project because at the time
 

00:14:27.329 --> 00:14:29.299
part of the project because at the time
the deadlines were far enough away so

00:14:29.299 --> 00:14:29.309
the deadlines were far enough away so
 

00:14:29.309 --> 00:14:30.650
the deadlines were far enough away so
that they don't make that crushing sound

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:30.660
that they don't make that crushing sound
 

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.790
that they don't make that crushing sound
they do when they get a little closer

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800
they do when they get a little closer
 

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.799
they do when they get a little closer
and we were still a small team that

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:33.809
and we were still a small team that
 

00:14:33.809 --> 00:14:35.449
and we were still a small team that
needed to be scrappy and pretty

00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:35.459
needed to be scrappy and pretty
 

00:14:35.459 --> 00:14:37.340
needed to be scrappy and pretty
resourceful so I literally built this

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:37.350
resourceful so I literally built this
 

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.290
resourceful so I literally built this
case in my garage over a few weeks and

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:39.300
case in my garage over a few weeks and
 

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.090
case in my garage over a few weeks and
the best part of that is that I got to

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100
the best part of that is that I got to
 

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.090
the best part of that is that I got to
buy a new tool not just any tool but a

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:44.100
buy a new tool not just any tool but a
 

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.920
buy a new tool not just any tool but a
60 watt laser cutter which of course I

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:45.930
60 watt laser cutter which of course I
 

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:46.850
60 watt laser cutter which of course I
got off the internet

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860
got off the internet
 

00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:49.790
got off the internet
I literally learned how to use a laser

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:49.800
I literally learned how to use a laser
 

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.160
I literally learned how to use a laser
cutter for this project I ate it on the

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:52.170
cutter for this project I ate it on the
 

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.079
cutter for this project I ate it on the
design in my garage over the course of a

00:14:54.079 --> 00:14:54.089
design in my garage over the course of a
 

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:56.119
design in my garage over the course of a
few weekends it was my first time using

00:14:56.119 --> 00:14:56.129
few weekends it was my first time using
 

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:58.220
few weekends it was my first time using
any kind of 3d modeling package to do

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:58.230
any kind of 3d modeling package to do
 

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.199
any kind of 3d modeling package to do
this kind of design my first time ever

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:00.209
this kind of design my first time ever
 

00:15:00.209 --> 00:15:02.809
this kind of design my first time ever
using a laser cutter and I basically

00:15:02.809 --> 00:15:02.819
using a laser cutter and I basically
 

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:04.519
using a laser cutter and I basically
learned by watching videos online and

00:15:04.519 --> 00:15:04.529
learned by watching videos online and
 

00:15:04.529 --> 00:15:06.379
learned by watching videos online and
the point here is that if this is the

00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:06.389
the point here is that if this is the
 

00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:08.360
the point here is that if this is the
kind of thing you like yes you can do it

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:08.370
kind of thing you like yes you can do it
 

00:15:08.370 --> 00:15:09.799
kind of thing you like yes you can do it
too and you'll probably have a lot of

00:15:09.799 --> 00:15:09.809
too and you'll probably have a lot of
 

00:15:09.809 --> 00:15:12.590
too and you'll probably have a lot of
fun doing it the material that I tried

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600
fun doing it the material that I tried
 

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:14.329
fun doing it the material that I tried
first was this birch plywood it's about

00:15:14.329 --> 00:15:14.339
first was this birch plywood it's about
 

00:15:14.339 --> 00:15:16.400
first was this birch plywood it's about
three millimeters thick you can get it

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:16.410
three millimeters thick you can get it
 

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.199
three millimeters thick you can get it

batch of 60 it's maybe a dollar and a

00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:24.870
batch of 60 it's maybe a dollar and a
 

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.230
batch of 60 it's maybe a dollar and a
half a sheet or less so it's pretty cost

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240
half a sheet or less so it's pretty cost
 

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.509
half a sheet or less so it's pretty cost

this out I wasn't very efficient with my
 

00:15:31.019 --> 00:15:33.319
this out I wasn't very efficient with my
material use it would take maybe two or

00:15:33.319 --> 00:15:33.329
material use it would take maybe two or

little more optimized waste a little
 

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.410
little more optimized waste a little
less material and as you see here I

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420
less material and as you see here I
 

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.760
less material and as you see here I
managed to fit the whole case in a

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:43.770
managed to fit the whole case in a
 

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:47.030
managed to fit the whole case in a
single 12-inch square sheet of plywood I

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040
single 12-inch square sheet of plywood I
 

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:49.070
single 12-inch square sheet of plywood I
did have to fit one of the sides inside

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:49.080
did have to fit one of the sides inside
 

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.340
did have to fit one of the sides inside
of the bezel to make that work it was a

00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:52.350
of the bezel to make that work it was a
 

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:54.980
of the bezel to make that work it was a
lot of fun to kind of it was a big

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:54.990
lot of fun to kind of it was a big
 

00:15:54.990 --> 00:15:56.270
lot of fun to kind of it was a big
challenge to figure out how to get this

00:15:56.270 --> 00:15:56.280
challenge to figure out how to get this
 

00:15:56.280 --> 00:15:58.070
challenge to figure out how to get this
all into one sheet of plywood a lot of

00:15:58.070 --> 00:15:58.080
all into one sheet of plywood a lot of
 

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.620
all into one sheet of plywood a lot of
fun to overcome that but laser cutters

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:00.630
fun to overcome that but laser cutters
 

00:16:00.630 --> 00:16:02.810
fun to overcome that but laser cutters
only cut in 2d which meant it's a little

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:02.820
only cut in 2d which meant it's a little
 

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.160
only cut in 2d which meant it's a little
hard to work a fastener like a screw

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:04.170
hard to work a fastener like a screw
 

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.590
hard to work a fastener like a screw
into the into the design so this one is

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600
into the into the design so this one is
 

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.990
into the into the design so this one is
all friction fit I came up with a tab

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000
all friction fit I came up with a tab
 

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.400
all friction fit I came up with a tab
and slot design where you could put it

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:10.410
and slot design where you could put it
 

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:11.630
and slot design where you could put it
together by hand and it would stay

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:11.640
together by hand and it would stay
 

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.790
together by hand and it would stay
together pretty securely and the best

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800
together pretty securely and the best
 

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.200
together pretty securely and the best
part of that was that it was actually

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:15.210
part of that was that it was actually
 

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:17.630
part of that was that it was actually
real easy to service in the field if a

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:17.640
real easy to service in the field if a
 

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.980
real easy to service in the field if a
connector comes loose or you need to

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:18.990
connector comes loose or you need to
 

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:20.990
connector comes loose or you need to
change a jumper you can snap the thing

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000
change a jumper you can snap the thing
 

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.120
change a jumper you can snap the thing
apart with your hands you don't need to

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.130
apart with your hands you don't need to
 

00:16:23.130 --> 00:16:25.100
apart with your hands you don't need to
find a screwdriver you fix it you put it

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.110
find a screwdriver you fix it you put it
 

00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:27.620
find a screwdriver you fix it you put it
back together and you're good to go we

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:27.630
back together and you're good to go we
 

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:29.660

tried a few variations in other

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:29.670
tried a few variations in other
 

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:31.310
tried a few variations in other
materials such as the acrylic you see

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320
materials such as the acrylic you see
 

00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:33.380
materials such as the acrylic you see
here I think it looks much better than

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:33.390
here I think it looks much better than
 

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:35.930
here I think it looks much better than
the wood obviously this semi-transparent

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:35.940
the wood obviously this semi-transparent
 

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.810
the wood obviously this semi-transparent
red is really cool but what we found is

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820
red is really cool but what we found is
 

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.060
red is really cool but what we found is
that in acrylic the thickness for us at

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:41.070
that in acrylic the thickness for us at
 

00:16:41.070 --> 00:16:43.670
