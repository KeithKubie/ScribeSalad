00:00:01.541 --> 00:00:03.495
- [Voiceover] Each small
square in the diagram

00:00:03.495 --> 00:00:06.495
has a side length of one centimeter.

00:00:07.533 --> 00:00:11.243
So, what is the area of the figure?

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:13.798
So, we have this figure down here in blue,

00:00:13.798 --> 00:00:15.395
and we want to know its area.

00:00:15.395 --> 00:00:18.228
Area is the total space it covers.

00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.545
And, we're also told that
each of these little squares

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.450
has a side length of one centimeter.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.232
So, that means that each of these squares

00:00:27.232 --> 00:00:29.315
is one square centimeter.

00:00:30.744 --> 00:00:32.476
So, we can find the area by seeing

00:00:32.476 --> 00:00:37.250
how many square centimeters
does this figure cover?

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.974
One way would be to just try

00:00:39.974 --> 00:00:43.375
to draw the little square
centimeters and count them.

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.543
There's one square
centimeter, there's two,

00:00:45.543 --> 00:00:47.519
and so on and keep counting them

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.843
all the way through.

00:00:49.843 --> 00:00:52.040
Or, what we could do

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.208
is we could look at this

00:00:53.208 --> 00:00:56.208
and try to break it into two shapes.

00:00:57.555 --> 00:00:59.555
So we can say down here,

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:01.683
into two rectangles.

00:01:01.683 --> 00:01:04.947
Down here we have one rectangle,

00:01:04.947 --> 00:01:08.197
and up here we have a second rectangle.

00:01:10.743 --> 00:01:13.548
And then we can find the
area of each rectangle

00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:17.019
and add it together to find the total area

00:01:17.019 --> 00:01:18.936
that the figure covers.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.396
Down here on the bottom, we have two rows

00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:25.286
of unit squares.

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:27.757
And each of those has one, two,

00:01:27.757 --> 00:01:30.257
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:01:31.536 --> 00:01:34.403
So, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:01:34.403 --> 00:01:37.903
So there's two rows of seven unit squares,

00:01:39.268 --> 00:01:40.826
or seven square centimeters,

00:01:40.826 --> 00:01:44.993
so the bottom rectangle is made
up of 14 square centimeters.

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.842
It covers 14 square centimeters.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.864
And the top rectangle,

00:01:51.864 --> 00:01:56.031
let's see we have one row,
two, three, four, five rows.

00:01:59.378 --> 00:02:03.135
And each of those rows has
one, two square centimeters,

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:07.302
so we have five rows of two
square centimeters, or 10.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.761
So, this top rectangle
here that we have in blue

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:16.518
covers 10 square centimeters,

00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:20.685
plus the bottom rectangle
that we outlined in green

00:02:21.931 --> 00:02:24.348
covers 14 square centimeters,

00:02:25.402 --> 00:02:26.402
so in total,

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:29.949
the entire figure covers 24

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:32.148
square

00:02:34.248 --> 00:02:35.248
centimeters.

00:02:36.103 --> 00:02:39.916
So, 24 square centimeters is our area,

00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:43.892
because area is how much
space does it cover,

00:02:43.892 --> 00:02:48.059
and we figured out that it
covered 24 square centimeters.
