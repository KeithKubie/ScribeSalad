ANKUR KOTWAL: Hi.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.120
I hope you're ready to see
all the exciting new stuff

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.690
we have added in Google
Play services 5.0.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.590
As you already know by now,
Google Play Services rocks.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.060
I'm Ankur Kotwal, and
I've subbed in for Magnus,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.570
as he well, got a
little bit carried away

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.275
with the whole rocks theme.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:24.120
But rest assured,
he's recovering well.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.860
Let's just look at
the latest additions

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.100
in Google Play Services 5.0.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.300
It's one of our biggest
releases to date,

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.030
including new APIs like Android
Wear, the Dynamic Security

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.420
Provider, a major set of
additions to Google Play Games

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.890
Services, and the
App Indexing API.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.050
We've also added new APIs for
Google Cast, Google Drive,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.830
Google Wallet, Analytics
and Mobile Ads.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.710
Whew, let's just dive right in.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.130
The first new API for
Google Play Services 5.0

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.410
is Android Wearable Services.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.450
With the Data API, we can sync
data between Android Wearables,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.140
and Android phones and tablets.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.700
This can be performed
in three steps.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.860
The first is through messages.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.340
These are uni-directional,
fire and forget,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.480
with delivery not
guaranteed, and are

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.820
useful for control signals,
like media playback.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.110
You can use messages to start
intents on the Wearable, too.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.740
Second, you can exchange assets.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.950
These are binary
blogs such as images.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.590
And finally, we have
DataItems, which

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.920
are raw byte arrays
for synchronizing

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.760
data between these devices.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.350
And next new API is the
Dynamic Security Provider.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.510
Think of this as
providing an SSL library

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.590
in Google Play Services.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.200
The advantage of including
this in Google Play Services

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.540
is that the Dynamic Security
Provider will be updated along

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.850
with Google Play
Services, keeping

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.490
the security fixes up-to-date.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.530
Google Play Games Services
is itself not a new API,

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.360
but this time, it has
so many new features

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.949
that we're celebrating
it like a new API.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.300
We've now added quests,
a new set of APIs

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.970
to run time-based
events for players,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.250
and rewards for completing them.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.140
To do this, developers
send game activity data

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.180
to the quest service whenever
a player successfully wins

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.910
a level, stops an alien, or
saves a rare black sheep.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.570
This tells quests what's
going on in the game,

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.960
and developers can use that game
activity to create new quests.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.840
By running quests
on a regular basis,

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.350
developers can create an
unlimited number of new player

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.980
experiences to drive
re-engagement and retention.

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.720
Saved Games is a
new snapshot API,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.700
so developers can store a
player's game progress for use

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.920
across many screens, along with
a cover image, description,

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.930
and the time played.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.320
Players never need
to complete level

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.410
one again by having their
progress stored with Google,

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.730
and can see where they left
off when developers attach

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.650
a cover image and description.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.240
Game Profile collects
a user's achievements,

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.820
and rewards them with
experience points.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.170
To activate experience
points, you only

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.110
need to confirm point
distribution in the Google Play

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.370
developer console.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.860
In fact, you don't even
need to update your games

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.190
to activate experience points.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.310
These sets of features are going
to drive up gamer engagement,

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.740
whilst allowing them to pick
up a game on their phone,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.050
and continue it on their tablet.

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:45.550
Maybe soon, gamers
could be interacting

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.150
on their Android Wearables, too.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.230
Exciting times ahead.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.260
The App Indexing API
provides a way for developers

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.170
to notify Google
about deep links

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.390
in their native
mobile applications,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.900
and drive additional
user engagement.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.040
Integrating with
the App Indexing API

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.580
allows the Google Search app
to serve your app's history

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.640
to users as instant
search suggestions,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.610
providing fast and easy
access to those inner pages

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.360
in your app.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.570
The deep links reported using
the Apps Indexing API are also

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.080
used by Google to index
your app's content,

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.280
and surface them as deep links
to the Google search results.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.030
How awesome is that?

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.620
Now let's look at updates
to existing APIs starting

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.540
with Google Cast, which now has
media tracks that enable closed

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.090
caption support for Chromecast.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.250
Finally, I can watch my
TV shows late at night

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.520
with the volume
low, and still know

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.400
what's happening on screen.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.230
I love captions.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.510
The Google Drive API is getting
very useful enhancements.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.750
Query results can be sorted.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.090
Folders can now be
created offline,

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.220
and the file picker can
be filtered by mime type.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.410
Building great apps with the
Google Drive storage backend

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.810
has never been easier.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.630
With all these awesome
APIs, your apps

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.110
are going to go where
they've never been before.

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:20.150
So, what should we look at next?

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.080
Ah, yes, let's dive into ways
that we can drive monetization.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.310
And now ladies and gentleman,
here is my new favorite

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.630
Wallet API, Save card to Google.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.720
Wallet objects from Google
take physical objects,

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.450
like loyalty cards and
offers from your wallet,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.920
and store it in the cloud.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.470
When a user clicks the
Save card to Google button,

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.840
the offer gets
saved, and shows up

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.970
in the user's Google Wallet app.

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.770
And here's the best part.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.830
Geo-fenced in-store
notifications

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.960
prompt the user to show
and scan digital cards

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.800
at point-of-sales terminals,
driving higher redemption.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.940
This also frees the
user from having

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.230
to carry around offers
and loyalty cards,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.480
and provides a great
purchasing experience.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.540
In fact, merchants are
happier because they

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.220
get increased offer
proliferation.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.790
Customers are
happier because they

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.530
don't need to carry so many
of their loyalty cards.

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.870
And developers are happier
for connecting these consumers

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.100
to merchants.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.630
Google Analytics has
introduced Enhanced Ecommerce,

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.600
which provides visibility into
the full customer journey.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.360
Adding the ability to measure
product impressions, product

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.040
clicks, view product
details, adding a product

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.340
to shopping cart, initiating
a checkout process,

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.090
internal promotions,
transactions, and refunds.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.490
Together they help users
to gain deeper insights

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.740
into the performance
of their business,

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:04.110
including how far users progress
through that shopping funnel,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.220
and where they're abandoning
in the purchasing process.

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.300
Enhanced Ecommerce allows users
to analyze the effectiveness

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.310
of their marketing and
merchandising effort,

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.780
including the impact of
internal promotions, coupons,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:22.230
and affiliate
marketing programs.

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.170
Google Mobile Ads are a great
way to monetize your apps,

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.580
and with Google
Play Services 5.0,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:32.210
you now have access to
better in-app purchase ads.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.670
We've also made improvements to
the Play Store in-app purchase

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.550
API client, so it requires
less effort to integrate.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.270
Well folks, Google Play
Services 5.0 is huge

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.050
and it's rolled out
to devices everywhere.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:48.500
So now it's your turn.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:53.260
Show us what you can build
with these awesome APIs.
