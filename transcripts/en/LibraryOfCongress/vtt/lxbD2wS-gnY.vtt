00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.450 position:56%
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: Welcome everybody.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.750
I'm George Barnum.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.310
I'm the president of
the Chesapeake chapter,

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.310
and we're delighted
that you're here.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.480
This is the third time that we
have done one of these events

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.120
for our [inaudible] fellows.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.360
It seems unbelievable that this
is the third class of [inaudible],

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.910
and we're delighted to have
three of the five of us here

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.830
and giving presentations.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.680
Mike Denker, known to many of
us in this room but perhaps not

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.200
to the fellows so much and to
others, was a really beloved

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.040 position:56%
and faithful member of this chapter.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.140
He was the president
for a long time.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.570
Above and beyond that,
he was really one

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.150
of the coolest people
that ever lived.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.860
And when he was taken from
us four or so years ago,

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.420
the chapter did a certain amount
of searching around for a way

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.000 position:56%
to honor his contributions to us,
and there were lots and lots of ways

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.210
to describe Mike, all of them
laudatory, but he was a builder.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.910
He was a builder by
profession, and he was a builder.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.820
He was a builder of
friendship and of relationships

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.120
between students and [inaudible].

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.590 position:56%
So we felt that our Denker
fellowship is a way to sort of honor

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.690
that and hope to sort
of carry him on.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.660
Bringing students into the chapter,
getting them hooked up if we can

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:04.680
with people who are active
and working in the chapter,

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.720
and also to open up
the wonderful world

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.110
of the American Printing
History Association to them.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.700
We're going to be working this
year under [inaudible] to sort

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.360
of formalize the Denker fellowship
a little bit more than it has been

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.210
in our own heads and to find more
ways to get the fellows together

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.140
with people and to
offer more opportunities

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.170
than we've done up to this point.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.910
So that will be coming along.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.740
And it is the time of year
when we are recruiting

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.880
for the 2017 class of fellows.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.900
So the way that we do this seems to
work best when it's face to face,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.670
when it's somebody knows.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.010
So if you know somebody who
would be a likely person

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.560
to be a Denker fellow next year,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.470 position:56%
about the only requirement we really
have is they have to be a student.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.000
But beyond that, we are
a very broad church here,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.300
and the application process
is hardly even a process.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.040
So talk to Casey or to me
or to Chris [inaudible].

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.920
I have a couple of chapter
announcements to make.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.470
We have, thank goodness, a slate
for chapter elections coming up,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.050
and Chris tells me that the
ballots are in the mail.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.400
So look for them and
return them promptly.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:40.170
And we are going to be planning a
holiday get together of some kind,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:45.360
so stay tuned and watch
the email for that.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.710
Casey, do you have any words?

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.130
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] beautiful
[inaudible] for sale, only $20.

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.730
You can find those on the website.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.530
I brought a couple today so
you can take a look at them.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.040
I think those two are already sold.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.400
&gt;&gt; Twenty-five.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.530
&gt;&gt; It's 25 online because
that includes the shipping.

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.420
&gt;&gt; And an expert.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.220
&gt;&gt; And an expert.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:18.440
[ Inaudible Comments ]

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.370
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: So, without
any further [inaudible] about,

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.100
I will introduce Susanne Allen,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.940
who will then pass it
along to the other two.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.240
Susanne, please.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.510
&gt;&gt; Susanne Allen: Thank you.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:39.040
[ Applause ]

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.340
Good afternoon.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.640
I'm Susanne Allen.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.960
I finished in the [inaudible] book
program at Corcoran [phonetic]

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.730
in May, and while I
was in the program,

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.600
received the Denker fellowship,
and it was great honor

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.350
to receive a fellowship of an honor

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:04.570
of such a beloved member
of your chapter.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.440
While I was in the
Corcoran, I did a short paper

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:17.730 position:56%
on a man names Simon Bening, who you
will see in this talk is the father

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.330
of the [inaudible] I'm
going to talk about.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.870 position:56%
He lived in the 1500s, 1400s, 1500s.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:32.020
He was an illuminator
of manuscripts.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.890
He was a painter, a [inaudible],
and he was at the top of his art.

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:42.790
He was one of the most well-known
illuminators in Europe at the time.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.200
So I'll talk about
him a little bit more.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.810
So we're going to talk
about Levina Teerlinc.

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:56.400
Pantrix [phonetic] is
the feminine of painter.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.400
Levina Teerlinc was a rarity.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.900
She was a successful
woman artist [inaudible].

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.380 position:56%
She served all four Tudor
monarchs, in particular Elizabeth I.

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.630
She was a simple woman
and friend to Elizabeth,

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.930
and she painted miniature
portraits of the queen.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.660
Teerlinc was born 1510
to 1520 in Flanders,

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.400
the eldest of Simon
Bening's five daughters,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:29.030
and the only one known
to work as an artist.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.440
Her heritage as illuminator,
miniaturist, scribner [phonetic]

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:37.170
and calligrapher can be traced
to her father and grandfather.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.620
Simon and Sanders Bening,
masters of a specialized art form,

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.870
the illuminated manuscript.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.270
They worked with other noted
painters on the Grimani Breviary,

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:54.070
circa 1510, which is
a book of prayers.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.870
The Grimani Breviary has 1670 pages

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.690
of which 120 are full
page miniatures.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.400
It represents the height of Flemish
manuscripts within the nation.

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:09.360
The Marfond [phonetic] Library

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.760
at Yale University holds a
facsimile copy of the Breviary,

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.810
and one of their curators
said, "the borders of this page

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.830
and many others throughout
the Breviary are filled

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.290
with exquisite [inaudible]
depictions of natural forms.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.960
The [inaudible] elements are a
hallmark of the Bening studio."

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.390
It was famous for these
vary naturalistic borders.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.650
Miniatures developed
from the tradition

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.320
of religious manuscript
illumination.

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.030
The miniatures in the
Grimani Breviary are part

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.170
of an enormous book,

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:47.280
while Teerlinc's miniatures
were usually painted

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:50.840
in vellum glued to playing cards.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:56.370
They could be as small as a
little over 1-1/2 inches by less

00:07:56.370 --> 00:08:01.240
than 1-1/4 inches, to the works
I will show you are engaged,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.230
excuse me, enlarged many times.

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:08.030
Working on a tiny surface,
Teerlinc created realistic images

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.940
of Elizabeth and other
figures in the court.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:16.370
An accident at birth sent
Teerlinc on her career path.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.520
She had no brother to take
over her father's studio,

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.790
so Simon taught her his art.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:27.050
His studio produced
magnificent one of a kind books,

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:32.830
but as Susan James says in the
feminine dynamic in English art,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.820
"Simon Bening took Flemish
illumination to its final zenith.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.100
It was an art form which became
obsolete upon his death."

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.480
Illuminated manuscripts were in
decline because of the invention

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.010
of the printing press
and movable type,

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:54.290
but Teerlinc's skills
were transferable.

00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.680
She used them to forge a
career in service to Royalty.

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:06.390
By the late 1530s, she had
finished her apprenticeship

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:10.460
and became a fully fledged
member of her father's workshop.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:15.060
She was admitted to the Rogue
Painters Guild, which was required

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:17.280
for her career as a miniaturist.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.400
She married George Teerlinc,

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:26.030
the son of a prosperous gentry
family between 1540 and 1542.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:31.580
The couple moved to England in
1546 when Catherine Parr, the sixth

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.640
and last queen of Henry
VIII, hired Teerlinc

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:39.710
as court painter after
Hans Holbein died.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.410
The Teerlincs were
invited to live in London

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:47.810
because Catherine Parr had learned
of Levina's skills as an artist.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:51.860
George Teerlinc's career
was secondary to his wife's.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:56.600 position:56%
He promoted himself as an aristocrat
and became a gentleman pensioner,

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.410
the male equivalent
of a maid of honor.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:04.980
This helped advance both his

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.890
and his wife's position
at the English court.

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:13.400
Susan Frye, author of Pens and
Needles, Women's Textualities

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.360
in Early Modern England, says,
"George may have been a dealer

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.960
in tapestries, textiles and
artwork produced in the Netherlands

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:27.650
and it's likely that he acted
as an agent for his wife.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.990 position:56%
Levina Teerlinc probably spent the
period immediately after her arrival

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:35.850
in England working for Queen
Catherine and her sister,

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.940
Ann Parr, a prominent art patron.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:46.350
After Henry VIII died, Teerlinc
worked for Edward VI and Mary I,

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:51.100
and when Elizabeth became queen
in 1558, Teerlinc was retained

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:55.670
as a miniaturist for
the rest of her life.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:58.110
As court painter to Elizabeth,

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.870
she was paid the salary
of 40 pounds a year.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:06.630
In addition, she received 20 pounds
a year directly from Elizabeth.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:10.910 position:56%
This was twice what Hans Holbein had
received and more than the salary

00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:13.780
of Nicholas Hilliard, a
celebrated court painter,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.650
who is better known
today than Teerlinc.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:23.120
Hilliard's salary did not reach
40 pounds a year until 1599.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.440
Another woman artist,

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.190
Susanna Horenbout paved
the way for Teerlinc.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:36.010 position:56%
She was from the Netherlands and was
active from the 1520s to the 1540s.

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.890
She was trained by her father,
the artist Gerard Horenbout,

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:42.050
and her brother, Lucas, was
a well-known miniaturist.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:45.990
Henry VIII brought the
Horenbout family to England

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:50.460
to paint portrait miniatures
and illuminated manuscripts.

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:54.790
Horenbout may have
lived into the 1550s.

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:58.250
By 1554 or earlier, she had died.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.060 position:56%
Now I'll talk about Teerlinc's work.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:07.400
Teerlinc worked for Edward
VI, Henry VIII's son.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.480
In summer of 1547 at the beginning
of Edward's reign, Teerlinc appears

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.190
on the list of the King's artists.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.410
Her appearance on this list
was a unique achievement

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:22.650
for a 16th century woman, and
it's even more significant

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.290
because she is listed first.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:30.350
The record shows that in 1552,
Teerlinc presented a group

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.460
of miniatures to the King
as a New Year's gift.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:37.860
When Mary came to the
thrown in 1553,

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.180
Teerlinc was retained
as court painter.

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:47.450 position:56%
The earliest surviving examples of
Teerlinc's art is a portrait of Mary

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:54.240
on the Coram Rege Roll
of October 1553.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.600
Coram Rege Rolls were records of
the proceedings of the King's bench

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.890
where the text of the roll always
began with a capital P for pasita,

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:07.320
which is a public port or assembly.

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.290
Mary's portrait was
painted within the P,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.710
but you can't see the whole P,
but you can see Mary's portrait.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.820
The P is surrounding the
portrait, but I can't,

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:24.240
I'm not able to show you the
whole letter P. Also for Mary,

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.040
Teerlinc made an illuminated
manuscript, Queen Mary's manual

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.280
for blessing cramp rings
and touching for the evil,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.490
the rituals of the royal
healing ceremonies.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:43.430
This is circa 1553 to 1558, so
it could have been about in any

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:46.070
of the five years of Mary's reign.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:50.760
Cramp rings were given to women to
ward off the pain of menstruation

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:56.050
and childbirth, and I don't
know what they looked like.

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.560
[laughter] So that's
the description.

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.870
And here is the manuscript.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:06.280
Touching for the evil refers
to the ritual of the king

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.520
or queen touching a person
suffering from scropula [phonetic],

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.720 position:56%
and inflammation of the lymph glands

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.050
that can cause hearing
loss and blindness.

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:20.240
The recto [phonetic] is titled, the
Ceremony for the Healing of Them

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.010
that be Diseased with
the King's Evil.

00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.980
The borso [phonetic] shows
Mary applying the royal touch.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.750
And there she is.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:31.070
There's a little boy,
a little [inaudible],

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:35.590
and she's applying
the touch [inaudible].

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:40.910
When Elizabeth became queen in
1558, Teerlinc became a gentlewoman

00:14:40.910 --> 00:14:43.360
and friend to the monarch.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.120
She was talented at
making her way in court.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.040
Susan James says although
technically a royal servant,

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:55.440
Teerlinc appears to have been
accepted at the English court

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.960
as an honorary aristocrat.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.200
She had known Elizabeth since
the latter was 11 years old.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.980
Because of her presence
in the royal chamber,

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.230
Teerlinc had significant
influence with the queen.

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.340
In Elizabeth's court, New
Year's Day was an occasion

00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.130
for giving lavish gifts.

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:21.960
From 1558 to 1576, Teerlinc
painted miniatures that she gave

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.840
to the queen as New Year's gifts.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.680
This is a partial list of her
work, and these are extracts

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:34.510 position:56%
from the official records so you see
the differences in the spellings.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:39.040
[ Background Noise ]

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:43.350
In a box finally painted, look at
the way finely painted is spelled.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:56.330
And finely painted on the first
line, 1559, is spelled differently.

00:15:56.330 --> 00:15:59.210
And her last name, Terlyng,

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.120
there's another spelling
of Terling, and Taolyng.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:06.160
So the spellings are not consistent
at all, the spellings of her name.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:11.250
Elizabeth did not like to sit
for portraits, but she is known

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:17.250
to have sat for five artists,
including Teerlinc in 1551

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:20.620
and Nicholas Hilliard in 1572.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.290
Susan James says Teerlinc's
miniatures were intimate private

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:29.990
gifts, evidence of the close
bond shared by these two women.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:32.710
Painted for the queen's eyes only,

00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:34.850
they represent a private
conversation

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.400
between ruler and artist.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.300
Teerlinc had access to the queen

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.340
that a male painter
would not have had.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:45.990
Susan James says that
Teerlinc's work helped Mary

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:50.780 position:56%
and Elizabeth assert their God-given
right to rule England by ensuring

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:54.380
that their images were
prominently displayed.

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:58.400
In addition to miniatures,
portraits, and manuscripts,

00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:02.320
it's likely that Teerlinc created
[inaudible] legal documents

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.270
and designed seals,
coins, and needlework.

00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:08.850
Scholars attribute
designs for the great seal

00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:10.870
of Elizabeth I to Teerlinc.

00:17:10.870 --> 00:17:15.100
The designs were executed
by another artist.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:22.430
In 1573, a manual entitled A Very
Proper Treatise wherein is breefley

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:26.830
set forth the art of Limming,
never put in print before his time.

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:30.290
The title on this one
is a little different

00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:32.790
because it's a different edition,

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:35.040
but it was published
anonymously in 1573.

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.180
Limming refers to miniature
painting.

00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:43.620
James believes that
Teerlinc wrote the manual,

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:46.710
thus ensuring that the art of
miniature painting would be passed

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:49.450
onto a new generation of artist.

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.070
A Very Proper Treatise was a
detailed how to manual intended

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:58.010
for painters who wanted to
learn the art of miniatures.

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.700
It was useful because
miniatures were very popular

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.840
with Elizabeth in her court.

00:18:02.840 --> 00:18:07.030
The queen exchanged them with other
European rules, women who wore them

00:18:07.030 --> 00:18:09.850
as jewelry, and they
were given and received

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.810
in romantic and courtship rituals.

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.300
To talk about Levina
Teerlinc's work,

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:19.100
I need to also discuss
Nicholas Hilliard.

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:23.050
Hilliard lived from 1547 to 1619,

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.550
so he was 30 to 40 years
younger than Teerlinc.

00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:30.280
In about 1570, Hilliard
became a miniature painter

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.040
to Queen Elizabeth.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.710
Thus, Teerlinc and Hilliard were
painting miniatures during the same

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:40.230
period since Teerlinc
lived until 1576.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:44.660
Roy Strong, a prominent art
historian, and Susan James believed

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.500
that Teerlinc taught
Nicholas Hilliard his art.

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:53.300
But art historians differ in their
opinions about which Teerlinc

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:58.280
or Hilliary executed some of
the works and caution is needed.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:01.540
Some works originally attributed

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:05.670
to Hilliard have been more
recently attributed to Teerlinc,

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:08.600
especially by feminist art critics.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:11.990
Teerlinc did not sign her
work, and very few miniatures

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.390
from this period exist, to
attribution is difficult.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:21.710
Roy Strong and other critics
have associated Teerlinc

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:26.710
with an important miniature
known as an Elizabethan Maundy.

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:31.380
Painted around 1565, it illustrates
the queen washing the feet

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:35.840
of poor women on Maundy Thursday,
the day before Good Friday.

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:39.880
However, Susan James believes
Teerlinc did not paint

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.410
this miniature.

00:19:41.410 --> 00:19:48.040
The Lute miniature, circa 1574
to 1576, has been attributed

00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:50.940
to both Hilliard and Teerlinc.

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:53.500
Strong and other scholars
have associated Teerlinc

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:57.000
with less sophisticated
miniature portraits of Elizabeth

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.410
as princess and as queen.

00:19:58.410 --> 00:20:01.290 position:56%
And this is Elizabeth as a princess,

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.990
and you can see how
small the diameter is.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:09.920
This is thousands of times bigger.

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.610
This is Elizabeth as
queen of England.

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:18.950
This is a miniature of Lady
Catherine Grey, Elizabeth's cousin

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:22.350
and a possible successor
to the throne.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:25.810
This is Mary Dudley, Lady Sidney.

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.820 position:56%
And this is Lady Hunsdon [phonetic].

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.640
These are some of Teerlinc's
miniatures.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.990
Strong writes that in these
miniatures and Elizabethan Maundy,

00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:40.240
the figures are not
particularly well drawn.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.810
They are typically elongated, and
the arms are always very thin.

00:20:44.810 --> 00:20:48.150
You can see them there,
very thin arms.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.440
He says the draftsman ship is weak
and the painting is thin; however,

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.610
he also says that Teerlinc's
work shows a degree

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.960
of innovation in subject matter.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.080
Her miniatures may be
lacking in technique,

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:03.730
but the fact that they were
created by a woman artist

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.090 position:56%
in the Tudor era makes them notable.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:09.520
A side-by-side comparison
of Teerlinc's

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:14.060
and Hilliard's work shows
differences in technique.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:19.140 position:56%
The rose is miniature on the right,
is generally attributed to Hilliard.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.530
The miniature shows
great delicacy of touch,

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.450
and Elizabeth's expression
is serene.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.870
The miniature of Elizabeth as
queen of England attributed

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:31.520
to Teerlinc is less refined.

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.510
It shows a more girlish
queen with an expression

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:38.560
that is not uncheerful
but also a little blank.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.520
Susan Durand in the
Myth of Elizabeth says

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:45.530
that in Hilliard's miniature the
white roses in Elizabeth's hair

00:21:45.530 --> 00:21:51.640
and pinned to her dress signify the
chastity of a marriageable maiden.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.750
The same flowers are
present in portraits

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.370
of other young unmarried women.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:22:00.760
In the queen's black and white
costume, white symbolizes purity,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:05.540
simplicity, faithfulness and
joy, all desirable qualities

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.880
in a woman seeking
a marriage partner.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.260
In this case, black stands for
constancy, not [inaudible].

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.530
During the first eight months of
1572, Elizabeth was negotiating

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:22.560
for marriage with the French
Duke of Anjou, and it's likely

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.340
that the miniature was
painted with this in mind.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.010
I've talked about Levina's work.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:32.990 position:56%
Let me give you a little more
information on the rest of her life.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:41.410
In 1547 or 1548, Levina and George
Teerlinc traveled back to Flanders.

00:22:41.410 --> 00:22:45.400
She was pregnant on their return
to English, and her son, Marcus,

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:50.040
was born in 1548 or 1549
in Calet [phonetic].

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.980
Calet belonged to English
at the time,

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.040 position:56%
and the Teerlincs wanted their son
to be a subject of the English crown

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.220
so he could inherit
property in English.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:06.160
In 1566, her husband leased land
in Stepney, a district of London,

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.590
and built a house for the
large sum of 500 pounds.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:16.550
The same year, she and her husband
and son became English citizens.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:20.280
Little known today, her
career almost entirely exists

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.410
by her successor Hilliard.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:26.700
Teerlinc is nevertheless an example
of a talented women succeeding

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:29.320
in a field dominated by men.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.580 position:56%
Look closely, and you will find her.

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.070
First, in her father's
workshop, learning her trade,

00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:40.630
and later painting with a minute
brush on a tiny piece of velum,

00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:44.110
capturing Elizabeth's likeness
for the queen's pleasure

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:47.500
and for foreign princes
and diplomats.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:54.020
Teerlinc died on June 23,
1576, probably in Stepney.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:59.460
She was between 56 and 66 years
old at the time of her death.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.590
She was buried at the St.
Dunstan Parish church in Stepney.

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.750
No portrait of her has been found.

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.550
Thank you.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.700

do questions at the end.

My name is Malia Balas, and
first I want to thank you all

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:32.790
for having me here to share my
testimonial with all of you.

00:24:32.790 --> 00:24:40.350
I'm here to talk about my
experience and how I grew

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:45.780
into the [inaudible] love
throughout my years of college.

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.570
First, to give you a brief
background about me, I was born

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:51.740
and raised in the Pocono Mountains
in Pennsylvania, and I'm the oldest

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:54.560
of three siblings and
the first in my family

00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.140
to pursue a degree
in the field of arts.

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:03.640
Though I excelled in other fields,
I felt that my passion [inaudible],

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.200 position:56%
so my parents were extremely
supportive and not at all surprised,

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:11.090
especially when I chose a
competitive program really close

00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:12.390
to home.

00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:15.920
So then I began my studies
as a communication student

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.180
at [inaudible] University.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.710
Fast forward to my sophomore year.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.960
It's the spring of 2014, and
everyone was starting to line

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.320
up their summer jobs,
and I was not having it

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.740
with going back to
the retail business.

00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:36.330
I was ready to get work in the
program that I was growing to love.

00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:40.030
I wanted to do something
with design,

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.020
so I approached professor
Ann Lemon [phonetic],

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.970
who came here with me today
to see if she had any advice.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:50.900
I didn't have any classes under
her instruction, but she seemed

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.110
like a very approached and
sociable lady, so I thought, hey,

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:56.930
maybe she has some advice
that she could give me.

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.670
And she told me, well, I'll
keep my eyes open to see

00:26:00.670 --> 00:26:03.820
if anybody wants a sophomore
on their team, but hey,

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:06.680
I'm doing this project
over the summer.

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.500
One of my fellow faculty members
just donated a letter press

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:15.270
to the university, and I would
love to see this go up and running

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:18.040
so that students would
use it by the fall.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.010 position:56%
But it is a lot of work, and I
don't think I can do this on my own.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.650
So do you want to be my intern?

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:27.480
And it didn't take much
thought for me to say yes,

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.740
even though I had zero knowledge
of letter press at that point.

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:32.690
I was ready to explore
this new form of art

00:26:32.690 --> 00:26:37.410 position:56%
that I had thought was lost in time.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:41.580
So, I showed up to room 209,
and by the looks of things,

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.860
I knew I was ready to earn my keep.

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:50.480 position:56%
I saw a stack of rusted galley trays
and composing strips in one corner,

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:56.100 position:56%
and a box of ink that looked like it
had been resurrected from the 1960s,

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.860
and just a pile of type drawers

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:03.360
that had a thick layer
of dust covering it.

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.980
See many of our type drawers
had either been donated

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.170 position:56%
from the university precomputer age,

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:16.640
or they were donated
by the local newspaper.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.220
Regardless, the type drawers
were all being exhumed

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:25.990
from old dusty basements,
and they just had a piece

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.230
of cardboard duct taped
to the top of it,

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:32.060
so none of the pieces
were in the right spot.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.520
So when I wasn't scrubbing rust
off of trays, I was learning

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.310
to navigate California [inaudible]
forward and backward and sideways.

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:47.880
We developed this machine
to try to get all the dust

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:51.840 position:56%
out of the little nooks and
crannies of all of the type drawers.

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.630
It was a lot of work.

00:27:55.630 --> 00:28:00.090
[laughter] It was kind
of fun though.

00:28:00.090 --> 00:28:05.020
It was like kids on
Christmas morning or one

00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.200
of our friends [inaudible] would
bring up these type drawers

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.270
from the basement,
and we'd open them,

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:14.770
and the reactions would vary
from, ooh, 72 [inaudible]

00:28:14.770 --> 00:28:20.310
to like, oh 10 [inaudible].

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:26.880
So after a few weeks, the
room somewhat started,

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:29.170
maybe started to make sense.

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:34.620
We took a lot of supply tips and
organization tips from our friends

00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:37.980
at Light Graffiti, and we
tweaked them around a bit

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.950
in our little 10 foot by 6 foot
room that we called a studio.

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:47.850
So after hours of laborious
organization,

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:53.230
we finally had our very own
tabletop C and D pilot press.

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:58.310
The room was complete with three
type drawers, one set of furniture,

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:01.720
and about a dozen cans
of very old paint.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.720
Anyway, once the press
had been up and running,

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:13.030
we decided to name it the Landis
Press after Professor John Landis,

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.220
who had taught at [inaudible]
University.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.620
He had taught many
of my own professors,

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:21.070
and he was an advocated
of hand-done work.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:25.090
He really stressed the
value in taking your time

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:28.670
and putting the effort
into your work.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:33.200
In fact, it was only when he
went on sabbatical for a semester

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.610
that the university was able to
pull the presses out of the room

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:38.740
and replace them with computers.

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:42.730
Anyway, once we had the press
up and running, we had the honor

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:49.400
of inviting him back for a
little induction ceremony.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:54.280
They're we announced the official
opening of the press complete

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:55.580
with the cutting of a ribbon.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.230
So after the press was
officially open for student use,

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.170
I was given permission by the
head of our design department

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:03.180 position:56%
to host some group sessions in order

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:06.770
to give an introductory
course on letter press.

00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:10.930
It was a simple two-hour course
where fellow students could come in

00:30:10.930 --> 00:30:14.260
and they could see type
other than on the screen

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:18.010
and they could quick print
a little piece of their own

00:30:18.010 --> 00:30:22.420
so that maybe they could use
letter presses [inaudible].

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.850
So most of my junior
year was spent teaching,

00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:28.490
and then slowly making small
improvements to the room.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.920
Getting new ink, procuring
more type,

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.370
and exploring new methods
of printing.

00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:36.290
We started printing on everything,

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:40.760
from tape to cardboard
to linoleum block.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:43.880
We had a little wall there
of our experimentation.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.290
One of our experiments, we tried
getting these little cut pieces

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:49.590
of paper printed.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:51.790
It comes out very good.

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:57.070
Fuzzy. Regardless, it
was fun experimentation.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:59.860
I was able to help many of my
peers utilize the press as well.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:03.520
We would make everything from
little coasters to posters

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:05.890
and then I would make
my own holiday cards

00:31:05.890 --> 00:31:08.900
and spread some of those around.

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:13.220
We even made our own prints
to sell at local [inaudible].

00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:18.830
So in comes my senior year,
and as part of our program,

00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:22.790
we are to have an internship
for credit.

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:26.360
And I was getting ready to intern
at a small package design company

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.000
in West [inaudible],
and Ann approaches me

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.440
with a proposition of hers.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:34.330
For the past few years,
she has overseen a project

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:38.580
for the [inaudible] historical
society and paired with them

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:42.860
to make a publication
entitled Along the [inaudible].

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.430
For that project, she would
pair a student or duo together,

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:53.990
and they would make a
nicely laid out layout book

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:57.460
that would be filled
with local history.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:32:03.800
And each year the student or duo
would make a nicely laid out spread

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.380
of the book and design a dust
jacket that would be conceptual

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.680
to the theme of that year.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:13.720
The year 2016 was planned to be all

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.880
about the town bicentennial
celebration.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:19.250 position:56%
The historical society had this idea

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:23.020
to create a memorabilia
of artifacts.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:28.620
They had brought together all these
old items from past celebrations,

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.250
and they wanted to
put them all together

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.550
and preserve them in a book.

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:37.220
To make a long story
short, the two students

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.580
who had started the project,
they were amazing designers,

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.580
but they were unable to
see the project through.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:48.450
So that's when Ann approached
me and asked if I would pick

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.880
up the project where
it was left off.

00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:55.040
And it seemed like an interesting
topic as well as a great way

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.460
to build my portfolio as a senior.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:00.070
So I agreed.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:04.540
So as many of you are probably
aware, whenever you take

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:09.040
over a project from someone
else, it can be a nightmare,

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.650
and for me this was like
being handed a jigsaw puzzle

00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:17.250
where I knew all the pieces were
there, but getting them to fit

00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:18.860
in the right spot was a mess.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:23.300
Between rebuilding a corrupted
file and then losing photos

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:27.090
and getting some old documents
[inaudible] the surprises never

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:28.720
seemed to end.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.810
Thankfully I had some amazing
photos that were taken by one

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:33.790
of the previous students
who had worked on it,

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:39.220
and they had already started a nice
grid to work from, and thank God,

00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:42.180
I had some of the most
patient people working with me

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:45.390
because this was already
about three months past due,

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.530
and there were 12 rounds
of revision between me

00:33:48.530 --> 00:33:51.130
and getting this book off to print.

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.520
Also, while I was working
on the interior,

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.830
I was consistently tinkering
with the book's cover,

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:00.170
what I wanted to do for that.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:02.780
The dust jackets in past
years had been letter pressed,

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.350
so we wanted to keep
that tradition going.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:10.780 position:56%
However, in the past years, they had
used polymer plates, and I thought,

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.600
wouldn't it be great if
we printed the jacket

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.450 position:56%
with bare boned hand-set metal type.

00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:20.510
And it seemed like a
great idea at the time,

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:24.980
but I did not know what I
was getting myself into.

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.720
But it would have great
historical significance.

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.180
I mean most of the type that we
had was historic to the university

00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:34.000
or the town, and the local
paper that we featured

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.290
in the interior of the book.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:41.680
Well, I don't [inaudible] that
idea in mind, and just the concept

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.340
that I would challenge myself
to make the most complicated

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.750
that I had ever attempted.

00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:51.180
I wanted the cover to be minimal
while still stretching the idea

00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:54.230
of what could be done with our
very modest collection of type.

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.340
I spent hours pouring over
images and tutorials of how

00:34:57.340 --> 00:34:59.990
to make angles work with
metal type and trying

00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.190
to break out of that grid.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:09.160
When the interior was all about
round ten, we took this lock-up,

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.340
wrapped it in cellophane and
bubble wrap and put it in a box

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:16.250
and drove it down from Pennsylvania
to Delaware to our friends

00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:20.150
at Light Graffiti, where they
helped us fill in the little gaps

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:23.700
that were missing in this
lock-up and assisted us

00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:26.860
in printing the covers
on their [inaudible].

00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:31.030
We decided that we would print
with just black and white

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:35.550
to match the scheme
of past celebrations

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:40.210
and to keep the minimal
historical feel.

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:45.430
The exterior of the jacket
shows the finished product,

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:48.640
and the interior cover
shows the lock-up

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.420
that was used to print the jacket.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.470
So shortly after the
jackets were printed,

00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:57.430 position:56%
the interior of the book was printed
and bound as well, and in the end,

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:02.090
we had just over 70
copies all put together.

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:04.220
I worked really hard
to show off the amount

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.330
of design the Landis
Press had to offer.

00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:10.510
Not just in the cover but
also in the chapter headers.

[ Background Noise ]

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.980
All in all, the book tells a great
story of historic [inaudible]

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:23.700
and memorabilia and
celebrations that have gone by.

00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.970
Since graduating in the
spring, I've been working

00:36:27.970 --> 00:36:30.570
at a small [inaudible] design
company in Westchester,

Pennsylvania just outside of Philly.

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:37.390
There we develop gateways and
vehicle pedestrian signage

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:39.300
for cities all across the nation

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:43.590
from Anchorage to Austin
to Annapolis.

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:46.570 position:56%
I'm able to get back to the Landis
press every once in a while and work

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.490
on a few projects of my own.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:52.370
I recently was able to print
out some Mother's Day cards

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:54.600
and tried my hand the first time

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:58.590
on wedding invitations
for a friend of mine.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.250
My experience in letter press
and print making has allowed me

00:37:01.250 --> 00:37:05.020
to develop a passion for
detailed and hand-done work,

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:07.460 position:56%
and I'm extremely thankful for that.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.020
I continue to bring that
into my work every day,

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:12.670
and while my current placement
does not allow me the funds

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:16.780
to have my own press, I plan
to one day fire one of my own

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.930
so that I can continue to push my
skills and really develop that form

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:25.640
of art that I have learned a lot
about for the past few years.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.440
Thank you.

name is Jodi Hoover.

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.570
I am also very honored to be
one of your Denker fellows.

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.790
I'm here today to talk about,

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:45.380
a little bit about my
research and my artwork.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:50.860
I am currently a part-time MFA
candidate at Towson University.

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:55.340
I'm also working full time as
a liberation at the University

00:37:55.340 --> 00:38:00.080
of Maryland in Baltimore county,
which explains why I'm known

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.260
to any [inaudible] apologize.

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:10.980
So, and some of you may also know
me as I think this chapter has been

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:14.520
up to see Vivian and Edgar
[inaudible] book collection,

00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:18.570
and I was the person like who
ran things all over the place.

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:26.220
I worked with them since 2001,
so, anyway, [inaudible] book.

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:31.740
So as an artist I've always been
interested in combining words

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.270
and images to tell stories.

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:38.980 position:56%
My undergraduate degree is in
illustration, but I quickly realized

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:44.280
that commercial illustration work
was not going to be fruitful.

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.900
When I was in [inaudible] print
making and artist books that way

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:52.020
of working really clicked
for me because I could,

00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:56.750
it was a way that would allow
me to tell my stories and

00:38:56.750 --> 00:38:59.390
yet retain complete control over
my materials, over the process

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:04.390
that I used to bind [inaudible].

00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:11.700
So this one of my books that is
very [inaudible] based on a couple

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:17.220 position:56%
of Bible verses in Revelations of a
[inaudible] that destroys the world.

00:39:17.220 --> 00:39:23.180
And this is another one
where I worked with a friend,

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:25.990
had taken on microfiction class

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:29.460
and so her story worked
really well with my books

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:32.620
because I like keeping
the text like very,

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:35.410
very minimal so that you
can actually [inaudible]

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:39.500
because I understand that
part of the experience

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:42.720
with artists' books is often
not being able to like sit

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.090
and hang out with them for hours.

00:39:46.090 --> 00:39:55.010
So this is about, I guess
it's now a love triangle.

00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:56.320
[laughter] So alongside

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.740
of my [inaudible] books,
I've created drawings.

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:03.220
The drawings were sort of
[inaudible] story telling process.

00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:07.280
I was thinking about
snapshots, sort of a quick window

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:11.540
into revealing a character,
and again, you know,

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:15.460 position:56%
they're very illustrative,
reactions [inaudible] sort of mixed.

00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.760
So like some people would be like,

00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:20.320
I don't get this [inaudible]
for it whatever.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.830
Then some people would
comment and tell me

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:26.780 position:56%
like really elaborates stories about
what they thought was going on.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.160
Of course those are the
people that I loved, so,

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:35.040
and like sometimes they were
just about me telling jokes.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:39.060
Like for [inaudible] these two
guys who, you know, they are really

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.940
into each other, but the
one doesn't have any feet,

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:49.080 position:56%
and the other doesn't have any
wings, so this interaction was going

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:51.440
to be really [inaudible]
be together.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:59.470
Anyway, [inaudible] studio practice
going, I've also earned a degree,

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:03.690
a master's degree in library
science, and I've been working

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:07.550
as a full-time librarian for
seven or eight years now.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:16.690
And in the summer of 2013, I
was misdiagnosed, but I was told

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:19.460
that I was going blind,
and that there was nothing

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.700
that they could do about it.

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:25.300
Thankfully that was completely
untrue, but I was like,

00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:29.150
you know what, I have an
opportunity where I can go back

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:31.450
to school, I'm going to do it.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.970
So I applied to the
[inaudible] program

00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:41.030
and started there in
the fall of 2014.

00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:43.920
When I applied for this fellowship
and also when I started school,

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:47.270
I really thought that I was going
be doing a lot of print making,

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:50.960
that I was going to be doing
some letter press work,

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.420
and I have done a little bit
of that, but as, you know,

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:57.040
our programs sometimes go,

00:41:57.040 --> 00:42:01.060
once you're there you end up doing
something completely different.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:04.940
So we're going to talk about
drawing because [inaudible].

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.310
But in case you don't know,

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:11.470
Towson actually has a
quite lovely print shop.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:13.200
And that's another picture.

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.110
In the beginning of every
semester they don't let students

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:19.060
into the shop until they
can pass a skills test,

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:21.480
so there's some beautiful few weeks

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:25.770
where like only grad students
have the combination to shops,

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:30.500
and if you want to go in
and use like three tables

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:32.420
and like all the things, you can
because no one else is there.

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:36.060
So that is me being really happy
when I believe Saturday night

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:42.370
when I was a giant nerd and ended
up at the shop by myself for hours.

00:42:42.370 --> 00:42:47.600
So my research interests have
ended up moving down [inaudible].

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.590
My family is Pennsylvania German.

00:42:49.590 --> 00:42:54.420
I don't know, if you guys know,

00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:56.660
Pennsylvania German
groups are actually divided

00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.540
into two categories.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:00.130
There's the fancy Pennsylvania
Germans.

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:05.130
Those are the ones that
have the [inaudible] signs.

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.700
Mostly I believe Lutheran
and Methodist,

00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:11.920
and then there's the plain
Pennsylvania Germans,

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:14.040
and those are the Amish
and Mennonite.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:18.310
The Amish and the Mennonites
only [inaudible] 25 percent

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:23.660
of Pennsylvania German population
[inaudible] so a small percent.

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:30.970
And my family is Mennonite
from Lancaster county.

00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:34.840
And so I started looking
at traditional Amish

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.980
and Mennonite quilting patterns,
so not the block designs,

00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:46.530 position:56%
but the actual hand-stitched
quilting patterns, and taking a look

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:49.750
at the different variations
used in those.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.900
So this one is from a book
that I was looking at.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:59.300
The one on the right is
quilted by my grandmother,

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.910
who was an amazing
quilter and also a painter

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:08.360
and furniture maker [inaudible]
really not much she couldn't do.

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:14.540 position:56%
In addition, I also started
looking at Pennsylvania [inaudible],

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:18.990 position:56%
which I was not previously aware of.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:26.970
These were things created
mostly between 1740 and 1860.

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:31.580
Generally small, always on paper,
colored with ink rather than paint.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.680
And they were used to
commemorate important events,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:40.280
so like a birth or a baptism.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:44.970
More prevalent within the
fancy Pennsylvania groups

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:49.790
but also [inaudible].

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:56.150
For me and my aesthetic, I was
delighted to discover, you know,

00:44:56.150 --> 00:45:02.320
beautiful, crazy flowers
and creatures and just sort

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:08.810
of some beautiful folk art design
work that really appealed to me.

00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:12.480
There's been a lot written on
what the different things mean.

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:16.310
Some people are like flowers
mean one thing, and you know,

00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:20.800
the lady with wings is an angel,
the different kinds of birds

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.090
and different things, but what I
found really interesting is there's

00:45:25.090 --> 00:45:30.050
also just some weird stuff that
people cannot fully explain.

00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:32.960
Like mermaids show up.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.430 position:56%
Now they are no longer [inaudible]
bible or in Pennsylvania [laughter],

00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:39.760
so it's just kind of
this weird thing,

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.790
but they're like I don't know
why they decided on mermaids,

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:46.610
but it's something that
definitely shows up.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:55.330
So I started to draw, and you know,
these were just some early drawings

00:45:55.330 --> 00:46:00.120
where I was looking at different
ways that I could combine

00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:06.060 position:56%
that sort aesthetic [inaudible] into
the way that I like to see things.

00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:10.960
The radio towers always
appeared in my other drawings,

00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.900
sort of [inaudible] communication.

00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:19.340
So I was playing around with that.

00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.100
And then as I was going through
this process, I started to think

00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:27.050
about ways that I could get text
incorporated into the drawings.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:30.240
And [inaudible] story telling.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:33.360
I went back to my roots,
my illustration roots,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:35.870
and was really looking at a lot

00:46:35.870 --> 00:46:38.590
of different children's
books and reading.

00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:42.290
There was not a lot of critical
analysis of children's book art.

00:46:42.290 --> 00:46:43.890
There should be, but there is not.

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:47.330
So I was reading some things
about that, but really thinking

00:46:47.330 --> 00:46:51.070
about how-- because if
anybody is trying to write

00:46:51.070 --> 00:46:52.720
for children's books,
right, it's hard.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.160
People will tell you it's one
of the most difficult types

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.020
of writing that's done because we
have to communicate a lot of things

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:05.010
in some very simple sentences,
and then thinking a way

00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:09.150 position:56%
that that hangs out and [inaudible].

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:12.110
So these are just [inaudible]
books in my collection.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:20.820
And so this is kind
of where we end up.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:23.110
So one of the pieces I've
been working on recently.

00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:29.960
This was the first one and what
turned into a series of three.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.000
It fairly large for me.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.770
It's 42 x 34, and so it's
on [inaudible] paper,

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:41.320
and the final piece is then
stretched like a canvas

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:45.700
after the drawing was finished,
so it was a little nerve wracking.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.000
I actually drew [inaudible]
picture [inaudible]

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.380
and so what I was doing is
once the paper was [inaudible],

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.530
I have it out on the table,
and I use acrylic ink.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:02.790
And because the paper is treated,
the ink doesn't dry right away,

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:06.470
so as the ink is drying I
come back into the studio

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:10.800
and tip the paper to make it run.

00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:17.850
And then that dictated
the structure.

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:25.100 position:56%
So those drips became the building,
and somebody that is used to working

00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:29.330
with like a pretty tight sketch,

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:34.310
particularly when I go
to something this large.

00:48:34.310 --> 00:48:36.690
I [inaudible] so it's
just as it progressed,

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:39.480
I would start adding things
in but not really knowing

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:42.400 position:56%
like how things were going to layer.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:49.280
I used a projector and took the
quilt patterns the stitching

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:52.830
patterns and project them onto
the paper, and then pencil

00:48:52.830 --> 00:48:58.570
and paint them in, which is every
bit as time consuming as it sounds,

00:48:58.570 --> 00:49:03.500
and considering how much I
resisted learning how to quilt,

00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.180
like I can barely sew,

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:10.040
my grandmother would have
thought this was hilarious

00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:16.580
because it is actually very similar
to how you would put the patterns

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.490
on the fabric in order
to quilt them.

00:49:20.490 --> 00:49:29.550
So one of the last things I did
with this was put in the text.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:31.500
It was [inaudible] access
point for the drawing

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.220
where like I was creating
this really weird drawing,

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:39.060
and people needed to have some sort
of way to enter that and just sort

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.870
of get an idea of where I am.

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:49.530 position:56%
Specifically I went with [inaudible]
but there will come a point

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:55.830
where that is difficult for
people to read, and so it sort of,

00:49:55.830 --> 00:50:01.260
there's a point at which, I don't
know, it means more of a mystery.

00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.800
To get some of that
texture on the little house,

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.950
it's like a thin paper
collage and then oil pastel,

00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:12.350
so I'll show you on
one of the others.

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:15.400
There's a lot of dimension
to the drawings.

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.960
This was the second one in
that series that [inaudible]

00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:25.630
so again using that same
technique I just sort of,

00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:32.640
the ogre didn't actually appear in
this until about halfway through.

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:33.940
I wasn't sure.

00:50:33.940 --> 00:50:38.740
And the full sentence is the
ogre regretted her choice,

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:40.500
and I know that it's
supposed to be ogress,

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:44.470
but ogress is a terrifying
word, so I changed to ogre.

00:50:46.650 --> 00:50:48.750
And then you can see hopefully
a little bit on the drawing

00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:56.880
on the right taken at an angle, so
I used thin paper to sort of build

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:04.450
up that figure so it really
has a texture [inaudible].

00:51:04.450 --> 00:51:08.830
[Inaudible] so the
little [inaudible] guy

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:13.630
that we're moving through, I
mean I think this is happy ending

00:51:13.630 --> 00:51:15.310
because the wind is happy.

00:51:15.310 --> 00:51:19.850 position:56%
It might not be as happy because of
the little masked buy, I don't know.

00:51:19.850 --> 00:51:23.690
We're going to [inaudible].

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:31.370 position:56%
And this one too, again, using those
quilt patterns as a way to enhance

00:51:31.370 --> 00:51:33.460
and obscure and really
messing around with the idea

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:40.580
that the space can be three
dimensional but also flat as I went

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:43.460
through and kind of hidden,

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:47.750
kind of put that leftward
fadeout even on the paper.

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:52.860
This was one that I
recently finished.

00:51:52.860 --> 00:51:59.430
It doesn't have the text, but
I used [inaudible] that ended

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:04.390
up getting wrecked for
reasons we won't go into.

00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:10.240
This is actually on canvas,
so it's drawing on canvas.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.980
I refer to them as drawings,

00:52:11.980 --> 00:52:13.360
and we're probably
[inaudible] at this point.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.880
And again the house shows
up, and [inaudible].

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:26.810
And then I added in, I was looking
the Victorian era children's books

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:36.070
with the black and white
drawings, and added in this bunny.

00:52:36.070 --> 00:52:39.280
The title is [inaudible] were
small, and I [inaudible] sort

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:48.100
of a fairy god mother,
guardian angel type thing

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:52.720
but also a little ominous
because we don't know [inaudible].

00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.380
I will show you very quickly
this exceptionally [inaudible]

00:52:56.380 --> 00:53:04.080
of a drawing that I'm
currently working on,

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:09.210
although is on canvas,
so [inaudible].

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:15.400
Again, the flowers, the types
of things you're going to see

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:18.960
in the [inaudible] examining
the ink, as a way of sort

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.260
of forming like [inaudible].

00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:23.270
I think this is going to be about
bees, but the bees haven't shown

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:27.000
up yet, but I'm confident
that they will,

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.360
nor have I completely decided what
sort of text [inaudible] with this.

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:38.210
[Inaudible] a couple
details of how that looks.

00:53:38.210 --> 00:53:43.910
Again, this is kind
of like [inaudible].

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:55.060
It's like 30 by 40, I
think, 32 by 40 or so.

00:53:55.060 --> 00:53:58.120
They're fairly large.

00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.850
What's next?

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:04.050
I am going to hang it up, going to
be in an exhibition in the spring

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.750
with [inaudible] artist
named Rob Blair [phonetic].

00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:13.940
He does ceramic monsters that are
very like mechanical, like crazy,

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:17.610
[inaudible] so I think that
my like nature monsters,

00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:22.660
fairytale monsters will
fit in well with his.

00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:26.360
Because I'm part-time and because
the Towson program is 60 credits,

00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:29.850

it would take me three years.

the fall of 2018,

more books in here somewhere.

01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:02.440
But there's a couple,
there's a couple instances too

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:07.610
where the wonder [inaudible] shows
up, which is like the man fish

01:02:07.610 --> 01:02:09.190
with like feet and [inaudible],

01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:16.980
and like they think that it was
printed on paper that came through

01:02:16.980 --> 01:02:21.820
and so, those sorts of bits
were collected as inspiration,

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.510
but disconnected from the meaning.

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:41.040

&gt;&gt; George Barnum: Well I think one
of the things that has impressed us,

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:53.890
now all three times, is not only
the quality of these presentations,

01:02:53.890 --> 01:02:55.680
over all [inaudible],
but the variety,

01:02:55.680 --> 01:03:00.900
and I think this is very much
in the spirit of the person

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:07.060
in whose honor we are here.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.630
He would be [inaudible].

01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:14.560
We have a small token of
appreciation for the three

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.510
of you, our chapter [inaudible].

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:26.050
[ Inaudible Comments ]

01:03:26.050 --> 01:03:29.030
I also need to say as usual, and
we can never say this enough times,

01:03:29.030 --> 01:03:30.800
our thanks to Martin [inaudible].

01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:32.600
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.110
[ Applause ]

01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:38.130
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: [Inaudible]
for hosting us so graciously,

01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:40.230
and we have some [inaudible].

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:43.090
&gt;&gt; I'm always happy
to have you here.

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:48.180
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: So, [inaudible]
there are, there's a little bit

01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:49.500
of [inaudible] over
there on the table.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.760
There are pickup cards
about the chapter

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:56.150
and about the Denker fellowship
[inaudible] also there.

01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:58.610
&gt;&gt; Please take one of
the [inaudible] that one

01:03:58.610 --> 01:04:01.600
of our former Denker
fellows, [inaudible].

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.300
I think there are enough
for everybody.

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:10.510
&gt;&gt; George Barnum: And thank you.

01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:13.700
