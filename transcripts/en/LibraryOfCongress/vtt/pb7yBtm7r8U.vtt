00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.030
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Hello
everyone and welcome to our panel

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.250
on Artists' Rights and
the Digital Marketplace.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.540
The goal of our panel tonight
is to facilitate a conversation

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.240 position:56%
about artists' rights and about some

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.590
of the issues surrounding
getting paid for our work

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.460
in the digital marketplace.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.380
We've assembled an excellent
panel of music professionals

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.110
who will share their different
perspectives on the issues.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.780 position:56%
And after hearing from them, we will
look forward to hearing from you

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.270
about your questions and concerns.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630
So, we have some heavy
hitters with us tonight.

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:01.360
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about who's here on our panel.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.590 position:56%
Maria Schneider who is doing her
week long-jazz residency here at LC,

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.270
is a world renown composer
and leader

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.530
of the Maria Schneider Orchestra.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.930
She has received five Grammy
awards for her recordings,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.490
the most recent being, the most
recent two being Best Arrangement

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.370
instruments and vocals for her
collaboration with the late,

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.610 position:56%
great David Bowie, on the single
called Sue, or In a Season of Crime.

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.900
And Best Large Jazz Ensemble album

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.890
for her latest work,
the Thompson Fields.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.500
In addition to being
an accomplished artist,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.400
Maria's a very successful
entrepreneur whose 2004 album,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.600
Concert in the Garden, became
historic as the first recording

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.650
to win a Grammy with
internet-only sales.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.840
And that album also pioneered
the crowd funding boom

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.690
as the first album ever released
on the Artist Share platform.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.520
Maria's also a passionate voice
for music advocacy as you're going

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.480
to hear tonight, having
testified before Congress

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.020
about digital rights, appeared
on CNN, and being quoted

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.500
in numerous publications
for her views

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.190
on digital rights and music piracy.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.560
Most recently, she and
concerned colleagues in New York,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.480
have launched a wide
spread campaign on behalf

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.910
of music makers, musicanswers.org.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.780
And you're going to be hearing more
about musicanswers.org very soon.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.650
To my right, John Simson here
is Executive in Residence

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.300
at the Kogod School of Business
at American University here

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.400
in Washington, D.C. He started
out in the music biz in 1971

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.110
as a recording artist
and songwriter.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.230
Since then, John's career has
included stints as a manager,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.940
handling the career of five-time
Grammy, Mary Chapin Carpenter,

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.450
special advisor to Harry Belafonte
for music and TV projects,

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.090
and a 30 year career,
a 30 year career

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.210
as an entertainment lawyer
advising clients on copyright

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.360
and business issues
in film, television,

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.690
music and the visual arts.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.350
John was at the forefront of the
battle for the artist's right

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.550
to be paid in the digital era.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.310
From 2001 to 2010 he served as
the founding executive director

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.340 position:56%
of SoundExchange, an organization he
helped launch to collect royalties

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.080
from internet and satellite
radio services on behalf

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.750
of recording artists
and record labels.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.870
SoundExchange has now distributed
over $2 billion dollars to artists

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.090
and labels since it began.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.100
&gt;&gt; John Simson: If I'd
only had stock options.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.480
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: John is
currently president of the Music

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.050 position:56%
and Entertainment Industry Educators
Association and he also serves

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.030
on our National Recording
Preservation Board here

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.790
at the Library of Congress.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.830
So, we see him a lot.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.280
Spree Wilson in the middle there,
is a singer songwriter who was born

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.790
in Nashville, Tennessee, and
attended Clark University

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.810
in Atlanta, Georgia, where he met
one of his mentors, Dallas Austin.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.130
Dallas was impressed by
Spree's guitar skills

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.760
and offered him an internship
at his famous studio, D.A.R.P.,

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.260
as well as offering him
a recording contract.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.510
Spree turned down the recording
contract, sold his car,

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.390
and bought a one-way ticket
to New York City arriving

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.420
with just a suitcase and a guitar.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.430
Being in the Big Apple, led to
his meeting with his other mentor,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.510
rapper producer Q-Tip, who helped
land Spree a major label deal

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.650
with Jive Records and
ultimately a publishing deal

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.730
with Universal Music Group.

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.700 position:56%
And since then, Spree has co-written
Afrojack's single, The Spark,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.860 position:56%
which I looked at today and realized

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.740
that you've got almost 35
million views for the Spark.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.450
Which has been A listed
on BBC's Radio 1.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.920
In addition, he's co-written
Sin City

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.850
on Good Music Compilation album,
Cruel Summer with Teyana Taylor.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.700
The album went number 1 on the
U.S. top R&amp;B Hip-Hop Albums,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:15.620
U.S. Top Rap Albums, and
number 2 on U.S. Billboard 200.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.920
In addition to Q-Tip,
Spree has collaborated

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.220
with other note-worthy producers
such as Novel, No ID, Jim Jonsin,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.500
Infamous, Malay, Robin Hannibal,
Frequency, and Mark Maxwell.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.510
Please welcome our
panelists tonight.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.030
[ Applause ]

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.160
Even though we're living
in a time when brick

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.580
and mortar record stores have all
but disappeared, the good news is

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.610
in the digital realm, it's never
been easier to share our music.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:55.810 position:56%
But the bad news is also, it's never
been easier to share our music.

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.770
And millions are helping themselves
to it and expecting it for free.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:02.270
So we need to have strategies

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.860
to protect our music
and to get paid for it.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.950
So, my first question
to our panelists is,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.420
and I'm going to address
this to Spree first.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:19.570 position:56%
As we trend, we've transitioned from
a purchase model where people paid

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.150
to buy downloads and physical
CDs, we've transitioned

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.700 position:56%
to an access model where consumers
can stream almost anything they want

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.140
on demand.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.920
What, if anything, about that is
working, and what is not working?

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.620
And what's the financial reality

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.990
that you're living
with, as an artist?

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:40.910
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Well, I think
you have to, I think you have

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.510
to first ask yourself, like what
is it that you're looking for,

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.190
or are hoping for as
an artist, you know.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.490
I mean, the general, most
basic thing that you want

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.170
as a creative is to be heard.

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.230
You want to be seen,
you want your art,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:56.210
to at least mean something
to one person.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:01.110
So, these streaming companies,
like Spotify and Apple Music,

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.120
and things like You tube,
they help you get your music

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.420
and your art out there.

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:11.600
They give you to access to people
in a bigger abundance of, you know,

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:16.180
you can cast a wider net rather
than 24 or 23 years ago, like,

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:17.890
you have to perform
in a club and hope

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:19.470
that like more than
5 people show up.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.770
So, you know.

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.070
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Right.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: So, so yeah, that's
the positive aspect, you know.

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.800
The downside is that there's
no transparency, right.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.800
Like, I put my music on Spotify,
there's music on Youtube,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.210
it racks up a total of like, I
don't know, 30 million views.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.510
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: 35.

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.810
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: 35 million views.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.560
I have a song that's 45
million on Spotify right now.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.940 position:56%
But I have no idea what that equals,
because Spotify in a sense they get

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:53.660 position:56%
to make up their own numbers, right?

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.050
They get to say, well, we're
going to pay you, point, point,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.850
point zero four for your song.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.660
Now where do you get
that number though?

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.480
Like how can you equate, how can
you, like, what is the equation

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.390
that you put this price
tag on this piece of art?

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:15.350
And then they've said, well, on top
of that, you know, if your song is

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:18.150
through a major label,
or you've collaborated

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.470
with somebody who's signed to
a major publishing company,

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:22.170
what we're going to do is we're
going to have this lump sum

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.360
of money and we're pay them.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.500
Now, we're not going to tell
you how much we're paying them,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.580
just know that we're paying them
70% of whatever we're making,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.070
whatever that number is, right?

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.000
So it gives this pile
of money to the labels.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.500 position:56%
And the label says, well we're
doling out the money as best we can.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.020
How much money is it, though?

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:40.320
You just don't know.

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:43.400 position:56%
And so it's still just this thing
of non-transparency that gets passed

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.830
around and all this red tape you
have to go through, like, how much,

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:52.410
how much does 45 million streams
on Spotify equal moneywise?

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:54.010
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: How
much does it translate into?

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.310
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Yeah,
and you just never know.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:58.630
Like you just never know if you're
getting the right amount of money.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.600
I mean for example, like just for
my own personal business out there,

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.950
the song she's referring
to, The Spark,

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:09.210
and on Spotify it has
45 million streams,

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:13.910
it's Afrojack second highest
streamed song on Spotify.

00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:17.090
Every quarter probably it's
streamed at least a million times,

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:18.680
which a quarter is 3 months.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.290
When I get a royalty statement,
they pay in 4 quarters.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:24.200
So every 3 months, I
get a royalty statement.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:26.940
The highest I've ever
been paid on Spotify

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.190
for a million streams, is $60.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:34.990
If that give you any idea of what,

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:38.800
of what a high-stream
song will pay you.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.100
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And, John?

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:41.520
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Now to be
clear that's you being paid

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:43.820
as a songwriter, not as the artist.

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.820
The artist actually gets
paid a little bit more.

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.120
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: A
little bit more, but.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.420
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Yeah,
it's a little bit better.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.720
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: But, but--

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:53.670
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: So you
can eat a nice restaurant,

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.890
as opposed to taking
your friend to a diner.

00:09:56.890 --> 00:09:59.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Simson: I'll go through some
of those numbers in a little bit.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:05.190
Because I've spent my life since
running SoundExchange looking

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.440
at those numbers and
they're pretty pitiful.

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.560
We throw around terms like
ARPU, average revenue per user.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.850
You know, or annual revenue per
user, how much does each user

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.390
of a service like Spotify generate?

00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:22.890
And obviously the problem is there
are some people paying $9.99 a

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.800
month, if you're paying $10 a month
for Spotify, that's $120 a year

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.100
that you're paying for music.

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.400
That's not bad.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.760
If, you know, if 60% of that is
being transferred over to the label

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.200
and the artist to share, $72
you can sit there and 10%,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.510
typically it's 10.5%,
gets transferred

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:41.340
to the song writer
and the publisher.

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.420
So, they're going to make $12.60

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.720
if you're the song
writer and publisher.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:49.390
But remember, the more people
stream, the lower your rate gets.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.150
Because they more they have to pay

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.690
out for the $10 a month
that you're paying.

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.350
So they love people who
subscribe and then don't use it.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:01.470 position:56%
You know, it's kind of like
breakage, but most people use a lot.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:04.590
I can tell you in the first
5 years of SoundExchange,

00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:07.420 position:56%
we logged in 7 billion performances.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.230
And again, it's before Pandora,

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:12.400
before some of the major
streaming services existed.

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.000
2001 to 2006, 7 billion
performances.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: From multiple
locations on the internet.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.300
So everybody--

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.600
&gt;&gt; John Simson: These are all
streaming music, so they'd have

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.150
to be non-interactive, streaming
like college radio stations,

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.120
AOL had a streaming service.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:29.130
CBS, all the broadcasters
who stream on line.

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:30.450
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Can
you explain the difference

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.420
between interactive
and non-interactive?

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:33.720
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Sure.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.520
A non-interactive service
is like Pandora,

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.310
where you can't pick the song
you want when you want it.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:42.170
You can go to Pandora and say,
I want to hear Taylor Swift.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.930 position:56%
And they'll play you a Taylor Swift
song and then they'll play you a lot

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.340
of other songs that they
think you'll want to hear.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.420
It's more like a radio station.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.530
You can't specifically say, in
fact the worse thing to do is say,

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.040
I want to hear this
song by Taylor Swift,

00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.830
because then they can't
play you that song.

00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:59.820
They're not allowed to play you
the song that you asked for,

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:03.100
because they get a compulsory
license from the government.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.010 position:56%
So they can play anything they want.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:07.310
Taylor Swift cannot take
her music off Pandora.

00:12:07.310 --> 00:12:11.460 position:56%
She can take it off Spotify, she can
take it off any interactive services

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:13.270
because in the interactive world

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.830
where you can demand the song
you want, when you want it,

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:17.160
artists have the right to say no.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.820
It's usually their label
that has the right to say no.

00:12:19.820 --> 00:12:23.650
But there is some control there,
which is why you see an artist

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:27.370
like Drake say, I'm going to
give an exclusive to Apple Music.

00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:29.010 position:56%
Or you see an artist like Kanye say,

00:12:29.010 --> 00:12:31.260
I'm giving an exclusive
to Tidal Music.

00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.410
So artists can have those kinds

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.190
of exclusive relationships
in the on demand world.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.270
In the Pandora world, or when
broadcasters stream online,

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.060
called simulcasting,
so I Heart Radio,

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:44.760
where you hear Clear Channel
stations streamed online,

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:48.290
or Bonneville or CBS, any of
the big radio conglomerates.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:51.540
When they stream online, they have
a compulsory license given them

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.400
by the government, and basically
what it says is you can stream

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:56.740
whatever you want,
anything publically released

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.490
in the U.S. is fair game.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:02.070
All you have to do is
pay the royalty rate set

00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.150
by the copyright royalty
board that's located here

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.200
in the Library of Congress.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.560
And you have the data
to SoundExchange

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.480
of what you played, so
they know who to pay.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.690
So, you know, so, non-interactive
is very easy,

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.690
it's kind of a plug and play.

00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:18.920
You know, you basically
start streaming tomorrow

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.220
and no one can sue you.

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:23.090
You have to get about
four licenses to do that.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:26.740
And they're licenses that
people have to give you.

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:29.150
So, it's a very easy situation.

00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:32.730
Spotify and on-demand
services, much more difficult.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:34.900
So for example, when Spotify
needs to stream music,

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:38.820
they have to negotiate a
license with every single owner

00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:40.130
of the master recordings.

00:13:40.130 --> 00:13:42.900
Whoever owns those recordings,
typically record labels,

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.090
which is why the major
labels in order

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:50.080
to let Spotify exist took
20% equity in Spotify.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.460
So the major record labels
are investors in Spotify,

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:55.940
or they have equity, they
are waiting for the IPO.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: And now SoundCloud.

00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.970
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Yeah, this is the
case with pretty much any service

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.220
that needs those massive catalogs
of recordings that are owned

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:06.740
by Universal, Warner, and Sony.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:12.530 position:56%
That they can demand equity to allow
these services to stream on demand.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.610
Think of Spotify, and Apple,
and Tidal and these services

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:18.390
that serve you up records
when you ask for them.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.840
They're the replacement
for record stores, right?

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.450
Because you're getting to
hear exactly what you want,

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:23.750
when you want to hear it.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:25.340 position:56%
Obviously, there are some holdbacks.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.020
Adele didn't put her
record on Spotify, or,

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:29.630
you know, on streaming services.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:34.130
And there's a big battle going
on too between paid services.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.510
You don't get Apple
unless you pay for it.

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.270
You don't get Tidal
unless you pay for it.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.520
You might have a free trial
for a very limited period

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.540
of time, but you have to pay.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:45.860
Spotify has the free tier,
which is the overwhelming tier,

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.470
600 million unique users.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.300
Versus the paid tier,
where there are

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:52.620
about 30 million worldwide users.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:54.570
So you can see, 20 to 1.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:55.870
Pandora, the same way.

00:14:55.870 --> 00:15:02.020
They have both ad supported
service, most of their users are

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.020
on the ad supported free service,
where they don't pay anything.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:10.050 position:56%
Kind of like the old radio model,
you listen to ads and you get music.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:13.220
But, it's interesting, you
pay $4.00 a month to get rid

00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:15.350
of the ads, very few people do.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.240
They're willing to take
the 2 minutes of ads.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.050
I kept yelling at Pandora,
you need 10 minutes of ads.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:22.900
Because that way musicians
actually can make a living,

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:26.380
more people will buy the ad
free because they don't want

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.590
to listen to 10 minutes of ads.

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.230
And it's very interesting,
the free service

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.710
of Pandora generates last
year about $1 billion dollars.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:36.330
Last year $1.1 billion.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:39.290
81 million users, if
you do the math,

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:44.610
they earned about $13
-$14 per person, per year.

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:47.640
Right? Over the air radio, the
Clear Channels of the world

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.990
that you listen to when
you're in your car,

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.440
with their 10 minutes
of advertising.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:54.800
They earn $71 per person, per year.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.990
I already mentioned, Spotify,
if you're paying for it,

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:59.500
$120 per person, per year.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.100
Satellite radio at $15.

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.050
Sirus XM $150 to $160
per person, per year.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.780
So, you can see that
subscription isn't a bad thing

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:10.080
if people are actually paying.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.850
It can generate a liveable
wage, if people are paying.

00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:16.870
If people are not paying,
it's really, really difficult.

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:18.820
And YouTube is the worse.

00:16:18.820 --> 00:16:23.930
Because YouTube with over a billion
users, generated less than 4%

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.440
of the industry's revenue
last year in royalties.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:29.150
So that's the real problem.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.560
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
Speaking of a living wage,

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.590
what would Spree's career look like
in the old days of record stores?

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.170
I mean, compared to the $60
he makes from massive numbers

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:42.380
of people streaming his music.

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.810
What would his career
look like in the old days?

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.110
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Well I think--

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:47.530
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: With just as
many people listening to his music.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:50.270
&gt;&gt; John Simson: The hard part is
translating listens into sales.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:52.450
But for example, I think the
way to look at it would be,

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:55.280
if he had 45 million
listens on the radio,

00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.230 position:56%
how much would ASCAP or BMI pay him?

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:03.920 position:56%
Right? And you know, again, the
rates online have been horribly low.

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.030
Partially because, because of
radio, ASCAP and BMI were locked

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:11.030
into very low rates
with traditional media.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.200
And so when they went online, they
continued to get very low rates,

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.150
kind of mirroring what
they were getting at radio.

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.730
And online music is not
like, really like radio.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.280
It's much more personalized.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.890
It's a much, you know, more
interesting listening experience

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:26.820
and so it's capturing more
and more listening hours,

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:29.090
and yet not paying
out what it should.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.560
And by contrast, SoundExchange
didn't, we didn't have a radio rite

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.920
in the United States
for recording artists.

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.120
That's another problem we
can talk about another time.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.850
The hundreds of millions of
dollars that U.S. artists lose

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.480
because radio stations don't
have to pay them anything.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:48.230 position:56%
But because we didn't have a 3%, 4%
legacy radio rate, we're getting 50%

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:52.420
of Pandora revenue, whereas song
writers are getting 4 or 5%.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.630
So the artists are getting 10
times as much as song writers,

00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:56.650
and that's not fair, frankly.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.580
Song writers should
be getting far more.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.800
You know, these services
need to monetize better.

00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.820
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: If you
don't want it on YouTube,

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.940
you can ask them to take it down.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.400
There's a way to.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.570
It's tortuous.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.620
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: It's a
very, like, she can tell you.

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.620
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: I'd like
to turn it over to Maria,

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.360
to talk about the take downs.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.440
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well, there's
so many things to talk about here.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.840
It's incredible.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.560
One thing just before I go into
that, that I'd like to talk

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:32.180
about because to me, one of the
most eroded royalties and rites

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.890
that I feel is very
frustrating and has been

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:40.950
around since the piano roll, and
that's the mechanical royalty.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:47.470
When something is fixed onto a
record, onto a CD, onto a download,

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:50.070 position:56%
onto a device where you can play it,

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.430
there is a statutory rate
approximately 9 cents a song,

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:58.690
that was always figured into
the cost of making a record.

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:06.270 position:56%
Right? And now, that note, we know,
Spree and I were just talking today,

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.710
about the fact that you can
get, there are all sorts of apps

00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:12.810
out there now, that you can
rip an MP3 off of any video.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.430
You know, in a matter of seconds.

00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:16.980
And have it.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:22.650
And if you can listen it again
on demand again and again,

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.800
we know that this is a
replacement for buying that music.

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.100
We know that.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.820
Because people are not
buying music as much anymore.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:37.230
So if I think about
your 45 million plays,

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.840
and what I believe should
be happening, because to me,

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.020
what really angers me
about the whole business is

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.660
that people are not
looking at the music.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:53.650
Maybe because it's not
fixed in form as an asset.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:58.050
I mean, it used to be in
Tower Records, they would put,

00:19:58.050 --> 00:20:01.560 position:56%
Marshall Gilkes, in my band, he was
just pointing out, remember in Tower

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.730 position:56%
when they put that plastic thing
around so you couldn't steal the CD.

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:09.850
Right? Wrapped a thing of
plastic around this record,

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:14.690
that had to be taken off
when you purchased it.

00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:17.270
So when it was in physical form,

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:19.340
somehow we all looked
it at that way.

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:22.670
Now that it's in digital form,
we aren't looking at it that way.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.260
And so, people aren't looking at,

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.620
at something that costs
money, is of value.

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.910
When I made my record The Thompson
Fields, it was $200,000 to make

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:36.880
that record, pay the
players, the engineers,

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.800 position:56%
the everything, the hours of mixing.

00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:44.520
A year of my time and I did not
include myself in that budget.

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:47.490
Then, I haven't included
the years writing

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.610
that music, preparing that music.

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:53.600 position:56%
This is a $400,000 investment, okay?

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:59.930
So, when my music is played,
I, somewhere, or is distributed

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:04.590
in some kind of way, I want
to set my own price point

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.090
because I know the cost of that.

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:10.800
And if my music, I would
never put my music on Spotify.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:15.050
You could sooner roll
me over in, in whatever.

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:18.950
But, say my music was
on something like that,

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:26.140 position:56%
you can bet I wouldn't want somebody
basing the mechanical royalty

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:31.680
on a percentage of what that
company tells me their profits are.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.540
So, that's how they're figuring
out these mechanical royalties.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:40.110
It's a, it's a percentage of
their net profit and the value

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:44.160
of the big data company is a
very difficult thing to value.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.490
Because their value is
something that grows and grows.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:50.130 position:56%
We know, what's the value of Google?

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:54.360
Google is all that data,
it's all that power,

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:57.620
it's not just the advertising,
it's the data analytics.

00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:00.980
It's the capability that they
know, you know, that this person

00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:03.950
who listens to this music,
all the things that crawl

00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:07.300
around your devices that
know everything that you do.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.730
The data lords are taking, that's
the name of the piece I've written

00:22:10.730 --> 00:22:16.100
for the Library of Congress, Data
Lords, are taking, appropriately.

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:19.520
Are just you know, taking
all this information

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.020
and becoming hugely powerful.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:27.130 position:56%
So, to me, each unique listen, if
somebody listens to more than a half

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:32.400
of your song, they can listen
a thousand times, I don't care.

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.060
But that first time they
listen a full time through,

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:37.700
or let's say two times,
let's be generous

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.300
to the new internet generation.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:46.450
I believe that, that person
automatically should have to pay

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.850
that 9 cents mechanical to you.

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:51.230
And that's, imagine
how huge that would be.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:52.920
I don't know how many unique,

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.170
do you know how many unique
users, listeners you have?

00:22:56.170 --> 00:22:57.470
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: That's
something to look into.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.770
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well, okay.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.550
So let's just say it's 4.5 million.

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:06.580
So you know, if it's 4.5 million
and it's 9 cents, what is that?

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:10.270
&gt;&gt; John Simson: It's a
little under $450,000.

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Scheider: So it's $450,000,

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:19.930
there's a half million
dollars almost,

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:23.200
in his pocket for his mechanicals.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.500
And you know what?

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:27.460
With the kind of use you have,
you should be buying an apartment.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:28.760
I'm sorry.

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:30.060
You know, really?

00:23:30.060 --> 00:23:34.610
So, anyway, the mechanical
royalty erosion is the first thing

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:38.650
that has just, you
know, made me crazy.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:44.970
If you look at these big data
companies and what they're doing,

00:23:44.970 --> 00:23:50.550
and right now the Office of
Copyrights is doing a study

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.850
on safe harbor provisions.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:56.120
And these companies
like YouTube and Google,

00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:00.010
and all the internet companies.

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:07.010
So in 1998 they created
something called the DMCA,

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:11.120
which is the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act.

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.460
It was designed to protect these
ISP's, this is before Napster,

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:18.940
before all these things, these
ISP's that were basically pipelines

00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:22.150
for information coming
through, you know.

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:27.900
And they didn't really know AOL,
you know, Verizon, I don't know,

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:34.590 position:56%
they didn't really know exactly what
was coming through their pipeline.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.620
So they said, we don't
want to be liable.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:44.200
We can't be liable when we
don't even know what's coming

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.500
through the pipes.

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:49.240
So they said okay, so
you get Safe Harbor.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:52.160
But then they created
this, take down.

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.050
I don't know when the
takedown was created.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.920
&gt;&gt; John Simson: It was, it's
part of the negotiation in 512.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:05.380
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Part of
the negotiation, is that people

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:09.890
who were being infringed, if
their work was being infringed,

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:12.710
they could have, file a takedown.

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:16.060
So these companies
had to have some place

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.520
where that person had the
capability to go up and you know,

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.820
and file this takedown notice.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.120
The problem is now with
these new companies.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.420
Look at YouTube.

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.720
This is a modern day
wholesale publishing company.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.020
They are, and they are inducing,
you know, there was a case

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.320
between Viacom and YouTube.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.620
Because Viacom said,
you know, they're,

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.920
they're letting our music come up.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.220
They shouldn't be getting Safe
Harbor and it went to court.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.520
They lost but then Viacom
appealed and the judge looked at it

00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.820
and said there are some
interesting facts here.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.120
I think we're going to send this

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.420
down to the trial court again
and take a look at this.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.720
And there were employees at YouTube
that indicated that they had,

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.020
you know, instigated and
induced this infringement

00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:41.320
which they are not allowed to do.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.620
And that's what the court
was trying to decide.

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:43.920
Is, are these companies aiding
and abetting this infringement?

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.670 position:56%
The answer is without question, yes.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:50.490
All you have to do is go to
YouTube and upload something.

00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:54.070
You upload in 2 seconds
flat, no questions asked.

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:56.710
Nobody says, do you own this?

00:25:56.710 --> 00:26:02.800
Or, so, I can show them in a little
while, I brought up some kind

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.670
of interesting things on YouTube.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:11.500
For instance, you can cue in, or
search no infringement intended.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:16.610
Let's see what happens here,
if we do that, what comes up.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:22.530
Okay. Let me just see if I can
find it easily and quickly.

00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:23.980
No infringement intended.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.330
&gt;&gt; On the e.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:26.720
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
On the e, thank you.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:31.570
There we go.

00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:36.750
You know what, can
you do this for me?

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.050
Because you're.

00:26:38.050 --> 00:26:40.580
No copyright infringement intended.

00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:45.820
659,000 people have uploaded stuff

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:48.220
and it says no copyright
infringement intended.

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.010
I just really want to
share this band, you know.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.090
And then these things get
like millions of views.

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:58.120
So YouTube, I mean, they
know this stuff is there.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.660
And so if you want to take it down
immediately, so there's no warning

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:05.570
that says when you put
it up, exclamation point.

00:27:05.570 --> 00:27:08.110
If you don't own this music,
or you didn't write the music,

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:11.920
or you haven't gotten permission,
you could be in a lot of trouble.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:15.560
But if you want to take your music
down, there's a big yellow thing

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.780
with an exclamation point,
under penalty of perjury,

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.690
you better not be, you
know, taking down something

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:25.670
that isn't yours otherwise you
could be in a lot of trouble

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:28.860 position:56%
and there's question after question.

00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.840 position:56%
It's honest to God, it's incredible.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:35.710
It's, and clearly they want people
to be able to put this stuff up.

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.370
There are people, this week,
I, there was a situation

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:42.880
where I was digging around,
it's fun to dig around YouTube

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.200
to see just how egregious
some of this stuff is.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.250
So I happened to see
a site with just tons

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:50.720
of independent jazz musicians.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.290
I'm a jazz musician, so
I know all these people.

00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:56.440
So a guy might be on, you know,
he had several albums uploaded

00:27:56.440 --> 00:28:03.330
on some young guy's YouTube
channel, hundreds of records.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:06.740
So, I spoke to Clarence, Clarence
said oh my God, that's crazy.

00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.010
So the guy ended up,
he contacted this guy,

00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.330
he ended up taking
his whole site down,

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.770
because I think he got freaked
out, his whole YouTube channel.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.890
And, I found the teacher of this
person, because he was a young guy,

00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:23.980
and I said I want to talk to him,
and find out some things from him.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.030
And I said, I promise I won't use
your name, I won't tell anybody

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.630
about you, I just want
to find out some facts

00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:31.320 position:56%
because there were ads on all these.

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:37.030 position:56%
They were all full albums, full
albums, they all had a string of ads

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:42.940
on them, and he had I think
it was 3.5 million views.

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:47.150 position:56%
Okay? So if you look on YouTube what
they charge for an ad, between 10

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:52.770
and 30 cents, so imagine what
they're bringing, you know, in.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:59.650
So, let's, let's say it's only
one ad on each one for 10 cents,

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:01.640
3.5 million, that's, how much?

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:02.940
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Typically,
YouTube's been paying

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:06.200
out about $2,000 per million views.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.670
And I think, some of the major
companies may get a little bit

00:29:08.670 --> 00:29:10.100
higher rate, but YouTube--

00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.680
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Wait, 2 million what?

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:14.630
&gt;&gt; John Simson: $2,000
per million views.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.220
So it's incredibly low.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.520
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
It's incredibly--

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Simson: But in other words--

00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:20.330
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
What are they taking?

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.510
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Oh, they won't
tell you how much they're making.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.440
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well, what
was interesting with this kid,

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:28.740
I promise I won't tell anybody,
what are you making on those ads?

00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.860
He said, I didn't make anything.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.820
YouTube generated those
ads, it came on their own.

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:36.790
He said I don't know
where the money was going.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.920
And he said, I presumed
that because they did that,

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.150 position:56%
and a lot of the stuff was somewhere
else on YouTube, it was okay.

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:48.450
So, you see, this whole
thing is serving YouTube.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:55.070
It's, it's taking what ours
and taking it away and trying

00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:56.870
to make us feel like
it's doing something good

00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:58.500
for us, and it is not.

00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:02.980
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: A lot of the kids,
like the ones she is referring to.

00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.220
They don't really know that they're
doing anything wrong, you know.

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.090
They have no idea what they're
doing, they're uploading music.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:12.170
And, you know, we talked about
this specific situation, you know,

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.990
this kid thinks the ad money
is going to the artist.

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:19.440
You know, meanwhile, her friend
doesn't even know his music is

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.740
on YouTube.

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.410
He's looking at me like why
is my whole album on YouTube.

00:30:23.410 --> 00:30:27.470
And so it's this whole thing,
like, where, it brings me back

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.970
to my first question,
where is the money?

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:31.270
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:32.570
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Who,
like, who has the money?

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.780
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: I'll
tell you who has it.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:40.040
You know, what it is, it's
a redistribution of wealth.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.700
That's what it is.

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.670
By big data companies.

00:30:43.670 --> 00:30:49.550
So, it's, they use music and this
is my beef with Sony, Universal,

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:55.260
and Warner, and Spotify, too.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:31:00.570
It's like a feeding frenzy here,
everybody panicked what to do,

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:02.500
you know, when things
started to go south

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:05.820
with the internet and file sharing.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:12.260
And so, and I had the perfect
solution and I'm still doing it

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.620
through Artist Share, which I'll
explain later, which is basically

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:18.650
about self-ownership and
selling directly to the fan,

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:22.170
and knowing who the fan
is and owning my own data.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:26.900 position:56%
But what these companies did is they
realized how do we, on the internet,

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:30.640
how do we get eyeballs
so that can amass data,

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.770
so that we can sell advertising.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:37.620
We give them entertainment, we give
them music, we give them movies.

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:41.490
We give them all these things,
just to attract eyeballs.

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.790 position:56%
And so how do you get more eyeballs?

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.380
You make that music free.

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:51.230
And YouTube somehow tried to,
when I testified before Congress,

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:57.120 position:56%
I was next to one of the general
counsels of YouTube and she had the,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.970 position:56%
I just couldn't even believe I
heard her talking about a woman who,

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:05.140
you know, had a million plus views,
and it really helped her career,

00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:08.370
and it was really wonderful,
and it really worked for her.

00:32:08.370 --> 00:32:10.050
As like this is doing us a favor.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:13.760
I said, that is, I, okay, so
maybe this woman it was a success

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:15.640
for her in some way.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.350
Maybe she was a songwriter
that was actually a performer,

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.130
let's not forget that a lot of
songwriters are not performers.

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:26.610
So, I said that's like going into
a poverty stricken neighborhood,

00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:29.850
finding one person that wins
the lottery and calling--

00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:31.310
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Making
them the exception.

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.960
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah, this is
a great sustainable economic model.

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:36.350
Look at this person,
what they've achieved.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:39.540 position:56%
You can all hope for this, you know?

00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:42.150
I was like oh, please.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.600
So, anyway, so what happened
is Spotify needed music, right?

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:51.370
They want to be this
big data company.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:55.080
Daniel Ek wants to be
the answer to piracy.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:59.140
I mean, honestly, you know,
to me, he's the pirate

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.500
in sheep's clothing, you know.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:04.680
So, what did they do
to get all that music,

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.040
because they couldn't
really get the library?

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.420
They gave the equity to
Sony, Universal and Warner.

00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:16.050
And Sony, Universal and Warner did
it, nobody really knew about it.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:19.760
It was money that now, one of
them, I think it was Warner,

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:21.060
said somehow you know,

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.630
since everybody's been really
making a hullabaloo about this,

00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:25.930
like we'll distribute it.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:27.230
How do you distribute it?

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.760
Somebody dies, you're going to go
back and find the estate, I mean.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.940
This is, someday when
they're equity comes through,

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.190
it's utterly ridiculous.

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:40.820
And so, these companies, now
that represent these artists

00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:45.750
through their contracts, maybe
this is a harsh way to say it,

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.400
but I dare, I'm going
to use a harsh analogy.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:54.740
I feel like a lot of these artists,
it's almost now, these companies,

00:33:54.740 --> 00:33:57.530
they're now big data companies.

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.440
They're no longer music companies.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.740
They have equity.

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:05.830
They're in the business
of making music free

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:08.160
so that their equity can go up.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:11.550
And that they can make
money in other ways.

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:15.730
And so these musicians that
are tied to these people,

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:18.850
it's like being chain
ganged to working, you know,

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:24.220
I'm doing my music while they,
so that can sell it for free and,

00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:28.710
or give it away for free and
become more valuable by it.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.580
It's completely wrong.

00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.350
If I had one wish, it would be that
artists could, if there was a way

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:39.520
to say, you have broken our
fiduciary trust, you have, this,

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.570
you represented me as an
artist, as a publisher,

00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:47.760
at my financial interest, and
you sold me down the river.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:49.060
I want out.

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:55.960 position:56%
Because you know, how many
musicians had contracts that foresaw

00:34:55.960 --> 00:35:00.770
in them these other ways
of distributing music?

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:03.610
I mean, you can say
that you're a lawyer--

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.440
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Oh, I mean
there's been a huge issue

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:09.750
in the music industry
over the last decade

00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.850
because of the way
music is distributed.

00:35:11.850 --> 00:35:14.030
And one of the big cases
actually was brought

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:18.930
by Eminem's production company, FBT
versus Aftermath, Dr. Dre's label.

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:23.670
When songs were being sold on
iTunes for 99 cents, you know,

00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:25.960
the record company would say,
oh, we're selling a single,

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.950
it's just like the way
we used to sell singles,

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:30.220
and so you get 12% of the dollar.

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:31.720
So here's your 12 cents.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.900
They pay 9.1 cents to the
publisher for the mechanical,

00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.150
that's 21.1 cents, and they
keep the rest of the money

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:40.690
that iTunes would pay them.

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:43.330
iTunes out of the 99 cents
would keep about a quarter,

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:46.800 position:56%
so there'd be about another 50 cents
the record company would pocket.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.060
So Eminem's producer said no,
no, you're not selling anymore.

00:35:50.060 --> 00:35:53.040
You're licensing Apple the music.

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:55.390
And when you went in to
look at the contracts,

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.350
most artists' contracts say,
if you sell it, it's 12%,

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.550
but if you license it, we get half.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:04.770 position:56%
So all of a sudden the record labels
had to pay half of the money to all

00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:07.870
of these legacy artists from the
70's, the Allman Brothers sued.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.190
There was a big Warner settlement,

00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:10.950
there was a big Universal
settlement,

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.420
there was a big Sony settlement.

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.720
So that was great.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:16.270
That was a great windfall
for all the legacy artists

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:19.170
because their contracts
didn't say anything.

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:21.030
In, starting in 2003, now

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:23.100
that we knew iTunes was the
way we were selling music,

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:26.350 position:56%
in those contracts going forward,
it says when we sell through iTunes,

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.340
it's a sale, it's not a license.

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:30.810
So they've protected
themselves going forward.

00:36:30.810 --> 00:36:35.150
I actually think, Maria, that
the label's taking equity.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:37.920
I mean, there's definitely
a cynical view.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.740
And I don't know that they
ever planned to share it

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.640
with the artists, the fact that
they were using these vast catalogs

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:45.080
of music to get the equity share.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.860
And now they've had to come
forward and say, oh well,

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.260
we'll share this with, you know--

00:36:48.260 --> 00:36:49.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: One of them has.

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.360
&gt;&gt; John Simson: If there's ever an
IPO, no all three I think, have.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.660
They've all come forward.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:56.080
But I actually think it was the
record companies finally having

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.440
that ah-ha moment, so
they had the opportunity

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.270
to own MTV and they didn't.

00:37:00.270 --> 00:37:02.300
They had the opportunity
to own Soundscan,

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.770
which creates data
about sales, and didn't.

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:09.090
You think about the Victrola, you
think about all the technology

00:37:09.090 --> 00:37:12.390
that delivers music to consumers,
where all the money's made.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:15.130
Right? It's not the, the
creators have always been screwed.

00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:17.160
You know, it's always been
the hardware companies

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.460
that have made the money.

00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:19.760
It's always been, you know.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.850 position:56%
Sony was an electronics company,
but because Betamax lost out to VHS,

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:25.380
they bought a movie studio.

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:28.200
We're not going to lose this next
time, we'll have our own content.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.630
So, I think it was really
them strategically thinking,

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.250
we're going to now take equity
in all these new start-ups,

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.950
we don't know which ones are going
to succeed but if they do succeed,

00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:38.250
we're going to be in for it.

00:37:38.250 --> 00:37:42.190
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Do you think it
was a like, from the Napster days,

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:45.770
of we didn't buy to the Napster
thing and we missed out on that?

00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:47.070
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Well, you know,

00:37:47.070 --> 00:37:48.370
the Napster thing is
kind of interesting.

00:37:48.370 --> 00:37:51.400
As an aside, I was actually
subpoenaed in the Napster lawsuit,

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.640
but that's another
story for another day.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.210
Shortest deposition in history.

00:37:56.210 --> 00:38:00.640
But, I was actually
starting SoundExchange

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.940
out of the back of the RIAA.

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.240
When that was actually going on.

00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:05.920
And the RIAA actually
reached out to Napster

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.730
and said, you guys need a license.

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.260
We should negotiate.

00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:11.090
&gt;&gt; Jennifer cutting: Let's
spell out the acronyms,

00:38:11.090 --> 00:38:13.470
Recording Industry
Association of America.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.780
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Representing the
major labels and some major indies.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:20.030
And this is back in 1999, 2000,

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.470
when Napster started
with the file sharing.

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:23.930
And they tried to license them.

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.500
And basically the answer was,

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:28.240
we don't need licenses,
this is fair use.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.680
And finally, you know,
Napster got sued and they lost

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.690
in the 9th Circuit, and they
ended up getting shut down.

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:41.000
So, as, what's kind of
ironic, is that's 1999, 2000,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.940
and now we have Spotify which is
basically a Napster with licenses.

00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:46.240
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Right.

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.540
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Right?

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.420
And it only took us 10 years to get
there and lots of losses to piracy

00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:51.720
in the intervening years.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.440
You know, I think there have
been band aids along the way,

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.070
the iTunes download store was
a wonderful thing for a while.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:38:59.370
You know, people buying individual.

00:38:59.370 --> 00:39:01.770
People wanted to buy the one
track, not the whole album,

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:03.070
okay, we'll let you do that.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:05.440 position:56%
And that was in response to Napster.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.970
It was the record companies trying
to do something proactively.

00:39:08.970 --> 00:39:12.780
You know, if you think about CD
stores, back when we had those,

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:14.510
like Tower and HMV, you know.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.820
They weren't really interested
in selling CD singles.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:19.790
Because you think about the profit
major on a CD single selling

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.320
for $2.99, taking up the
same amount of shelf space

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.560
in a record store as the full CD.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.960
Right? So there was no business
in selling singles, you know.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.330
When I was managing artists, we
might, you know, we had 45's right?

00:39:32.330 --> 00:39:34.150
Then we had ca-singles.

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:35.450
You probably, don't.

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:36.750
I don't know if any of
you have any of those.

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:38.050
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Maxi singles.

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.350
&gt;&gt; John Simson: And then,
yeah, the maxi singles.

00:39:39.350 --> 00:39:40.650
If you're in the dance music.

00:39:40.650 --> 00:39:42.040
You know, the 12 inch, you know.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:43.860
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Can
I just say something?

00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:47.460
Because, and I know Taylor
Swift came out and said this.

00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:49.990
You know, people are
willing to buy music.

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:52.530
First of all, I'll tell you through
my website, because I have all

00:39:52.530 --> 00:39:55.140
of my data, I see every
sale that comes in.

00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:58.470
The vast majority of
people are buying my CD.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:04.080
Okay? And people are
willing to buy music.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:07.090
People are willing to pay
for downloads and they work.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:12.000
It's just if it's made available
for free, who doesn't use that?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.670
You know, so this is not a
matter of what people want,

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:23.450
it's a matter of what large,
large companies have made us,

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.470
made people think that
they want and need.

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.180
Of course everybody takes
free if they get it.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.110
At everybody's expense,
except their own.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:38.600
And it's a dangerous thing for
us to not be awake to that.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.750
And I really, so right now,

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:44.600
the copyright office is
doing a wonderful thing.

00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.380
And they're taking in,
they've just closed it now,

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:52.300
in comments about Safe Harbor.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.140
And a lot of people, I wrote
in, a lot of organizations,

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.700
I know Music Answers
wrote in, the RIAA.

00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.480
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Thousands
of artists.

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.220
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Thousands
of artists have written in.

00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:07.060
Basically saying, you know,
and I think the argument needs

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.130 position:56%
to be made definitely that you know,

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:14.490
these companies are
purposely setting this up.

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:19.480
And trying to create of culture of
infringement for their own good.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.780
And

00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.080
&gt;&gt; John Simson: If I
can just add to that.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.630 position:56%
When you were talking about the
Safe Harbor, this is the section 512

00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:27.600
of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.460
Where you send a notice, and the
person running the service has

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:36.450
to take it down, or they can be
held liable for infringement.

00:41:36.450 --> 00:41:40.160
And again, remember it was
written during a time of dial up.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:42.820
It was written during Netscape,
it was written during AOL.

00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:45.600
We didn't have services
like Google and YouTube

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:47.520
which are content delivery systems.

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:51.160
This was really meant for dumb
pipes, that was the expression

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.260
that was used back in the day.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:56.720
So here's the thing
that infuriated me.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.950
You send a takedown notice for
a particular piece of content

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.860 position:56%
that you own, and they take it down.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:03.610
They abide by the law.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:07.560
A minute later a new person
puts the same content up.

00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:11.000
They don't have to filter and go,
oh wait, we already took that down.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.680
Someone shouldn't be
able to put that back up.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:14.980
They just put it back up.

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:16.280
It's like whack-a-mole.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.830
And then you've got to send
them another takedown notice.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:20.270
Now, if you're the major label
and you have a whole department

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:23.680
and that's all you do, sending tens
of millions, hundreds of millions,

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:27.140
of take down notices,
every month, you're okay.

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:30.120 position:56%
But if you're an independent
artist, you can't afford to do that.

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.460
You don't have the
resources to do it.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:33.040
There have been some
independent film makers,

00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:36.010
who have made these independent
films on their credit cards,

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.900
only to see it being
distributed for free

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.150
because they can't
get it taken down.

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.930
And you know, the other
thing you were talking about,

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:45.340
how they try to threaten you when
you were taking something down.

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.730
You better have the
right to take this down,

00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:48.050
or we're going to come after you.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:50.860
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: And now
YouTube has just started a program

00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:56.480
that if somebody takes, let's
not mind the fact that, you know,

00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:01.960
probably 99.9% of takedown
notices are definitely authorized,

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.010
but every once in a while
somebody does a malicious takedown

00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:06.940
on somebody, or whatever.

00:43:06.940 --> 00:43:10.710
So, YouTube has started
saying that they will pay

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:15.980
up to a million dollars in
attorney's fees to defend some

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:18.230
of their users who
have something taken

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:21.030
down that they feel
is wrongly taken down.

00:43:21.030 --> 00:43:23.140
Never mind are they're
going to pay, you know,

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:26.660
a million dollars of
my time and effort.

00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:29.890
I want to, can I show you
something that just came out.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:34.790
This is pretty wonderful
because, so,

00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:37.630
the YouTube takedown
thing is frustrating.

00:43:37.630 --> 00:43:41.420
The Google takedown
thing is impossible.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:44.890
And Google, so it, I mean,
let's make no mistake,

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:46.940
Google and YouTube equal alphabet.

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:50.870
Which is you know, the big,
you know the data lord empire.

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:56.630
But Google is creating
searches to many of these sites.

00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:59.930
Some that are foreign that don't
have to adhere to the DMCA.

00:43:59.930 --> 00:44:04.840
Many are that torrent sites,
where you send in your DMCA thing

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.190
and they say, oh we can't
help it, it's server to server

00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.830
and we can't do anything.

00:44:08.830 --> 00:44:12.520 position:56%
You know, in the meantime, they have
my entire sets of scores and parts

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.030
and videos that go with it that
are worth $115 on my website.

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:21.350 position:56%
So, this man just put out this thing
about how to send a takedown notice

00:44:21.350 --> 00:44:26.390
to Google in 46 or more easy steps.

00:44:26.390 --> 00:44:28.340
So, let's get started.

00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:31.360 position:56%
Go to Google.com, look for the word
copyright at the bottom of the page?

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.090
Nope. Look for the word legal?

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:38.550
Nope. Look for the, contact
or contact us, nope, nope.

00:44:38.550 --> 00:44:41.090
Link about, nope that's not it.

00:44:41.090 --> 00:44:45.040
Link on terms, scroll down,
scroll down, how about privacy

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.700
and copyright protection,
now we're on our way.

00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.620
Click on the link for help center.

00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:54.220
Click on the link for submit
a legal request, okay.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:58.640
Read the drop down menu, click
the link for the word tool,

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.140 position:56%
read a set of 12 choices, select web
search, read a list of 8 choices,

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:06.290
none of the choices mention
the word copyright, really?

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:08.460
You invite me to submit
a legal request and none

00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:09.760
of the choices are copyright,

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.460
and you receive 75 million
take down notices a month.

00:45:14.460 --> 00:45:16.490
Okay, that's crazy.

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:22.490
So, select, I found a site that is
engaging in suspicious behavior.

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:24.420
The page is solely about phishing.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.320
Go back, Google will
not let me go back.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:27.620
Must start over.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:28.920
Repeat step 11.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:33.280
Select, I have a legal issue
that is not mentioned above.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:34.580
I mean, this is incredible.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:38.570
Ah ha, removing content from
Google is one of the choices.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:42.730 position:56%
Select. Warns me that they will
send my notice to the Lewin project,

00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:44.030
formerly Chilling Effect,

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:46.720
and my notice will be
published for all to see.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:50.430
Really? They haven't even found
out what I'm complaining about yet.

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:54.170
This is intimidation
tactic step number 1.

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:56.350
Are you the copyright
owner or authorized

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:58.260
to act on his or her behalf?

00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.560
Select yes.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:02.670
Select from two choices,
image video and other.

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:06.590 position:56%
To speed things up and avoid yet
another menu that will inevitably go

00:46:06.590 --> 00:46:11.270
with other, I select video image.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:15.030
Google asks me to yes
or no the question,

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:17.230
the image video is of yourself?

00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:18.860
Why this matters, I can't fathom.

00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:22.830
I have already said I am the
copy owner, so I say yes.

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.130
DMCA form?

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:25.430
Nope, this warning appears.

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:27.170
Under U.S. copyright
law, a photograph

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:30.810
or video is generally owned by
the photographer videographer,

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.450
unless the photo was taken as part
of his or her responsibilities,

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:36.210
blah diddy blah diddy blah.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:38.270
So this guy goes on to
say, but that's not true.

00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:41.900
What if it's a selfie, then
I'm taking my own photo.

00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.360
So then it goes on and on and on.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.800
He hits every dead end.

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:49.730
So he goes, let's see I, let's see,

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:53.100
they demand that I provide them
a written assignment of copyright

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:55.200 position:56%
or they will not process my request.

00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.720
Intimidation tactic number 2.

00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.700
Since I know better, I ignore this.

00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:03.530
Click the link for here, request
for me to enter my email address.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:05.620
Email address entered,
click returns.

00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:07.950
Sorry Google doesn't
recognize that email.

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:09.590
Create an account using
that address.

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:13.120 position:56%
You have to create a Google account.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.450
Okay? Click next to an
attempt to bypass Google.

00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:19.090
Will not let me fill
out a DMCA form,

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:21.240
unless I've created
a google account.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.980
Creating a google account will
require me to divulge my name,

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:28.660
email address, birthdate, mobile
phone, it goes on and sign

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.130
up for all their, you
know, purple Kool Aid,

00:47:32.130 --> 00:47:36.480
we get to the bottom, you know.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.780
So, this is--

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:39.570
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: That's
the list online.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:41.840
Imagine if you had no
list and you had to do

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.910
that all through experience.

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.520
Imagine how frustrated
you would be by step 12.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.440
&gt;&gt; John Simson: I have a new
assignment for my students.

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.840
I'm going to give them that site.

00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.710
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: But
this is, could any court

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:59.050
of law except maybe
one in Washington

00:47:59.050 --> 00:48:00.830
when there's probably
three or four buildings

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:03.250
of Google lobbyists in this town.

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:07.260
Could any court of law, not
possibly look at that and say,

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.430
they really don't want
this stuff to come down.

00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:11.730
I mean, come on.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.860
You know, when there is
no list of such questions

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.640
when you put something up.

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:23.010
There's no, and even if you
submit a request and you say,

00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:25.030
I don't want you to
link to that site,

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:30.800
or that's a Russian site that's,
you know, doing cyber or you know,

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:32.900
infringement or whatever.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:37.160
This doesn't even guarantee
that link is going to come down.

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.370
So, one of the ideas that I had,
that I think would be amazing,

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:47.920
is that you know, with all these
data analytics, they should be able

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.180
to know, like, I 've done
many takedown requests.

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.730
And I've never had a counter
notification, you know.

00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:56.550
Nobody's ever argued with it.

00:48:56.550 --> 00:48:58.220
I should get a high rating.

00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.100
I should be able to do fast
track to Google and say, hey,

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:03.770
Lime Torn, bad, bad company.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:07.480 position:56%
They're infringing my stuff so that
you know, thousands of other people,

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:09.260
like myself, millions
of other people,

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.190
like myself that have a high
rating, are given a warning

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:15.370
that Lime Torn is, that
they immediately take

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.410
down the URL to that company.

00:49:17.410 --> 00:49:20.780
I mean, there are things they could
do, if somebody made them do it.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.400
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Maria,
what's the ray of hope?

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:23.950
There's so much broken.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:29.500
We've had a wonderful list, a
litany of everything that's wrong,

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:35.130
and it really is not a
good situation for artists.

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:39.150
Is there a way for artists
to outsmart the data lords?

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.640
Is there way to circumvent,
is there a way

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.490
to outsmart, is there a way to?

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:49.620
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: There are
two things that are going on.

00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:52.300
So one, is at the very beginning
I think she said something

00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:55.320
about musicanswers.org, and I
want to tell you about that.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:58.290
Because a group of musicians
started this in New York

00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:01.990
and I'm a part of it,
and so is Spree.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:05.040
And the idea is that
a lot of organizations

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.580
that were representing you know,

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:10.640
write and advocacy and
doing great things.

00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.850
But none of those were
really for performers,

00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:18.850
songwriters, composers
and producers.

00:50:18.850 --> 00:50:21.130
The people that actually
make the music

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:24.150
without also having
the record companies

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:25.740
and the publishers in there.

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:28.430
Even ASCAP and BMI, you know,
they've got the publishers,

00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:31.360
they've got the writers, and
there's always this little bit

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:32.930
of conflict and competition.

00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:38.440
So this, we all have the same,
basically the same interest.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.490
So, we decided to create
this campaign,

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:44.650
and create a declaration
of principles.

00:50:44.650 --> 00:50:51.970
And the declaration of
principles is basically to,

00:50:51.970 --> 00:50:58.660
that people can sign on, and
say, these are the basic things

00:50:58.660 --> 00:51:01.390
that we all must agree
and adhere to.

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:03.150
Transparency.

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.670
Here's some we come together
as writers, performers.

00:51:06.670 --> 00:51:10.300
We oppose practices of
video streaming services,

00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:13.500
internet services and
other businesses

00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.390
that appropriate the value
of our music in order

00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:18.680
to make huge profits
selling advertising and data.

00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:21.510
We believe like music
should be treated like.

00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:24.820 position:56%
That means performance and composer.

00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.810
That this really should
be, fair is fair.

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:31.980
Transparency and, so people
are signing on to this.

00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.820
We already have Carole
King, Herbie Hancock,

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.800
we have Steve Wright,
we have John Corviano.

00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.100
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: David Byrne.

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:42.930
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: David
Byrne, we have many, many people

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:44.840
and we're trying to get students.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:48.730
And we're creating all sorts
of videos to wake people up,

00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:50.520
so the ideas is education.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.970
And anybody can sign up.

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:56.130
People can sign up as fans, as
people in the music industry

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:59.870
to basically get people to say,
yeah, this is what we believe,

00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:02.400
and this is what we
want to advocate for.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:05.020
And have this huge list of
names, and we're already

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.930
up to 1600 and we just got started.

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:10.920
And have this huge list of
names and videos and things

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:13.400
that say, we're watching you.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.350
We want better, we expect better.

00:52:15.350 --> 00:52:17.950
We now know what's going
on, we're not going

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:19.870
to sleep at the wheel anymore.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:25.640 position:56%
So, if you can't change Congress
and you can't change it through law,

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.590
you can change it through
exposure and pressure.

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:33.720
And then the other thing
that I always advocate for,

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:36.040
because it works so much for me,

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:40.260
and that is Artist Share gave me
this opportunity to put my music

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.850
out there, this platform
where I can connect

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:45.160
with fans in meaningful ways.

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:50.240
And Taylor Swift is a big
advocate of connecting with fans,

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:53.170
and I can tell you from
me, it works beautifully.

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:55.940
And you know, sharing, my
whole process and everything

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:59.120
and having access to all that data

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.880
and knowing every person
who buys my music.

00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.180
Owning my music.

00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.040
Not giving away my rights.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:06.720
Running my own show.

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.500
Having my own archive
of my own work.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.810
And you know, I'm able to
pay for a $200,000 record.

00:53:13.810 --> 00:53:18.160
In an industry where almost nobody
can pay for a $200,000 record.

00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:20.420
And it's jazz big band.

00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.690
So, I was always imagine, I
look at, you know, some artists,

00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:26.650
I look at Taylor Swift you
know, and I imagine her numbers

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:29.480
if she was doing what I was doing.

00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.220
Insanely eye popping.

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:32.520
I mean, really.

00:53:32.520 --> 00:53:34.540
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Well I mean but you
saw, when she withheld her music

00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:36.710
from Spotify, from
the free services.

00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:38.020
And look what happened with Adele.

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.170
She said no to Spotify,
8 million sales.

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.500
So you still can sell.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:43.800
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: People buy.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.670
&gt;&gt; John Simson: People will buy
if they can't get it for free.

00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:46.970
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:53:46.970 --> 00:53:48.270
That's the point.

00:53:48.270 --> 00:53:49.570
People will buy if they
can't get it for free.

00:53:49.570 --> 00:53:51.090
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
So, just say no.

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:54.320
That's one of the take
aways from this.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:55.620
So as the takeway--

00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:56.920
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
Wait, just one second--

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.920
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: I just want to add
something, just like, I think also,

00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:02.750
one key component is you have
to switch the way of thinking.

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.600
Just, just to people
in general, you know.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.070
Especially people of my age
and generation, it's like,

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:11.600
you have to understand there's a
group of kids from 2000 to 2016

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.200
who have grown up and have never
paid for music in their life.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:19.620
They have no concept of going to a
store, buying a cd, taking it home,

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:22.120
putting on some headphones,
unwrapping the cd,

00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:25.300
turn the music on, looking at the
credits and vibing out to music.

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.600
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And
reading the liner notes.

00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:27.900
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Exactly.

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.020
Their whole idea of what music is,
is almost like background noise.

00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.870
Like, have you heard that new Drake
song, that new Taylor Swift song?

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:35.730
We'll play it in the background
as we get ready for a party.

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:40.720
And I just think you have to change
the idea of what music is to people

00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:43.500
to make them feel like
it's something special,

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:46.920
and not just this thing that
they're supposed to have.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.960
That they're, and it just
comes for free, you know.

00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.210
That's a longer road
to get to I feel like,

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:56.200
but it can be done, you know.

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.500
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: If there was a,

00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.560
I'll tell you if there was a
financial motivation for that

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:04.800
from a company like Google, they
would make it happen overnight.

00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:09.660 position:56%
Because they've manage to change a
generation, and once that, you know,

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.580
once that dam is broken,
that's their idea.

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.700
All the dams are broken, this
is how people get music now.

00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.000
It's like wow.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.420
This is what the damage
they've done.

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.050
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: And so
it's just an awareness also,

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:24.360
I think making the issue
with music being free up,

00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.260
not just a music issue but a
people issue, a person issue.

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:29.520
You know, like, when
you think about people

00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:32.810
who aren't getting paid
the right amount of wages,

00:55:32.810 --> 00:55:34.530
you all feel for them, you know.

00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:37.200
Like, I did when I said
I got $60 for a song

00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:39.070 position:56%
that was streamed millions of times,

00:55:39.070 --> 00:55:41.080
I heard the whole crowd
just gasp, you know.

00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.730
Because how could that
happen, you know?

00:55:42.730 --> 00:55:45.360
Just imagine, like, I think
when people think of songs

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:47.580
and songwriters and artists,
they think about these guys

00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.090
who have millions and millions of
dollars and it's really one percent

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:54.730
of the entire pie, who
is that successful.

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:56.030
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Less
than one percent.

00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:58.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Yeah, for the most
part, I'm from Nashville, Tennessee,

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:00.420
for the most part, people are,

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.660
people have worked
their whole lives just

00:56:03.660 --> 00:56:05.730 position:56%
to live a decent life writing songs.

00:56:05.730 --> 00:56:07.340
That's all they've
ever known, you know.

00:56:07.340 --> 00:56:10.960
And as the years progress,
that likelihood of providing

00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.240
for their family gets taken
away from them every day.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:15.460
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well, and we
know from the copyright report,

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:20.000
I think we've talked about it
today, how many songwriters

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.240
in Nashville have left
the profession

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.870
in the last, I don't know,

00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:25.670
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Like
10 years, 12 years.

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:26.970
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: 80%.

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:29.120
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: This
is a songwriters city.

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:32.240
This was a city that
was built on songwriting

00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:35.840
and to see these people not be
able to take care of their family,

00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:37.650
provide for their household.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:39.280
It's sad, it's really sad.

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:43.040
Because this is not
just a music thing,

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.870
it's a person, it's a people thing.

00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:47.410
You know, just imagine, like
you're going, you guys are going

00:56:47.410 --> 00:56:50.640 position:56%
to your jobs tomorrow, and just
imagine your boss comes in and says,

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:53.350
hey, today you guys are
going to be working for free.

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:54.650
I'm sorry.

00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:56.240
That's just the, or you know
what, we're going to pay you,

00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.020
but we're not going to tell you
how much we're going to pay you.

00:56:58.020 --> 00:56:59.970
&gt;&gt; John Simson: How
about a penny an hour.

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:03.780
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: I think your job
is worth zero zero zero point 4,

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:05.560
give or take just, you know.

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.860
So.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:08.980
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Or it's like
going to Congress and saying hey,

00:57:08.980 --> 00:57:12.050
we just found a way to
hack into all your 401K's

00:57:12.050 --> 00:57:15.610
and give away $15 little things.

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:18.210
Everybody, here, have
a frenzy at it.

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:21.160
And everybody can just pick
away and say oh cool, wow,

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.510
I can get $15 from
[inaudible], cool.

00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:25.990 position:56%
I'm going to take $15 from you know,

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:29.820
and they just go around,
and that's what it is.

00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:35.260
It's like, I used to work sometimes
with Toots, Toots Goman and he used

00:57:35.260 --> 00:57:38.110
to say when he would
announce playing the Blusette,

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:40.950
before he would play it,
this is my social security.

00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:43.080
This song, you know.

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:47.020
It is, your songs are your assets.

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:51.630
They're something that should
pay you and, you know, your kids,

00:57:51.630 --> 00:57:55.410
and you know, for 75
years, you know.

00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:58.190
It should belong to you
and it should be protected.

00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:01.670
And you know what, it's
in our constitution.

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:05.370
Copyright is in our constitution.

00:58:05.370 --> 00:58:06.670
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
And this is the home

00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:09.020
of U. S. copyright, the
Library of Congress.

00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.320
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:11.620
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
Thank you all so much

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.920
for your eloquence on this subject.

00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:16.110
And I'm just very curious
how many creators are

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:18.410
in the audience tonight?

00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:23.860
Okay, for those who are music
creators, as a take away,

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:26.240
I'm just going to ask
what is one thing,

00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.200
I'm going to ask all three of you.

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:34.470
What is one thing that music
creators can take away,

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:38.020
to take home tonight from
this panel that they can do it

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.800
when they get home, to
better protect their rights

00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.740
in the digital marketplace.

00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:44.040
John?

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.340
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Sure.

00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:48.150
Well, for one thing there are
lots of different pools of money.

00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:51.950 position:56%
And if you've put out recordings,
and your recordings have been played

00:58:51.950 --> 00:58:55.920 position:56%
on Sirius XM, if they've been played
on Pandora, if they've been played

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.430
on any of these streaming
services, you want to make sure

00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:01.620
that you are signed up to
collect from all those pools.

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.880
And so most people know that if
they're a songwriter they have

00:59:04.880 --> 00:59:07.270 position:56%
to sign up with ASCAP, BMI or SESAC,

00:59:07.270 --> 00:59:08.890
those are pretty much
your three choices.

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:13.190 position:56%
You can self-publish, you don't have
to go through one of the PRO's, but,

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:15.480
you know, most people go
through one of those three.

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:17.260
Make sure you're a member.

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:19.760
They collect money from the
public performance of your work

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.950
as a composer for the composition.

00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:25.980
SoundExchange, the organization
I started 16 years ago now,

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:29.080 position:56%
collects for you as a recording
artist and for you as a label owner.

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:32.050
Make sure, if you own your own
masters, if you are the label

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:34.380
as well as the artist, you
sign up for both shares.

00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.830
Frequently an artist signs up with
SoundExchange and they only sign

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:40.100
up as the artist, not
thinking oh, I own the masters,

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:43.330
I'm the label owner too, and they
leave half the money on the table.

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:45.500
And we used to have
to track people down,

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.900
when all of a sudden there'd be
this pool of money and we'd go,

00:59:47.900 --> 00:59:50.110
wait a minute, you know,
we don't know this label,

00:59:50.110 --> 00:59:52.830
we'd call the artist and go,
do you know who the label is?

00:59:52.830 --> 00:59:54.240
Oh, I'm the label.

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.610 position:56%
So, very simply you make sure you
sign up as the artist, as the label.

00:59:57.610 --> 01:00:02.210
If you're a background musician and
you play on other people's records,

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:05.010
especially if you play on
major records, there is a fund

01:00:05.010 --> 01:00:08.670
that is controlled by the AFM and
AFTRA that's American Federation

01:00:08.670 --> 01:00:11.770
of Musicians and now it's
SAG-AFTRA, but American Federation

01:00:11.770 --> 01:00:14.580 position:56%
of Television and Radio Artists, has
an intellectual property fund based

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:17.080
in California and they get 5%

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.500
of the all the money
SoundExchange collects,

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.970
so about $40 million last year,

01:00:20.970 --> 01:00:24.100
be probably $50 million
dollars this year.

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.170
And there's also other reuse fees
when songs get put in movies,

01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:31.020
when they get reused for other
things, so there's probably well

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:34.530
over $100 million dollars a
year for background musicians

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:38.470
and background vocalists if you
play on fairly popular recordings.

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:41.160
You have to get in touch with them
and let them know who you are,

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:43.270
and where they can find you.

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:44.850
So, it's really important
to let people know.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:46.580
There's another much smaller fund.

01:00:46.580 --> 01:00:49.140
It's probably $2 to 3
million dollars a year,

01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.790
it's located here in Washington.

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:54.470
It's called AARC, the Alliance of
Artists and Recording Companies.

01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:58.570
I used to be on their board and
basically they collect money back

01:00:58.570 --> 01:01:01.580
when dat tape was going
to revolutionize the world

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:04.740
and we got this law
passed, that, you know,

01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:08.470 position:56%
that every time blank media would be
used to copy things or hard drives,

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:09.940
but we got screwed on that.

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.450
Because unlike Europe where
lots of money is being collected

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:14.770
in these levies, we don't
get hard drives on computers

01:01:14.770 --> 01:01:16.100
because they're multi use.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.300
We don't get blank cd levies
unless it says a music cd,

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:21.160
and most people just
buy regular blank cds.

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:23.040
But it could be hundreds
of millions of dollars

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.920
if people were actually
paying for the media

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.590
on which they're copying our stuff.

01:01:26.590 --> 01:01:29.920
So AARC, again, is something
that you should look up.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.260
I believe, if you google
Alliance of Artists

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.190
and Recording Companies,
you'll find it.

01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:37.920
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: And
SoundExchange's web site is?

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.340
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Soundexchange.com

01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:40.640
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
Soundexchange.com

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:41.940
&gt;&gt; John Simson: And they actually
have a place on the website

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:46.010
where you can actually search
to see if you have money.

01:01:46.010 --> 01:01:48.630
And I just saw a wonderful
site, called buzz angle,

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:51.340
of course it's way more expensive
than you'd ever want to spend,

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:55.030
but I found out I had 35
streams on Spotify on my record

01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:57.890
that has never been
digitally released.

01:01:57.890 --> 01:01:59.680
So I still king of mystified,

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:04.190
until I found out that somebody
has been bootlegging it.

01:02:04.190 --> 01:02:07.710
So I'm owed 16 cents.

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:09.010
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Spree?

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:10.310
Thanks John.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:11.820
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: I just think
the biggest way, the most,

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:13.940
or one of the ways you can
protect yourself is just

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:15.700
through awareness, you know.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.970
When I was a kid, nobody
had any information for me.

01:02:19.970 --> 01:02:22.970
There wasn't a lawyer to go to,
or there wasn't another artist,

01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:26.040
I literally had to either,
it was trial by fire

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.960
or figure it out as I go.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:30.820
So I think for artists and
just people who are interested

01:02:30.820 --> 01:02:33.790
in the subject matter at
hand, it's just research.

01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:36.110
Awareness, when the
article comes out, read it.

01:02:36.110 --> 01:02:38.720
I know it's a lot of information
to take in, and you're not going

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:42.400
to figure this whole thing out
in a day, maybe not even a year.

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.140 position:56%
But the more you keep abreast of it
and the more awareness that you have

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:48.930
of it, of how your music is getting
out there, what you're getting paid

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:52.620
for your music, what are different
avenues to put your music through,

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:56.270
I think, I think will give
you much more protection

01:02:56.270 --> 01:02:58.170
because you won't go
into it so blindly.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:01.390
You know, there's millions of kids
are tossing their music on Spotify

01:03:01.390 --> 01:03:04.910
and have no idea how much they're
getting paid or if they're supposed

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.210
to be getting paid at all.

01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.570
So, I think that the more
you know, as they used to say

01:03:08.570 --> 01:03:12.260 position:56%
on the NBC thing, the more you
know, the more you going to prepare,

01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:15.260
of you know, how to
attack the giant, the data.

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.120
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: The data lords

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.400
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: The data
lords of the music industry.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.550
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: So, absolutely.

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:27.030
I mean, that's what we're
trying to do at Music Answers.

01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:30.470
So, I hope that you will
go to Music Answers,

01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:34.310
look at the videos we're
making and you can endorse the,

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:36.970
if you like the declaration
of principles,

01:03:36.970 --> 01:03:40.430
to me there's nothing not to love.

01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:45.200
You endorse it, sign up, and then,
you know, we'll keep you apprised

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.960
of what's going on and
what things are changing.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.410
There are a lot of
sites you can go to,

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:54.940
Music Business Worldwide is a
wonderful, just sign up there.

01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:58.000
Everyday articles come
in, and just shockers,

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.790
you know, about the business.

01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:01.090
It's really good.

01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:04.660
ASCAP has a wonderful sort
of advocacy, you know,

01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:08.370
they upload all sorts of
links and things of things

01:04:08.370 --> 01:04:09.770
that are coming out every day.

01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:15.280
And they're all tools that
just help people to know

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.950 position:56%
and I do think the more people that
know and the more people that share,

01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:21.430
and say, you know this
isn't what I think.

01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:23.740
And are vocal about it.

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:28.250
And, it puts pressure on
these companies to change.

01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:31.290
I mean, you have to
demand transparency.

01:04:31.290 --> 01:04:34.980
And fairness and you know.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.280
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Thank you.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.580
Thank you.

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:40.980
You've all been so articulate
about all of these issues.

01:04:40.980 --> 01:04:43.510
Let's have a round of
applause for everybody.

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:49.300
[ Applause ]

01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.960 position:56%
And now, we'd like to hear from you.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.420
What are your questions?

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:57.970
Do you have any questions for
our highly qualified panelists?

01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:00.360
Please take a mic.

01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:07.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hello. My name is Howard Crowell,
I'm actually a Grammy member.

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:08.870 position:56%
Which is how I found out about this.

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:13.310
I have a question, you said that
the Congress is not doing enough.

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:14.620
I know that, you know, I go to,

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.380
we have something called
Grammies on the Hill every year.

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.320
I've been going there
for the last four years.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.680 position:56%
So every year, a lot of
politicians, you know, Nancy Pelosi,

01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.240
they all come to this huge major
event that is supposed to bring,

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:32.050
you know, music performers
and lawmakers together.

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:36.440
and they all promise that they're
going to kind of deal with this,

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.690
this you know, this problem
with our copyright infringement

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:40.990
and things like that.

01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:42.420
And it doesn't seem like
we're making any progress.

01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:45.060
It seems like every year, you know,

01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.030
we as the members we
get these emails

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.890 position:56%
from the hill saying you know, we're
going to tackle this this year,

01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:52.110
go to your neighbor, talk
to your member of Congress.

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:54.340
You know, kind of rally the
troops and it doesn't seem

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.310
like we're making progress.

01:05:56.310 --> 01:05:58.850
So, why do you think that is?

01:05:58.850 --> 01:06:01.020
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: It's
because of lobbying.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.790
You know, because, it's marvelous

01:06:03.790 --> 01:06:06.290
that you came here for
Grammys on the Hill.

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:07.590
That's a great, great event.

01:06:07.590 --> 01:06:09.680
And it is a wonderful experience

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:12.760
to experience all these musicians
getting together and getting

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:15.650
to have meetings with Congressmen
and tell them our issues.

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:18.490
So I applaud you for doing that.

01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:21.900
It's, it's a huge thing and I
think it can make a difference.

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:24.340
And it does make a difference.

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:28.240
But I also know that in
our meetings, you know,

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:33.310
I remember Jerry Nadler,
sitting over his desk and saying,

01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:36.960
The radio lobby is really strong.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:42.490
You know. Just that giving a
little bit of a reality check

01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:47.680
that these forces and
lobbying is you know,

01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.600
is powerful, powerful stuff.

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:55.920
And, and that's why I do think it's
so important that organizations

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.570
like NARIS that are doing
things, and what we're doing,

01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:02.070
and all these different
organizations,

01:07:02.070 --> 01:07:04.590 position:56%
grass roots people, the individuals.

01:07:04.590 --> 01:07:08.240
I know Jerry Nadler told me,
it's the individual stories,

01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:12.040
the people coming like Spree and
saying, I had 45 million views

01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:14.470
and they sent me a check for $30.

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:19.310
He said that those kind of
stories mean a lot to them, and so,

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:22.770
you know, I guess we just have
to, we just have to keep pushing

01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:25.280
and trying and hoping and
doing everything we can.

01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:28.260
&gt;&gt; John Simson: You know, I think
having been a lobbyist myself

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:31.470
for a number of years when
I was running SoundExchange,

01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:35.750
interestingly back in 1994 my
partner who is here tonight,

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:39.070
Tom Karic and I were approached by
the Recording Industry Association

01:07:39.070 --> 01:07:40.970
of America to join
a lobbying campaign.

01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:45.730
To get a law passed to make
broadcasters pay recording artists

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:47.640 position:56%
when they played songs on the radio.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:50.350
And we got our clients involved,
and we reached out to other artists

01:07:50.350 --> 01:07:53.380
that we knew and other managers,
and got people involved.

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:54.820
And we had this campaign going

01:07:54.820 --> 01:07:57.470
to get a full performance
rite in the United States.

01:07:57.470 --> 01:08:01.830
And when we failed to get that
done, we did not get radio stations

01:08:01.830 --> 01:08:06.430
to pay, but when we went to the
digital side during that campaign

01:08:06.430 --> 01:08:08.770
in 1995, who was our ally?

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:10.070
The broadcasters.

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:12.990 position:56%
Because they sat there and said, Oh,
our future competitors who are going

01:08:12.990 --> 01:08:14.290
to be doing satellite radio

01:08:14.290 --> 01:08:16.290
and internet radio,
all this digital stuff.

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:18.930
They're going to have to pay a
royalty that we don't have to pay.

01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:21.360
So, because the broadcasters
are on our side

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:24.930
and these digital services didn't
exist yet, we got the law passed.

01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:27.920
In 1995, the Digital Performance
Right and Sound Recordings Act.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.650
The first time recording artists

01:08:29.650 --> 01:08:31.460
in the United States ever
were entitled to get paid.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:34.260
And now it's 20 years old.

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:36.610
The broadcasters of course kind
of shot themselves in the foot.

01:08:36.610 --> 01:08:37.910
They didn't realize.

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:40.690
They thought they had exempted
themselves from ever having to pay.

01:08:40.690 --> 01:08:42.850
But now when they stream
online, they do have to pay.

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:46.570
You know, so they're a little
bit upset because they realize

01:08:46.570 --> 01:08:49.620
that eventually they'll be
streaming online completely.

01:08:49.620 --> 01:08:54.930
But you know, they make $17
billion a year playing ads

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:57.200
around music, and we get zero.

01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.530
Songwriters get a little.

01:08:58.530 --> 01:08:59.830
But not nearly enough.

01:08:59.830 --> 01:09:02.930
I mean, imagine if you
had, if you owned music.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.220
At a rate, a guy said I have
this brand-new invention.

01:09:05.220 --> 01:09:07.200
It's called radio and
here's what I'm going to do.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:10.120
I'm going to play your songs,
amass people listening.

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.530
I'm going to sell ads.

01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:12.840
But I'm not going to
give you anything

01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.630 position:56%
because you'll sell concert tickets.

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:15.930
You'll sell records.

01:09:15.930 --> 01:09:17.230
It's fine.

01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:18.590
I'm going to make $17
billion but I'm not going

01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:20.450
to guarantee you anything.

01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:21.750
That's not a very good deal.

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:23.050
You can't even say no.

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:24.350
It'd be one thing if
you could say no,

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:25.650
I don't want you to use my stuff.

01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:28.890
But you don't even have the right
under US Copyright Law to say no.

01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:32.810 position:56%
As Maria said, there's a broadcaster
in every congressional district.

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:35.990
If you want to get elected, you
need to be on the radio and TV.

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:39.270
So, that's why the broadcasters
are such a strong lobbying force.

01:09:39.270 --> 01:09:42.560
You know, Congress always said
to us when we would come to them,

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:44.280
when we almost had a deal in 2010

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.250
where the broadcasters finally
agreed to pay something.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:49.730
When the broadcasters and you
guys come together with a deal

01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:52.330
that everybody's willing to
agree to, we'll bless it.

01:09:52.330 --> 01:09:53.950
You'll have legislation.

01:09:53.950 --> 01:09:55.550
That's the only way
it'll ever happen.

01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:58.440
And I think given the power
of Google and these companies,

01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:01.800
that's the only way that will ever
happen is if the tech companies,

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.610
you know, and the music
industry come together with a,

01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:06.790
some sort of a bill that they can.

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:09.040
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Just in case
some people don't understand this,

01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:11.780
performance royalty
is for the performer.

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:15.290
So, for instance, Aretha Franklin
has been on the radio how many,

01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:17.050
you know, millions
and millions of times.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:18.770
She never got a penny.

01:10:18.770 --> 01:10:20.070
&gt;&gt; John Simson: No
respect [laughter].

01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:21.370
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: She never-

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.670
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Otis got
respect because he wrote it.

01:10:22.670 --> 01:10:23.980
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: But
she never got a penny.

01:10:23.980 --> 01:10:28.600
What are the 2 countries,
there's only 2, like-

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.980
&gt;&gt; John Simson: No,
there's more than a couple.

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:31.280
But they're not-

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:32.580
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Notable ones.

01:10:32.580 --> 01:10:34.060
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Yeah, North Korea
doesn't pay, Iraq doesn't pay,

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:37.200 position:56%
Sudan doesn't pay, Iran doesn't pay.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.510
Pretty much all the other countries
in the world pay performers

01:10:39.510 --> 01:10:40.810
when they play it on the radio.

01:10:40.810 --> 01:10:43.740
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Those
countries, the sad part is

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:46.800
because it's not reciprocal,
because, so in Germany, GEMA,

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:50.650
they have a great performing rights
organization, GEMA in Germany.

01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:54.590
Because we don't pay their artists
when their German artists are

01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:57.900
on the radio here because we don't
pay them a performance royalty,

01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.640
therefore they don't
pay Aretha Franklin's.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.380
And so these countries, I
know a guy, he said they,

01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:07.450
he had a hit down in Brazil
with Brazilian musicians

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:10.380
and he was one of the songwriters.

01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:12.940
Or performers on it.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:15.750
And, or was a hit worldwide
or something.

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:19.510
His friends, you know,
they all made great money.

01:11:19.510 --> 01:11:22.330
They had like apartments
on Copacabana, you know?

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:24.150
And this guy didn't get a penny.

01:11:24.150 --> 01:11:25.590
So it's hurting us internationally.

01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:26.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Simson: He needs to call me.

01:11:26.890 --> 01:11:28.190
I can get him the money.

01:11:28.190 --> 01:11:29.490
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Yeah.

01:11:29.490 --> 01:11:30.790
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: I
mean, the international,

01:11:30.790 --> 01:11:34.270
it would be interesting to get
the international loss of income

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:35.670
into the United States from that.

01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:36.970
&gt;&gt; John Simson: I did
a little bit of that

01:11:36.970 --> 01:11:40.720
when we were leading this campaign
and it's hard to totally quantify

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.550
but US repertoire except
in certain countries

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:48.040
where language issues are
pretty major, it's 30 to 50%

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.340
of the world's repertoire.

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.280
So, when you look at that, the
labels get their share, by the way.

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.030
Because remember, when
your record comes

01:11:55.030 --> 01:11:57.820
out in the UK, it comes
out on Sony UK.

01:11:57.820 --> 01:11:59.550
They're a local company,
they get paid.

01:11:59.550 --> 01:12:01.500
The artist, if they're
American, is an American artist.

01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:02.810
They don't get paid.

01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:08.630
So, we estimated somewhere around
$100 million to $150 million a year

01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:11.260
that US artists were
losing in foreign royalties.

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.520
So, it's not insignificant.

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:15.650
When you think about it,
and also the other piece

01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:19.320
that people forget is, you
know, it's not all pop music.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.890
Europe plays a lot
more classical music.

01:12:20.890 --> 01:12:22.370
They play a lot more jazz.

01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:26.600
And so it's a lot of really niche
music that is losing that money.

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:29.630
EDM for years, it's starting
to obviously catch up here

01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:32.120
but for years there
were artist here.

01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:33.420
There were loopholes.

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:36.790
So for example, one of the things
I would tell people is go record

01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:39.480
in London and if you record
in London, then you can get

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.490
to collect your royalties
around the world.

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.570
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: That's exactly
what my business manager,

01:12:43.570 --> 01:12:46.980
he gave me this bit of
advice which enabled me

01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:50.670 position:56%
to get a lot more money overseas
which with the Afrojack song, Spark,

01:12:50.670 --> 01:12:53.730
because it was a Dutch artist,
I was able, and I was a writer

01:12:53.730 --> 01:12:55.030
and a performer on the song.

01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:56.600
I was able to collect all the money

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.610
that probably would've
been withheld from me.

01:12:58.610 --> 01:12:59.980
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: That's
why because you told me

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:03.330
that I was asking him about
his BMI royalties and he said

01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:05.790
that the foreign royalties are
pretty good and that's why.

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:07.180
Because I was little surprised.

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:09.740
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Well, wouldn't BMI,
it would be your foreign royalties-

01:13:09.740 --> 01:13:12.000
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: But they're
coming through BMI or, well-

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.390
&gt;&gt; John Simson: They're probably
coming through either SoundExchange

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:15.690
or you might have a
business manager.

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:17.460
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Yeah, a
business manager, yeah.

01:13:17.460 --> 01:13:18.760
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Okay.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.570
&gt;&gt; John Simson: I actually did
that for Cobalt for awhile as a-

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.850
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: I want to
get to a few more questions.

01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:24.150
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Okay, sorry.

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.450
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Does
that answer your question?

01:13:25.450 --> 01:13:26.750
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

01:13:26.750 --> 01:13:28.050
Thank you.

01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:29.350
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Very fully.

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:30.650
Thank you.

01:13:30.650 --> 01:13:31.950
Other questions?

01:13:31.950 --> 01:13:33.250
&gt;&gt; Nelson, from Altavoz
Entertainment.

01:13:33.250 --> 01:13:34.550
I actually want to follow up with
Jerry and what people can do.

01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:39.480
There is something called the
music act, go to musicact.org.

01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.220
And that is supported by Jerry,
introduced, and it's supposed

01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:48.640
to give US record labels up to $1
million a year to make, manufacture

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.570
and export US-made music.

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:55.660 position:56%
Why we don't, and I've been going
to Grammys on the Hill for 15 years.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.260
We don't, because we have
Halliburton-ized the US

01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.780
recording industry.

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:03.860
US-made music is not
exported out of the US.

01:14:03.860 --> 01:14:05.880
You're not going to
make money digitally.

01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.030
Digitally is only a fraction
of all the money earned.

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:11.750
You have to do both.

01:14:11.750 --> 01:14:13.480
And we have a music act.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.230
We need to get people to go.

01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:17.130
You need to get your
local representative

01:14:17.130 --> 01:14:21.640 position:56%
to go why are we not doing
anything supporting our local music?

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:23.310
Because Sony, Universal
and Warner Bros.

01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:25.640
Warner Bros., actually BMG is back.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:27.450
There are four majors.

01:14:27.450 --> 01:14:33.180
BMG has Janet Jackson, Alabama,
Scarface, it's not in the news.

01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:36.040
But they're back because
majors make billions

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:37.860
of dollars selling records still.

01:14:37.860 --> 01:14:40.040
And they're getting
everybody else to go play

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.560
in the digital sandbox
that makes microcents.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:44.930
So, you have to do both.

01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:47.520
The other thing is
you need block chain.

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.500
It has to be tied to
a public block chain

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:52.890
and then your rights
will all get done out.

01:14:52.890 --> 01:14:54.990
And we're fighting
this out in industry.

01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:56.290
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider:
What is a block chain?

01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:58.530
&gt;&gt; So, the block chain is
what this crypto currency is.

01:14:58.530 --> 01:15:03.230
This is a public ledger that
would allow all the right holders

01:15:03.230 --> 01:15:06.160
to have their information
promulgated out and then

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:09.480
if someone used it,
it's tied to a pair key

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.350
so your information goes
out, you have a public key

01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:13.880
that allows it to the broadcast.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.240
You have a private key
that your information,

01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:18.670
say I want to use it,
I get it right.

01:15:18.670 --> 01:15:20.510
It reports back to you.

01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:22.690
It would send a payment
to him the songwriter.

01:15:22.690 --> 01:15:24.200
It would send it to
your distributor,

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.060
to your aggregators, all done.

01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:27.360
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: One place.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.660
&gt;&gt; But guess who doesn't like that?

01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:30.650
The established people
in our industry.

01:15:30.650 --> 01:15:38.330
And so the indies have
to take it back.

01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:39.630
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Thank you.

01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:41.220
Other questions?

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.520
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Actually I have got

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.680
about 10 questions but
I'll start with one.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.980
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
Pick your favorite one.

01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:59.000
&gt;&gt; I've watched stuff on YouTube
and I could never figure out, like,

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.660
first of all, I hate YouTube.

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:04.640
I can't understand why you would
actually get music from YouTube.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.940
Is it just a place?

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:08.340
I mean, like, when
people go to YouTube,

01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:11.880 position:56%
do they just, using it like a radio?

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.190
Like to play it?

01:16:13.190 --> 01:16:14.860
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Check
stuff out, just to get,

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:16.740
to check it out without buying it.

01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:18.040 position:56%
&gt;&gt; John Simson: It's on demand, too.

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:20.250
Because they let everything
stay up there.

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.550
They don't take anything down,

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:23.280
so you know you'll
find everything there.

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.540
&gt;&gt; Because my question
was I'm a photographer.

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:32.150
And photography is being
destroyed on the Internet.

01:16:32.150 --> 01:16:34.400
It's just, it's unbelievable.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:41.010
Because if you are represented by
an agency, you know, AP or Magnum,

01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:42.930
they really can't do anything.

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:46.270
They do stuff for marquee
photographers.

01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:49.610
The biggest concern isn't so
much that photography is showing

01:16:49.610 --> 01:16:52.670
up in all these websites and
nobody can do anything about it.

01:16:52.670 --> 01:16:55.440
What seems to be particularly
irritating to a lot

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.770
of photographers is that
their work is being taken

01:16:57.770 --> 01:17:03.870
and the individuals are then
doing stuff to it and reposting it

01:17:03.870 --> 01:17:09.150
in some other form that's not
what its original intent was.

01:17:09.150 --> 01:17:10.700
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
Analogous to sampling.

01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:13.290
&gt;&gt; And it's just like,
when you see it, I mean,

01:17:13.290 --> 01:17:14.930
I've heard from photographers
who said I saw

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:16.520
and I didn't even know
it was mine at first

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.730
and I remember, what is this?

01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:21.250
And that is just, it's maddening.

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:24.560
And only really in
the top, only the top,

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:26.890
I know most people don't
know a lot about photography

01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:30.260
but like you get some premier
photographs, Magnum or AP

01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:34.490
or Reuters will come down and
they'll, the lawyers will show up.

01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:38.200
But for the most part,
it's Katie bar the door.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.620
&gt;&gt; John Simson: I was going to
say, I actually was involved

01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:42.950
in some meetings last year about,

01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:45.780
with some of the photographing
agencies about trying

01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:49.070
to create a SoundExchange-like
right for photographers

01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:52.700
so that basically people
could use them online

01:17:52.700 --> 01:17:55.950
but there would be charges,
you know, on websites.

01:17:55.950 --> 01:17:58.600
And they'd have to pay percentages
of revenue, things like that.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.800
And then the pool would come in
and then you'd have to figure

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.730
out how to, it's very difficult.

01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:04.530
Obviously, more difficult
than songs.

01:18:04.530 --> 01:18:08.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's, I mean, they do,
each agency has their own mechanism

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.740
but each one of them is different,
different forms, different price.

01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:17.310
But they really say we don't
want you taking the photographs

01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:20.110
and changing them around.

01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:22.920
And I guess I'm not 100% sure,
because I see a lot of stuff

01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:25.900
on YouTube, and it seems
to me like nonsense.

01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:28.320
Like, if I have a daughter and
she looks up a Beyoncé song,

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:33.040
she'll get 30 things that aren't
even the things she's looking for.

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:35.710 position:56%
And some of them are actually,
sometimes they're even pornographic,

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:40.140
which I don't know what,
how that's allowed.

01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:42.350
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: It's funny you
say that because we talked about,

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:47.830 position:56%
we had this conversation about remix
culture and like a photographer,

01:18:47.830 --> 01:18:52.380
like your photographs when somebody
takes sitting re-purposes it.

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.680
They do the same thing with music.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:58.710
Like I've had songs where somebody
just found it, found a cappella

01:18:58.710 --> 01:19:03.050
and did a remix and had it
on every, it's a repurposed.

01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:05.470
It's my song but they repurpose
the for their own, like,

01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:07.700
artistic creative choice, whatever.

01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.220
And they're, I don't know
if they're making money

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:11.650
from it but it's the same thing.

01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:15.560
It's so hard to have
somebody take it down.

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:19.510
You know? Because a remix, it
could be 1000 remixes one song

01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:21.840
and sometimes you just don't even
know how many remixes there are,

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.140
you know?

01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:24.830
I've had a song that
was remixed 20 times.

01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:27.390
I've only heard it like 10.

01:19:27.390 --> 01:19:30.270
It's just that somebody sent me
a paperwork of all the remixes

01:19:30.270 --> 01:19:31.570
that someone to the research

01:19:31.570 --> 01:19:33.830
but I haven't heard all the
remixes so I just don't know.

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:35.630
Like, and it's the same
with your photographs.

01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:39.430
Like, you just don't know how many
times somebody has reposted your

01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:41.120
photograph, especially
in the social media age.

01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:44.170
Man, we're like I could take your
picture and put a filter on it

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:45.920
and then I could distribute
it to thousands of people

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:48.320
and somebody else take that same
picture and do the same thing.

01:19:48.320 --> 01:19:50.510
You just have no idea.

01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:52.960
You know? There's no, like,
like I wish there was some kind

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.560
of like watermark or they take
watermarks off now too so it's

01:19:56.560 --> 01:20:00.780
like I just don't know how
you can keep up with any

01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.080
of the artwork or your work.

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.380
You know?

01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:04.680
&gt;&gt; John Simson: It's like
first-grade Photoshop.

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.490
Eliminate all that stuff.

01:20:07.490 --> 01:20:09.160
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting:
Thank you so much.

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.460
Thank you.

01:20:10.460 --> 01:20:12.760
We have time for one more question?

01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:17.940
&gt;&gt; Hi. Hello?

01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:24.540
So I wanted to sort of get some
feedback from you about one

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:28.820 position:56%
of the aspects that I think is under
discussed in terms of the transition

01:20:28.820 --> 01:20:34.360
from the ownership model to the
access model and that's how the,

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.340
it gets talked about in terms
of total industry revenues.

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:42.070
And I want to talk about how those
revenues end up being distributed

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:44.720
across different kinds of art.

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.840
You know, different kinds
of music is intended

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:48.300
for different kinds of listening.

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.460
There's pop music, which I love,
which is sort of the kind of stuff

01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:53.860
that you listen to over
and over again and kind

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:55.470
of can be the soundtrack
to your life.

01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:59.650
And then there's kind of
music that's not for everyone.

01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:03.620
Like big-band jazz or the noisy
punk rock that I make my basement.

01:21:03.620 --> 01:21:08.570
It's never going to be mass
audience music in the same way.

01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:11.870
And it might be not the kind
of thing you return to over

01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:15.460
and over again for repeat
listening over and over again

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:19.790
but a few listeners that you do
sit down and really take it in

01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:23.540 position:56%
and can be transformative and really
powerful artistic experiences.

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:29.600
And one of the challenges with the
on-demand streaming economics is

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:34.840
that it seems set up to
reward the kind of pop music.

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:39.170
Repeat listening over and over and
over again for a period of years

01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:43.650
at the expense of sort of the
art music, the fewer listens,

01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:46.310
the niche, the little guys.

01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:49.140
I'm really concerned about
whether there's any kind

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.310
of economic incentive
to validate those.

01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:55.180
I mean, I'm excited
by what you're saying

01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:57.880
about building those direct
relationships with fans

01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:00.890
and explaining the economics
to them being a means

01:22:00.890 --> 01:22:04.150
of recourse to counterbalance that.

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:08.110
I'm wondering if you're
getting those kinds of feedback

01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:09.480
from your communities as well?

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:14.090
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Well, one
thing, so I was talking to a person

01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:18.060
in the music business in
New York just about Spotify

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:19.850 position:56%
in the way they calculate, you know,

01:22:19.850 --> 01:22:24.360
when there's a $9.99
subscription fee.

01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:26.160 position:56%
And I hadn't heard about this before

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:27.490
and I thought it's
an incredible idea.

01:22:27.490 --> 01:22:34.680
He said he feels that if somebody
pays, if you pay $9.99 per month

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:38.530
and you're listening is,
you know, big band jazz

01:22:38.530 --> 01:22:42.520
and that's all you listen
to and maybe listen 9 times.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.280
That, he said your 9.99 should go,

01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:51.140
be divvied up to the
people that you listen to.

01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:54.390
And if you're a person
that pays 9.99 a month

01:22:54.390 --> 01:23:01.290
and you listen 5000 times,
you know, to something else,

01:23:01.290 --> 01:23:05.920
then it gets divvied up by 5000
times amongst those things.

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:09.430
And I think that there is a certain
beauty in that because I think

01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:14.650
that people would be maybe more
likely to pay a subscription fee

01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:16.790
if they knew that the
money actually was going

01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:19.860 position:56%
to those people that they listen to.

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.980
I think that would be a meaningful
change and a meaningful step.

01:23:22.980 --> 01:23:25.650
Now, there are a lot of people
that are not going to like that.

01:23:25.650 --> 01:23:29.880
You know? But I think it would
be good and good for the music.

01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:33.030
And then obviously, you
know, I'm just a fan

01:23:33.030 --> 01:23:35.440
of what I described
before for myself.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.200
But that little step

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:40.370
in the streaming world I think
would make the difference.

01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:41.670
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Thank you.

01:23:41.670 --> 01:23:43.200
&gt;&gt; John Simson: Yeah, I
think if you think about it,

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.530
we have the technology
to be able to do that.

01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:50.440
I mean, that's the most fair
way to distribute the money,

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:53.640
based on total plays
per user for the fee-

01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:54.940
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Yeah.

01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.240
Going to those people.

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:58.270
I mean, it's easy to do that.

01:23:58.270 --> 01:24:02.080
So, yeah, but it's difficult.

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.510
And this is changing.

01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:06.290
It is going to change
your musical culture.

01:24:06.290 --> 01:24:13.800
You know, because it is hurting
those little niche musics

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:16.770
that don't have, you know,
as big of an audience.

01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:21.130
And usually that music is the
most expensive to record, too.

01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:22.430
That's the irony.

01:24:22.430 --> 01:24:25.910
You know, the classical music
and it's, so it's tough.

01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:27.210
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Thank you.

01:24:27.210 --> 01:24:28.510
Thanks for your question.

01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:29.810
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: One more.

01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:31.110
&gt;&gt; I just want to ask one question.

01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:32.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Okay, one more.

01:24:32.410 --> 01:24:35.590
Let's get you on mic.

01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:37.200
&gt;&gt; Okay, so it's really quick.

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:41.450
This kind of pertains to
me and like if I don't know

01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:42.960
if I'm going the right
direction or not.

01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:46.760
But I should think you maybe if
you can let me know if I'm not.

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:50.220
But, okay, so basically
I'm an aspiring musician.

01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.230
My music name is Rosebud.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:57.070
It's enchanting, it's
captivating music, bliss.

01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:59.680
A lot of people say it
gets underneath her skin

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.060
in a peaceful manner.

01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.030
So, I want to know,
of course is a creator

01:25:04.030 --> 01:25:06.560
of your music, it's like a baby.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:08.320
You know, like you created.

01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:14.010
So I did copyrighted, I copyrighted
it, like maybe about 3 weeks ago.

01:25:14.010 --> 01:25:17.960
But am hesitant, I don't know
if it's me, like, being scared

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.050
or it's like, I just
want to protect it.

01:25:20.050 --> 01:25:22.170
But you know how like
I can go to someone

01:25:22.170 --> 01:25:27.660
and he may have a recording
studio and they want to record it.

01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:31.020
Like, am I going the right way
or should I have like documents

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:35.490
to show, like, you know, the way to
protect it or this is what's going

01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:38.200
on and make it pacific in writing?

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.500
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Are you asking

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.440
if somebody's recording
your song for you?

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like, I mean, should
I be putting it on YouTube,

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.870
should I be putting
it on like SoundCloud?

01:25:45.870 --> 01:25:47.320
I don't know.

01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.060
I'm a very critical thinker.

01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:52.960
Times, certain stuff like this.

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:55.530 position:56%
So, I'm not so, like, quick to jump.

01:25:55.530 --> 01:25:56.830
So, I just want to know-

01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:58.130
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Well,
the first question is,

01:25:58.130 --> 01:25:59.430
what are you looking for?

01:25:59.430 --> 01:26:00.730
Like, that would be my
first question as an artist.

01:26:00.730 --> 01:26:02.960
Like, what are you, what
is your goal with the song.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.530
Because sometimes it's
not about making money.

01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:05.910
Sometimes it's just
about being heard, right?

01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:11.320
So if SoundCloud is the way
for you to get heard, you know,

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.200
that might be a outlet or it
might be like what Maria said.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:17.750
Like, she has a platform where
you can put your song out.

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:19.460
Or it might just be a
personal agreement with you

01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:21.640
and whoever you're
recording a song with.

01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:23.880
But I think the first thing you
should ask yourself is like,

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:25.180
what is my goal but this song?

01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:26.670
What is my goal this music?

01:26:26.670 --> 01:26:31.030
And I think that can guide you into
whatever direction you're going in.

01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:33.110
Everything else is just
about research, you know?

01:26:33.110 --> 01:26:35.980
Spotify, how much they'll pay
you, SoundCloud or whatever.

01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:38.430
But you should ask yourself, like,

01:26:38.430 --> 01:26:40.100
how do I want to get
this music heard?

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:42.130
Like, what's the best
platform for it?

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:44.420
And I think everything else
will guide you after that.

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:47.510
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: And I also
think that thinking ahead,

01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:48.810
because you're just starting out.

01:26:48.810 --> 01:26:51.440
If I was just starting
out right now,

01:26:51.440 --> 01:26:54.560
my goal would be building
my own career.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:00.730
And if you throw your stuff, I
think you want to pick those things

01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:03.490
that you want to get
out there as a magnet

01:27:03.490 --> 01:27:06.220
but then you want the
things that you preserve.

01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:08.440
There's a new thing
that's just starting now,

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.040
it's called fanfunded.com.

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.640
It's basically like artists
share light, that anybody can do.

01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:16.300
But the beauty of it
is that you will know,

01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:18.850
you will build your own audience.

01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:20.150
You will know who they are.

01:27:20.150 --> 01:27:21.720
You can contact them.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:25.220
You can share things with them,
and you can build a career.

01:27:25.220 --> 01:27:30.360
So, the idea isn't just making that
first record or doing those songs

01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.630
and necessarily on the first
one making all your money back.

01:27:33.630 --> 01:27:36.860
But then maybe your next
one builds so people get

01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:39.540
to know what you're doing
and you know who they are.

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:41.450
You, then when you do
your second record,

01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:45.220
you already have this many
people you can send out an email

01:27:45.220 --> 01:27:48.310
and say hey, or note or
however they're going

01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:49.610
to communicate, you know.

01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:52.840
I am now going to fund
another record or I'm going

01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:55.070
to create a single or
I'm going on a trip here

01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:56.930
and I'm writing music about this.

01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:58.230
Come follow along.

01:27:58.230 --> 01:28:00.600
You can help fund it or whatever.

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.700
And building it.

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:06.550
So that you have your own
little empire at the end.

01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:10.140
Because otherwise they
will suck you dry.

01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:13.280
You know? It's very
difficult these days.

01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.720
I think it's very important.

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.020
Ownership is everything.

01:28:16.020 --> 01:28:17.760
&gt;&gt; John Simson: And I think Maria
makes a really good point which is

01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.530
if you, one of the
problems with some

01:28:19.530 --> 01:28:22.220
of these big streaming services
is that they don't tell you

01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:24.360
that people are more
listening to you.

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.460
And that's most valuable data,
is having that relationship

01:28:27.460 --> 01:28:29.210
with that fan, having
their email address,

01:28:29.210 --> 01:28:31.580
knowing who they are,
knowing what they like.

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:34.600
You know, and because that way
you have a direct relationship.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.280
You can monetize it or you
can give it away for free

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:39.130
but you have a community.

01:28:39.130 --> 01:28:41.610
I think that's important.

01:28:41.610 --> 01:28:43.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Spree Wilson: Sometimes it's
about putting those breadcrumbs out.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.770
Like she says, she has
wonderful platform which is

01:28:45.770 --> 01:28:48.400
like put the breadcrumbs out
there and then direct them

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.670
to your own platform where
you can be the beneficiary of.

01:28:51.670 --> 01:28:53.220
&gt;&gt; Maria Schneider: Build
it and they will come.

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.270
Slow and steady is, you
know, slow and steady

01:28:56.270 --> 01:28:58.740
and being good to your fans.

01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:02.140
That is, you know, creating
a relationship of trust

01:29:02.140 --> 01:29:05.610
and respect is a huge part of it.

01:29:05.610 --> 01:29:06.910
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Cutting: Thank you.

01:29:06.910 --> 01:29:09.000
I want to say a big
thanks to all my panelists.

01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:13.620
Maria Schneider, Spree Wilson, John
Simson, for being with us tonight.

01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:16.920
Thanks also to the music division
folks who planned this panel

01:29:16.920 --> 01:29:21.720
and all the events in Maria's
weeklong jazz residency.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:25.450
Ann McLean, Nick Brown,
David Plyler.

01:29:25.450 --> 01:29:28.790
We'd also like to thank our
sound engineers Mike Turpin

01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:30.090
and Jay Kemlaw.

01:29:30.090 --> 01:29:31.390
Thank you very much.

01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:34.110
And videographer Thom
Wolf, thank you.

01:29:34.110 --> 01:29:39.060 position:56%
Before we go, I just want to let you
know about one more upcoming event.

01:29:39.060 --> 01:29:43.410
The concert is sold out so
we can't invite you to that

01:29:43.410 --> 01:29:48.380
but Maria has an upcoming
workshop this Saturday, April 16.

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:49.940
That's at 2 o'clock.

01:29:49.940 --> 01:29:52.960
It runs from 2 o'clock
to 4 o'clock and it's

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.950 position:56%
in our beautiful Coolidge Auditorium

01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:59.130
in the Jefferson building,
the one in the big down.

01:29:59.130 --> 01:30:01.070
Maria will be working with members

01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:04.220
of the Bohemian Caverns
Jazz Orchestra

01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:07.820
and the Levine Music
Premier Jazz Combo.

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.640
And both of the groups will perform

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:14.120
and then Maria will give them
some coaching and some feedback

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.120
in a workshop-style environment.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.290
But the workshop is free of charge.

01:30:19.290 --> 01:30:22.000
So, seating is first-come,
first-served

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.000
but there's loads of
room in the Coolidge.

01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:25.740
It's a big auditorium.

01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:28.390
So, we're hoping to see you
there this Saturday at 2 PM

01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:30.770
in the Coolidge and I
want to thank you all

01:30:30.770 --> 01:30:32.930
so much for coming out tonight.

01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:35.510
Thank you very much.

01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:39.500
