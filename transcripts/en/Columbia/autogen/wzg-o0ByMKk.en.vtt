thank thank you very much probably

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009
thank thank you very much probably
 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.590
thank thank you very much probably
listening to the very end of the last

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600
listening to the very end of the last
 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.560
listening to the very end of the last
talk i'm one of those people who is

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570
talk i'm one of those people who is
 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.810
talk i'm one of those people who is
pursuing a particular technology and so

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820
pursuing a particular technology and so
 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.999
pursuing a particular technology and so
everything i say probably has a little

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009
everything i say probably has a little
 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.820
everything i say probably has a little
bit of a bias on the other hand i think

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830
bit of a bias on the other hand i think
 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.859
bit of a bias on the other hand i think
it's very hard to predict the future and

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869
it's very hard to predict the future and
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.769
it's very hard to predict the future and
so I think we need multiple options to

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779
so I think we need multiple options to
 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.840
so I think we need multiple options to
move forward and I'll try something here

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850
move forward and I'll try something here
 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.759
move forward and I'll try something here
which is a little bit outside of the

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769
which is a little bit outside of the
 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.859
which is a little bit outside of the
normal box of how to think about things

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
normal box of how to think about things
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.679
normal box of how to think about things
so i would like to argue that it is

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689
so i would like to argue that it is
 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.900
so i would like to argue that it is
actually possible to get co2 back out of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
actually possible to get co2 back out of
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.720
actually possible to get co2 back out of
the air at a price you can afford and if

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
the air at a price you can afford and if
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.549
the air at a price you can afford and if
that's true it opens all sorts of

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559
that's true it opens all sorts of
 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.160
that's true it opens all sorts of
interesting options you can you can make

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170
interesting options you can you can make
 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200
interesting options you can you can make
fuels out of it or you could bury it

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210
fuels out of it or you could bury it
 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.540
fuels out of it or you could bury it
depending on what you want to do with it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550
depending on what you want to do with it
 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.670
depending on what you want to do with it
so let me just sort of as a matter of

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680
so let me just sort of as a matter of
 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.610
so let me just sort of as a matter of
disclosure say we start I started to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620
disclosure say we start I started to
 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.270
disclosure say we start I started to
think about this in 1999 in 2003 in the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
think about this in 1999 in 2003 in the
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.880
think about this in 1999 in 2003 in the
winter of 2003-2004 while he broker

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890

introduced me to Gary como who used to

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320
introduced me to Gary como who used to
 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.100
introduced me to Gary como who used to
own land sand and Gary got very

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
own land sand and Gary got very
 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960
own land sand and Gary got very
interested in climate change issues and

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970
interested in climate change issues and
 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.580
interested in climate change issues and
he got interested enough that he put

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
he got interested enough that he put
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859
he got interested enough that he put
money up to form a small private company

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869
money up to form a small private company
 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.440
money up to form a small private company
with which I have been involved since so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450
with which I have been involved since so
 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.899
with which I have been involved since so
I have an interest in this which goes

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909
I have an interest in this which goes
 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.469
I have an interest in this which goes
past the academic side but I would argue

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479
past the academic side but I would argue
 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.350
past the academic side but I would argue
i'm interested in it because i started

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360
i'm interested in it because i started
 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.289
i'm interested in it because i started
it and so I leave it to you to decide to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
it and so I leave it to you to decide to
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.179
it and so I leave it to you to decide to
which extent i'm worrying about the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189
which extent i'm worrying about the
 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.640
which extent i'm worrying about the
academic issues and to what extent i'm

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650
academic issues and to what extent i'm
 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.230
academic issues and to what extent i'm
worrying about more commercial issues

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
worrying about more commercial issues
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.010
worrying about more commercial issues
but i do think it is one of those

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
but i do think it is one of those
 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.240
but i do think it is one of those
fundamental things which can change how

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
fundamental things which can change how
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.060
fundamental things which can change how
you think about the problem so without

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070
you think about the problem so without
 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.730
you think about the problem so without
arguing to begin with can we do it let's

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
arguing to begin with can we do it let's
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.770
arguing to begin with can we do it let's
assume we could do it and why would it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780
assume we could do it and why would it
 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.410
assume we could do it and why would it
be interesting and I would argue the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
be interesting and I would argue the
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.120
be interesting and I would argue the
biggest first step it gives you it

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130
biggest first step it gives you it
 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.700
biggest first step it gives you it
separates the sources of co2 from the

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710
separates the sources of co2 from the
 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.190
separates the sources of co2 from the
sinks of co2 because the air is a

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
sinks of co2 because the air is a
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.249
sinks of co2 because the air is a
conveyor which can transport the co2

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259
conveyor which can transport the co2
 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.999
conveyor which can transport the co2
over large distances without really a

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
over large distances without really a
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.399
over large distances without really a
big side effect you could imagine having

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
big side effect you could imagine having
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.280
big side effect you could imagine having
a car driving in Los Angeles and it

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290
a car driving in Los Angeles and it
 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.410
a car driving in Los Angeles and it
emits co2 into the atmosphere and that

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420
emits co2 into the atmosphere and that
 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.410
emits co2 into the atmosphere and that
co2 will mix in very well and in a

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
co2 will mix in very well and in a
 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.510
co2 will mix in very well and in a
matter of weeks it sort of has circled

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
matter of weeks it sort of has circled
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.350
matter of weeks it sort of has circled
the globe

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
the globe
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.180
the globe
in a matter of months it has spread out

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
in a matter of months it has spread out
 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.970
in a matter of months it has spread out
into him in a hemisphere in two years it

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980
into him in a hemisphere in two years it
 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.410
into him in a hemisphere in two years it
has spread out between the two

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420
has spread out between the two
 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.240
has spread out between the two
hemispheres and since we are not worried

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
hemispheres and since we are not worried
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.700
hemispheres and since we are not worried
about the change in a matter of months

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710
about the change in a matter of months
 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.430
about the change in a matter of months
or weeks in the co2 in the world we

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
or weeks in the co2 in the world we
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.470
or weeks in the co2 in the world we
could literally pick up that co2 in the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
could literally pick up that co2 in the
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.410
could literally pick up that co2 in the
Australian desert and dispose of it

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420
Australian desert and dispose of it
 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.050
Australian desert and dispose of it
right there so you you are not tight to

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060
right there so you you are not tight to
 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.150
right there so you you are not tight to
your source anymore you suddenly have

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160
your source anymore you suddenly have
 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.220
your source anymore you suddenly have
the ability to make things happen far

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230
the ability to make things happen far
 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.260
the ability to make things happen far
apart the other thing you could start

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270
apart the other thing you could start
 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.540
apart the other thing you could start
thinking about it is the emissions could

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550
thinking about it is the emissions could
 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.580
thinking about it is the emissions could
also be emissions from the past so you

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590
also be emissions from the past so you
 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.310
also be emissions from the past so you
can start reducing the co2 content of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320
can start reducing the co2 content of
 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.080
can start reducing the co2 content of
the atmosphere again if you really can

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090
the atmosphere again if you really can
 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.970
the atmosphere again if you really can
do that but of course this makes no

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980
do that but of course this makes no
 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.699
do that but of course this makes no
sense until you stabilize co2 before

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709
sense until you stabilize co2 before
 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.310
sense until you stabilize co2 before
that you are just another sequestration

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320
that you are just another sequestration
 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.750
that you are just another sequestration
option option another capture option

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760
option option another capture option
 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.070
option option another capture option
ultimately I think what makes it really

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080
ultimately I think what makes it really
 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.350
ultimately I think what makes it really
interesting is the idea that it allows

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360
interesting is the idea that it allows
 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.330
interesting is the idea that it allows
for closed fuel cycles where you have

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340
for closed fuel cycles where you have
 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.960
for closed fuel cycles where you have
co2 the ash coming from the air you take

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970
co2 the ash coming from the air you take
 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.150
co2 the ash coming from the air you take
it with new energy and convert it back

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160
it with new energy and convert it back
 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.900
it with new energy and convert it back
into a fuel and then of course from a

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910
into a fuel and then of course from a
 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.460
into a fuel and then of course from a
practical point of view in the short

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470
practical point of view in the short
 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.140
practical point of view in the short
term there are commercial applications

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150
term there are commercial applications
 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.900
term there are commercial applications
for co2 which allows us to sort of have

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910
for co2 which allows us to sort of have
 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.330
for co2 which allows us to sort of have
a bootstrap from where we are to way we

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340
a bootstrap from where we are to way we
 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.460

would like to be but the underlying
problem of course is the problem of co2

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930
problem of course is the problem of co2
 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:30.590
problem of course is the problem of co2

out how to stop the growth in emissions
 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.810
out how to stop the growth in emissions
and hold emissions constant we would

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820
and hold emissions constant we would
 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.060
and hold emissions constant we would

because the power plants are only a
third of the total roughly so you have

this is a stock problem so I basically
said you have a total budget of roughly

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130
said you have a total budget of roughly
 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.330
said you have a total budget of roughly
30 tons per person left

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:39.340
30 tons per person left
 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.570
30 tons per person left
and I took a slightly higher yeah and

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580
and I took a slightly higher yeah and
 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.730
and I took a slightly higher yeah and
and that's the this could take

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740
and that's the this could take
 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.830
and that's the this could take
infinitely that you could do this

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840
infinitely that you could do this
 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.960
infinitely that you could do this

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:53.650
have a few hundred years if you if you
 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.500

the seal trip I used eight yeah I used
eight billion people to get 30 so I

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:06.669
eight billion people to get 30 so I
 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:09.360
eight billion people to get 30 so I
allowed for that roughly but but we can

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:09.370
allowed for that roughly but but we can
 

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.840
allowed for that roughly but but we can
quibble with its 40 tons or 25 tons but

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:12.850
quibble with its 40 tons or 25 tons but
 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.510
quibble with its 40 tons or 25 tons but
the point is the budget is surprisingly

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520
the point is the budget is surprisingly
 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.850
the point is the budget is surprisingly
small and it it there's nothing new in

people will tell you that the 450 ppm

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:37.840
people will tell you that the 450 ppm
 

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.260
people will tell you that the 450 ppm
mark is clearly too high I see no

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:40.270
mark is clearly too high I see no
 

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.140
mark is clearly too high I see no
practical way to actually stop at 450 we

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.150
practical way to actually stop at 450 we
 

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.480
practical way to actually stop at 450 we
probably will overshoot that but we may

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:45.490
probably will overshoot that but we may
 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.520
probably will overshoot that but we may
have to come down even lower than that

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:47.530
have to come down even lower than that
 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.580
have to come down even lower than that
and some people have suggested 350 and I

one of your tools you really can't even
 

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:57.779
one of your tools you really can't even
do that so it seems to me we have to

00:07:57.779 --> 00:07:57.789
do that so it seems to me we have to
 

00:07:57.789 --> 00:07:59.760
do that so it seems to me we have to
think about whether this is possible and

00:07:59.760 --> 00:07:59.770
think about whether this is possible and
 

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:02.640

so you need to think in tens of terra

00:10:25.590 --> 00:10:25.600
so you need to think in tens of terra
 

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:27.210
so you need to think in tens of terra
watts and I think the three options

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:27.220
watts and I think the three options
 

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.610
watts and I think the three options
which are big enough solar energy

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:29.620
which are big enough solar energy
 

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.400

nuclear energy and fossil energy for

nuclear energy and fossil energy for
 

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.410

you fix the carbon capture and storage

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:36.370
you fix the carbon capture and storage
 

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.980
you fix the carbon capture and storage
problem and so I think it's very

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:37.990
problem and so I think it's very
 

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:40.650
problem and so I think it's very
important to really seriously start

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:40.660
important to really seriously start
 

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.440
important to really seriously start
thinking about how to get all three to

the scale you need and if you get rid of
the fossil fuels then the other two have

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:48.100
the fossil fuels then the other two have
 

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.490
the fossil fuels then the other two have
to figure out in some way or another how

00:10:50.490 --> 00:10:50.500
to figure out in some way or another how
 

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.170
to figure out in some way or another how
to deal with the transportation sector

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:52.180
to deal with the transportation sector
 

00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:55.470
to deal with the transportation sector
and in my view the best option there is

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480
and in my view the best option there is
 

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.850
and in my view the best option there is
to provide liquid fuels so when I would

these case

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:02.790
these case
 

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.150
these case
because if the answer is fossil fuels

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160
because if the answer is fossil fuels
 

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:07.400
because if the answer is fossil fuels
then carbon capture and storage is

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:07.410
then carbon capture and storage is
 

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.880
then carbon capture and storage is
needed and I would argue see co2 capture

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:10.890
needed and I would argue see co2 capture
 

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:12.800

from the air is capture of last resort

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:12.810
from the air is capture of last resort

cars and airplanes and then are

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:19.500
cars and airplanes and then are
 

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.430

you are talking about a power plant

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560
you are talking about a power plant
 

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.950
you are talking about a power plant
roughly ten percent of that will escape

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:27.960
roughly ten percent of that will escape
 

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.800
roughly ten percent of that will escape
and it's getting economically expensive

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:30.810
and it's getting economically expensive
 

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.740
and it's getting economically expensive
to get it there if geoengineering is the

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:33.750
to get it there if geoengineering is the
 

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:35.210
to get it there if geoengineering is the
answer and I don't talk about that here

answer and I don't talk about that here
 

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.120
answer and I don't talk about that here
then you can think of the reduction of

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.130
then you can think of the reduction of
 

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.370
then you can think of the reduction of
atmospheric co2 and stabilizing it at

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:40.380
atmospheric co2 and stabilizing it at
 

00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:42.200

option and again I think you would need

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760
option and again I think you would need
 

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.270
option and again I think you would need
the capture of co2 just to keep it cold

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:47.280
the capture of co2 just to keep it cold
 

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.220
the capture of co2 just to keep it cold
and leprosy or to pile up under it

little bit like saying we solve the

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:52.950
little bit like saying we solve the

little because that's what you would

00:11:58.430 --> 00:11:58.440
little because that's what you would
 

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:00.470
little because that's what you would
have to do because they co2 levels would

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480
have to do because they co2 levels would
 

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.650
have to do because they co2 levels would
keep going up and up and up and I think

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660
keep going up and up and up and I think
 

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.270

capture would allow you to do that

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:11.730
capture would allow you to do that
 

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.000
capture would allow you to do that
because it would bring you in the carbon

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:14.010
because it would bring you in the carbon
 

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.670
because it would bring you in the carbon
atoms you would want to close that loop

so what what struck me that day is there

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:29.420
so what what struck me that day is there
 

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.350

this where they feel like this is worth
 

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.079
this where they feel like this is worth
looking at a little harder because if

00:14:44.079 --> 00:14:44.089
looking at a little harder because if

we can build windmills one should
investigate this a little more closely

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:52.970
investigate this a little more closely
 

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:56.500
investigate this a little more closely
and so basically if you build some co2

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:56.510
and so basically if you build some co2
 

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.449
and so basically if you build some co2

looking at some costs I said well if I'm

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:11.810
looking at some costs I said well if I'm
 

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:13.660
looking at some costs I said well if I'm
really dumb about it it is right when I

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:13.670
really dumb about it it is right when I

square meter of rondalee area that let's
 

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:23.380
square meter of rondalee area that let's
say has the same let me calculate the

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:23.390
say has the same let me calculate the
 

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.870
say has the same let me calculate the
price of a ton of co2 if the price of

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880
price of a ton of co2 if the price of
 

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.460
price of a ton of co2 if the price of
electricity is five cents a kilowatt

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:27.470

and I need one more assumption is that

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:30.200
and I need one more assumption is that
 

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.110
and I need one more assumption is that
the collection efficiencies of those two

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120
the collection efficiencies of those two
 

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:34.450
the collection efficiencies of those two
are maybe the same 30-some percent or

00:15:34.450 --> 00:15:34.460
are maybe the same 30-some percent or
 

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.360
are maybe the same 30-some percent or
whatever you pick and if you make that

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:37.370
whatever you pick and if you make that
 

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.280
whatever you pick and if you make that
assumption you find that the price of

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:39.290
assumption you find that the price of
 

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.780
assumption you find that the price of
five cents per kilowatt-hour is

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:40.790
five cents per kilowatt-hour is
 

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.640
five cents per kilowatt-hour is
equivalent to fifty cents per ton of co2

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:42.650
equivalent to fifty cents per ton of co2
 

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.310
equivalent to fifty cents per ton of co2
so I said I could be orders of magnitude

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:45.320
so I said I could be orders of magnitude
 

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.770
so I said I could be orders of magnitude
off with this calculation and maybe it's

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:47.780
off with this calculation and maybe it's
 

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.170
off with this calculation and maybe it's
ten times more expensive but what it

00:15:50.170 --> 00:15:50.180
ten times more expensive but what it
 

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:52.270
ten times more expensive but what it
suggests is that contracting the air

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:52.280
suggests is that contracting the air
 

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.470
suggests is that contracting the air

started to think about it you today if
 

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:07.630
started to think about it you today if
you actually add up all the cost of the

dollars a ton right and I think we can

dollars a ton right and I think we can
 

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:18.850

keep working on it my point is the

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:21.140
keep working on it my point is the

away with a co2 because it would usually

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:51.650
away with a co2 because it would usually
 

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.770

be too expensive so I need to have a

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:53.780

regenerable sore butt and now I look
 

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:57.970
regenerable sore butt and now I look
just like a power plant flue gas

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:57.980
just like a power plant flue gas

right and so I can take their costs as a

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:03.110
right and so I can take their costs as a
 

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.890
right and so I can take their costs as a
lower limit of what I could possibly do

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:05.900
lower limit of what I could possibly do

to back off and repeat this and this

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:20.150
to back off and repeat this and this

challenge just like the job they have

00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:22.430
challenge just like the job they have
 

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.449
challenge just like the job they have
and so the question is is our job much

00:17:25.449 --> 00:17:25.459
and so the question is is our job much
 

00:17:25.459 --> 00:17:26.920
and so the question is is our job much
much harder than there's always a

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:26.930
much harder than there's always a
 

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.220
much harder than there's always a
comparable and I would argue yes the

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:30.230
comparable and I would argue yes the
 

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.440
comparable and I would argue yes the

concentration is roughly 300 times lower
 

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:35.020
concentration is roughly 300 times lower
but that's not as bad as it sounds and

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:35.030
but that's not as bad as it sounds and
 

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.940
but that's not as bad as it sounds and
the reason I'm making that argument is

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:36.950
the reason I'm making that argument is
 

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.040
the reason I'm making that argument is
that if you calculate the Sorbonne

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:39.050

come down to one percent or Oh point one
 

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:13.550
come down to one percent or Oh point one
percent so the factory is not 300

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.350
here i plot the actual curves and I
cheat a little by pointing out that the

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360
cheat a little by pointing out that the
 

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.420
cheat a little by pointing out that the
power plant has to be a little harder

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:41.430
power plant has to be a little harder
 

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:44.180

300 Kelvin I may even be a little lower
but taking those two numbers you see

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:48.810
but taking those two numbers you see
 

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:50.390
but taking those two numbers you see
this is the range for the power plant

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400
this is the range for the power plant
 

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:52.310

it's ten percent captured and this is
 

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.540
it's ten percent captured and this is
where air capture would be in this Orban

long thing so I worked it out and I said

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740
long thing so I worked it out and I said
 

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.920

little bit and I take that limit of this

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:29.670

complicated formula I go through this

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.040
complicated formula I go through this
 

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.690

actually calculated a number which is

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.130
actually calculated a number which is
 

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:43.520
actually calculated a number which is
slightly lower than mine so if I just

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:43.530
slightly lower than mine so if I just
 

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.920

strong so I needed a little more energy

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:07.830
strong so I needed a little more energy
 

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:10.280
strong so I needed a little more energy
and by the way as I go to zero it would

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:10.290
and by the way as I go to zero it would
 

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:12.320
and by the way as I go to zero it would
go to infinity so we are roughly eight

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:12.330
go to infinity so we are roughly eight
 

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.720
go to infinity so we are roughly eight
percent more than the fancy formula

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:14.730
percent more than the fancy formula
 

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.580
percent more than the fancy formula
would suggest but that's because we

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:16.590
would suggest but that's because we
 

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.890
would suggest but that's because we
assume we do it in a single torben and

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:18.900
assume we do it in a single torben and
 

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.980
assume we do it in a single torben and
and so we then find out that we have a

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:21.990
and so we then find out that we have a
 

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.430
and so we then find out that we have a
certain efficiency we can get to so but

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440
certain efficiency we can get to so but
 

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:27.140
certain efficiency we can get to so but
the conclusion i have from that is that

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:27.150
the conclusion i have from that is that
 

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:29.210
the conclusion i have from that is that
the dominant costs are likely to be

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220
the dominant costs are likely to be
 

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.550
the dominant costs are likely to be
quite similar right and in the end the

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:31.560
quite similar right and in the end the
 

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.140
quite similar right and in the end the
proof is in the pudding i would argue i

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:33.150
proof is in the pudding i would argue i
 

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:36.800
proof is in the pudding i would argue i
can't i can't go much more but back at

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:36.810
can't i can't go much more but back at
 

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:39.410
can't i can't go much more but back at
the envelope statements as saying that I

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:39.420
the envelope statements as saying that I
 

00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:42.260
the envelope statements as saying that I
see it is reasonable that the final cost

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:42.270
see it is reasonable that the final cost
 

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.720
see it is reasonable that the final cost
of collecting co2 from the air will be

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:44.730
of collecting co2 from the air will be
 

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.080
of collecting co2 from the air will be
higher than scrubbing a flue gas stack

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.090
higher than scrubbing a flue gas stack
 

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.120
higher than scrubbing a flue gas stack
but it will not be orders of magnitude

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.130
but it will not be orders of magnitude
 

00:20:50.130 --> 00:20:52.880
but it will not be orders of magnitude
higher I need a solvent which is twenty

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:52.890

thirty percent maybe one and a half
times as strong and so the energy I need

00:20:57.170 --> 00:20:57.180
times as strong and so the energy I need
 

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:58.940
times as strong and so the energy I need
to close the loop is a little higher

00:20:58.940 --> 00:20:58.950
to close the loop is a little higher
 

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.950
to close the loop is a little higher
than theirs if we are in the perfect

than theirs if we are in the perfect
 

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:03.200

limit so if they are you they can get

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.210
limit so if they are you they can get
 

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.030

gradually perfect we would be maybe one
 

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:17.540
gradually perfect we would be maybe one
and a half times their costs so so I

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:17.550
and a half times their costs so so I
 

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:20.420
and a half times their costs so so I
would argue we can get quite cheap as

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:20.430
would argue we can get quite cheap as
 

00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:22.730
would argue we can get quite cheap as
well and that's sort of what drove us to

00:21:22.730 --> 00:21:22.740
well and that's sort of what drove us to
 

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.680
well and that's sort of what drove us to
make it happen but then of course what

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:24.690
make it happen but then of course what
 

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.450
make it happen but then of course what
becomes very clear is your sorban choice

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:26.460
becomes very clear is your sorban choice
 

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.520
becomes very clear is your sorban choice

solvent you can make this work so we

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960
solvent you can make this work so we
 

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.720
solvent you can make this work so we
looked at all sorts of things and we

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:32.730
looked at all sorts of things and we
 

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:34.520
looked at all sorts of things and we
started like everybody else you can take

sodium hydroxide and sure enough it
 

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.230
sodium hydroxide and sure enough it
works it works very well on the capture

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240
works it works very well on the capture
 

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.690
works it works very well on the capture
side it's very cheap on the capture side

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:41.700
side it's very cheap on the capture side
 

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:44.630
side it's very cheap on the capture side
but now the co2 is really bound then you

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640
but now the co2 is really bound then you
 

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.880
but now the co2 is really bound then you
can't get it off easily and so we

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:46.890
can't get it off easily and so we
 

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:51.020
can't get it off easily and so we

00:22:12.619 --> 00:22:12.629
in it when it's dry it absorbs and when
 

00:22:12.629 --> 00:22:14.690
in it when it's dry it absorbs and when
it's wet it gives it back so here's your

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700
it's wet it gives it back so here's your
 

00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:16.820
it's wet it gives it back so here's your
polystyrene with a quaternary ammonium

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:16.830
polystyrene with a quaternary ammonium
 

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:19.430
polystyrene with a quaternary ammonium
attached and that acts like the sodium

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440
attached and that acts like the sodium
 

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.460
attached and that acts like the sodium
in a sodium hydroxide solution so now

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:22.470
in a sodium hydroxide solution so now
 

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.470
in a sodium hydroxide solution so now
the negative ion when I buy this stuff

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480
the negative ion when I buy this stuff
 

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.509
the negative ion when I buy this stuff
is a chloride I washed it out and made

00:22:26.509 --> 00:22:26.519
is a chloride I washed it out and made
 

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:28.970
is a chloride I washed it out and made
it a hydroxide not surprisingly it will

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:28.980
it a hydroxide not surprisingly it will
 

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.159
it a hydroxide not surprisingly it will
pick up a co2 and turn into a carbonate

00:22:31.159 --> 00:22:31.169
pick up a co2 and turn into a carbonate
 

00:22:31.169 --> 00:22:33.560
pick up a co2 and turn into a carbonate
what surprise does it picked up a second

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:33.570
what surprise does it picked up a second
 

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:36.619
what surprise does it picked up a second
co2 and it turned into a bicarbonate and

00:22:36.619 --> 00:22:36.629
co2 and it turned into a bicarbonate and
 

00:22:36.629 --> 00:22:38.269
co2 and it turned into a bicarbonate and
in moving from carbonate to buy

00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279
in moving from carbonate to buy
 

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:41.090
in moving from carbonate to buy
carbonate a sheet of this material and

00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100
carbonate a sheet of this material and
 

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.950
carbonate a sheet of this material and
let me see here here you see that we

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960
let me see here here you see that we
 

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.570
let me see here here you see that we
actually had it in sheet form a sheet of

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580
actually had it in sheet form a sheet of
 

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.869
actually had it in sheet form a sheet of
this material is it still as fast as a

00:22:47.869 --> 00:22:47.879
this material is it still as fast as a
 

00:22:47.879 --> 00:22:49.840
this material is it still as fast as a
one molar sodium hydroxide solution

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:49.850
one molar sodium hydroxide solution
 

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.999
one molar sodium hydroxide solution
covering a similar sheet so so the

00:22:52.999 --> 00:22:53.009
covering a similar sheet so so the
 

00:22:53.009 --> 00:22:54.950
covering a similar sheet so so the
upshot is the kinetics is as good as

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960
upshot is the kinetics is as good as
 

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:57.139
upshot is the kinetics is as good as
sodium hydroxide but I'm moving from

00:22:57.139 --> 00:22:57.149
sodium hydroxide but I'm moving from
 

00:22:57.149 --> 00:22:59.720
sodium hydroxide but I'm moving from
carbonate to buy company that alone got

00:22:59.720 --> 00:22:59.730

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.119
carbonate to buy company that alone got
as excited because the the energetics of

00:23:02.119 --> 00:23:02.129
as excited because the the energetics of
 

00:23:02.129 --> 00:23:03.799
as excited because the the energetics of
swinging between carbonate and

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:03.809
swinging between carbonate and
 

00:23:03.809 --> 00:23:05.629
swinging between carbonate and
bicarbonate is much more favorable than

00:23:05.629 --> 00:23:05.639
bicarbonate is much more favorable than
 

00:23:05.639 --> 00:23:08.029
bicarbonate is much more favorable than
the energetics of swinging between

00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039
the energetics of swinging between
 

00:23:08.039 --> 00:23:11.239
the energetics of swinging between
hydroxide and carbonate but then we

00:23:11.239 --> 00:23:11.249
hydroxide and carbonate but then we
 

00:23:11.249 --> 00:23:15.649
hydroxide and carbonate but then we
found out that if the dry raisin will do

00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659
found out that if the dry raisin will do
 

00:23:15.659 --> 00:23:18.379
found out that if the dry raisin will do
that the wet resin actually falls back

00:23:18.379 --> 00:23:18.389
that the wet resin actually falls back
 

00:23:18.389 --> 00:23:21.440
that the wet resin actually falls back
to the carbonate and that we call the

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:21.450
to the carbonate and that we call the
 

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.299
to the carbonate and that we call the
moisture swing and we got really excited

00:23:23.299 --> 00:23:23.309
moisture swing and we got really excited
 

00:23:23.309 --> 00:23:25.759
moisture swing and we got really excited
about this so here you see some of this

00:23:25.759 --> 00:23:25.769
about this so here you see some of this
 

00:23:25.769 --> 00:23:30.529
about this so here you see some of this
material in various forms and so the

00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539
material in various forms and so the
 

00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:33.499
material in various forms and so the
sheets absorb co2 from here they absorb

00:23:33.499 --> 00:23:33.509
sheets absorb co2 from here they absorb
 

00:23:33.509 --> 00:23:35.720
sheets absorb co2 from here they absorb
down to balogh partial pressures with

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:41.989
the empty you can easily go to one or
two ppm in the air air loading can reach

00:23:41.989 --> 00:23:41.999
two ppm in the air air loading can reach
 

00:23:41.999 --> 00:23:45.739
two ppm in the air air loading can reach
bicarbonate and the equilibrium is water

00:23:45.739 --> 00:23:45.749
bicarbonate and the equilibrium is water
 

00:23:45.749 --> 00:23:48.259
bicarbonate and the equilibrium is water
sensitive so we had experiment setup

00:23:48.259 --> 00:23:48.269
sensitive so we had experiment setup
 

00:23:48.269 --> 00:23:50.299
sensitive so we had experiment setup
like a bell like that where we did it

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:50.309
like a bell like that where we did it
 

00:23:50.309 --> 00:23:52.789
like a bell like that where we did it
inside then we replaced it with a small

00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799
inside then we replaced it with a small
 

00:23:52.799 --> 00:23:55.100
inside then we replaced it with a small
loop where we go around and so you see

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:55.110
loop where we go around and so you see
 

00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:58.369
loop where we go around and so you see
here data where the red line is the co2

00:23:58.369 --> 00:23:58.379
here data where the red line is the co2
 

00:23:58.379 --> 00:24:01.879
here data where the red line is the co2
content in the gas phase so if it goes

00:24:01.879 --> 00:24:01.889
content in the gas phase so if it goes
 

00:24:01.889 --> 00:24:04.489
content in the gas phase so if it goes
up the recent releases if it goes down

00:24:04.489 --> 00:24:04.499
up the recent releases if it goes down
 

00:24:04.499 --> 00:24:07.009
up the recent releases if it goes down
the resin absorbs and the blue line is

00:24:07.009 --> 00:24:07.019
the resin absorbs and the blue line is
 

00:24:07.019 --> 00:24:10.039
the resin absorbs and the blue line is
the moisture in this Soviet ways you're

00:24:10.039 --> 00:24:10.049
the moisture in this Soviet ways you're
 

00:24:10.049 --> 00:24:11.600
the moisture in this Soviet ways you're
changing the moisture level in the gas

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:11.610
changing the moisture level in the gas
 

00:24:11.610 --> 00:24:14.060
changing the moisture level in the gas
and so you see whenever we make it right

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:14.070
and so you see whenever we make it right
 

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.519
and so you see whenever we make it right
it absorbs co2 whenever we make it wet

00:24:16.519 --> 00:24:16.529
it absorbs co2 whenever we make it wet
 

00:24:16.529 --> 00:24:18.830
it absorbs co2 whenever we make it wet
it gives it back and so we can swing it

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840
it gives it back and so we can swing it
 

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.899
it gives it back and so we can swing it
back and forth as many times as we like

00:24:20.899 --> 00:24:20.909
back and forth as many times as we like
 

00:24:20.909 --> 00:24:22.520
back and forth as many times as we like
here's an isotherm so this

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:22.530
here's an isotherm so this
 

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:25.040
here's an isotherm so this

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:25.050
the loading of the resin as functional
 

00:24:25.050 --> 00:24:27.950
the loading of the resin as functional
partial pressure when the air has when

00:24:27.950 --> 00:24:27.960
partial pressure when the air has when
 

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.080
partial pressure when the air has when
the air has about a dew point around

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:30.090
the air has about a dew point around
 

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:32.870
the air has about a dew point around
freezing so this is desert air in Tucson

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880
freezing so this is desert air in Tucson
 

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.520
freezing so this is desert air in Tucson
Arizona as a matter of fact where we

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:34.530
Arizona as a matter of fact where we
 

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:36.260

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:36.270
doing things and so you see this nice
 

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:39.020
doing things and so you see this nice

different temperatures when the material
 

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.420
different temperatures when the material
is wet and notice the change is

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:50.430

happens is that in the wet ski system we

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600
happens is that in the wet ski system we
 

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.540
happens is that in the wet ski system we
see the same carbonate skate chemistry

00:25:11.540 --> 00:25:11.550
see the same carbonate skate chemistry
 

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:13.370

as you see in aqueous sodium carbonate

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:13.380
as you see in aqueous sodium carbonate

ions will hang on to a hydroxide and
 

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.480
ions will hang on to a hydroxide and
converted to a bicarbonate but the

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:23.490
converted to a bicarbonate but the

far away and so the bike carbonates are

00:25:27.590 --> 00:25:27.600
far away and so the bike carbonates are
 

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.960
far away and so the bike carbonates are
there all along all the way until it's

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:29.970
there all along all the way until it's
 

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.570
there all along all the way until it's
full you also see that the maximum

moist so it won't work very well in the
 

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.890
moist so it won't work very well in the
tropics it works very well in a desert

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:39.900
tropics it works very well in a desert
 

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.620
tropics it works very well in a desert

anything the water ranges itself to
lower the free energy even more and then

and I think that's why people were

00:26:56.210 --> 00:26:56.220
and I think that's why people were
 

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:59.060

step is the resin price and that happens

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:01.500
step is the resin price and that happens

spontaneously in the air in the wind so

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:04.290
spontaneously in the air in the wind so
 

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:08.090
spontaneously in the air in the wind so
so we don't add that work as work so we

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:08.100
so we don't add that work as work so we
 

00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.380
so we don't add that work as work so we
work a little bit like an air

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:09.390
work a little bit like an air
 

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:10.910

water we have the water release the co2

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:17.400

again and then in the end for the cycle

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:20.220
again and then in the end for the cycle

to close the water actually has to

00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:22.350
to close the water actually has to
 

00:27:22.350 --> 00:27:24.860
to close the water actually has to
evaporate and so we roughly consume

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:24.870
evaporate and so we roughly consume
 

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:28.040

this case so basically we have these

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020
this case so basically we have these
 

00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.080
this case so basically we have these

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:54.090
things in the air we put them in a box
 

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.420
things in the air we put them in a box
and make it wet now we have two options

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:56.430
and make it wet now we have two options
 

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.430
and make it wet now we have two options
either we evacuate the box before we

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440
either we evacuate the box before we
 

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.170
either we evacuate the box before we
make it wet then we get five percent of

make it wet then we get five percent of
 

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:02.000
make it wet then we get five percent of

an atmosphere of pressure inside which
is co2 in some water vapor or we put it

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:05.430
is co2 in some water vapor or we put it
 

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:07.190
is co2 in some water vapor or we put it
back into the air then we have five

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200
back into the air then we have five
 

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.410
back into the air then we have five
percent co2 in the gas stream and at

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:09.420
percent co2 in the gas stream and at
 

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:11.660
percent co2 in the gas stream and at
this point we didn't pay much energy at

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:11.670
this point we didn't pay much energy at
 

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.060
this point we didn't pay much energy at
all except for the water and now you

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:14.070
all except for the water and now you
 

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:16.280
all except for the water and now you
could go with a conventional process and

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:16.290
could go with a conventional process and
 

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.530
could go with a conventional process and
close the loop all the way to the top I

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:18.540
close the loop all the way to the top I

think it's smarter well we can debate

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:20.730
think it's smarter well we can debate
 

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:22.550
think it's smarter well we can debate
that but i believe it's smarter to

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:22.560
that but i believe it's smarter to
 

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.060
that but i believe it's smarter to
actually evacuate the alternative is to

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:26.070
actually evacuate the alternative is to
 

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.890
actually evacuate the alternative is to
capture it a second time and the

00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:27.900
capture it a second time and the
 

00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:29.780
capture it a second time and the
question may be what kind of energy you

00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:29.790
question may be what kind of energy you
 

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:32.900
question may be what kind of energy you
have if you have electricity then it's

nice to run compressors and pumps which
you have to do if you have a vacuum

00:28:36.290 --> 00:28:36.300
you have to do if you have a vacuum
 

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.230
you have to do if you have a vacuum

you may use heat to close the loop so

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:42.900
you may use heat to close the loop so
 

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.840
you may use heat to close the loop so
here's sort of a small picture of

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:44.850
here's sort of a small picture of
 

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:47.360
here's sort of a small picture of
something which could do it we assume we

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:47.370
something which could do it we assume we
 

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:48.560
something which could do it we assume we
have one meter as

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:48.570
have one meter as
 

00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:50.810
have one meter as
and going through our uptake rates

00:28:50.810 --> 00:28:50.820
and going through our uptake rates
 

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:53.269
and going through our uptake rates
around 25 micro moles per square meter

00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279
around 25 micro moles per square meter
 

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:56.210
around 25 micro moles per square meter
per second and so our release rates so

00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:56.220
per second and so our release rates so
 

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.129
per second and so our release rates so
we need we have a specific surface area

00:28:58.129 --> 00:28:58.139
we need we have a specific surface area
 

00:28:58.139 --> 00:29:01.340
we need we have a specific surface area
this is older we are better now of 24

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:01.350
this is older we are better now of 24
 

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:03.230
this is older we are better now of 24
square meters per kilogram this is not

00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240
square meters per kilogram this is not
 

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.060
square meters per kilogram this is not
the tiny nooks and crannies in there but

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:05.070
the tiny nooks and crannies in there but
 

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.600
the tiny nooks and crannies in there but
it's the layers of the material itself

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:07.610
it's the layers of the material itself
 

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.450
it's the layers of the material itself
and so we fill the filter volume with

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:11.460
and so we fill the filter volume with
 

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:13.549
and so we fill the filter volume with
about ten percent of the stuff and the

00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559
about ten percent of the stuff and the
 

00:29:13.559 --> 00:29:16.100
about ten percent of the stuff and the
upshot is if you wanted a ton a day you

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:16.110
upshot is if you wanted a ton a day you
 

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.870
upshot is if you wanted a ton a day you
would look at a system which is about as

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880
would look at a system which is about as
 

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.690
would look at a system which is about as
big as a container it would sit on top

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:20.700
big as a container it would sit on top
 

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.220
big as a container it would sit on top
and you could move the whole thing

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:22.230
and you could move the whole thing
 

00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:24.919
and you could move the whole thing
around inside your container we have

00:29:24.919 --> 00:29:24.929
around inside your container we have
 

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:27.919
around inside your container we have
then worked out what that might cost and

00:29:27.919 --> 00:29:27.929
then worked out what that might cost and
 

00:29:27.929 --> 00:29:30.200
then worked out what that might cost and
the point I stress is people always tell

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:30.210
the point I stress is people always tell
 

00:29:30.210 --> 00:29:32.570
the point I stress is people always tell
you well it's the cost goes linearly in

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:32.580
you well it's the cost goes linearly in
 

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.119
you well it's the cost goes linearly in
the concentration we would argue we are

00:29:35.119 --> 00:29:35.129
the concentration we would argue we are
 

00:29:35.129 --> 00:29:36.919
the concentration we would argue we are
in a regime where it still goes linearly

with a log of the concentration or the
 

00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.600
with a log of the concentration or the
dilution factor right and I think that's

00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:41.610
dilution factor right and I think that's
 

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.999
dilution factor right and I think that's
an important argument and people give

00:29:43.999 --> 00:29:44.009
an important argument and people give
 

00:29:44.009 --> 00:29:46.549
an important argument and people give

00:30:14.779 --> 00:30:14.789
similar slope for for pharmaceuticals
 

00:30:14.789 --> 00:30:16.519

which I think has similar arguments

00:30:16.519 --> 00:30:16.529
which I think has similar arguments
 

00:30:16.529 --> 00:30:18.320
which I think has similar arguments
attached but if you calculate it for

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:18.330
attached but if you calculate it for
 

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:20.180

mining what you get is that the price of

00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:20.190
mining what you get is that the price of
 

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:22.279
mining what you get is that the price of
a metal is roughly ten dollars per ton

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:22.289
a metal is roughly ten dollars per ton
 

00:30:22.289 --> 00:30:24.169
a metal is roughly ten dollars per ton
of ore and if you ask what did you just

00:30:24.169 --> 00:30:24.179

the noise compared to those first terms
 

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.759
the noise compared to those first terms
so in that case is clearly the linear

00:30:37.759 --> 00:30:37.769
so in that case is clearly the linear
 

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:39.440
so in that case is clearly the linear
term which dominates because the big

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:39.450

00:30:52.009 --> 00:30:52.019
tends to be invisible so I think this
 

00:30:52.019 --> 00:30:54.710
tends to be invisible so I think this
argument is simply not right so we did

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720
argument is simply not right so we did
 

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.620

don't want to do that unless you're

00:30:59.980 --> 00:30:59.990
don't want to do that unless you're
 

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:02.200
don't want to do that unless you're
really interested but basically we found

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:02.210
really interested but basically we found
 

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:04.270
really interested but basically we found
the materials cost in our devices is low

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:04.280
the materials cost in our devices is low
 

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.920
the materials cost in our devices is low
the manufacturer costs the first time

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:05.930
the manufacturer costs the first time
 

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:07.990
the manufacturer costs the first time
around is very high and we figured that

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000
around is very high and we figured that
 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.880
around is very high and we figured that
one time a day unit the first time is

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:09.890
one time a day unit the first time is
 

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:12.160
one time a day unit the first time is
two hundred thousand dollars right the

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.170
two hundred thousand dollars right the
 

00:31:12.170 --> 00:31:14.920
two hundred thousand dollars right the
operating costs the inputs of a low the

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:14.930
operating costs the inputs of a low the
 

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.420
operating costs the inputs of a low the
maintenance is high because if you had

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:16.430
maintenance is high because if you had
 

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.160
maintenance is high because if you had
time today and you have 30 minutes over

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:18.170
time today and you have 30 minutes over
 

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:19.420
time today and you have 30 minutes over
person there you just spent thirty

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:19.430
person there you just spent thirty
 

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:21.550
person there you just spent thirty
dollars a ton of three or two right and

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:21.560
dollars a ton of three or two right and
 

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.710
dollars a ton of three or two right and
so we figured the operating cost is

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720
so we figured the operating cost is
 

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.030
so we figured the operating cost is
about one hundred twenty dollars a ton

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:25.040
about one hundred twenty dollars a ton
 

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.760
about one hundred twenty dollars a ton
on the first try and we end up with a

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:27.770
on the first try and we end up with a
 

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:29.560
on the first try and we end up with a
total cost some of you two hundred and

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:29.570
total cost some of you two hundred and
 

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.210
total cost some of you two hundred and
two hundred fifty dollars by Tennessee

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:31.220
two hundred fifty dollars by Tennessee
 

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:33.280
two hundred fifty dollars by Tennessee

is a first-of-a-kind so if I came to you

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:38.270
is a first-of-a-kind so if I came to you
 

00:31:38.270 --> 00:31:39.760
is a first-of-a-kind so if I came to you
today and then you know you need to

00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:39.770
today and then you know you need to
 

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.890
today and then you know you need to
build a car in a machine shop you also

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:41.900
build a car in a machine shop you also
 

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.840
build a car in a machine shop you also
would have a two-hundred-thousand-dollar

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:43.850
would have a two-hundred-thousand-dollar
 

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:46.390
would have a two-hundred-thousand-dollar
item on your hands and as a matter of

00:31:46.390 --> 00:31:46.400
item on your hands and as a matter of
 

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.920
item on your hands and as a matter of
fact if you build a car other spare

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:47.930
fact if you build a car other spare
 

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:50.040
fact if you build a car other spare
parts it costs more than that because

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:50.050
parts it costs more than that because
 

00:31:50.050 --> 00:31:52.600
parts it costs more than that because
because spare parts are priced much

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:52.610
because spare parts are priced much
 

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.120
because spare parts are priced much
higher than the car itself so I do

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:55.130
higher than the car itself so I do
 

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.820
higher than the car itself so I do
believe that there is an enormous amount

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:57.830
believe that there is an enormous amount
 

00:31:57.830 --> 00:32:00.280
believe that there is an enormous amount
we're learning can drive costs down and

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:00.290
we're learning can drive costs down and
 

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:02.920
we're learning can drive costs down and
factors 54 so I actually not that

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:02.930
factors 54 so I actually not that
 

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.470

horrible but i do want to translate
these costs and i do want to point out

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:07.490
these costs and i do want to point out
 

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:08.980
these costs and i do want to point out
that a hundred dollars per ton of co2

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:08.990
that a hundred dollars per ton of co2
 

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:12.070
that a hundred dollars per ton of co2
will translate into 22 cents per liter

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080
will translate into 22 cents per liter
 

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.500
will translate into 22 cents per liter
of gasoline or if you are in this

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:14.510
of gasoline or if you are in this
 

00:32:14.510 --> 00:32:16.810
of gasoline or if you are in this
country eighty-five cents per gallon if

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:16.820
country eighty-five cents per gallon if
 

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.490
country eighty-five cents per gallon if
you get it down to thirty dollars this

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:18.500
you get it down to thirty dollars this
 

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.050
you get it down to thirty dollars this
is seventy cents per liter of gasoline

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:20.060
is seventy cents per liter of gasoline
 

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.440
is seventy cents per liter of gasoline
or twenty-five cents a gallon the other

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:23.450
or twenty-five cents a gallon the other
 

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:26.560
or twenty-five cents a gallon the other

a liter of gasoline has roughly 10

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:28.910
a liter of gasoline has roughly 10
 

00:32:28.910 --> 00:32:31.540
a liter of gasoline has roughly 10
kilowatt hours of chemical energy in it

kilowatt hours of chemical energy in it
because i'm going to use that number in

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:33.290
because i'm going to use that number in
 

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:37.870
because i'm going to use that number in
a minute so this sums up where I see why

00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880
a minute so this sums up where I see why
 

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.030
a minute so this sums up where I see why
I see this as interesting because even

00:32:40.030 --> 00:32:40.040
I see this as interesting because even
 

00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.740
I see this as interesting because even
at a hundred dollars a ton it starts

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:41.750
at a hundred dollars a ton it starts
 

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:44.260
at a hundred dollars a ton it starts
getting interesting I think at thirty

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:44.270
getting interesting I think at thirty
 

00:32:44.270 --> 00:32:46.510
getting interesting I think at thirty
dollars a ton this would be cheaper than

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:46.520
dollars a ton this would be cheaper than
 

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.700
dollars a ton this would be cheaper than
any carbon tax I could imagine because

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:48.710
any carbon tax I could imagine because

in nineteen eighty if i asked you to
 

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:12.879
in nineteen eighty if i asked you to
make a reasonable cost estimate you

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:12.889
make a reasonable cost estimate you
 

00:34:12.889 --> 00:34:15.280
make a reasonable cost estimate you
couldn't have come up with a proper cost

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:15.290

hour because if you had you would know

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:19.340
hour because if you had you would know
 

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:22.180
hour because if you had you would know
how to do it and and so there's a

00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:22.190
how to do it and and so there's a
 

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:24.550
how to do it and and so there's a
paradox there right you can't you you

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560
paradox there right you can't you you
 

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.770
paradox there right you can't you you
can't predict where prices will end up

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:26.780
can't predict where prices will end up
 

00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:28.629
can't predict where prices will end up
and I think the honest answer is we will

00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639
and I think the honest answer is we will
 

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.940
and I think the honest answer is we will
not know but just because you are a

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:30.950
not know but just because you are a
 

00:34:30.950 --> 00:34:32.980
not know but just because you are a
factor five too expensive at the start

00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:32.990
factor five too expensive at the start
 

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:35.139
factor five too expensive at the start
doesn't mean you couldn't get there

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:35.149
doesn't mean you couldn't get there
 

00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:39.250
doesn't mean you couldn't get there
that's that that that's my point and so

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:39.260
that's that that that's my point and so
 

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.040
that's that that that's my point and so
you have to be careful if you if you

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.050
you have to be careful if you if you
 

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.840
you have to be careful if you if you
just make an incremental change I think

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:43.850
just make an incremental change I think
 

00:34:43.850 --> 00:34:45.669
just make an incremental change I think
it's fine to calculate the cost and say

00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679
it's fine to calculate the cost and say
 

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.560
it's fine to calculate the cost and say
I do i do not want to make that

00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:47.570
I do i do not want to make that
 

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:49.540
I do i do not want to make that
incremental change if you start talking

about new approaches new technologies I
think you have to say are there some

00:34:55.379 --> 00:34:55.389
think you have to say are there some
 

00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.609
think you have to say are there some
physical laws which there you can't

00:34:57.609 --> 00:34:57.619
physical laws which there you can't
 

00:34:57.619 --> 00:34:59.830
physical laws which there you can't
possibly do it and if that's the answer

00:34:59.830 --> 00:34:59.840
possibly do it and if that's the answer
 

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.840
possibly do it and if that's the answer
well then you should forget it but if

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:01.850
well then you should forget it but if
 

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.000
well then you should forget it but if
you just say manufacturing costs are

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.010
you just say manufacturing costs are
 

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:07.120
you just say manufacturing costs are
high you can't really make an argument

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:07.130
high you can't really make an argument
 

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.130
high you can't really make an argument
and I think the thermodynamics i can

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:09.140
and I think the thermodynamics i can
 

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:11.230
and I think the thermodynamics i can
calculate how much heat i would need to

00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240
calculate how much heat i would need to
 

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:13.270
calculate how much heat i would need to
make this happen on the order of 60

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280
make this happen on the order of 60
 

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.790
make this happen on the order of 60

much does it cost to provide that it's
 

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:20.560
much does it cost to provide that it's
cheap right if i ask how much does the

it's chi right I can't do it but with

low-cost right now to pull it all
 

00:35:26.369 --> 00:35:29.120
low-cost right now to pull it all
together but that is precisely where

learning can make a difference so then

you can say well maybe it's it's

that this gradually goes away and so you

that this gradually goes away and so you
 

00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.319

of course air capture could play a role

from that coal directly but of course

from that coal directly but of course
they will fall ten percent short and I

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:53.890
they will fall ten percent short and I

they will fall ten percent short and I
think the long-term promise has to be

00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720
think the long-term promise has to be
 

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.020
think the long-term promise has to be
that it's a one to one right if that

that it's a one to one right if that
were the case then you can think of as

air capture as being part of that mix as

air capture as being part of that mix as
 

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.849
air capture as being part of that mix as
one of the capture options and I think

00:39:05.849 --> 00:39:05.859
one of the capture options and I think
 

00:39:05.859 --> 00:39:07.650
one of the capture options and I think
it's the capture option of last resort

00:39:07.650 --> 00:39:07.660
it's the capture option of last resort
 

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:10.589
it's the capture option of last resort
because it can deal with any co2 it

00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599
because it can deal with any co2 it
 

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:12.990
because it can deal with any co2 it
doesn't care where it came from and of

doesn't care where it came from and of
 

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.180
doesn't care where it came from and of
course lower capture options come first

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:15.190
course lower capture options come first
 

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:17.039
course lower capture options come first
right so if your power plant can do it

00:39:17.039 --> 00:39:17.049
right so if your power plant can do it
 

00:39:17.049 --> 00:39:19.859
right so if your power plant can do it
at half price by all means take the co2

00:39:19.859 --> 00:39:19.869
at half price by all means take the co2
 

00:39:19.869 --> 00:39:21.809
at half price by all means take the co2
at the power plant right but more

00:39:21.809 --> 00:39:21.819
at the power plant right but more
 

00:39:21.819 --> 00:39:23.760
at the power plant right but more
expensive options simply cannot compete

expensive options simply cannot compete
 

00:39:23.770 --> 00:39:26.400
expensive options simply cannot compete
anymore so as a result air capture

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:26.410
anymore so as a result air capture
 

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.799

00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:08.480
supposed to win so so there's a lot of
of those details there but I think the

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:08.490
of those details there but I think the
 

00:52:08.490 --> 00:52:11.480
of those details there but I think the
next step is actually to move out and to

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:11.490
next step is actually to move out and to
 

00:52:11.490 --> 00:52:13.760
next step is actually to move out and to
do just that and I would agree with you

00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:13.770
do just that and I would agree with you
 

00:52:13.770 --> 00:52:15.380
do just that and I would agree with you
and I think at the end you only know

00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:15.390
and I think at the end you only know
 

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:17.900
and I think at the end you only know
after you did it whether we turn out to

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:17.910
after you did it whether we turn out to
 

00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:19.550
after you did it whether we turn out to
be two hundred dollars a ton and never

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:19.560
be two hundred dollars a ton and never
 

00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.920
be two hundred dollars a ton and never
get off that number or whether we can

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:21.930
get off that number or whether we can
 

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.900
get off that number or whether we can
actually systematically drive the cost

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:23.910
actually systematically drive the cost
 

00:52:23.910 --> 00:52:26.210
actually systematically drive the cost
down and and here I'm the optimist

00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:26.220
down and and here I'm the optimist
 

00:52:26.220 --> 00:52:27.830
down and and here I'm the optimist
because otherwise I wouldn't be working

00:52:27.830 --> 00:52:27.840
because otherwise I wouldn't be working
 

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:30.710
because otherwise I wouldn't be working
on it who says I think those steps can

00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720
on it who says I think those steps can
 

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.810
on it who says I think those steps can
be done but I think that these are

00:52:32.810 --> 00:52:32.820
be done but I think that these are
 

00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:34.550
be done but I think that these are
chicken in an egg yeah that they you

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:34.560
chicken in an egg yeah that they you
 

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:37.100
chicken in an egg yeah that they you
actually have to put the resources and

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:37.110
actually have to put the resources and
 

00:52:37.110 --> 00:52:39.350
actually have to put the resources and
then make it happen and then see whether

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:39.360
then make it happen and then see whether
 

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:41.150
then make it happen and then see whether
you can go from there to the next step

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160
you can go from there to the next step
 

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.280
you can go from there to the next step
from the company's point of view they

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:43.290
from the company's point of view they
 

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:45.200
from the company's point of view they
would love to sell so that gives you

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:45.210
would love to sell so that gives you

stepping stones let's say we start at

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:47.250
stepping stones let's say we start at
 

00:52:47.250 --> 00:52:50.030
stepping stones let's say we start at
five percent co2 in the exit string so

00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040
five percent co2 in the exit string so
 

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.000
five percent co2 in the exit string so
no evacuation you just make it wet you

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:53.010
no evacuation you just make it wet you
 

00:52:53.010 --> 00:52:55.520
no evacuation you just make it wet you
collect the co2 at roughly five percent

00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:55.530
collect the co2 at roughly five percent
 

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:58.100
collect the co2 at roughly five percent
and you feed it to algae right because

00:52:58.100 --> 00:52:58.110
and you feed it to algae right because
 

00:52:58.110 --> 00:53:00.650
and you feed it to algae right because
they want to buy co2 or you feed it into

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:00.660
they want to buy co2 or you feed it into
 

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:02.960
they want to buy co2 or you feed it into

not the climate we would like to work in
right now they pay roughly 100 euros for

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220
right now they pay roughly 100 euros for

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300
greenhouse and where they diluted back
 

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.130
greenhouse and where they diluted back
down because they want to be 900,000 ppm

00:53:16.130 --> 00:53:16.140

thereby also operated elevated co2 which

00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660
thereby also operated elevated co2 which
 

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:31.100
thereby also operated elevated co2 which
tends to grow tomatoes faster so it is a

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:31.110
tends to grow tomatoes faster so it is a
 

00:53:31.110 --> 00:53:32.840
tends to grow tomatoes faster so it is a
productivity enhancement for them and

00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:32.850
productivity enhancement for them and
 

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:34.310
productivity enhancement for them and
that's why they pay a hundred dollars a

00:53:34.310 --> 00:53:34.320
that's why they pay a hundred dollars a
 

00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:36.920
that's why they pay a hundred dollars a
hundred euros a ton of co2 to make this

so but none of that is big enough to

00:53:49.610 --> 00:53:49.620
so but none of that is big enough to
 

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:52.130
so but none of that is big enough to
really deal with these big issues but i

00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140
really deal with these big issues but i

do believe because it can start small

00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:54.330

do believe because it can start small
that you can actually sort of bootstrap

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:56.910
that you can actually sort of bootstrap

whole other talk my own view is that

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:07.590
whole other talk my own view is that
 

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.590
whole other talk my own view is that
these units don't want to get pretty

00:54:09.590 --> 00:54:09.600
these units don't want to get pretty
 

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.080
these units don't want to get pretty
fully big they want to get mass-produced

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:12.090
fully big they want to get mass-produced
 

00:54:12.090 --> 00:54:16.130
fully big they want to get mass-produced
and then if you want a thousand tons a

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:16.140
and then if you want a thousand tons a
 

00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.540
and then if you want a thousand tons a
day in a place then you have

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:17.550
day in a place then you have
 

00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:19.640
day in a place then you have
aggregate a thousand of these units into

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:19.650
aggregate a thousand of these units into
 

00:54:19.650 --> 00:54:23.480
aggregate a thousand of these units into
one place but implicit in this is a is a

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:23.490
one place but implicit in this is a is a
 

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:25.570

fairly sophisticated level of automation

00:54:25.570 --> 00:54:25.580
fairly sophisticated level of automation
 

00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:27.950
fairly sophisticated level of automation
because if I spend 30 minutes of

because if I spend 30 minutes of
 

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:30.560
because if I spend 30 minutes of
maintenance every day on a unit I just

maintenance every day on a unit I just
 

00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:35.000
maintenance every day on a unit I just
blew my budget on on labor costs right

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:35.010
blew my budget on on labor costs right
 

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:40.520
blew my budget on on labor costs right
so so small units aggregated requires a

00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:40.530
so so small units aggregated requires a
 

00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.560
so so small units aggregated requires a
high level of automation and

00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:42.570
high level of automation and
 

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:45.890
high level of automation and
sophistication that one but I do believe

00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900
sophistication that one but I do believe
 

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:48.260
sophistication that one but I do believe

it will gradually get more and more

00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:03.030
it will gradually get more and more
 

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:05.900
it will gradually get more and more
sophisticated in our understanding but

it won't get much more practical yes yes

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:20.190
it won't get much more practical yes yes
 

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:22.100
it won't get much more practical yes yes
but it doesn't have 20 tons of stuff in

00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.200
raise the pressure we could use some of
the water which i didn't show you if you

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:36.210
the water which i didn't show you if you
 

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:38.660
the water which i didn't show you if you
do the calculation for desalinating sea

00:56:38.660 --> 00:56:38.670
do the calculation for desalinating sea
 

00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:41.480
do the calculation for desalinating sea
water and so you would look at brians

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:41.490
water and so you would look at brians
 

00:56:41.490 --> 00:56:44.630
water and so you would look at brians
which are not extremely sailing if you

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640
which are not extremely sailing if you
 

00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:47.330
which are not extremely sailing if you
look at that that would would add less

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:47.340
look at that that would would add less
 

00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:49.160
look at that that would would add less
than five that would add roughly five

00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:49.170
than five that would add roughly five
 

00:56:49.170 --> 00:56:52.880
than five that would add roughly five
dollars to a ton of co2 so so we could

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:52.890
dollars to a ton of co2 so so we could
 

00:56:52.890 --> 00:56:55.520
dollars to a ton of co2 so so we could
afford that kind of level of energy so

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:55.530
afford that kind of level of energy so
 

00:56:55.530 --> 00:56:57.650
afford that kind of level of energy so
if you are now in that desert yes you

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660
if you are now in that desert yes you
 

00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:59.599
if you are now in that desert yes you
would create a big cluster of them and

00:56:59.599 --> 00:56:59.609
would create a big cluster of them and
 

00:56:59.609 --> 00:57:02.660
would create a big cluster of them and
put 10,000 hundred thousands in one

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:02.670
put 10,000 hundred thousands in one
 

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:04.340
put 10,000 hundred thousands in one
place and they would inject co2

00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:04.350
place and they would inject co2
 

00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:07.040

point is you would go where you know

00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420
point is you would go where you know
 

00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:12.680

this is a voluntary offset and I think
 

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.140
this is a voluntary offset and I think
right now people are not willing to pay

right now people are not willing to pay
 

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:36.540
right now people are not willing to pay
four dollars a ton and certainly not the

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:36.550
four dollars a ton and certainly not the
 

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:38.040
four dollars a ton and certainly not the
two hundred dollars a ton where we think

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:38.050
two hundred dollars a ton where we think
 

01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:40.560

of co2 in that local market was selling

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:49.330
of co2 in that local market was selling
 

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:52.200
of co2 in that local market was selling
at three hundred dollars and the reason

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:52.210
at three hundred dollars and the reason
 

01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:54.240
at three hundred dollars and the reason
this is the case because the co2 is

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:54.250
this is the case because the co2 is
 

01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:56.040
this is the case because the co2 is
basically driven by the transport costs

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:56.050

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:27.250
volunteers and sort of the order of
 

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.130
volunteers and sort of the order of
magnitude is thousands of dollars per

01:01:29.130 --> 01:01:29.140
magnitude is thousands of dollars per
 

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:48.420
magnitude is thousands of dollars per
car yes there are smaller scale options

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:48.430
car yes there are smaller scale options
 

01:01:48.430 --> 01:01:52.140
car yes there are smaller scale options
but it turns out the amount of co2 we

01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:52.150
but it turns out the amount of co2 we
 

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:55.230
but it turns out the amount of co2 we
make is just very large right in the

01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240
make is just very large right in the
 

01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.540
make is just very large right in the
u.s. it's 20 tons I don't know what it

01:01:57.540 --> 01:01:57.550
u.s. it's 20 tons I don't know what it
 

01:01:57.550 --> 01:01:58.980
u.s. it's 20 tons I don't know what it
is in France I would guess it's probably

01:01:58.980 --> 01:01:58.990
is in France I would guess it's probably
 

01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:02.190
is in France I would guess it's probably
seven or eight tons of co2 per person

01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.200
seven or eight tons of co2 per person
 

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:05.790
seven or eight tons of co2 per person
per year right so if you look if you

01:02:05.790 --> 01:02:05.800
per year right so if you look if you
 

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.160
per year right so if you look if you
look at those kind of numbers and say

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:08.170
look at those kind of numbers and say
 

01:02:08.170 --> 01:02:11.099
look at those kind of numbers and say
what do you do on that scale well this

01:02:11.099 --> 01:02:11.109
what do you do on that scale well this
 

01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:13.530
what do you do on that scale well this
is these 20 tons of the US would be 50

01:02:13.530 --> 01:02:13.540
is these 20 tons of the US would be 50
 

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.740
is these 20 tons of the US would be 50
tons of carbonate a year because you

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:16.750
tons of carbonate a year because you
 

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:18.480
tons of carbonate a year because you
have to go energetically downhill if you

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:18.490
have to go energetically downhill if you
 

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:20.160
have to go energetically downhill if you
don't turn it back into a fuel and the

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:20.170
don't turn it back into a fuel and the
 

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:21.900
don't turn it back into a fuel and the
only thing downhill are the carbonates

01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:21.910
only thing downhill are the carbonates
 

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:24.390
only thing downhill are the carbonates
right so you end up saying okay how many

01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400
right so you end up saying okay how many
 

01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.609
right so you end up saying okay how many
Greek Revival columns can I put in front

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:26.619
Greek Revival columns can I put in front
 

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:28.980
Greek Revival columns can I put in front
of my house because I can make three or

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:28.990
of my house because I can make three or
 

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:31.530
of my house because I can make three or
four a year right and so you pretty soon

01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:31.540
four a year right and so you pretty soon
 

01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:34.560
four a year right and so you pretty soon
we don't consume things short of water

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:34.570
we don't consume things short of water
 

01:02:34.570 --> 01:02:37.829
we don't consume things short of water
on that scale right and so I see yes I

01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839
on that scale right and so I see yes I
 

01:02:37.839 --> 01:02:40.650
on that scale right and so I see yes I
see plenty of smaller things we can get

01:02:40.650 --> 01:02:40.660
see plenty of smaller things we can get
 

01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:42.210
see plenty of smaller things we can get
into the concrete market you can get

01:02:42.210 --> 01:02:42.220
into the concrete market you can get
 

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.040
into the concrete market you can get
people talk about Simmons which I've

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:44.050
people talk about Simmons which I've
 

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:46.290
people talk about Simmons which I've
carbonate based and all of those things

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:46.300
carbonate based and all of those things
 

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:48.780
carbonate based and all of those things
can absorb a little here in a little

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:48.790
can absorb a little here in a little
 

01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:51.180
can absorb a little here in a little

you are left with a 19 at the other hand

01:02:56.339 --> 01:02:56.349
you are left with a 19 at the other hand
 

01:02:56.349 --> 01:02:59.280
you are left with a 19 at the other hand
so I'm looking at the the big options

01:02:59.280 --> 01:02:59.290
so I'm looking at the the big options
 

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:02.880
so I'm looking at the the big options
our disposal right and people call it

01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:02.890
our disposal right and people call it
 

01:03:02.890 --> 01:03:04.620
our disposal right and people call it
storage which sounds so much more benign

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:04.630
storage which sounds so much more benign
 

01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:08.190
storage which sounds so much more benign
but really its disposal or recycle to

01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:08.200
but really its disposal or recycle to
 

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:10.349
but really its disposal or recycle to
what it was and that is fuel right and

01:03:10.349 --> 01:03:10.359
what it was and that is fuel right and
 

01:03:10.359 --> 01:03:12.660
what it was and that is fuel right and
that means you had a cheap energy source

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:12.670
that means you had a cheap energy source
 

01:03:12.670 --> 01:03:14.609
that means you had a cheap energy source
in the in your back pocket because

01:03:14.609 --> 01:03:14.619
in the in your back pocket because
 

01:03:14.619 --> 01:03:18.660
in the in your back pocket because
otherwise you can't afford it yes

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:18.670
otherwise you can't afford it yes
 

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:34.620
otherwise you can't afford it yes
i yes we looked we looked at various

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:34.630
i yes we looked we looked at various
 

01:03:34.630 --> 01:03:38.940
i yes we looked we looked at various
options and this is early I think fifty

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:38.950
options and this is early I think fifty
 

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:43.700
options and this is early I think fifty
percent efficiency is ambitious but not

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:43.710
percent efficiency is ambitious but not
 

01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:48.600
percent efficiency is ambitious but not
not outrageous so so if you were to look

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:48.610
not outrageous so so if you were to look
 

01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:52.050
not outrageous so so if you were to look
at these various options electrolysis

01:03:52.050 --> 01:03:52.060
at these various options electrolysis
 

01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:54.570
at these various options electrolysis
can be a lot more than that and and you

01:03:54.570 --> 01:03:54.580
can be a lot more than that and and you
 

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:56.640
can be a lot more than that and and you
can push fischer-tropsch into the fifty

01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:56.650
can push fischer-tropsch into the fifty
 

01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:58.230
can push fischer-tropsch into the fifty
sixty percent so if you multiply this

01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240
sixty percent so if you multiply this
 

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.590
sixty percent so if you multiply this
together you you can aim for about fifty

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:01.600
together you you can aim for about fifty
 

01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.740
together you you can aim for about fifty
percent right so basically you need and

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:04.750
percent right so basically you need and
 

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.570
percent right so basically you need and
that's what I included when I said

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:06.580
that's what I included when I said
 

01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.930
that's what I included when I said
forties I assumed it costs you 2020

01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:09.940
forties I assumed it costs you 2020
 

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:12.270

kilowatt hours to make a gallon of
 

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.610
kilowatt hours to make a gallon of
gasoline rather than the 10 which is

what's chemically in it right and and

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:17.800
what's chemically in it right and and
 

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.280
what's chemically in it right and and
round trip efficiencies you can get to a

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:20.290
round trip efficiencies you can get to a
 

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:23.070
round trip efficiencies you can get to a
third and so by the time if you started

01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:23.080
third and so by the time if you started
 

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.840
third and so by the time if you started
with electricity when it was cheap and

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:24.850
with electricity when it was cheap and
 

01:04:24.850 --> 01:04:26.520
with electricity when it was cheap and
you ended up with electricity when it's

01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:26.530
you ended up with electricity when it's
 

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:29.460
you ended up with electricity when it's
expensive you probably got one third

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:29.470
expensive you probably got one third
 

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:31.830
