00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.020
I got an electronic kit just in time for my
birthday, so in this project let’s open

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.980
it up and explore some of the things we can
do with LittleBits

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.279
To start this project, I’m using the CloudBit
starter kit, and the LittleBits space kit.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.320
Opening it up, you can see all kinds of sensors,
switches and motors, including this little

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.740
power module, that hooks to a USB cable or
a 9 volt battery for power. Each little module

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.890
has magnets built into the ends so you can’t
connect them the wrong way. Instead, they

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.350
click themselves into position for you, making
simple circuit building a snap.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.109
Now if we connect an LED to the end of the
button module, you can see in less than 5

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:44.230
seconds we’ve made a flashlight, that works
each time we press the button.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.019
If we switch out the button with the sound
trigger module, we can turn on the light with

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:49.559
a snap or a clap.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.569
Alright, let’s take this to the next level
with the CloudBit module. This little piece

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:57.009
snaps just about anything to the internet,
and you’ll see how it works in just a second.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.569
Now if we bring in a remote trigger and this
owl puppet I found laying in the kids play

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:04.890
room, we can build a secret circuit to monitor
the kids.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.510
First off, let’s cut a small hole in the
feathers of the puppet, just big enough to

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.380
expose the sensor.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.900
This little device is going to let us know
when someone’s using a remote control. So

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.260
let’s snap some wires to either side of
the sensor, then snap it to the CloudBit module,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.750
making this circuit wifi compatible.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.500
I chose to snap my circuit to a mounting board
for convenience, and added a little bit of

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.980
duct tape, to keep the 9 volt battery beside
the circuit.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.070
Our remote detector circuit is complete, and
now all we need to do is hide it. You can

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.640
see the sensor hides pretty well in the forehead,
and to get it all working, all we’ll need

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.480
to do is throw the power switch.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.840
Alright, let’s go ahead and tuck everything
inside the puppet so it’s snug and secure,

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.700
and completely concealed.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.490
Now I set this one beside the TV in our kids
playroom because our kids are in the habit

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.250
of sneaking up to watch TV after we’ve all
gone to bed. The difference now is that when

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.140
they press any button on the remote, the sensor
in the puppet triggers the circuit, and sends

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.550
a text message to my phone, letting us know
that some little body is watching TV.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.210
I also found these could be used to detect
a thief. I made this circuit, in less than

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.920
10 seconds, by replacing the remote sensor
with a light sensor and an LED. When the light

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.950
sensor is covered, you can see the circuit
goes into standby mode, but reactivates when

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.390
light hits it again.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.940
I tried taping this inside my safe, along
with a little note for any would-be intruder,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.510
and if you watch carefully, you can see that
when the door closes, the LED shuts off and

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.600
the circuit switches to standby.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.390
Now if anyone gets inside it lights up, scaring
away a potential thief, and sending an alert

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.930
that someone just opened your safe.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.780
Now there are over a million circuit combinations
that you could make with these snap together

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.380
circuits, and for one final project, I tried
connecting a LittleBits AC switch inline with

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.870
a small space heater. The circuit uses an
infrared transmitter to activate the switch,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.690
which can be done remotely by setting a few
simple commands on www.ifttt.com. So now instead

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.319
of heating an empty house all day, simply
send a text message on your way home from

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.530
work, to turn on the heater. This way you’ll
save energy, and and still come home, to a

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.430
nice warm room.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.160
Well there are a few projects I tried with
a LittleBits electronics kit, to solve some

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.170
everyday challenges, and learn more about
electronics in the process. Well that’s

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.800
it for now. If you liked this project, perhaps
you’ll like some of my others. Check them
