00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.020
Hey there sleepy heads, Julia here for Dnews.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.870
According to the National Sleep Foundation
snoring affects 90 million Americans.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.100
So you’re probably not the only one sleeping
on the couch tonight.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.150
When you sleep most of your muscles relax.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.840
Including those in your mouth, throat and
airways.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.410
If these become too relaxed, they can get
in the way of your breathing.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.580
As you try to suck more air through the narrowed
airways, these muscles can vibrate, making

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.620
sounds like an airplane or lawnmower.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.940
Although it might be annoying to your sleeping
buddy, snoring seems mostly harmless.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.730
Yet several studies linked the night time
malady to some pretty nasty healthy effects.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.489
One study published in the journal Laryngoscope,
found that snoring might lead to a thickening

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.200
of the arteries in the heart.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.180
Snoring can also lead to headaches and even
decline in memory.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.120
Not to mention if you wake up your partner,
snoring could get you into some relationship

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120
trouble.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.550
But is your snoring so bad you wake yourself
up?

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.550
You might suffer from sleep apnea.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.970
Half of those 90 million I mentioned earlier
might be suffering from Obstructive Sleep

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.200
Apnea (OSA).

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.310
Apnea means literally “without breath”.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.850
Like the name suggests, this type of sleep
disorder can cause the airways to completely

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.090
close.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.340
Sufferers actually stop breathing when they
sleep!

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.850
This lack of oxygen wakes people up with a
snort or gasp.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.870
While waking up a bunch of times in the middle
of the night leaves you tired the day, Sleep

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.119
Apnea can also lead to a host of other problems.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.990
One large study was published in the journal
American Journal of Respiratory and Critical

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.990
Care Medicine.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.390
The study found that patients with severe
apnea have a 30% higher risk of developing

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.461
diabetes than those with almost no apnea.

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:38.461
And patients with mild or moderate apnea had
a 23% increased risk of developing diabetes.

00:01:38.461 --> 00:01:41.570
Another study published in the journal Journal
of Clinical Sleep Medicine surveyed a group

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.219
of patients for 20 years!

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.869
The researchers found that, even after controlling
for smoking and other lifestyle factors, people

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.350
with moderate to severe obstructive sleep
apnea were four times more likely to die,

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.679
nearly four times more likely to have a stroke,
three times more likely to die from cancer,

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.140
and 2.5 times more likely to develop cancer.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.040
Lack of oxygen to the brain is never a good
thing.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.780
One study published in the journal Cerebral
Blood Flow and Metabolism, found that the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.030
immediate effects of sleep apnea on the brain
were similar to the effects of a stroke!

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.569
Okay okay, have I scared you enough?

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:12.569
Sorry about that.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.310
So currently one of the best treatments for
sleep apnea remains the cumbersome CPAP machine.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.530
CPAP stands for "continuous positive airway
pressure".

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.519
Basically, if you can’t guess from that
name, the machine creates pressure on your

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:27.650
airways so those soft tissues don’t get
in the way of your breathing.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.900
The exact pressure depends on the patient
and decided by a physician.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.680
But you breathe easier and pretty much stop
snoring.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.570
While the whole get-up includes a face mask,
that goes into your nose and over your head,

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.129
it definitely helps.

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:44.299
Some studies published in the journal Sleep
found that using a CPAP machine improves blood

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.849
pressure and even restores brain tissue after
a year of use!

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.330
So while it might be awkward, it could actually
add years to your life.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.489
So wanna found out if your snoring is dangerous
or just dang annoying?

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.069
Well there’s an app for that, designed by
researchers at the University of Washington.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.860
ApneaApp uses sound waves to monitor breathing.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.900
The app acts kind of like a bat, emitting
sonar to track breathing patterns.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.420
According to its makers, the app can detect
sleep apnea as well as hospital tests 98%

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.650
of the time.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.420
The app is only designed for use on android
phones.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.750
Sorry hipsters, you’ll just have to wait.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.460
We talk about sleep a lot on DNews - for instance,
did you know anxiety messes with your sleep?

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:39.049
