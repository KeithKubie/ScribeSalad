hey everyone thanks for coming back to
Seeker Plus today I am trace this is

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.960
episode 2 of 3 in our new series on
internet obsession but really

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.110
information obsession in general I'll
explain why later make sure you

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.859
subscribe for more episodes and also you
can find an audio version of this story

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.580

at-tracedominguez
okay enough of that today we're gonna

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.870
talk about how our obsession with
information is changing the world out

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.230
here I'm talking about the stuff that
you do on your phone and how it's gonna

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.980
be changing everything else that you do
when you're not on your phone we're

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.270
gonna talk about the history and
engineering and politics of information

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.469
obsession and so much more again make
sure you subscribe let's kick into it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.760
okay so at the end of Act one
we were talking about getting obsessed

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.239
and how they get you obsessed they with
the quotes around it but does that

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.850
matter what could it possibly do and
what could that do to us is an

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.200
interesting question right but first we
have to understand how many people are

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.360
actually out there on the Internet
internet usage has exploded the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.170
International Telecommunications Union
found in 2000 that there were seven

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.930
hundred and thirty eight million people
on the internet all over the world

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.590
that's not very many relative to the
world population of six billion or more

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.030
right that's it just seven hundred and
thirty eight million people in 2015 it

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.670
was 3.2 billion people that's like half
of every human that we know exists in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.630
the universe and they're all on the
internet you know maybe there are other

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.780
humans somewhere else I'll have to wait
till Daniel figures out the Stargate to

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.020
do that but whatever on average
Americans spend ten hours a day staring

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.549
at their screens and that's at minimum
for me it's a lot more because you know

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.430
I'm staring at screens for you all what
we wanted to know is what all this

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.680
screen time is doing out in the world is
it really changing things not just in

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.790
the Estados Unidos you know we're
changing the infrastructure of countries

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.189
all over the planet in response to us
being obsessed with sucking information

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.420
out of the internet but let's be clear
this is not the first time this has

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.690
happened so before we get to the actual
infrastructure and the changes let's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.630
address
history here because this is seeker plus

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.040
and we love it when we get to do some
history in the 1700s books finally

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.230
became affordable for the average person
you could just go out and buy a book and

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.140
this changed the world now we had
something called reading mania people

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.980
were really upset and scared because all
these people they weren't talking to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.580
each other they weren't walking around
the town square I mean I don't actually

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.150
know that maybe they were but they were
reading books they had their heads down

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.560
reading a book remember the opening
lines of Beauty and the Beast this was a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.260
real problem that people were worried
about it was derided and feared by the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.900
1880s the New York Times wrote that
novels were unwholesome books were

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.550
unwholesome they were unwanted by the
media elite they wrote the novel reader

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.490
quote detests stories in which the
interest is not exaggerated and pulled

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.280
up ten times as high as the interests of
ordinary life they exaggerated normal

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.640
life in these books and ah who would
want that they called it unhealthy they

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.140
called reading spasmodic action of the
imagination it would affect our

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.820
imagination hmm that sounds so familiar
like perhaps our imaginations would be

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.770
affected by the media around us and we
would have shorter attention spans this

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.590
was in the 1880s today we have the
Journal of Neuroscience which did an

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.370
fMRI study where again they look at
blood flow to different parts of the

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.920
brain they also added something to that
to study what happens in our brains when

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.410
we read eye tracking so that way when
they were looking at the fMRI they knew

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.580
exactly which word people were looking
at while they were reading they called

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:05.820
this new system the fixation related
fMRI or fire MRI which just sounds

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.650
awesome their hypothesis was that when
you read you're associating real actions

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:15.420
in real life in your brain that's
represented in their research as well

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.140
the brain area is dealing with
manipulation of objects and carrying out

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:24.240
physical actions would light up when
people would read words on a page words

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.250
translate in our minds in our
imaginations to

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.080
real actions so if you're reading a
story about a wizard and you know living

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.120
in the UK or whatever you're picturing
those actual actions when he grasps his

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.520
wand you're picturing him in your head
grasping a wand another study done with

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.250
18th century literature specifically
found executive function also lit up and

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:54.360
our old friend the pleasure center
so not unlike social media today reading

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.610
helps give us reward in our brains we
like reading things we like social

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.540
interaction we like understanding we
like being entertained and we wanted

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.530
more of it so you know what we did we
learned to print and write and create a

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.870
whole supply chain to provide us with
that entertainment in this case in the

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:20.970
1880s it was with books we changed the
world around us to suit what we wanted

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.220
eventually we started creating other
things to do that same thing I'm gonna

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.340
fly through a few of them really quick
just to give you the idea I think you

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.550
probably get it but you know we're gonna
go Malcolm Gladwell and I'm gonna kick

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.970
the dead horse on this telephone's think
of all the pop culture there is around

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.150
telephones the sense of connection there
are not a lot of studies about this

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.890
telephone addiction kind of idea but I'm
sure we all know of people obsessing

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:46.030
over being connected about feeling
anxiety about missing our calls and we

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.780
can feel that and the New Scientist had
an op-ed in 1986 where they had

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.010
something that they dubbed the Tell
ahall ik which was a person who would

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:57.400
use the telephone for long periods they
could have 8 to 10 people on a single

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.640
call that was especially common with
teenagers and they were dubbed

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:05.110
antisocial and psychologically
imbalanced they were called sad bad mad

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.130
and shy sound familiar
of course it does you've probably heard

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.970
that about your social media use in
1980s as well New York Times writer

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:16.930
Trish Hall wrote the u.s. is becoming
addicted to telephone chatter some

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.940
people have as many as two telephones
for a single person can you believe it

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.919
there were also fax machines one guy was
called out which was a low mean for

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.030
faxing his girlfriend in Japan what are
we doing with ourselves they were asking

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:37.180
in the late 80s do young people have no
inhibitions seriously seriously they

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:40.750
were asking that people took this thing
that

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.960
and they started putting it around
telephones were everywhere we got them

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.830
at home we got them at work we got them
in airplanes in the 1980s and the media

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:52.240
kept commenting about how tella holics
were the reason we were doing this there

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.470
is some science behind this science
Reports has a study about social

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:00.340
interaction and how it gives people
meaning and it lights up in the ventral

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:06.130
striatum which you probably already have
guessed is part of the reward system our

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.730
good old friend what about television
addiction of course that exists as well

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:13.960
we've all heard and talked about that in
2003 a Scientific American piece wrote

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.440
about people who watch a lot of
television potentially having some kind

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.250
of substance dependence it was very
similar to drug uses what they were

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.900
trying to say you could have repeated
unsuccessful attempts to stop watching

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:29.620
TV and then you would get withdrawal
from the entertainment that you would

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:33.970
get while watching the Journal of
behavior addiction in 2013 did a

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.300
literature review of all of the
different studies around television

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:42.160
addiction and found the first mention of
it being back in 1954 televisions then

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.030
were much smaller black and white it's
very different time and they found that

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.750
it was addictions not unlike gambling
and substance abuse that most mirrored

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.380
television addiction and there were
behaviors that were involved as well

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.850
they called it food for the senses and
they said it was very shocking quote TV

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:03.070
addiction might be expected particularly
among persons experiencing inadequate

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:07.570
turnover of mezzo limbic dopamine that's
right

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:12.010
the reward system back again little
dance break so New York Times writer

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:17.020
Roland Neth away actually called
television quote an opiate for naive

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.580
children that was a headline we began to
change the infrastructure of the world

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.780
for all of these different things books
and telephones we crossed cables from

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.020
coast to coast we built dishes we
launched satellites we bounced the

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.880
signals off those satellites all to
satisfy this craving for information for

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.400
connection for social interaction right
and yes we haven't even gotten to the

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.599
internet yet this was all before that
dating back hundreds of years what I'm

00:08:43.599 --> 00:08:46.810
trying to say by going through all of
these different things is we build the

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:52.360
infrastructure to serve what we want the
infrastructure doesn't just happen to us

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:56.330
and then we react
the world adapts to us we are not

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:02.710
victims of our infrastructure books gave
us unprecedented access to power

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:08.570
newspapers gave us unprecedented access
to power radio television cell phones do

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:12.770
remember the CrackBerry those of us who
are a little older yeah the CrackBerry

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:15.320
was what they called the blackberry
because people were just on it all the

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.910
time and now there's the internet we
adapt the real world to once over time

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:25.040
nearly 90% of American teens report
being active users on social media the

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.300
youth have continuously outpaced other
age groups in adopting new media that's

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.770
according to Leonard in 2015 and the
examples of how the infrastructure has

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:37.850
changed outside of you know building
cable lines and launching satellites to

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:41.440
communicate better and there are some
examples of how we've changed

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.350
infrastructure outside of launching
satellites and building cable lines and

00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.630
such we physically changed roads and
sidewalks after the inventions of cell

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:56.150
phones for example in 2014 China added a
sidewalk lane in one of their cities DC

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.080
actually had one first here in the
United States as a joke but it was

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.630
copied around the world some people
actually thought maybe this is a good

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:06.170
idea to put people who are staring at
their cell phones in a separate lane in

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:10.280
the sidewalk as people who are you know
walking with purpose if you will I

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.000
couldn't actually find any follow-ups on
the original flurry of articles about

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.590
this in 2014 so if anybody knows if
those sidewalk lanes are still there if

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.070
they're used please tweet at us at
seeker there are people who are trying

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:26.600
to fight this around the world to make
sure that people aren't just looking at

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:30.440
their phones and walking around with
explicit infrastructure like in

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.220
Singapore where they're putting traffic
lights embedded in the sidewalk so you

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:38.090
know you're looking down at your phone
you can see the traffic light down there

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:42.410
and you know not to walk into into
traffic and hurt yourself they literally

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.650
have green and red signs embedded under
the sidewalk it's amazing there are

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.890
other places that do this as well the
Netherlands has crosswalks that are

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:53.420
built to keep you from using your phone
in Germany they have train stations that

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.990
are designed to make sure that people
using their phones don't get hurt and in

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.310
Thailand they also have mobile phone
lanes where people can walk and use

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.270
their phone at the same time it's pretty
amazing the Ohio State University has a

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.480
study where they talked about distracted
walking and they found that 1500

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:14.850
pedestrians were injured in 2010 alone
and that has doubled since 2005 and is

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.300
not just silly academics talking about
this the National Safety Council that

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:23.699
monitors all of this stuff found in 2017
there were 6,000 fatalities related to

00:11:23.699 --> 00:11:27.480
people being on their phone and not
paying attention in Honolulu they're

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:33.420
actually making it illegal to look at
your phone while on a crosswalk you can

00:11:33.420 --> 00:11:36.600
get a ticket for that and it's an
expensive one in the developed world

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.759
we're not changing the infrastructure
quite as much as in the developing world

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:45.269
mainly because we already have a lot of
it built but now that cell phones exist

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:49.589
the developing world is seeing a lot of
infrastructure change or maybe not

00:11:49.589 --> 00:11:52.800
change that we would have had to do let
me give you an example

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:56.850
we built telegraph lines phone lines
cable lines and cell phone towers that

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.449
have cable and microwave connections to
each other in Nigeria everyone had a

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:04.230
cell phone but they probably didn't
build all of the infrastructure that we

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.949
built to get there they built mainly
cell phone towers right they didn't

00:12:07.949 --> 00:12:11.970
necessarily need to build telephone and
telegraph lines to get information to

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.230
every single person's house everywhere
in the country the problem was they

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:21.120
didn't have internet access to Nigeria
the big back channel so that the

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.449
internet uses the big cables that are
underneath the water that ship it across

00:12:24.449 --> 00:12:30.060
the world those didn't connect to
Nigeria so boom K o PK I don't actually

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:34.440
know if that's how to pronounce her name
but she is awesome she started a company

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.190
and got access to the Internet in
Nigeria through a backhaul service and

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:44.459
they got access to an undersea cable and
now people in Nigeria don't need cable

00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:48.180
modems they can just use their cell
phones and access the Internet who needs

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:52.680
wires you know there are also all these
other plans to get Internet to places

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.410
without building all of this
infrastructure and you could argue that

00:12:55.410 --> 00:13:00.000
these plans are infrastructure in
themselves balloons from Google

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.899
satellites from all sorts of different
companies drones from Facebook and a

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:06.839
whole bunch of other crazy ideas to try
and deliver Internet to people around

00:13:06.839 --> 00:13:11.399
the world all in the feeding of this
information obsession over time we've

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:16.620
slowly demanded this stuff from
ourselves and there are people who are

00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.059
legitimately addicted to their devices
to television to radio to

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:24.869
News but there are also millions more
who aren't addicted and are using these

00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:29.669
services and with the internet just like
with telephones and letters and

00:13:29.669 --> 00:13:33.629
newspapers they're pretty ubiquitous so
the point of this whole exercise is to

00:13:33.629 --> 00:13:38.369
say a couple of things one information
obsession is not an internet thing it's

00:13:38.369 --> 00:13:43.709
a human thing we've always had internet
obsession let's go back to reading mania

00:13:43.709 --> 00:13:49.109
just for a second one quartz piece by
charles chu found when he did the math

00:13:49.109 --> 00:13:53.069
that the amount of time we spend on
social media is equivalent to reading

00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:56.879
about 200 books a year we could read
that in the same amount of time which is

00:13:56.879 --> 00:14:01.919
pretty incredible but does that mean
things are worse now I mean if you had

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:05.729
reading mania couldn't you just read 200
books a year right

00:14:05.729 --> 00:14:08.909
maybe it's the same maybe they were
reading 200 books a year and that was

00:14:08.909 --> 00:14:12.989
freaking people out in the same way that
now we're reading our time lines all the

00:14:12.989 --> 00:14:18.749
time and that's freaking people out
maybe they're the same I am not the

00:14:18.749 --> 00:14:23.999
person to ask if it is you'd have to ask
scientists and researchers while

00:14:23.999 --> 00:14:28.319
researching this piece there was a
really great piece on timeline comm it's

00:14:28.319 --> 00:14:31.769
by luis anslo you can check the link in
the description it's really really cool

00:14:31.769 --> 00:14:35.909
he did a lot of the research into
newspapers and headlines claims have

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:39.119
been made about addiction to various
technologies that we didn't get into

00:14:39.119 --> 00:14:44.549
including comic books video games the
Internet of course and virtual reality

00:14:44.549 --> 00:14:48.959
in a coming addictive way so this is
definitely a problem we're gonna keep

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:55.769
seeing but we've got the Internet now
it's it's on 3.2 billion people's phones

00:14:55.769 --> 00:15:01.499
or computers right what happens when it
gets to everyone should we change how we

00:15:01.499 --> 00:15:05.039
think about the internet and internet
obsession and information obsession

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:09.239
should we change that because in light
of what we learned earlier with people

00:15:09.239 --> 00:15:14.069
taking advantage of our psychology and
our reward systems aren't we just giving

00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:21.869
another 3 4 billion people up to this
problem shouldn't we fix it I don't know

00:15:21.869 --> 00:15:25.949
how to do that maybe you have ideas you
can tell us in the comments do you even

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:30.509
think this is a problem you can tell us
that too maybe it's just something we

00:15:30.509 --> 00:15:33.599
haven't gotten used to yet I don't think
there are people out there saying you

00:15:33.599 --> 00:15:38.940
read too many books
right so maybe we just haven't gotten

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.720
used to this one yet we'll see what
comes next thanks everyone for watching
