00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.410
- [Instructor] So we've spent
a lot of time justifying

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:07.040
why we have this downward-sloping
demand curve for money.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.390
But you're probably asking,
well, this is a market, what,

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:10.927
we didn't think about
an equilibrium point.

00:00:10.927 --> 00:00:14.150
And to do that, we need to
think about the supply of money.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.420
And in previous videos,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.390
we've started thinking
about the supply of money,

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.380
and we'll think more in future videos

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.600
about different monetary policies.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.920
But in a classical model,

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.490
we assume a perfectly
inelastic supply of money.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.880
So we draw it as a vertical line,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.500
which is another way of saying
that the supply of money

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.910
is not impacted by the
nominal interest rate.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.420
So this is the supply of money.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.430
I'll call that money supply one.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.370
Where it intersects the quantity of money,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.940
I'll just call that M
sub one right over here.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.210
And so this point where it intersects

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.770
is the equilibrium point
in our money market.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.440
The equilibrium nominal
interest rate right over here,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.950
we could call R one.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.390
This would be the opportunity
cost for holding money.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.100
Now I have to give a
little bit of a disclaimer.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.490
This is a classical model here,

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.130
and we'll talk more about
it in future videos.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.330
And most introductory economics class

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.890
talk about this classical model

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.850
where the central bank might
set the supply of money,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.600
and that doesn't change according

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.950
to the nominal interest rate.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.400
And then the nominal
interest rate gets set

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.360
essentially by this equilibrium point.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.090
Now, in the world that we live in,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.820
it actually goes the other way around.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.640
Central banks actually target
a nominal interest rate.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.980
And if the central bank is able

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.870
to achieve that target interest rate,

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.930
well, that's going to impact
the actual quantity of money.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.170
So keep that little disclaimer
in the back of your mind.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.700
But in an introductory economics class,

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.620
we assume this world.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.020
So now that we have this neat little model

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.630
for our money market,

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.250
let's think about what would
happen in different situations.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.830
Let's think about a situation
where, for whatever reason,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.010
people lose confidence
in the electrical grid.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.830
What would happen to the
demand curve for money?

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.340
And let's call this the MD sub one.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.760
Pause this video, and think about it.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.120
Well, if people lose trust
in the electrical grid,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.760
then this precautionary motive

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.700
for holding money becomes stronger.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.040
Regardless of what the opportunity
cost is of holding money,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.020
people would want to
hold more of it because,

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.550
like, hey, you know, I
don't know if I'll be able

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.350
to access money if the
lights go out again.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.660
I'm not gonna be able to go to an ATM,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.850
or the banks are gonna close.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.830
And so at any nominal
interest rate, I would

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.550
or, and in aggregate, people

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.290
are going to want to hold more money.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.280
And so that would shift the
demand curve for money to

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.140
the right.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.860
I could've drawn it a little
less hairy, but there you go.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.990
That would be MD sub two.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.890
We have this shift to the right.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.300
And then if that happened,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.480
if you had this demand for money increase,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.080
well, then what happens

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.830
to the actual equilibrium
nominal interest rate?

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.210
If you look at this point right over here,

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.640
assuming that the quantity
of money has not changed,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.010
you have a new equilibrium interest rate,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.310
nominal interest rate.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.370
It has gone up,

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.210
and that makes sense.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.793
If more people want to hold money,

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:15.510
in order to get people
to part with that money,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.240
you have to offer them more.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:21.170
The opportunity cost of holding
that money has to go up.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.090
And you could imagine
the reverse scenario.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.870
If, for some reason, people
thought it's a lot less likely

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.010
that the lights are gonna go
out, or they said, you know,

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.770
I don't need as much cash
around for transactions

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.520
or I'm not really into speculation,

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.030
well, then the demand curve for money

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.230
would shift to the left.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.030
And in that situation,
you would have a decrease

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.350
in the equilibrium nominal interest rate.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.800
I will leave you there.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.130
Always keep these models
with a grain of salt.

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.270
They're simplifications of the
real world, especially here,

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.270
where we're assuming a perfectly
inelastic supply of money,

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.470
which actually isn't the
case in the real world.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.320
But we can go with this for just,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.273
for the purposes of starting
to study the money market.
