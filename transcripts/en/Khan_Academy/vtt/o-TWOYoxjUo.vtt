00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.760
Identify complementary and supplementary

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.900
angles in the image below. So just as a reminder

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.480
complementary angles are two angles
that add up to 90 degrees and

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.120
supplementary angles, supplementary angles add up to

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.430
180 degrees.  So let's look at this diagram.
First let's look for the complementary,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.709
complementary angles. So angles that add up to 90 degrees and so they drew this right angle right over here.

00:00:28.709 --> 00:00:30.500
So we know that angle FAH

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.580
is a right angle, because they did this little
half box right over there,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.559
and it's made up of two adjacent angles

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.900
and these two adjacent angles make up a 90 degree angle so they must add up to 90 degrees.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.140
so the two angles-- angle FAC

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.660
Angle FAC

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.060
and Angle

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.660
CAH and

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.220
Angle CAH, let me do it in a different color since I already used that) and angle CAH and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.820
Angle CAH are

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.000
complementary because the measures of these two angles

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.640
must add up to 180 degrees are-- sorry, must add up to this 90 degrees right over here.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.100
And I think that's all the complementary angles.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.520
Just these two, they add up to this
right angle, to this 90 degrees.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.600
Now let's think about the supplementary angles, so

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.439
supplementary,

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.940
supplementary angles.  They add up to 180 degrees.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.640
So you have angle FAC, or we could call it CAF.
It's the same angle. So angle CAF,

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.559
and then this angle out here, FAB.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.547
When they're adjacent to each other
and they clearly form a straight angle

00:01:45.547 --> 00:01:48.750
which is 180 degrees
when you add their two measures.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.770
So these two are clearly

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.360
supplementary and

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.340
angle FAB.   FAB.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.760
CAF and FAB together definitely add up to 180 degrees

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.060
so they're supplementary.  And then the other one--

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.280
we can do angle CAH,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.480
angle CAH,

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.100
which is this right over here,
that plus HAB clearly add up.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.500
They form-- They're adjacent.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.920
They form a straight angle.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.960
So they are clearly adding up to 180 degrees.
So they are also supplementary.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.520
CAH and

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.600
angle HAB.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.800
And we're done.
These two angles add up to 90.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.780
These two add up to 180,
these two add up to 180.
