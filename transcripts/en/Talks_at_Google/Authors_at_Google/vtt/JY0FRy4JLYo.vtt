GARY A. HAUGEN:
Well, I didn't plan

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.430
to come to Google to get
razzed about my hair,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.790
but I guess you just
don't know what to expect.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.300
So thanks for keeping
me on my toes, Justin.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.390
Thank you all for
joining me today.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.880
It's a great privilege
to get to be here.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.180
I would like to share a
little bit about the problems

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.870
of violence in the
developing world,

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.810
but I like to start with
a story from Oregon,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.840
the State of Oregon.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.340
And maybe some of
you are joining us

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.169
from Northern
California might relate.

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.210
So there's this young
woman just a few months ago

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.760
who's home alone in her house.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.590
She lives in a rural area,
and just a few months before,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.660
actually, she had been
horrifically assaulted

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.530
by this guy.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.160
And this guy is now at
her house, actually.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.560
It's a weekend night.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.540
She's alone, it's
dark, and this guy's

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.272
actually tearing his
way into her house.

00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:55.730
And she does what
anyone else would

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.300
do, she picks up to the
phone to call 911, right?

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.090
And then what
proceeds to happen is

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.550
the 911 operator engages this
very, very tense conversation

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.350
where she explains to this
young woman that I'm sorry,

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.670
but because of budget
cuts in your area,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.390
you don't have law
enforcement in your area.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.650
That there's no one that
we can send for you.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.130
Law enforcement was
available on the weekdays,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.060
but this was the weekend.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.270
And there's this
incredibly painful

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.640
10 minutes of conversation
where this 911 operator realized

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.100
there's just nothing that
she can do for this woman.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.440
And horrifically,
of course, the man

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.440
did make his way into the house,
horrifically assaults her,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.970
and rapes her.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.120
And this story did sort of
make the news around the world,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.925
and the reason I
share it, though,

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:53.340
is because this is an
example of what billions

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.400
of poor people in the world
live in as their daily reality.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.360
Why is that?

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.930
Because they don't have law
enforcement in their area.

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.790
A recent UN study found that
about four billion people

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.160
in the world live outside
the protection of law.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.440
And one of things we're
trying to do in this book,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.630
"The Locust Effect" is first of
all, get the news of this out.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.530
And then have us pause
together to think

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.650
about that for a moment.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.360
What if billions, especially
of the poorest people

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.640
in the world, don't have access
to basic law enforcement?

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.886
What does that look like?

00:02:27.886 --> 00:02:29.260
Well, we know a
bit what it feels

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.968
like because of this
story of this woman.

00:02:30.968 --> 00:02:33.310
But it looks like something
different in Bolivia,

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.320
for instance, where according
to statistics, if you sexually

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.500
assault a child in
Bolivia, you actually

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.150
are at greater risk of
slipping in the shower

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.410
and dying than you are of
actually being convicted

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:46.830
for that crime.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.860
And as a result, there just
an epidemic of sexual violence

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.030
against women and
girls in Bolivia.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.210
In India, amazingly,
if you enslave someone

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.240
you have a greater chance
of being struck by lightning

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.870
than ever being actually
convicted for that crime.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.920
So this is what it looks like
in the developing world when

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.616
you have this complete
collapse of law enforcement.

00:03:09.616 --> 00:03:11.490
And then what "The Locust
Effect" tries to do

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.910
is then tell the
story of the violence

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.310
that this collapse has unleashed
for the poorest in the world.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.000
And we go to four categories
of violence against the poor.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.190
The first one is what
we call gender violence.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.500
It's just sexual violence
and domestic abuse

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.130
against women and girls.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.830
Which according to the
World Health Organization,

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.780
it accounts for more death
and disability in the world

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.130
than malaria, cancer,
car accidents, and war

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.080
all combined.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.160
The greatest threat for
the average poor person

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.970
in the developing world,
especially a woman or a girl

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.990
is violence close at
home, sexual violence,

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.300
or domestic abuse.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.660
I got to know a good
deal about this working

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.060
with International
Justice Mission which,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.120
by the way, so grateful
for Google's partnership

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.510
in this work trying to protect
the poorest from violence.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.470
And what we do is we have teams
in the developing world who

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.480
are local indigenous
nationals, and they

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.490
are lawyers, and
criminal investigators,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.620
and social workers and they take
on these cases of violent abuse

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.329
and oppression on
behalf of the victims

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.940
and seek justice for them.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.200
Make sure the perpetrators
are brought to justice,

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.310
and make sure that we
provide long-term care

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.620
for the survivors of this abuse.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.030
And so now we've been doing
this for almost 20 years,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.772
we've had 10s of thousands of
cases of this violent abuse.

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:33.480
And it's getting to
know those cases that

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.030
allows us to see the reality.

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.030
And it came on for me meeting
this woman, Lucilla in Peru.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.060
Lucilla's a common
Andean mom who's

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.840
trying to provide for
her little family.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.560
And as I got to know
her, I came to know

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.740
the story of living
in her little town,

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.120
she experienced the
horrific rape and murder

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.960
of her eight-year-old
girl who was just

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.130
dumped out on the street.

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.706
They didn't even have
the-- I don't know.

00:04:57.706 --> 00:04:59.734
They didn't even
bother with the shame

00:04:59.734 --> 00:05:01.650
of like throwing her in
the river or anything.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.650
They just left her
out on the street.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.170
And to follow Lucilla
on the journey

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:09.700
to see what it means
to try to get justice

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.890
for such a crime when you have
no functioning law enforcement.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.180
One of things I found out
about Lucilla's little town

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.310
in the Andean mountains
is that it actually

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:22.160
had a higher rate of sexual
assault against women and girls

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.920
than what was coming out of the
worst war zones of the Congo.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.500
And this was also
the idea that there

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.770
can be levels of
violence taking place

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.630
that maybe in the headlines
we hear about it when it's

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.930
in a war, or a
conflict, or a genocide,

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.820
but we're talking in this
book about everyday violence.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.830
The second category of everyday
violence that afflicts the poor

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.280
is straight up slavery.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.940
The global slavery index
just came out in October,

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.440
and it affirmed that there's
about 30 million people

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.800
in the world who are
literally held in slavery.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.320
That's more people in slavery
than at any other time

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.530
in human history.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.050
About 11 million people
were extracted from Africa

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.210
during 400 years of the
transatlantic slave trade.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.540
But today, there's about
30 million held in slavery.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.580
In the book, you get the
sort of up close view of this

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.410
from getting to know Mariama
and the story of her family

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.090
and a number of
other villagers who

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.630
were held as slaves
in a brick factory.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.210
And this is not in some
completely remote lawless

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:25.400
part of India either.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.090
This is really just on the
beltway outside Bangalore,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.040
which is as you know
the high-tech capital

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.670
in many ways of India.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.190
But it would just take
us a matter of minutes

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.820
before we could be able to
drive with investigators to be

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:41.910
able to find places
of literal slavery.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:46.770
So that's the second category
of violence is slavery.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.980
Third is the reality of police
abuse in the lives of the poor.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:54.070
The World Bank did
this global study

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.519
which revealed that, it
said, police and courts

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:59.060
in the developing
world actually make

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:03.820
poor people less
secure and poorer.

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.370
What you find is that poor
people in the developing world

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.890
don't run to the police for
protection and to be safe.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.590
They run from the police
to be protected and safe.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.710
Statistics will also
show that the police are

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.550
likely to actually steal more
from a common poor person

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.890
than anybody else in
their community just

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.980
from the daily grind of
extortion and bribery.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.150
So that's the fourth
category of violence.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.900
I mean, the third.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.870
The fourth is
violent land seizure,

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:32.089
the way that millions of
poor people every year

00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:34.380
are threatened with having
their land stolen from them.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.860
In fact, about 5 million a
year find themselves forcibly

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.780
thrown off their land.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.430
One of the largest categories
of victims of land theft

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.450
are widows.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:48.600
Widows like, Susan, who is
one our clients in Uganda.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.220
And one of the things
we don't realize

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.670
is that widows in
the developing world

00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:56.710
support about a half
a billion orphans.

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.379
And so if you throw that family
off their little plot of land

00:07:59.379 --> 00:08:00.920
where they have
their little shelter,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.420
and their little
garden, and they're

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:04.550
trying to sort of make
their way out of poverty,

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.780
you have just decimated
their capacity to go forward.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.580
All of this I
emphasize is what we're

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.031
calling everyday violence.

00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:15.280
Because many times when we
see or hear about violence,

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:18.040
it's the stuff that
makes the headlines,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.230
the big wars, the genocide.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.490
I know something about
the phenomena of genocide.

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:29.100
I was the Director of the UN's
genocide in Rwanda in 1994.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:33.000
And my job was to sort through
about 100 different mass graves

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.390
and massacre sites to see
what it looks like when

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:39.190
human beings just unleash
violence against one another.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.820
And the things that
you notice when

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.570
you're digging
through all of that,

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.028
and you trying to
picture what's it

00:08:44.028 --> 00:08:46.690
like in the moment of
genocide to be in that place,

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:49.367
you realize that that person
in the moment of terror

00:08:49.367 --> 00:08:51.450
is really not crying out
for someone to bring them

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:55.260
food, or a doctor, or a
teacher, or a microloan, right?

00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:57.010
They're crying out for
someone to restrain

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:58.760
the hand of the
machete that's coming

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.740
towards them and their family.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.680
And this is what
we are identifying

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.960
in terms of our
engagement with the poor.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:08.410
We know a great deal about
providing food, and medicine,

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.610
and education, and
other basic needs,

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:13.374
but what about the violence?

00:09:13.374 --> 00:09:15.540
And so this is an effort
through "The Locust Effect"

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:18.699
to begin to open our
eyes to this epidemic.

00:09:18.699 --> 00:09:20.240
We're calling it
"The Locust Effect."

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.410
It comes from these
stories from history

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:23.880
that are very
powerful when you've

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.510
got these poor farmers who
were sort of starting to scrape

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:30.240
their way out of poverty, and
all of their work and ambition

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.070
is in their crops, right?

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.040
And they see them growing
and they offer great promise.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:37.710
And then one day, the
locust just descend.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:39.310
And honestly, in
a matter of hours,

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.650
they will just wipe
out years of work.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.550
And this is the way violence
operates in the developing

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:49.570
world for the poor who are
trying to get out of poverty.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:53.430
The violent predators just
come through and take it away.

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:57.130
And so this means there are
tremendous implications for all

00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:58.980
of us who care about
global poverty.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.017
Probably all of us in
our lifetime in some way

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:02.850
have been engaged with
that struggle, right?

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:04.520
We've given some money.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.150
We've sought fresh water.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:07.520
We've sponsored a child.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.310
We've helped with
a school somewhere.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:11.750
We sponsored a microloan.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:15.080
And so all of these are
extremely important efforts,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.320
and we've seen a lot
of significant progress

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:21.004
over the last 30 years
in addressing poverty.

00:10:21.004 --> 00:10:22.420
But what we're
starting to see now

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.210
is we may be reaching
the limit of what

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:27.040
can be done if we
don't begin to address

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.420
the locust of violence who
can come in and just sweep

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.580
the benefits of all
that effort away.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.980
The thing you'll notice
about the locust as well,

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.490
is that not only do the
locust descend and destroy

00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:40.830
the fruit of the
farmer, but the farmer

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:43.290
is not going to stop the locust.

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:43.790
Right?

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.830
We have to actually start
to do something differently.

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.080
And so that's what "The
Locust Effect" is trying to do

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.430
is to begin to change the
conversation about poverty

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.340
to make sure that
we're mainstreaming

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.400
the problem of violence.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.349
Because if that's
off the radar screen,

00:10:59.349 --> 00:11:01.140
we're going to miss
out on something that's

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:03.089
undermining all
of our good work.

00:11:03.089 --> 00:11:04.880
One of the things that
the book tries to do

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.050
is to try to say, well, why
is law enforcement so broken

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:09.360
in the developing world?

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.970
Why is there such
a lawless chaos

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.250
for the average poor person?

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:16.647
The book brings forth
really three surprises,

00:11:16.647 --> 00:11:18.480
and then one thing
that's not so surprising.

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.530
The first surprise
is to realize, oh,

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.780
all of these law enforcement
systems in the developing

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.564
world, they were never
designed to stop crime.

00:11:26.564 --> 00:11:28.980
They were never designed to
protect the common poor person

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.850
from violence.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:33.690
They were set up by colonial
powers over the first stage

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:36.310
of the 20th century in order
to protect the government

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:38.170
from the common people.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.290
And they've never been
re-engineered to actually

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:42.310
enforce the law.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.810
And as a result, poor people
in the developing world

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.060
now have great laws.

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:48.430
This tremendous human rights
revolution over the last 50

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:52.060
years has embedded great
laws in these countries.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:53.990
But what they don't
have is law enforcement.

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.075
And it turns out that
that really matters.

00:11:56.075 --> 00:11:57.700
And mostly because
they've been saddled

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.616
with these colonial
systems of law enforcement

00:11:59.616 --> 00:12:01.470
that have never
been re-engineered.

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.050
The second reason
you find out is

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:06.380
that there's been a massive
privatization of security

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.880
in the developing world.

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.642
So if you've been traveling in
the developing world at all,

00:12:10.642 --> 00:12:13.100
you'll sort of maybe notice,
especially in your first visit

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:14.300
there, like almost
everywhere I go

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.675
somebody's got a
gun guarding us.

00:12:15.675 --> 00:12:19.370
I mean, he's at the
restaurant, at the hotel,

00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.340
they're at the whatever sort
of commercial enterprise.

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:26.409
There are just people
providing physical protection

00:12:26.409 --> 00:12:26.950
all the time.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.230
I was at the World
Economic Forum at Davos

00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.990
a few years ago with a
number of corporate leaders

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.460
who have massive investments
in the developing

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:39.176
world, huge
facilities, thousands

00:12:39.176 --> 00:12:40.300
and thousands of employees.

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.750
And I just asked with all this
violence in the developing

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.650
world that we're aware of,
like how do you guys protect

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.034
your people and your property?

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:48.700
And they all kind of
look at each other,

00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:51.500
and they actually almost
answer in unison to say,

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.360
we pay for it.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.290
But if you think
about this, it's

00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.140
one thing if those with
wealth and influence

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:02.040
leave the public school and the
public school kind of gets bad.

00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.105
Or you leave the public
transportation system,

00:13:05.105 --> 00:13:06.674
and the buses
become not so great.

00:13:06.674 --> 00:13:08.840
But what happens when the
people of wealth and power

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.700
abandon the public
justice system?

00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:13.600
When the basic law
enforcement system

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.420
is allowed to get worse,
and worse, and worse?

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.300
That is the reality in
the developing world.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:19.820
And part of the
reason it stayed off

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.120
the radar screen of
everybody is that the sector

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:27.560
of wealthy folks in the
developing world from whom

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.490
the economic growth
is coming from,

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.000
have been able to
secure themselves

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.610
with private security.

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.110
And so now, in the aggregate,
if you look at that country,

00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:38.150
it produces a decent
rate of economic growth.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:42.060
But for people who are living
off, let's say, $2 a day,

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.210
that's about more
than 2 billion people,

00:13:45.210 --> 00:13:48.000
those folks can afford to
be safe and so they're not.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.620
The third other
surprising reason

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:55.620
behind sort of the
brokenness of law enforcement

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.510
is it's just not been the
subject of our investment.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:01.080
We've poured trillions of
dollars over the last 50 years

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.690
into food systems, water
systems, public health systems,

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:07.390
all totally vital, and
actually we haven't necessarily

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.660
spent enough on trying
to engage those systems,

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.690
because the poor need
all of those things.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:17.650
But we can't find even 1% of
all that expenditure and effort

00:14:17.650 --> 00:14:21.040
over the last 50 years that has
gone to building public justice

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:23.640
systems that will actually
protect the poor from violence.

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.190
So the third surprise is to
say, oh, we haven't actually

00:14:26.190 --> 00:14:29.420
really tried all that hard
to address this problem yet.

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:32.680
The fourth explanation is
less surprising, perhaps,

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:34.810
and that's just
the idea that there

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:37.690
are people in power in
the developing world who

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.320
have figured out how to
succeed in the absence

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.860
of public justice, right?

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.470
And so they now actually
would feel quite threatened

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:48.180
if justice systems actually
started working in the way

00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:49.670
that they should.

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:51.529
So that's the
diagnosis that we're

00:14:51.529 --> 00:14:53.320
trying to make here in
"The Locust Effect,"

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.890
but then we try to make
a turn towards hope.

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:57.840
And that is to
ask, OK great, this

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.970
is totally depressing,
massive violence, grotesque.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:04.220
There's no way I'm
going to read this book.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.820
I'm depressed already.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:07.320
My wife is like,
yeah, give me a gin

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.694
and tonic the next
time I'm going

00:15:08.694 --> 00:15:11.150
to try to read one
of your books, Gary.

00:15:11.150 --> 00:15:13.250
So yeah, the bad news is true.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.860
But this is part of where the
good news comes from, right?

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.710
Because if you
think about the era

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:19.570
when the AIDS
epidemic was really

00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:21.290
beginning to catch
momentum in the world,

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.620
it required everybody to
open their eyes to something

00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:26.910
that was still a little
beneath the surface,

00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:29.360
but if unaddressed was
going to roll over just

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.430
about everything else.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.090
And that's where we
are when it comes

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.950
to the phenomenon of violence
in the developing world.

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.380
So yes, we've got to wake up
to what is the tough reality.

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:41.650
But the hope can be found
in a number of areas.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.060
The first is just in history.

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:48.120
The truth is all of us enjoy
reasonably functioning justice

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:52.080
systems here in New York, or you
can be in the San Francisco Bay

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:55.190
Area, or Chicago, or you're
around the world in Paris

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:57.920
or Tokyo, or various places
around the world that

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.710
have the more developed
and affluent economies.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.250
And in each one of
those cities, you

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:07.570
will find a history where 100
years ago, 150 years ago, you

00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.580
would have had the exact
same levels of just

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.960
horrific violence and
horrific police corruption

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.200
and brutality.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.220
In the book, we give
actually a series

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:19.620
of descriptions to ask you,
like, guess which city this is?

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.160
And you think your reading
from some just nightmare

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.970
of a city in the
developing world,

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:26.830
but actually it's one of
the cities that we live in.

00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.500
And you can see,
oh, every country

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:32.560
begins with a difficult
situation of lawless violence,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.950
and you need to build systems
to protect the common citizenry.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:39.380
So what is the
process by which you

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:42.910
move to law enforcement
that actually

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:44.460
protects the common person?

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.525
And you learn that this is
actually quite a doable thing.

00:16:47.525 --> 00:16:49.150
So you learn these
lessons from history

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.280
and some clues about what might
happen in the developing world,

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.370
but also some very
specific projects

00:16:54.370 --> 00:16:58.280
that we have highlighted in
the book where the success is

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.670
really very encouraging
that if you focus on helping

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.970
law enforcement do its job,
it has a dramatic result.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:09.359
One of those projects we did
in the second largest city

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:12.650
of the Philippines
called Cebu which

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.760
had a horrible problem
of child sex trafficking.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.770
The abduction and taking
of these young minor girls

00:17:20.770 --> 00:17:22.740
into the commercial
sex industry,

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.609
and it's just a business
of rape for profit.

00:17:25.609 --> 00:17:29.830
And this was just taking
place at a horrific level

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.470
in the city of Cebu.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:33.980
And we got some funding
from the Gates Foundation

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.020
to try and experiment.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.400
Let's see whether or not it's
possible to do two things.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.480
Number one, let's see if
we can actually stand up

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.490
local law enforcement,
which when we first

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.500
began the project in the
city, it was actually

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.870
on almost on the side of
sex trafficking, right?

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.170
They're actually protecting
this and receiving funding

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.380
for doing so.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.940
And by the way, the people
who carried out this project

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.620
were our local
Filipino staff, right?

00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.364
Local Filipino lawyers,
Filipino criminal investigators,

00:18:00.364 --> 00:18:02.780
and social workers, and they
were trying to do two things.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:04.870
One, can we stand up that
local law enforcement

00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:07.475
through training and
programs of empowerment

00:18:07.475 --> 00:18:08.850
that allow them
to actually begin

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:11.310
to send sex traffickers to jail?

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.090
And if we do that,
will it actually

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.600
then lower the amount
of sex trafficking

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.877
of kids in the city?

00:18:16.877 --> 00:18:19.210
So we had some outside auditors
come in at the beginning

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:21.410
and measure, well, how
much victimization of kids

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.930
is there in the sex trade
before the project even begins.

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:26.680
And then let's measure
it four years later

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.660
to see what the impact is.

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:31.830
So four years training
law enforcement,

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:35.550
setting up specialized
units, fast tracking courts,

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:37.740
providing good social
services to the victim,

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.950
so they could actually make
their way through the justice

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:42.580
system and receive healing.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.120
So after rescuing
hundreds of those victims

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.450
and then sending about hundred
of the traffickers to jail,

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.200
what was the outcome
after four years?

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.820
The goal of the
project was to try

00:18:53.820 --> 00:18:57.910
to achieve a 20% reduction
in the victimization of kids

00:18:57.910 --> 00:18:59.280
in the commercial sex trade.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:02.030
But after four years, the
auditors came back and measured

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:06.680
and they found a 79% reduction
in the victimization of kids

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.380
in the commercial sex trade.

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.820
And what you find is that
those who brutalize the poor,

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.210
and children especially,
are not brave people.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.290
They're doing it
because they can.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.360
And once they start
getting in trouble for it,

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.130
they start to leave the
children and the kids alone.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:25.580
So this is sort of the reality
that we're helping people

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:27.410
to recover through the book.

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:30.000
That, yes, there's a real
serious problem in the world,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.430
but there's really
hopeful possibilities

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:36.560
for making a difference.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.030
I would, of course, say that
the real purpose of this book

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.910
is to begin to change the
conversation about poverty,

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:44.650
right?

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:46.114
Because if you
enter a discussion

00:19:46.114 --> 00:19:47.530
about global
poverty, if you think

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:49.550
of the phenomenon
of yourself, you

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.037
think of, OK, food and hunger.

00:19:51.037 --> 00:19:52.120
You think of medical care.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.040
You think of shacks.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.110
You think of bad
sanitation, bad education,

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.110
the need for microloans,
all that sort of thing.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.530
But what does not
generally come to our mind

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.970
is the violence that the poor
are chronically vulnerable to.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.920
And we just want to
change that conversation

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.940
to make sure we're
asking the question, what

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.640
about the violence?

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.660
So we would like you to be
a part of that for sure.

00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:14.770
We'd love for you to buy
the book, first of all.

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.240
Educate yourself, share
it with other people.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.710
If you buy the book
this week, we actually

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.230
have some donors that
are going to match

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.010
that with a $20 contribution
towards the actual work

00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:30.240
in the field of trying to defend
those who are victims of abuse.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.520
We'll have a copy here.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.535
And Victor Boutros
who's my co-author,

00:20:33.535 --> 00:20:35.010
I always want to recognize him.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:36.350
Victor Boutros.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:38.660
We're happy to sign
those, and that

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.844
will add $0.4 to the value
of the book or something.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:48.860
So we would love for you to
buy the book and to share that.

00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:50.440
The second thing
we'd like to do is

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:52.890
actually, have you look
at a piece of video

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:57.319
that we've put together to
likewise share on social media.

00:20:57.319 --> 00:20:59.110
Because obviously,
we've written this book,

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.870
it's got 40 pages of footnotes.

00:21:00.870 --> 00:21:03.550
It really takes you into sort
of the deep intellectual case

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.666
about what's going on.

00:21:04.666 --> 00:21:06.040
But for most of
us, in many ways,

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.700
it's important just for us
to get a heart level almost

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.930
sense of what this
challenge is looking

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:15.840
like for the common person,
and also what the promise is.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:17.740
So if you've got two
minutes, let's have

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.800
a look at this
video, and then talk

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.589
about one more thing
we can do together.

00:21:22.589 --> 00:21:25.084
[VIDEO PLAYING]

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.700
So that's the second
thing we'd love you to do,

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:30.420
just help get the
conversation going

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:32.750
by sharing that piece of video.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:37.396
The third thing, is that right
now at the United Nations,

00:24:37.396 --> 00:24:39.270
there's a tremendously
important conversation

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.910
taking place related to the
Millennium Development Goals.

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.940
In the year 2000, the
international community

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.506
came together to build sort
of the definitive roadmap

00:24:48.506 --> 00:24:51.130
for addressing poverty, and they
set out these eight Millennium

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:52.241
Development Goals.

00:24:52.241 --> 00:24:54.490
And they've been pursuing
them over the last 15 years,

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.270
and have seen some really
significant progress

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.884
on those targeted things.

00:24:58.884 --> 00:25:01.050
The big problem that people
are starting to realize,

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.440
though, is that they spoke
of the massive solution

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.860
to try to deal with
poverty, and they did not

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:09.130
say a word about violence.

00:25:09.130 --> 00:25:13.690
And now, imagine you're trying
to move the world forward out

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.410
of poverty, but you're
not doing anything

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.480
about this violence
that is just ripping

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.330
the rug out from underneath
everyone's ability

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:21.280
to move forward.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.350
So we have a petition that
we're putting together

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:26.260
and there's a way to sign
on there that will just

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:29.610
be going to the UN team that
is starting to put together

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.430
the Millennium Development Goals
to say, hey, let's just make

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:35.450
sure that this conversation
includes addressing

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.740
the violence that is descending
like locusts upon the poor

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.260
in developing world.

00:25:40.260 --> 00:25:43.930
This is, again, from the
AIDS epidemic perspective,

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.870
it wasn't just the
public health experts.

00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:50.210
It wasn't just the sort
of global affairs experts

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:52.330
that rang the alarm
about the problem,

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:54.500
and said, no, this is
something we need to address.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.930
It was very, very
common people who

00:25:56.930 --> 00:26:00.390
began to think differently
about the problems in the world

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.890
and to make sure that we were
addressing this epidemic as

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:03.490
well.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.365
And I think it's an
opportunity for all of us

00:26:05.365 --> 00:26:07.260
to raise our voice
on behalf of those

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.031
who are victims of
violence as well.

00:26:09.031 --> 00:26:10.780
So thank you very much
for the opportunity

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.950
to let me drone on here a bit,
but I would love to-- I've

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.950
been trying to guess about
what, if any of this,

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:17.020
might be interesting to you.

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.910
But it, actually, might
be better to ask you.

00:26:18.910 --> 00:26:21.160
So what questions do you have?

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:24.060
How might we engage the
conversation together?

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.865
And I understand from Justin,
unlike his prior advertisements

00:26:27.865 --> 00:26:29.600
to me, I don't
actually get to be

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:31.810
able to hear from
the folks remotely.

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.070
So you guys carry all
the burden of asking

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:35.540
the engaging and good questions.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.912
So here you go.

00:26:37.912 --> 00:26:39.120
What are thoughts, questions?

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:39.620
Yes.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:45.630
AUDIENCE: The question
is two for one.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.960
When you collected help like
[INAUDIBLE] and everything

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.720
you mentioned, do we expect--
does that decrease violence

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.020
in those countries
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:56.760
and by which factor?

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.580
And two.

00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.600
This experiment that
you did in the city

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.365
with the sex trafficking,
how much did it cost and can

00:27:04.365 --> 00:27:09.370
you put a price
[INAUDIBLE] on this program

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.886
compared to if you had given
meals, and food, and whatever,

00:27:12.886 --> 00:27:15.200
what the benefits are.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.610
GARY A. HAUGEN:
Yeah, great question.

00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.910
Sort of going at the first one,
I mean, the second one first.

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:26.970
The data on the actual
cost of law enforcement

00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:28.670
is available to us.

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:30.580
It'll give you an idea
of what it would cost.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:36.350
The data is not very good about
how much the economic benefit

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.950
is from all of that.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:40.105
And so it's just being
very much developed.

00:27:40.105 --> 00:27:42.370
But what you can
see, for instance,

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.840
is that where the
studies have been done,

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:50.650
the GDP is reduced
somewhere between 2% and 7%

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:54.290
an entire nation by criminal
violence and violence

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.339
in the community.

00:27:55.339 --> 00:27:57.880
You will see, in they did some
studies in Latin America where

00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:02.430
they showed half of the
accumulated net social capital

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:07.060
was eliminated, half of it
over a 15-year period of time

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:08.290
because of violence.

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.080
They're starting
to begin to develop

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.530
the numerical costs of violence.

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:16.200
It costs for instance in what
they call Disability Adjusted

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:21.820
Life Years, about 9 million
Disability Adjusted life years

00:28:21.820 --> 00:28:25.150
are wasted because of violence
against women and girls.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:28.060
And so that's massive
amounts of productivity.

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:34.300
What you also know is that the
economies that are actually

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.210
producing social mobility
are the ones that

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.935
provide protection for
those who are poorest.

00:28:40.935 --> 00:28:42.560
Because in the absence
of that, they're

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.392
unable to keep even the
benefits of their effort.

00:28:45.392 --> 00:28:47.600
Some of this is hard to see,
though, because in, as I

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.545
explained a little bit, in
low income and middle income

00:28:50.545 --> 00:28:51.920
countries right
now, you actually

00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:57.940
see some significant rates of
economic growth, reasonable GDP

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:58.600
advancements.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.930
But what you see when you
look at it, and disaggregate

00:29:01.930 --> 00:29:03.910
it is that that
economic growth is

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:06.850
coming from the sector
of the country that

00:29:06.850 --> 00:29:09.960
has protected itself
with private security.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:13.170
And that's a massive
expense, by the way, that

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.840
could be poured into a public
security, but at the moment

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.780
is just privatizing part of it.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:22.380
One of things that the book does
is call for much greater study

00:29:22.380 --> 00:29:24.140
of how much would this cost?

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.860
What would the benefit be?

00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:28.700
But there certainly is now
enough data from the World Bank

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.990
and from other multilateral
institutions that

00:29:31.990 --> 00:29:35.660
suggest that what is lost
to violence is massive.

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.150
And that if we don't get out in
front of it, that kind of cost

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.860
is just going to grow.

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.430
Yeah.

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:43.930
Other questions?

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:46.010
Thank you.

00:29:46.010 --> 00:29:48.130
AUDIENCE: So the
first question was

00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:51.440
people are looking at is from
an economic modeling standpoint.

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.060
Are people looking at it
also from a public health

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:55.780
standpoint?

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.602
Because the models
might be different.

00:29:57.602 --> 00:30:02.760
And the other question was,
I'm curious about the-- I mean,

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:06.260
solving this at the macro
level seems very hard, right?

00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:10.010
Because you have civil societies
that may not have traditions,

00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:14.500
and they differ radically.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.036
So I'd like you to talk
a little bit about that.

00:30:17.036 --> 00:30:17.867
Perfect.

00:30:17.867 --> 00:30:18.950
GARY A. HAUGEN: Thank you.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:24.310
Yeah, certainly this has, over
just maybe the last 15 years,

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:28.140
been looked at now as an
epidemiological matter

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:29.420
from the public health sector.

00:30:29.420 --> 00:30:32.210
In fact, the World Health
Organization, it was about 10,

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:35.190
15 years ago now, did
this massive global study

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.500
about violence as
a health problem.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.530
And that's where much
of the data for the book

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:43.840
is now coming from is the
World Health Organization

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.850
and public health
experts are dialed

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:51.270
into sort of the implications,
the ripple effects, of violence

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:52.770
in the lives of poor people.

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:55.300
What public health
has no experience in,

00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.400
however, is how you
stop the violence.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.770
And what is then
unfortunate is that world

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:06.350
of law enforcement that actually
reduces violent behavior is

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:09.189
sort of then off in its
own silo and public health

00:31:09.189 --> 00:31:10.230
has been off in its silo.

00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:11.670
And what we're
encouraging now is

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:13.940
that those things come together.

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:20.780
There's been some work done
on the economics of violence

00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:24.530
and the way that
undermines economic growth.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.310
But most of that's been
done in developed countries.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.560
So obviously, the data's
easier and more available,

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:32.810
and it's a little
too bad the way

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:35.050
our study tends to
run to the places

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.740
where the examination of
the problem is easiest.

00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:39.490
That makes sense in a
certain kind of way,

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:41.419
but we do need to bring
a lot of those lenses

00:31:41.419 --> 00:31:43.460
now into the developing
world to fully appreciate

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:44.990
what's happening.

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:49.634
The other question
is absolutely the one

00:31:49.634 --> 00:31:51.300
to be answered, which
is, wow, this just

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:55.390
sounds like this massive generic
problem that actually is very

00:31:55.390 --> 00:32:00.490
localized in its manifestations,
and probably in its solutions,

00:32:00.490 --> 00:32:03.380
how do we begin to address it?

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.450
One of our suggestions
in the book

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.310
is precisely that what is
needed are some small scale

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:12.240
experiments in some focused
places in the world.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.110
It's true, for instance, that
penicillin works everywhere

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.740
in the world.

00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:16.800
And there are
certain ways in which

00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.174
law enforcement
works everywhere.

00:32:18.174 --> 00:32:20.940
As to say, in almost
every context,

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:24.990
if human beings face a
cost for doing a behavior,

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:28.020
they are reduced in their
likelihood of doing it.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:32.850
That's just true the same way
that penicillin just works.

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.210
But what it takes in a
given society and culture

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.240
for law enforcement
to be effective

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.480
and to be supported
by the community,

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.200
that's a different
equation everywhere.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.950
So we're interested
in supporting,

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.220
and actually are
pursuing now, we

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:50.190
have seven different
projects around the world,

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.109
like the Cebu one,
which says, OK,

00:32:52.109 --> 00:32:53.900
not everywhere and in
regard to everything,

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.970
but let's start in
a few laboratories

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:57.360
and begin to experiment.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.820
What does it take in order
to do one thing first,

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.040
stand up local law enforcement?

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.810
Have the police, and the courts,
and the public justice system

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.680
actually switch sides.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.495
So that instead of
preying upon the poor,

00:33:10.495 --> 00:33:12.440
they're actually
protecting the poor.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.524
And we've actually learned
quite a bit about that.

00:33:14.524 --> 00:33:16.190
And there's some
things you see that are

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:17.490
common in most communities.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.750
And there's other things
that are very particular.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.420
And so what there
needs to be is just

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:23.920
a much more robust
experimentation

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.380
of this in the world.

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.450
Because again, it's not going
to come from a silver bullet

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:29.890
one size fits all.

00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.810
We did here in America, so
it's going to work over here.

00:33:32.810 --> 00:33:36.130
It's going to be a customized,
tailor-made, and community

00:33:36.130 --> 00:33:41.270
owned struggle in order to
bring justice for the poor.

00:33:41.270 --> 00:33:45.380
But that's when we need to start
to bring resources and effort

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:48.960
to that's commensurate to
the size of the problem.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.360
Thank you.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.865
Other questions?

00:33:52.865 --> 00:33:53.490
Please, Justin.

00:33:56.982 --> 00:33:58.690
AUDIENCE: So being
that we are at Google,

00:33:58.690 --> 00:34:01.090
I'm curious as to what your
thoughts are on the role

00:34:01.090 --> 00:34:03.050
that technology
can play in being

00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:05.130
a constructive element
of these changes.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.860
GARY A. HAUGEN: Yeah,
well, one of things

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:08.750
I'm hoping technology
will do is just sort

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:12.300
of shrink the world in
terms of awareness, right?

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.000
Because one of the things that's
difficult in this era is we

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.550
can live on different
planetary systems, right?

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:21.620
I mean, the idea that there are
millions of people in slavery.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.610
The idea that sexual assault
can take place at such a level

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.469
that you're more likely
to fall in the shower

00:34:28.469 --> 00:34:30.690
than to ever go to jail for it.

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:33.040
Those can feel so far from us.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.579
And one of the things
that this era has done

00:34:36.579 --> 00:34:38.120
is shrink that world
so that everyone

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.780
can be much more aware of this.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.179
One of things that we're
also starting to bring

00:34:43.179 --> 00:34:44.800
is visualization of this.

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:47.719
I mean, our teams now do
undercover investigations

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:50.590
that expose these kinds of
abuses that are taking place.

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.052
And that stuff can now
almost be shared real time

00:34:53.052 --> 00:34:53.760
around the world.

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.239
It's going to be
harder and harder

00:34:55.239 --> 00:34:58.520
to get away with this stuff.

00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:00.360
But once we have
exposure, then we

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:04.430
need to move actually
towards solutions.

00:35:04.430 --> 00:35:07.150
The other thing that technology
has a capacity to do,

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.020
amazingly, is bring
accountability

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:10.915
and transparency.

00:35:10.915 --> 00:35:13.040
You're starting to see this
in the corruption realm

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:18.180
now where instead
of paying a police

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.620
officer for your ticket on
the spot, you go to some kiosk

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.370
somewhere electronically
and pay for that.

00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:25.661
So it isn't even the opportunity
for the police officer

00:35:25.661 --> 00:35:26.900
to take the money.

00:35:26.900 --> 00:35:31.277
Or to like be able to
go to register and say,

00:35:31.277 --> 00:35:33.610
yeah, there were supposed to
be police in our community,

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:36.200
and if this is day 20 where
we've never seen anybody,

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.010
and all that sort of data and
that picture starts to appear.

00:35:41.010 --> 00:35:47.390
So we're even exploring the ways
in which satellite imagery is

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:51.360
able to actually see
where the brick kilns are

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:55.530
in South Asia where there's
more likely to be slavery.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.440
And the tracking of
criminality, the new VP

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:04.170
of investigations at IJM is
the former director of NCIS.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:07.390
And he's very interested in
trying to leverage technology

00:36:07.390 --> 00:36:09.910
in this crime fighting
effort around the world.

00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:12.660
So I'm not the one,
certainly, to be

00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.660
able to suggest what all
the possibilities are,

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.250
but what I would love to
do is to see those who have

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.670
this expertise and these
capacities just sort of join

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:20.795
the struggle and the fight.

00:36:23.392 --> 00:36:25.210
Yes sir.

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.260
AUDIENCE: Just as an idea,
with the proliferation

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.831
of cell phones
throughout the world.

00:36:30.831 --> 00:36:32.080
What about the self-reporting?

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.270
GARY A. HAUGEN: Absolutely.

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:35.200
Yeah, you do notice
that right now.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.420
There are very few
bad things that

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:42.304
happen these days sort of in any
kind of public way, especially

00:36:42.304 --> 00:36:44.220
law enforcement and so
forth that there aren't

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:47.290
five people around
with a cell phone.

00:36:47.290 --> 00:36:49.520
Challenge, of course, in
the poorest communities

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.120
is the people living off $2 a
day have less access to that.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.470
And to be clear,
you can see why this

00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.670
is why crime runs to
those places, right?

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.910
It runs to be amongst
the poor, because they're

00:36:59.910 --> 00:37:02.590
going to be the least empowered.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.050
One of things we
do, of course, is

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:08.110
take that kind of technology
into those communities

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:10.960
and into some of the darkest
places where crime is taking

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.310
place, infiltrate it
with video technology,

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:17.410
and now the world can see
and know what's going on.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:21.690
And that is, you have
to know, that when

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:25.000
you think about violent
perpetrators of horrific crime,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.950
they just seem so intimidating,
and how could you ever

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:30.330
go against them?

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:33.460
One of the things you have to
understand about criminality

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:37.910
and violence is that there's
a reason why they hide it,

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:40.180
because they're afraid.

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.640
You fundamentally
hide what you're

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.870
doing, because you're afraid
that if somebody saw it,

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:48.290
you would be in trouble, and
you couldn't get away with it.

00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:51.900
And as our world has the
technology increasingly

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:56.750
for where the bullies cannot
do this without being seen,

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:58.460
they're going to do it less.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.044
So there's significant promise.

00:38:00.044 --> 00:38:01.710
The question now I
think, substantially,

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.115
is how to get those
tools increasingly

00:38:03.115 --> 00:38:04.698
in the hands of those
who are poorest.

00:38:07.165 --> 00:38:09.072
Daniel, did you have a question?

00:38:09.072 --> 00:38:12.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you we're
talking about experiments.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:15.280
I know that there have been a
number of things on experiments

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.000
in trying to [INAUDIBLE]
poverty like the team of MIT.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.340
Can we work with them?

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:23.382
And can you describe some
of your other projects?

00:38:23.382 --> 00:38:24.881
GARY A. HAUGEN:
Yeah, no, we haven't

00:38:24.881 --> 00:38:26.860
had the opportunity of
the poverty lab at MIT

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.700
that actually did a
really fantastic project

00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:33.550
with Indian police
to actually see

00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:35.940
what it would take for the
community to actually begin

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.440
to have greater confidence
in working with the police.

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.580
And it's like all
great resources,

00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.460
a set of things that are
confirmed by the data

00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:47.410
that, oh yeah, we really did
think that that would help.

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.360
And then also turns
out, nope, everybody

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.400
thought this would help.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.510
Doesn't help at all.

00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:54.860
So we would love to
have an opportunity

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:57.500
to engage some of our work
with that kind of very

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.422
careful sort of
measurement capacity.

00:39:00.422 --> 00:39:02.130
Because that's what's
it's going to take.

00:39:02.130 --> 00:39:04.240
It's going to be
sort of taking what

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.490
we think we know about improving
these law enforcement systems,

00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:10.220
and then testing it, and
measuring, and seeing what

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:13.010
actually does work and let's
put more resources on the things

00:39:13.010 --> 00:39:14.300
actually work.

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.520
Yeah.

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.460
AUDIENCE: So you
talked about violence

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.995
as contributing
cause to poverty.

00:39:18.995 --> 00:39:19.870
GARY A. HAUGEN: Yeah.

00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:23.490
AUDIENCE: What about the
causes of the violence itself?

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:27.027
How much of that is,
perhaps, need driven?

00:39:27.027 --> 00:39:27.860
GARY A. HAUGEN: Yes.

00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:28.901
AUDIENCE: Is it cultural?

00:39:28.901 --> 00:39:30.190
Is it innate?

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:32.200
Does mankind just suck?

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.940
A very small
percentage of people

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:39.090
having a very large
impact on the community,

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:42.700
or can you discuss
violence as an effect?

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.186
GARY A. HAUGEN: I'd love to.

00:39:45.186 --> 00:39:46.560
I will tell you,
any of you who'd

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:49.340
taken a genocide course
in college or something

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.220
and look at genocide, I
mean, it's disturbing.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.340
The capacity for the
very common person

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.790
to become very, very violent
in regard to their neighbors

00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:58.830
is amazing.

00:39:58.830 --> 00:40:02.230
And as the investigator
of the Rwanda genocide,

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:06.950
the story is there that once
the restraints were taken off,

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.350
and you could do
anything to your neighbor

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:16.430
to take their land, to
sexually assault the neighbor's

00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:19.820
daughter, and to
kill your neighbor,

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:24.990
this is unleashed with
quite frightening ferocity.

00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:28.560
So there is something
in human beings

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:31.560
that just needs to
be accounted for.

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.210
And we've seen in history, too,
that the way that most violence

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.520
is restrained is
by law enforcement.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.540
That's why we all
have law enforcement.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:43.150
None of you are choosing to
live in a neighborhood that

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:45.000
has no law enforcement.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.900
But it would be interesting,
and if I had a whiteboard here,

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.830
you could draw a graph of crime.

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:54.230
And on the left axis, you
would put different kinds

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:58.000
of crime and their frequency.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.040
And then what you
do is draw a line

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.934
on the horizontal axis of risk.

00:41:04.934 --> 00:41:06.350
And what you would
measure is sort

00:41:06.350 --> 00:41:10.770
of the elasticity of different
kinds of crime to risk.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:15.060
And at the top is what we
call crime of opportunity.

00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:17.550
You do it because you
can get away with it,

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:19.220
and there's no risk at all.

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.530
And so you do it
because you can.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.970
Then there's crime
of desperation.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:27.990
Maybe I'm poor, and I feel
like I got a break that window

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.040
and steal that bread, because
I'm really quite desperate.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.850
Then there's crime of necessity.

00:41:32.850 --> 00:41:37.700
You feel like in order to hold
power, or in order to survive,

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:38.850
you must commit this crime.

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:42.370
And sometimes when the state
commits crime, like torture,

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.900
they feel like they
have to do this, right?

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.772
It's necessity.

00:41:45.772 --> 00:41:47.730
And then if you go way
down towards the bottom,

00:41:47.730 --> 00:41:49.560
you have social
pathology and deviancy.

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.489
A person actually can't
even stop themselves

00:41:51.489 --> 00:41:53.280
from committing that
crime, because there's

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.930
a sickness involved.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:59.400
All of those have different
elasticity to risk.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:05.060
So the pathology, man, somebody
who's really a social deviant,

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:08.800
and you see this with
pedophilia and other-- there you

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.240
can actually ratchet
up to risk level.

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:13.550
And it drops maybe a little
bit, but that line actually

00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:15.934
stays pretty steady,
because in that they end up

00:42:15.934 --> 00:42:18.100
going to jail in many
respects if there's decent law

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:19.100
enforcement.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.035
Then you have
crime of necessity,

00:42:21.035 --> 00:42:23.670
and likewise, it
takes a little dip,

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:28.270
but then it stays
pretty steady, too.

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.860
Desperation, yeah, it
takes a fall a little bit,

00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:34.070
but when desperation
feels like necessity,

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:35.810
it also flattens out.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:38.150
But crime of
opportunity, amazing.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.990
That stuff goes out
a little bit by risk,

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:43.716
and then it drops off to
zero, because it was crime

00:42:43.716 --> 00:42:45.090
because I could
get away with it.

00:42:45.090 --> 00:42:47.680
Now I can't get away with it,
I'm just not doing any more.

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.600
The vast, vast, vast majority
of violence against the poor

00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:53.940
is crime of opportunity.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:58.187
And so we can with law
enforcement reduce that amount,

00:42:58.187 --> 00:43:00.270
and then we'll be wrestling
with the kind of crime

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:04.310
that we're dealing with in our
more developed countries, which

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:07.390
is the hard problems of
social deviancy and people

00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:09.970
who are desperate and have
no hope, all kinds of things

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:14.450
involved here, substance abuse
and a whole set of factors

00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:16.620
But all this crime
of opportunity, this

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:18.860
is where all the crime is
happening against the poor

00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:19.750
because they can.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:24.120
And that is a very,
very doable proposition.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.240
Long lecture on the
elasticity of crime

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:29.480
than you weren't
expecting today.

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.650
I apologize in advance.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:34.640
Any other questions?

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.235
Yes.

00:43:35.235 --> 00:43:37.375
AUDIENCE: What about the
real structural situation

00:43:37.375 --> 00:43:40.060
of just the police and underpay?

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:43.290
And the fact that in many
countries being a cop

00:43:43.290 --> 00:43:44.416
is a license to steal.

00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:45.540
GARY A. HAUGEN: Absolutely.

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:46.190
Yeah.

00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.100
So that has to be addressed.

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.170
That's the bad news.

00:43:49.170 --> 00:43:51.410
The good news is it's
totally addressable.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:54.970
In other words, it's not
rocket science in a way.

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:56.655
I worked the first
half of my career,

00:43:56.655 --> 00:43:59.030
and Victor currently is that
the US Department of Justice

00:43:59.030 --> 00:44:00.050
dealing with police corruption.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:01.160
So in every society,
you are going

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.950
to have police corruption,
but it actually

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.760
turns out there's things
that you can do about this.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:08.120
And one of the case studies
that we look at in the book

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:11.740
is the study of the
country of Georgia,

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:14.120
which is a former
Soviet Republic.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:16.830
And it was one of the most
corrupt countries in the world.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:19.680
In fact, in 2003,
Transparency International

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:22.350
ranked it as like 143
out of a 190 countries

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:23.675
in being the most corrupt.

00:44:23.675 --> 00:44:25.360
I mean, more corrupt
than any country

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.610
that we currently work in.

00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:29.130
And we work in some
very corrupt countries.

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:32.860
And yet there was a
political election,

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:36.480
a party was committed
to a platform, really

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:38.250
of anti-corruption
came into power.

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:42.310
And they seriously went after
police corruption first.

00:44:42.310 --> 00:44:44.700
Just to give you an idea,
police corruption in Georgia,

00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:48.380
you would pay $10,000 to
the police commissioner

00:44:48.380 --> 00:44:50.900
in order to get hired as a
police officer for which you

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:53.230
are paid $10.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:55.444
Why would you pay
$10,000 for a job that

00:44:55.444 --> 00:44:56.985
was only going to
pay to $10 a month?

00:44:56.985 --> 00:44:59.180
It's because you were
given a license really

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:02.650
to use that authority
then to steal from people.

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:04.650
And what happened as a
result, is the state just

00:45:04.650 --> 00:45:06.941
started producing more and
more police officers, right?

00:45:06.941 --> 00:45:08.000
Because I get this now.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.660
The more police officers
there are, the more money

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.350
I make as the
commissioner of police.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.820
As far as payment, let
me just address that.

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.040
So what they did is they
came in very committed

00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.120
to addressing this.

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.450
The thing they did is they
fired 16,000 police officers

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:27.790
in a single day in the capital.

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:29.450
Sent them all
home, and the place

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:31.260
was safer and better for it.

00:45:31.260 --> 00:45:33.020
Right?

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.170
Just sent them all
home and rebuilt

00:45:35.170 --> 00:45:37.559
the police from the ground up.

00:45:37.559 --> 00:45:39.100
One of the things
that they had to do

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:42.852
was then pay the
police very well,

00:45:42.852 --> 00:45:44.560
because they want to
recruit good people,

00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:48.330
and equip them well,
and supply them well.

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:53.010
And as a result a lot of this
committed effort, by 2010

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:56.120
seven years later, the
Georgian police force

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.100
was rated as less corrupt
than the US police,

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:01.890
the German police,
or the French police.

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:03.895
The World Bank wrote
up the study of this,

00:46:03.895 --> 00:46:06.390
and it's featured in the book.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.610
Because I actually
fortuitously sat next

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:10.182
to the prime
minister of Georgia,

00:46:10.182 --> 00:46:11.640
because I was amazed
at this story.

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.430
And I got a chance to talk
to him over dinner about it.

00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:15.513
And he said people say
that corruption is culture.

00:46:15.513 --> 00:46:18.260
He says, corruption is a choice.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.010
And when a society
makes the choice

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:22.290
to begin to root this
out, it's possible.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:25.320
And the place to start
amazingly is the police,

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:27.160
because it sounds
counterintuitive in a way,

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:29.076
because that's like the
worst, scariest place.

00:46:29.076 --> 00:46:32.220
But if you think about
it, corruption is a crime.

00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.830
It's stealing from other people.

00:46:34.830 --> 00:46:38.760
And if you have crime of
corruption in the crime

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:42.280
fighting force, your capacity
to root it out from other places

00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:43.880
is just about zero.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.586
So we've kind of laughed
about it and joked about it.

00:46:46.586 --> 00:46:48.710
Oh, the police are corrupt
in the developing world.

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.380
No, no, that's a
serious problem,

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.230
because that has
undermined your capacity

00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.063
to deal with any
corruption in your country.

00:46:54.063 --> 00:46:55.840
And so that's the bad news.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:46:58.810
The good news is, because
this is a command structure,

00:46:58.810 --> 00:47:00.670
leadership can
actually change that

00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:03.165
quite quickly if there's
commitment from the top.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:06.830
Any other questions?

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:09.179
Yes.

00:47:09.179 --> 00:47:10.970
AUDIENCE: You make a
sensible point, right?

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:12.760
We buy the story and everything.

00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:16.090
Why [INAUDIBLE], they have
the money and everything,

00:47:16.090 --> 00:47:17.549
why nothing has happened?

00:47:17.549 --> 00:47:19.090
GARY A. HAUGEN:
Yeah, Great question,

00:47:19.090 --> 00:47:20.590
which is why isn't
everybody already

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:21.950
addressing this already?

00:47:21.950 --> 00:47:23.910
That's a hard question, too.

00:47:23.910 --> 00:47:27.670
And actually, I've spent the
last 10 years going around

00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:29.250
to almost every
smart person I can.

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.631
Because as they started
to come to our eyes

00:47:31.631 --> 00:47:34.130
from just the daily work in the
developing world, it's like,

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:35.566
hey, isn't this
is a big problem,

00:47:35.566 --> 00:47:37.190
and isn't this just
going to get worse,

00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:39.170
and don't we need to
get out in front of it?

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:41.650
There are some reasons why
it's been very difficult.

00:47:41.650 --> 00:47:44.480
One of the reasons
is that the people

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:47.200
who are immersed in
the academic and sort

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.580
of technical disciplines
of fighting poverty

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.220
are just very foreign to the
world of law enforcement,

00:47:53.220 --> 00:47:53.720
right?

00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:56.970
So it's the economist, the
agronomist, the clean water

00:47:56.970 --> 00:48:00.460
engineers, the
public health folks.

00:48:00.460 --> 00:48:07.720
What it takes to actually
do a highly effective law

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.920
enforcement is a completely
different discipline.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:11.710
So these worlds have
been very far apart,

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:13.850
and we're trying to
bring them together.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:17.430
The second thing is that
it's been dangerous and scary

00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:22.669
for aid organizations to engage
supporting law enforcement

00:48:22.669 --> 00:48:24.960
in the developing world,
because law enforcement is not

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.105
a benign system.

00:48:26.105 --> 00:48:28.200
Right?

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:30.050
Because it's a coercive system.

00:48:30.050 --> 00:48:32.850
It's the coercive arm of the
state, and if it turns bad,

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:34.060
it commits abuses.

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:36.050
Now you helped empower
it, and you're like, oh,

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:37.300
now we're in trouble for that.

00:48:37.300 --> 00:48:39.720
So we actually made
illegal after human rights

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:43.900
abuses in the 70s and
80s for aid organizations

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:45.810
to assist police.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:48.809
Now it seemed like a good
idea to like stop the abuses,

00:48:48.809 --> 00:48:50.350
but the answer to
bad law enforcement

00:48:50.350 --> 00:48:52.680
is not going to be
no law enforcement.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:54.720
So we need to say,
yeah, there's a bad way

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.140
to assist law enforcement.

00:48:57.140 --> 00:48:59.600
But they're also clearly
now some good ways to do it,

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:01.570
and that's what
we need to pursue.

00:49:01.570 --> 00:49:03.560
Thanks again for your
patience and interest.

00:49:03.560 --> 00:49:07.150
And please buy the book,
and share the video,

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:09.380
and help us change the
discussion on the Millennium

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:10.130
Development Goals.

00:49:10.130 --> 00:49:12.280
Thanks very much.
