For all the action, mistakes, easter eggs
and cameos in blockbuster movies, the drama

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.540
and comedy behind the scenes can be just as
awesome. We're changing things up, and giving

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.020
you another rapid fire dose of movie trivia
you never thought to look for. Screen Rant

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.050
presents: Know Your Movies: 20 Amazing Movie
Secrets That Will Blow Your Mind #2.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.640
The Revenant
The director's commitment to realism didn't

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.480
just send the cast into the wild, but scenes
could only be filmed using natural light,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.870
with the crew waiting until the sun lit the
scene perfectly, and having just hours to

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.360
shoot each day.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.609
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
The Stormtrooper Finn gets his nickname from

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:45.589
his First Order ID: FN-2187. The FN stands
for Footsoldier Number, but the 2187 is a

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.550
reference to Leia's Death Star prison cell
in the first movie.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.729
Mad Max: Fury Road
Fans hoping to see a romance develop between

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:55.850
stars Max Rockatansky and Furiosa left the
theatre disappointed. But the doubles for

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.329
Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron didn't. While
they rehearsed the brutal fistfight between

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.659
the two characters, they fell in love, eventually
marrying once production wrapped.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.030
Avengers: Age of Ultron
Scarlett Johansson didn't know she was pregnant

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.560
until a day before filming started, so the
Ultron effects team was charged with hiding

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.520
her growing belly through CG. Aside from stunt
doubles, watch out for Black Widow covering

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.740
her stomach, or conveniently lying down for
entire scenes.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.140
The Martian
A lot of the humor in this Mars story comes

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.729
from the book it's based on, but the filmmakers
had some fun. In one scene, the head of NASA

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.659
makes an accurate prediction. It's accurate,
because that exact scene played out in the

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.220
novel, giving those who read it an even bigger
laugh.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.570
Jurassic World
Nobody would have ever guessed that Chris

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.430
Pratt, the chubby clown from Parks &amp; Rec would
wind up battling dinosaurs, right? Wrong.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.570
He made the prediction himself in a behind-the-scenes
gag video four years before being cast.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.909
Minions
The little yellow mascots of the Despicable

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.939
Me series are famous for their voices and
gibberish language. But for their standalone

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.750
movie, it was only the director Pierre Coffin
who supplied the voices. All of them. All

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.440
899 of them. Talk about dedication.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.840
Ant-Man&nbsp;
Even though Adam McKay was brought in to rewrite

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.729
Ant-Man, there weren't many connections to
his other hit, Anchorman. But the Pym Technologies

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.330
building should look familiar - it's the same
Atlanta building used for the Channel 4 headquarters.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.090
Deadpool&nbsp;
Almost every superhero movie costume comes

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.540
with a muscle suit to give the stars a comic
book body. But on Ryan Reynolds, the extra

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.200
muscles were overkill, so the finished physique
of Deadpool is all natural.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.360
X-Men: Apocalypse
The mutant Nightcrawler gets a second appearance

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.920
in this prequel/reboot, played by Kodi Smit-McPhee.
The actor finally joins the Marvel superteam

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.100
after he was originally cast as a young Wolverine,
in X-Men: Origins. He probably made the right

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.100
call.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.940
Warcraft
Even though the Orcs of this video game fantasy

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.040
are created entirely in computers, director
Duncan Jones still had full-sized models of

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.290
their in-game armor constructed to scale,
so the actors knew just intimidating their

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.800
CG characters really were.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.530
The Jungle Book
Most Disney movies tend to give animals human

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.690
personalities, but for the CG/live-action
Jungle Book, it's the opposite. Footage of

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.380
real animals was used as the base, with the
famous cast having to copy those movements

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.980
as they delivered their lines.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.930
Independence Day: Resurgence
Can you believe an Independence Day sequel

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.290
was actually planned as soon as the movie
hit theatres? The writer wound up returning

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.680
his pay for the sequel script, since he didn't
think the story was strong enough.&nbsp;Fifteen

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.870
years later, inspiration struck, and the story
for Resurgence was born - set two decades

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.120
after the first film.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.630
The Revenant
It wasn't just the cold and snow that star

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.310
Leonardo DiCaprio had to deal with, but his
vegetarian diet. When a scene called for the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.430
character to eat mouthfuls of bison liver,
he realized the fake version wouldn't work,

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.010
and chowed down on the real thing - admitting
he would never do it again.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.650
Furious 7
Paul Walker's death stunned movie fans, and

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.950
forced the makers of the Fast &amp; Furious team
to get creative. Body doubles, CG and Walker's

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.840
brothers were used to finish his scenes in
Furious 7. The most incredible solution? An

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.280
airplane scene that required the effects team
to copy Walker in, frame by frame, using footage

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.730
taken from Fast Five to finish his character's
story in the series.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.590
The Hateful Eight
Though he denied it at first, Quentin Tarantino

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.400
eventually admitted that this western was
planned as a sequel to Django Unchained, with

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.310
Jamie Foxx's hero one of the snowed-in bounty
hunters. Since audiences shouldn't know who's

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.530
good or bad, or going to survive, he eventually
rewrote the script with Django removed.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.610
Mad Max: Fury Road
American movie fans have learned one lesson

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.260
over the years: German or Russian accents
belong to villains. Wartime grudges are worldwide:

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.590
in both the English and German versions of
the movie, the evil Buzzards speak Russian.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:11.760
For the Russian cut, their lines were re-dubbed...
Into German.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.310
Star Wars: The Force Awakens
Director J. J. Abrams found a way to pay homage

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.480
to every movie in the original Star Wars trilogy
in his sequel, including the iconic environments

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.250
from each in Episode 7. The deserts of Tatooine
in A New Hope, the frozen snow of Hoth in

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.820
Empire, and the forests of Endor's moon in
Return of the Jedi.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.230
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation
J. J. Abrams may only have produced Rogue

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:34.340
Nation, after directing the franchise's third
instalment, but his impact is still felt.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.210
When Ethan Hunt tries hacking an underwater
terminal, it's labeled with the number 108

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.540
- which just happens to be the sum of the
famous numbers from Abrams' famous TV series,

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.970
LOST: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.210
Spectre
The famous secret society and supervillain

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.170
Blofeld finally returned to the modern Bond
movies, but were originally planned to appear

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.050
in the first Casino Royale reboot, but replaced
by "Quantum." When the producer who owned

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.840
the rights passed away years later, a settlement
was reached, and Quantum was revealed to be

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.720
a subsidiary of SPECTRE all along...

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.670
Those are some of our favorite mind blowing&nbsp;movie&nbsp;facts,
but let us know which ones we missed and stay
