00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.700
Let's write an arithmetic
sequence in general terms.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.460
So we can start
with some number a.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.280
And then we can
keep adding d to it.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.900
And that number
that we keep adding,

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.950
which could be a positive
or a negative number,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.650
we call our common difference.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.100
So the second term in our
sequence will be a plus d.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.670
The third term in our
sequence will be a plus 2d.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.560
So we keep adding d all
the way to the n-th term

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.820
in our sequence.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.200
And you already see here
that in our first term,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.210
we added d zero times.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.580
Our second term,
we added d once.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.230
In our third term,
we added d twice.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.470
So you see, whatever the
index of the term is,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.650
we're adding d one less
than that many times.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.770
So if we go all the
way to the n-th term,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.315
we're going to add d
one less than n times.

00:00:54.315 --> 00:00:58.620
So it's going to be
n minus 1 times d.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.124
Fair enough.

00:00:59.124 --> 00:01:00.040
And let me write that.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.622
This right over here
is our n-th term.

00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:05.330
Now what I want to do
is think about what

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.750
the sum of this arithmetic
sequence would be.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.360
And the sum of an
arithmetic sequence

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.590
we call an arithmetic series.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.905
So let me write that in yellow.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.390
Color changing is
sometimes difficult.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.310
So the arithmetic
series is just the sum

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.420
of an arithmetic sequence.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.770
So let's call my
arithmetic series s sub n.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.030
And let's say it's going to
be the sum of these terms,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:43.780
so it's going to be a plus
d, plus a plus 2d, plus all

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:51.150
the way to adding the n-th term,
which is a plus n minus 1 times

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:52.274
d.

00:01:52.274 --> 00:01:53.690
Now I'm going to
do the same trick

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.930
that I did when I did the most
basic arithmetic sequence.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.170
I'm going to add this
to itself, but I'm

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.620
going to swap the order
in which I write this sum.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.812
So s sub n I can
write as this, but I'm

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:06.270
going to write it
in reverse order.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.120
I'm going to write
the last term first.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.090
So the n-th term is a
plus n minus 1 times d.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.290
Then the second to
last term is going

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.000
to be a plus n minus 2 times d.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.860
The third to last is going to
be a plus n minus 3 times d.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.830
And we're going to
go all the way down

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.250
to the first term,
which is just a.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.280
Now let's add these
two equations.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.410
We are going to get, on the
left hand side, s sub n plus s

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.230
sub n.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.330
You're going to get
2 times s sub n.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.890
Well, what's the sum of
these two first terms

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.100
right over here?

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.140
I'm going to have a plus
a plus n minus 1 times d.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.170
So it's going to be 2a
plus n minus 1 times d.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.070
Now let's add both of
these second terms.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.200
So if I were to add both
of these second terms,

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.360
what do I get it?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.940
I'm going to get 2a plus 2a.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.610
And what's d plus
n minus 2 times d?

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.004
So you could view
it several ways.

00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:20.170
Let me write this over here.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.675
What is d plus n
minus 2 times d?

00:03:24.675 --> 00:03:26.050
Well, this is just
the same thing

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.559
as 1d plus n minus 2 times d.

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:30.350
And so you could just
add the coefficients.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.100
So this is going to be n
minus 2 plus 1 times d, which

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.910
is equal to n minus 1 times d.

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:51.360
So the second term also becomes
2a plus n minus 1 times d.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.030
Now let's add the third term.

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.910
I'll do it in green.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.782
The third terms, I should say.

00:03:55.782 --> 00:03:57.740
And I think you're going
to see a pattern here.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.970
It's 2a plus 2a.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.410
And if I have 2 plus n minus 3
of something and then I add 2,

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:08.410
I'm going to have n minus
one of that something.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.130
So plus n minus 1 times d.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.430
And you're going to keep
doing that all the way

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.890
until your n-th pair
of terms, all the way

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.410
until you add these two
characters over here, which

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.220
is just 2a plus n
minus 1 times d.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.310
So you have this
2a plus n minus 1 d

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.437
being added over and over again.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.020
And how many times
are you doing that?

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.110
Well, you had n
pairs of terms when

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.610
you were adding
these two equations.

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.700
In each of them,
you had n terms.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.750
This is the first term,
this is the second term,

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.230
this is the third term, all
the way to the n-th term.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.430
So I can rewrite 2
times the sum 2 times

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.770
s sub n is going to be
n times this quantity.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:03.452
It's going to be n times
2a plus n minus 1 times d.

00:05:03.452 --> 00:05:05.160
And then if we want
to solve for s sub n,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.340
you just divide both sides by 2.

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.190
And you get s sub n is equal
to, and we get ourselves

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.940
a little bit of
a drum roll here,

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:17.750
n times 2a plus n
minus 1 times d.

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.340
All of that over 2.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.520
Now, we've come up
with a general formula,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.169
just a function of
what our first term is,

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.460
what our common difference
is, and how many terms we're

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:29.310
adding up.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.980
And so this is the generalized
sum of an arithmetic sequence,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.089
which we call an
arithmetic series.

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:37.880
But now, let's ask
ourselves this question.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.460
This is hard to remember.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:44.124
The n times 2a plus n
minus 1 times d over 2.

00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:46.540
But in the last video, when I
did a more concrete example,

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:53.210
I said well, it looks like the
sum of an arithmetic sequence

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.460
could be written as
perhaps the average

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.490
of the first term a1 plus an.

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.450
The average of the first
term and the last term

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.930
times the number of
terms that you have.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.990
So is this actually the case?

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.780
Do these two things gel?

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.500
Because this is very
easy to remember--

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.379
the average of the first and
the last terms multiplied

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.420
by the number of terms
you had and actually makes

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.130
intuitive sense,
because you're just

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.280
increasing by the same
amount every time.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.580
So let's just average the
first and the last term

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.600
and then multiply times the
number of terms we have.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.290
Well, all we have to do is
rewrite this a little bit

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:38.700
to see that it is indeed
the exact same thing as this

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.860
over here.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.810
So all we have to do
is break out the a.

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.270
So let me rewrite it.

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.620
So, this could be
rewritten as s sub

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:57.460
n is equal to n times a plus
a plus n minus 1 times d.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.030
I just broke up this
2a into an a plus a.

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.030
All of that over 2.

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.690
And you see, based on how
we defined this thing,

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.180
our first term a1 is a.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:19.930
And then our last term, a sub
n, is a plus n minus 1 times d.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.380
So this whole business
right over here

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:35.040
really is the average of
the first and last terms.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.120
I got my first term,
adding it to my last term,

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.410
dividing it by 2.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.190
And then I'm multiplying by
the number of terms we have.

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.810
And that's true for any
arithmetic sequence,

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.260
as we've just shown here.
