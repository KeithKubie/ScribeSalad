00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.790
This introduces us to the need for
parcel order planning.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.159
Parcel order planning occurs
with the multiple goals.

00:00:07.159 --> 00:00:10.852
And the plan for
achieving one goal provost another goal.

00:00:10.852 --> 00:00:14.060
David, can you think of an example
of parcel order planning?

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:16.710
&gt;&gt; So actually I do have a kind of
funny example of parcel order planning.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.370
Not long ago, we bought a couch.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.110
And to keep things simple, we decided to
pay them to assemble the couch for us.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.860
Then we got the couch home and found
out that once the couch was already

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.895
assembled, it would not fit
through the apartment door.

00:00:26.895 --> 00:00:28.650
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; So we had to completely disassemble

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.140
the couch, move the pieces in one by
one, and then reassemble the couch.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.800
So the plan for

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.220
assembling the couch clobbered the goal
of getting the couch into the apartment.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.720
&gt;&gt; Good example.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.160
Next we will discuss how
partial order planning

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.037
can help us detect conflicts
like this and avoid them.
