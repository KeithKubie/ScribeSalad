1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,960
The Joe Rogan experience. Yeah, it,

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:06,420
the other thing too is that how would you,

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,170
let's just say things are going to
shit really quickly, right? Right.

4
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,900
There's a nuclear power plant that's
going to blow up any second 92nd.

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,300
How would you, are you like a, I know
you're an outdoorsy guy. You Hunt,

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,090
you kill harvest. As I say, sorry.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,230
How long do you think you could survive
if things went to shit really quickly?

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:28,680
If you have to survive, you have
all the money you want, right?

9
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:31,980
But like how long do you think you
could survive in the wilderness?

10
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,640
It would be very hard.
It's not easy and not only that,

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,780
you got to get through the winter,

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,060
so you're going to have to build
some sort of a shelter. But he goes,

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,190
there's no winter here. There is
there. I mean, um, what's the called?

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,900
It gets here in la,
but in big bear,

15
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,760
which was only a couple of
hours north of here. Yeah.

16
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,430
I mean there's plenty of places where
you could drive in a couple hours.

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,310
You could go to big bear and then
you can go down to the beach.

18
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,960
You could experience the desert.
Yeah,

19
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,610
you can experience a lot
of different climates.

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,090
It would really depend upon where you
were stuck in what, what you would eat.

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,790
So the thing is,
if you want to stay in the La area,

22
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:06,180
you're dead because you're not gonna be
able to eat shit. There's nothing here.

23
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:07,680
Would you stay in your head?
Look, would you migrate,

24
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:10,160
give your kids in a way you gotta
get Outta here. So you'd leave,

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,190
you drive a Tesla, which
carbon away? What? No Way.

26
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,910
It was a big debate that I had in
the, in a crisis situation. Right.

27
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:20,640
Would you take the test though,
or would you take, would you take,

28
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,730
I have a Toyota Land Cruiser with
the VA gallon gas tank. Yeah.

29
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,910
I got an apocalypse immobile. But so
now I went through a big debate. I got,

30
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,950
I got shit on so much for this. I sent
the same exact thing, things say, listen,

31
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,870
and an old shit situation.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,790
I would leave the Tusla behind argued
with you about that. Lot of people.

33
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,780
Uh, I leave it behind. I take
my pickup truck like Tacoma.
That's what I deal with.

34
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:47,590
Gas drive 100%. You know, in an
emergency crisis situation, uh,

35
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,610
you don't have access to the gap.
What if the gasoline didn't work?

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,920
You going to the liquor store,
you fill it up with alcohol.

37
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:57,000
We'll run where we had the hurricane
in Florida a while back now every was

38
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:57,840
saying like,
yeah,

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,160
the gas pumps wouldn't work because
the electricity was shut off and uh,

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,050
but the supercharger still working,

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,420
you could get to your destination still
and like Tesla's used less energy.

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,270
It's like at the end of the day I
happened to pick up truck with like two

43
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:12,840
shotguns and like five things,
the gasoline and be fine.
I don't understand that.

44
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:17,370
They also make tanks that you can put
in your gas tank, uh, in your, uh,

45
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,040
the bed of your truck rather.
The survival tanks,

46
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:23,560
they drive as far as you
want getting hundred miles.
Yeah. And they more and they,

47
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,460
you drop thousands of miles.
There's a guy who actually,

48
00:02:26,461 --> 00:02:28,020
there was a podcast that I listened to,

49
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,860
this guy who is like an extreme prepper
and he actually made a trip with one

50
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,390
tank of gas. Yeah. From
Arizona to Canada. Damn.

51
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,470
He drove all the way up to Canada all
the way across with one tank of gas

52
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,810
because it's massive tank in the
back of his pickup truck. Right.

53
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,320
Feeds directly into his primary gas
tank. Yeah. Yeah. And you can get these,

54
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:54,750
they're like these survival
tanks and you know,

55
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:58,430
they'll host like hundreds of gallons
or also a toggle. I probably shoot,

56
00:02:58,431 --> 00:03:01,540
I'd probably shoot at the
guy's car actually, I think
to do that. So I don't know.

57
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,000
All of a sudden you're
lawless. Yeah. Barbera.

58
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
I know the lights go off for five minutes.
Want to kill everyone?

59
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,350
You're starting fires shooting cars.
So, so then, all right, so you leave,

60
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:13,750
you take your family, right? You
have your kids. If your wife,

61
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,730
where are you going to go?
You hop in your Land Cruiser.

62
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,310
Where are you going to go?
You have a real plan. Oh,

63
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,810
what are you going to bring you?
Well,

64
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,730
you would have to bring things to start
a fire and things to kill animals. Right.

65
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:28,330
Those are the things that it would be
very important. I would bring guns, right?

66
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:31,870
I'd bring Bose.
I'd bring ammunition and arrows,

67
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,870
but I would realistically realized that,
first of all,

68
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,510
I'm not going to make more bullets
and I'm not going to make more arrows.

69
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,500
What am I gonna do and how long am I gonna
last? Giving marijuana? No. Okay. No,

70
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,290
no. I'll be just trying
to stay alive. Yeah,

71
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,080
but you'd also be trying to stay alive
for a long period of time, right?

72
00:03:47,081 --> 00:03:50,580
You might want to bring it needs
the pain. No, really? What? No,

73
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:53,860
it's not going to eat that. I mean,
marijuana for pain relief. I mean,

74
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,694
I guess it works,

75
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,800
but that's not what I used to paint
night of the impending doom. Yours. Yeah.

76
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:03,850
You'd be freaking out even more. I'm
freaking out. Plenty. Yeah, maybe. I mean,

77
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,830
I just, there's no, there's not room.

78
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:08,290
I would bring water for
water purification tablets,

79
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,170
no food shelters and food
that would bring food.

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,440
I'd probably be food in the form of
a heavy duty bars like that take.

81
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:20,580
Don't take up a lot of space,
but dense and nutrient rich like a,

82
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,660
there's those green belly bars and bars.
Yeah.

83
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:26,490
Something that has a lot of calories,
high calories in a small package.

84
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,350
A small size. All right.
Where are you heading? Yeah,
exactly. Go ahead and go. Yeah.

85
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,470
You got to go somewhere where there's
animals and even then you're not gonna

86
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,130
make it and your kids are
probably not going to make it.

87
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,350
That's the real thing is it's true.

88
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,030
The idea that you're going to live off
of animals. This isn't the Serengeti man.

89
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,341
It's not,

90
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:46,840
it's not a lot of animals unless you're
somewhere where you can find a lot of

91
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:48,570
fucking animals. Right.
Like rabbits and shit.

92
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,400
You got to keep them like you're going
to have to kill them every other day

93
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:54,490
because they're not going to last with
the heat and your kids aren't going to

94
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:59,160
get a dead rabbit for short
dead rabbit. Yeah. They'll
eat a rabbit. Yeah. I'm like,

95
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,010
my kids will eat pretty much anything. You
have to start a fire. Yes. Really? Yeah,

96
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,480
but it's not easy. We had no, it's not.

97
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,950
If you have a string and a bow and
two pieces of dried wood and you know,

98
00:05:08,951 --> 00:05:13,210
hardwood and a softer would, you can do
it. You can do it, but it ain't easy.

99
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,100
Like starting a boat with one of those
two months in.

100
00:05:18,101 --> 00:05:22,450
That takes a little while, but it's not
easy. You're better off of the Flint.

101
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,780
If you have a Flint and a piece of metal,
you could start a fire pretty easy.

102
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:29,370
And also you want to bring with
you some Tinder. You want to, um,

103
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,870
if you have some dry Tinder,
Chapin that with you too,

104
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,200
but you're in for a world of
hate. Yeah. Now world of Shit,

105
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,490
if you want to really survive,
right. Those, whenever I
watch those survival shows,

106
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,340
which I love by the way, that they're
already into that shit, they're exciting,

107
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:43,810
right? Yeah. I'm in it. That shit I do.
