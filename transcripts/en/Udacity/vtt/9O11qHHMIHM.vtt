00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.600
Now there are alternatives to implementing [UNKNOWN] prefixes match with

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.920
a try. One could start with a content addressable memory or

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:09.700
a CAM. Now a CAM is a hardware base route

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.790
look up where the input is a tag and the output

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.870
is a value. So, for example, the tag might be

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.540
an address and the value might be the output port. Now,

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.020
the CAM really only supports exact match but it is an

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.390
O1. There is something called a Ternery CAM, where isntead of

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.650
exact matching In the tag, you can have 0, 1, or don't care,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.120
or a star. The ternary CAM and in particular its support for a wild

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.700
card permits an implementation of longest prefix

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.220
match. One can thus have multiple matching

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.290
entries, but prioritize the match according to

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.720
the longest prefix in the ternary CAM.
