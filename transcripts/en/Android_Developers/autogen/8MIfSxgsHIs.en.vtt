hi I'm Chet Haase from the Android team

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
hi I'm Chet Haase from the Android team
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.009
hi I'm Chet Haase from the Android team
at Google where I work on graphics and

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019
at Google where I work on graphics and
 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.020
at Google where I work on graphics and
animations and today I wanted to talk a

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030
animations and today I wanted to talk a
 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.330
animations and today I wanted to talk a
little bit more about ListView

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
little bit more about ListView
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.519
little bit more about ListView
animations which I talked about in a

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529
animations which I talked about in a
 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.950
animations which I talked about in a
previous episode this is another episode

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960
previous episode this is another episode
 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.320
previous episode this is another episode
in the series that I like to call you're

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
in the series that I like to call you're
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.070
in the series that I like to call you're
doing it wrong so this is another item

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080
doing it wrong so this is another item
 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.740
doing it wrong so this is another item
related to the last one where there is a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750
related to the last one where there is a
 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.450
related to the last one where there is a
need to understand how views are

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
need to understand how views are
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.460
need to understand how views are
actually used by ListView ListView

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
actually used by ListView ListView
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.620
actually used by ListView ListView
recycles views which means that when

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
recycles views which means that when
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.270
recycles views which means that when
those views are not on the screen it may

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280
those views are not on the screen it may
 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.069
those views are not on the screen it may
use that view to hold different content

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079
use that view to hold different content
 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.200
use that view to hold different content
and you need to be aware of that when

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210
and you need to be aware of that when
 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.400
and you need to be aware of that when
especially when you're running

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410
especially when you're running
 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.229
especially when you're running
animations so that you're not animating

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
animations so that you're not animating
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.360
animations so that you're not animating
the wrong thing so to demonstrate that

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
the wrong thing so to demonstrate that
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.060
the wrong thing so to demonstrate that
let's take a look at a little demo so we

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070
let's take a look at a little demo so we
 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.740
let's take a look at a little demo so we
have this demo that I call ListView

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750
have this demo that I call ListView
 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.889
have this demo that I call ListView
animations and there's a long list and

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899
animations and there's a long list and
 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.020
animations and there's a long list and
quite a boring one of cheeses

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
quite a boring one of cheeses
 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.060
quite a boring one of cheeses
now as I click on these items they're

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070
now as I click on these items they're
 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.920
now as I click on these items they're
going to automatically fade out and then

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930
going to automatically fade out and then
 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.330
going to automatically fade out and then
be removed from the adapter in the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340
be removed from the adapter in the
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.220
be removed from the adapter in the
ListView is going to update itself and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230
ListView is going to update itself and
 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.789
ListView is going to update itself and
that cheese will no longer exist so we

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799
that cheese will no longer exist so we
 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.560
that cheese will no longer exist so we
can scroll someplace we can delete this

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570
can scroll someplace we can delete this
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.929
can scroll someplace we can delete this
one we can see the fade-out and then the

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939
one we can see the fade-out and then the
 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.300
one we can see the fade-out and then the
ListView collapses around it so all of

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
ListView collapses around it so all of
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.510
ListView collapses around it so all of
that is good but what happens if we

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520
that is good but what happens if we
 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.130
that is good but what happens if we
delete a couple of these and then fling

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
delete a couple of these and then fling
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.440
delete a couple of these and then fling
the list hopefully you can see this on

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450
the list hopefully you can see this on
 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.690
the list hopefully you can see this on
the screen but what you should be able

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
the screen but what you should be able
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.480
the screen but what you should be able
to see is as I'm flinging the list there

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
to see is as I'm flinging the list there
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.280
to see is as I'm flinging the list there
seemed to be items that have nothing to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
seemed to be items that have nothing to
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.780
seemed to be items that have nothing to
do with the ones that I clicked on that

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790
do with the ones that I clicked on that
 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.789
do with the ones that I clicked on that
are being removed and this is because

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799
are being removed and this is because
 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.800
are being removed and this is because
we're running a fade animation on a view

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
we're running a fade animation on a view
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.350
we're running a fade animation on a view
which has since been recycled and is

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360
which has since been recycled and is
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.270
which has since been recycled and is
being used for different content now

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
being used for different content now
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.890
being used for different content now
that doesn't mean that the wrong item is

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900
that doesn't mean that the wrong item is
 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.359
that doesn't mean that the wrong item is
being deleted but it does mean that the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369
being deleted but it does mean that the
 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.249
being deleted but it does mean that the
wrong view is being animated so what

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
wrong view is being animated so what
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.710
wrong view is being animated so what
happens is we click on an item it starts

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720
happens is we click on an item it starts
 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.090
happens is we click on an item it starts
running a fade animation on it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
running a fade animation on it
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.460
running a fade animation on it
we fling the list that view is off the

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
we fling the list that view is off the
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.780
we fling the list that view is off the
screen it gets reused for a different

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790
screen it gets reused for a different
 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.639
screen it gets reused for a different
content the view continues fading

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
content the view continues fading
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.160
content the view continues fading
because it's the same instance it's the

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
because it's the same instance it's the
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.920
because it's the same instance it's the
same object inside so it continues

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930
same object inside so it continues
 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.389
same object inside so it continues
fading even though it now shows

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399
fading even though it now shows
 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.280
fading even though it now shows
different content and then when that

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
different content and then when that
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.319
different content and then when that
animation is done then we automatically

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
animation is done then we automatically
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.510
animation is done then we automatically
delete the original item so the data is

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520
delete the original item so the data is
 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090
delete the original item so the data is
still intact that's fine but the visual

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100
still intact that's fine but the visual
 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.920
still intact that's fine but the visual
experience on the screen is just weird

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930
experience on the screen is just weird
 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.479
experience on the screen is just weird
right we don't want to do stuff like

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
right we don't want to do stuff like
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:08.930
right we don't want to do stuff like
that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940
that
 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.580
that
so there's a couple of ways that you can

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
so there's a couple of ways that you can
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.020
so there's a couple of ways that you can
account for this and I want to talk

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030
account for this and I want to talk
 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.900
account for this and I want to talk
about those today so for one thing you

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910
about those today so for one thing you
 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.110
about those today so for one thing you
could use this item called view property

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
could use this item called view property
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.540
could use this item called view property
animator and as of jellybean actually

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550
animator and as of jellybean actually
 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.220
animator and as of jellybean actually
both of these ways of compensating for

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230
both of these ways of compensating for
 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350
both of these ways of compensating for
this are in the jellybean release one is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360
this are in the jellybean release one is
 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.000
this are in the jellybean release one is
to use view property animator which

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010
to use view property animator which
 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.040
to use view property animator which
internally tells the system hey I'm not

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050
internally tells the system hey I'm not
 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.470
internally tells the system hey I'm not
done with this view yet so just let me

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480
done with this view yet so just let me
 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.660
done with this view yet so just let me
run my animation in peace so if I'm

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670
run my animation in peace so if I'm
 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.930
run my animation in peace so if I'm
using that for the animations and then I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
using that for the animations and then I
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.199
using that for the animations and then I
do the fling operation you'll see that

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209
do the fling operation you'll see that
 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.430
do the fling operation you'll see that
there is no more disruption on the

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440
there is no more disruption on the
 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.860
there is no more disruption on the
screen nothing is being faded out in the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870
screen nothing is being faded out in the
 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.750
screen nothing is being faded out in the
new views that are that we're seeing on

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760
new views that are that we're seeing on
 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.270
new views that are that we're seeing on
the screen because we are persisting the

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
the screen because we are persisting the
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.740
the screen because we are persisting the
views that have the animations running

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750
views that have the animations running
 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.140
views that have the animations running
on them so basically we're grabbing it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
on them so basically we're grabbing it
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:52.250
on them so basically we're grabbing it
and saying you know what I have a lock

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260
and saying you know what I have a lock
 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.660
and saying you know what I have a lock
on this view don't recycle it yet

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670
on this view don't recycle it yet
 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.009
on this view don't recycle it yet
because I am in the middle of using it

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019
because I am in the middle of using it
 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.660
because I am in the middle of using it
if you don't want to use your property

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670
if you don't want to use your property
 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.250
if you don't want to use your property
animator another way to get the same

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
animator another way to get the same
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.780
animator another way to get the same
capability again in the jellybean

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
capability again in the jellybean
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.699
capability again in the jellybean
release is to use this new property

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709
release is to use this new property
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.440
release is to use this new property
called transient state so you can call

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450
called transient state so you can call
 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.540
called transient state so you can call
this method saying set has transient

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550
this method saying set has transient
 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.490
this method saying set has transient
state and that tells us you're in the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500
state and that tells us you're in the
 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.320
state and that tells us you're in the
middle of using it and we won't recycle

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330
middle of using it and we won't recycle
 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.080
middle of using it and we won't recycle
it until you tell us to so again we

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090
it until you tell us to so again we
 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.729
it until you tell us to so again we
delete some things we fling the list and

we have no disruptive experience on the
 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.660
we have no disruptive experience on the

out so interesting demo more interesting

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340
out so interesting demo more interesting
 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.130
out so interesting demo more interesting
code let's take a look at that so we

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140
code let's take a look at that so we
 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.330
code let's take a look at that so we
have this class called ListView

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
have this class called ListView
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.699
have this class called ListView
animations we create the you know the

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709
animations we create the you know the
 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.110
animations we create the you know the
check boxes in the ListView and the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120
check boxes in the ListView and the
 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.150
check boxes in the ListView and the
adapter all that stuff the interesting

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160
adapter all that stuff the interesting
 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.560
adapter all that stuff the interesting
part is down here what happens when we

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570
part is down here what happens when we
 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.840
part is down here what happens when we
click on an item so when we click on it

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850
click on an item so when we click on it
 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:36.800
click on an item so when we click on it
we're immediately going to run this

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810
we're immediately going to run this
 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.690
we're immediately going to run this
animation but how we run it depends on

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700
animation but how we run it depends on
 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.180
animation but how we run it depends on
which of those check boxes we check at

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190
which of those check boxes we check at
 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.710
which of those check boxes we check at

animator and we're going to animate in a

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780
animator and we're going to animate in a
 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.630
animator and we're going to animate in a
previous episode we saw some basics on

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640
previous episode we saw some basics on
 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.160
previous episode we saw some basics on
how to use object animator we use a

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170
how to use object animator we use a
 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.440
how to use object animator we use a
target object we use a target property

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450
target object we use a target property
 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.280
target object we use a target property
we're going to animate the Alpha

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290
we're going to animate the Alpha
 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.289
we're going to animate the Alpha
property on that view and we're going to

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299
property on that view and we're going to
 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.360
property on that view and we're going to
animate 0 from whatever value it has

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370
animate 0 from whatever value it has
 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.220
animate 0 from whatever value it has
right now which happens to be one fully

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230
right now which happens to be one fully
 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.949
right now which happens to be one fully
opaque usually is so we create the

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959
opaque usually is so we create the
 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.360
opaque usually is so we create the
animation we set a duration of a

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370
animation we set a duration of a
 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.789
animation we set a duration of a
thousand way too long for this operation

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799
thousand way too long for this operation
 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.199
thousand way too long for this operation
but for the purposes of this demo I

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209
but for the purposes of this demo I
 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.759
but for the purposes of this demo I
wanted you to actually be able to see

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769
wanted you to actually be able to see
 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.949
wanted you to actually be able to see

checked so we're going to skip this code

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240
checked so we're going to skip this code
 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.580
checked so we're going to skip this code
here which is the interesting

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590
here which is the interesting
 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.860
here which is the interesting
part which we'll get to later we're

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870
part which we'll get to later we're
 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.360
part which we'll get to later we're
going to add a listener so that we can

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370
going to add a listener so that we can
 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.670
going to add a listener so that we can
actually restore these things later and

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680
actually restore these things later and
 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.580
actually restore these things later and
then remove it from the data set so on

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590
then remove it from the data set so on
 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.469
then remove it from the data set so on
animation ends so when this nice little

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479
animation ends so when this nice little
 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.200
animation ends so when this nice little
fade animation out to zero ends we're

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210
fade animation out to zero ends we're
 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.760
fade animation out to zero ends we're
going to go in here and actually remove

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770
going to go in here and actually remove
 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.650
going to go in here and actually remove
it from the list of cheeses notify the

data set change restore the Alpha

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:44.669
data set change restore the Alpha
 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.159
data set change restore the Alpha
property which is always important to do

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169
property which is always important to do
 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.890
property which is always important to do
with fading animations and then we're

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900
with fading animations and then we're
 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.420
with fading animations and then we're
done and then we start the animation so

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430
done and then we start the animation so
 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.520
done and then we start the animation so
life is good unless that view got

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530
life is good unless that view got
 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.290
life is good unless that view got
scrolled off the screen after the

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300
scrolled off the screen after the
 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.930
scrolled off the screen after the
animation started in which case the view

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940
animation started in which case the view
 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.550
animation started in which case the view
has been reassigned to different content

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560
has been reassigned to different content
 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.830
has been reassigned to different content
we get that disruptive experience that

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840
we get that disruptive experience that
 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.670
we get that disruptive experience that
we saw earlier

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680
we saw earlier
 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:04.580
we saw earlier
so the two workarounds for it are to use

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590
so the two workarounds for it are to use
 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.500
so the two workarounds for it are to use
a view property animator so if you check

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510
a view property animator so if you check
 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.450
a view property animator so if you check
that box at the top of this demo then

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460
that box at the top of this demo then
 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.159
that box at the top of this demo then
instead of using object animator to

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169
instead of using object animator to
 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:11.840
instead of using object animator to
animate that view we're going to use

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850
animate that view we're going to use
 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.490
animate that view we're going to use
view property animator and we do that by

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500
view property animator and we do that by
 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.850
view property animator and we do that by
calling code much like this we say view

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860
calling code much like this we say view
 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.070
calling code much like this we say view
dot animate that returns the instance of

dot animate that returns the instance of
 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.540
dot animate that returns the instance of
the view property animator for that

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550
the view property animator for that
 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.450
the view property animator for that
specific view set duration again we want

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460
specific view set duration again we want
 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.029
specific view set duration again we want
an unusually long duration for this

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039
an unusually long duration for this
 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:27.439
an unusually long duration for this
animation just for the purpose of this

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449
animation just for the purpose of this
 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:29.750
animation just for the purpose of this
demo and then we're going to animate

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:29.760
demo and then we're going to animate
 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.570
demo and then we're going to animate
alpha to a value of 0 from its current

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580
alpha to a value of 0 from its current
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.790
alpha to a value of 0 from its current
value which happens to be 1 and when

value which happens to be 1 and when
 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.800
value which happens to be 1 and when
this animation finishes it's going to

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810
this animation finishes it's going to
 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.719
this animation finishes it's going to
have an end action which does something

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729
have an end action which does something
 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.370
have an end action which does something
remarkably similar to what we saw before

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380
remarkably similar to what we saw before

cheese list notify data set changed and
 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.580
cheese list notify data set changed and
restore the Alpha property and we're

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590
restore the Alpha property and we're
 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.710
restore the Alpha property and we're
done no special magic to work around

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720
done no special magic to work around
 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.050
done no special magic to work around
this instead internally we're doing the

right thing to tell the ListView don't

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250
right thing to tell the ListView don't
 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.250
right thing to tell the ListView don't
recycle this view yet because I am in

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.260
recycle this view yet because I am in
 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:56.390
recycle this view yet because I am in
the middle of using it and then when

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400
the middle of using it and then when
 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.150
the middle of using it and then when
that animation is done it unset set flag

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160
that animation is done it unset set flag
 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.339
that animation is done it unset set flag
and that view can be recycled

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349
and that view can be recycled
 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.860
and that view can be recycled
appropriately the alternate way to do it

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870
appropriately the alternate way to do it
 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.270

if you're not using view property

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280
if you're not using view property
 

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.550
if you're not using view property
animator you can have access to this

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560
animator you can have access to this
 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.610
animator you can have access to this
exact same functionality by calling set

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620
exact same functionality by calling set
 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.260
exact same functionality by calling set
has transient States so if you check

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270
has transient States so if you check
 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.879
has transient States so if you check
that other box at the top of the demo

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:13.889
that other box at the top of the demo
 

00:06:13.889 --> 00:06:16.550
that other box at the top of the demo
that said transient State

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560
that said transient State
 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.400
that said transient State
then we will say set trend set has

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410
then we will say set trend set has
 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.779
then we will say set trend set has
transient States so when you click on

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:20.789
transient States so when you click on
 

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:22.490
