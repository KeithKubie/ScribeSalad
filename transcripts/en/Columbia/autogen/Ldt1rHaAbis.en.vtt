00:10:41.749 --> 00:10:44.439
know where you're going to go don't know
what you're going to do you came to us

00:10:44.439 --> 00:10:44.449
what you're going to do you came to us
 

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:46.239
what you're going to do you came to us
from 50 different countries there are

00:10:46.239 --> 00:10:46.249
from 50 different countries there are
 

00:10:46.249 --> 00:10:50.559
from 50 different countries there are
alumni living alumni in 85 different

alumni living alumni in 85 different
 

00:10:50.569 --> 00:10:53.759
alumni living alumni in 85 different
countries so somewhere out there you're

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:53.769
countries so somewhere out there you're
 

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:57.129
countries so somewhere out there you're
going to change the landscape I think

00:10:57.129 --> 00:10:57.139
going to change the landscape I think
 

00:10:57.139 --> 00:10:59.710
going to change the landscape I think
what's interesting is that is is the

00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720
what's interesting is that is is the
 

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.090
what's interesting is that is is the
school is very different from when you

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:01.100
school is very different from when you
 

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:02.799
school is very different from when you
started even those of you who started

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:02.809
started even those of you who started
 

00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:04.150
started even those of you who started
just a couple of years ago it really

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160
just a couple of years ago it really
 

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.850
just a couple of years ago it really
changes a lot from Yeti oh we're very

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:06.860
changes a lot from Yeti oh we're very
 

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.350
changes a lot from Yeti oh we're very
affected by by you which means that it's

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360
affected by by you which means that it's
 

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:13.780
affected by by you which means that it's
quite possible that you leave the school

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:13.790
quite possible that you leave the school
 

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.889
quite possible that you leave the school
and you end up moving less than we do

00:11:16.889 --> 00:11:16.899
and you end up moving less than we do
 

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:19.179
and you end up moving less than we do
because if you come back here the place

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:19.189
because if you come back here the place
 

00:11:19.189 --> 00:11:21.429
because if you come back here the place
will have changed and this was always

00:11:21.429 --> 00:11:21.439
will have changed and this was always
 

00:11:21.439 --> 00:11:22.749
will have changed and this was always
the principal and maybe that's the

00:11:22.749 --> 00:11:22.759
the principal and maybe that's the
 

00:11:22.759 --> 00:11:24.400
the principal and maybe that's the
reason you came to us in the first place

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:24.410
reason you came to us in the first place
 

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.229
reason you came to us in the first place
that this is a school that travels not

00:11:26.229 --> 00:11:26.239
that this is a school that travels not
 

00:11:26.239 --> 00:11:27.970
that this is a school that travels not
just you go on York any trips and so on

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:27.980
just you go on York any trips and so on
 

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:30.749
just you go on York any trips and so on
but the school itself is on the move

00:11:30.749 --> 00:11:30.759
but the school itself is on the move
 

00:11:30.759 --> 00:11:33.249
but the school itself is on the move
it's very very exciting for those of us

00:11:33.249 --> 00:11:33.259
it's very very exciting for those of us
 

00:11:33.259 --> 00:11:34.749
it's very very exciting for those of us
who teach here because we really don't

00:11:34.749 --> 00:11:34.759
who teach here because we really don't
 

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:37.869
who teach here because we really don't
know where the school is going nobody's

00:11:37.869 --> 00:11:37.879

around there's a kind of ecology of

00:11:44.139 --> 00:11:44.149
around there's a kind of ecology of
 

00:11:44.149 --> 00:11:45.819
around there's a kind of ecology of
thinking which is pulling the school

00:11:45.819 --> 00:11:45.829
thinking which is pulling the school
 

00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:47.590
thinking which is pulling the school
endlessly in different directions and

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600
endlessly in different directions and
 

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.659
endlessly in different directions and
the school goes where the best ideas

00:11:49.659 --> 00:11:49.669
the school goes where the best ideas
 

00:11:49.669 --> 00:11:53.049
the school goes where the best ideas
take us and the best ideas are exactly

00:11:53.049 --> 00:11:53.059
take us and the best ideas are exactly
 

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:54.429
take us and the best ideas are exactly
that it's something that takes you

00:11:54.429 --> 00:11:54.439
that it's something that takes you
 

00:11:54.439 --> 00:11:56.650
that it's something that takes you
somewhere it pulls you somewhere you can

somewhere it pulls you somewhere you can

never be sure what a good idea is doing
 

00:11:58.489 --> 00:12:01.479
never be sure what a good idea is doing
to you it's actually only later that you

00:12:01.479 --> 00:12:01.489
to you it's actually only later that you
 

00:12:01.489 --> 00:12:02.949
to you it's actually only later that you
call it a good idea at the beginning

something happens and you start

something happens and you start
moving so the way I think of this is not

moving so the way I think of this is not

surely it's in this moment that we need
 

00:15:18.809 --> 00:15:21.139
surely it's in this moment that we need
our buildings to speak to us with the
