PAUL LEE: My name is Paul Lee.

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.952
And I'm a product
manager here at Google.

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:06.660
For the past several
years, my wife and I

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.400
have had the pleasure
of volunteering

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.150
with the International
Justice Mission.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.790
And today, I am
privileged to introduce

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.230
its founder and CEO Gary Haugen.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.010
So who is Gary Haugen?

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.520
I didn't fact check this.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.490
So we'll go with this.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.430
This is what the
internet says Gary is.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.940
Gary is the youngest
of six kids and hails

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.441
from nearby Sacramento.

00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.940
During elementary
school, he decided

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.398
he want to be a lawyer, inspired
by the examples of Lincoln

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:33.770
and MLK.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.010
He played football
in high school,

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.790
with the scene crew
cut he generously

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.480
shares with us today.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.180
And in 1981, he departed
for the lesser school

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.100
in the East Coast, Harvard.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.090
After graduating in 1985,
Gary traveled to South Africa

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.690
during the apartheid
era, and worked

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.720
with Michael Cassidy
and Desmond Tutu

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.260
at the National Initiative
for Reconciliation.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.200
For those of you who
were born in the '80s,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.330
this was during
the apartheid era.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.870
And as an example of what
it was like in that period,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.040
in one instance Gary was
detained by security forces

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.900
for attending a
multiracial church

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.760
service without permission.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.520
This was a world at that time.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.126
In 1988, Gary started law school
at the University of Chicago.

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:16.500
And during that time, he worked
for the Lawyers Committee

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.330
on Human Rights.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.840
He investigated crimes like
Lupeau Massacre of 1987,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.020
which involved the
execution of 17 civilians

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.570
by soldiers in
the Filipino army.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.890
After law school, Gary joined
the Department of Justice

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.402
as a trial attorney in
the Civil Rights Division.

00:01:30.402 --> 00:01:32.110
Gary met his wife,
Jan, during this time.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.750
They now have four kids.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.790
And in 1994, Gary was
detailed to the UN Center

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.100
for Human Rights, where he
directed the UN's investigation

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.070
of the genocide in Rwanda.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.540
I actually have on my
computer, but didn't

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.665
send it to Ruthie in time,
a photo, my favorite photo

00:01:47.665 --> 00:01:49.400
that I've seen in
the IJM office.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.620
It's a picture of a
giant military camouflage

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.170
helicopter in the
background, Gary

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.610
dressed pretty much
like he is right now,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.630
and scores of kids
running towards him.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.300
And I asked the
staff there, what

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.990
is that photo,
because it's just kick

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.220
butt to see this giant
military transport and all

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.479
these kids and Gary.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.990
It turns out that it was
from 2006, his first trip

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.920
back to Rwanda where he
visited a remote area that

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.880
was part of his investigation.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.460
That time was pivotal,
and if we go back to 1994,

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.770
Gary, when he worked
for the investigation,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.030
collected with his team,
testimony of physical evidence

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.060
from 100 mass
graves and massacre

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.050
sites across the country.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.785
Allow me to share because I
can't do this justice, the "New

00:02:36.785 --> 00:02:38.910
Yorker" subscription as
experienced from an article

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.520
they wrote about this in 2009.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.320
"Gary was sickened to come
across charred piles of bodies

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.547
in a church where Tutsi had
expected to find sanctuary.

00:02:47.547 --> 00:02:49.130
He took down the
testimony of a father

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.620
who saw his three small children
hacked to death with machetes.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.950
At one massacre site,
Haugen rolled back

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.240
the decaying body of
a woman, and found

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.300
the corpse of her
child beneath her."

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.950
End quote.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.050
Over the next 17 years--
sorry, let me back up.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.300
Moved by this experience,
Gary returned to the US

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.050
and went into start-up
planning mode.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.570
He would build a
new organization

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.780
that would not simply
plead for victims,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.840
but would actually rescue them.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.710
This organization would
focus on four key areas.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.620
Victim relief, perpetrator
accountability, aftercare

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.610
and structural reform.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.930
In 1997, one year prior
to Google's own start,

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.700
Gary found IJM with
one employee, desks

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.390
for two interns
in an office park.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.600
Over the next 17 years, IJM
would establish operations

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.500
in 10 countries
and earn the right

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.640
to investigate and
prosecute crimes,

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.120
working with local
law enforcement

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.910
and public prosecutors.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.730
You won't see these
videos, but I've seen them.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.200
And what you'll see if you were
actually at IJM headquarters

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.960
is pictures of staff
putting their lives

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.060
on the line in the back of
SWAT vans, raiding brothels,

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.020
chasing out the aggressors
and rescuing the victims.

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.540
It's a pretty
powerful experience.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.390
The organization now
includes 600 staff,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:06.890
including an
investigations team led

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.390
by Mark Clookie, the former
director of NCIS-- yes, he

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.780
did do two cameos on a TV show--
a policy team led by Holly

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.950
Burkhalter, former advocacy
director for Human Rights

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.050
Watch, as well as 200 lawyers.

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.610
Today IJM is a $50 million
human rights agency

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.760
that, in the words of the
"Atlantic"'s Stephen Bradley,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.620
investigates and prosecutes the
worst crimes, the worst evils,

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.380
around the globe.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.650
Human trafficking, sexual
exploitation, slavery,

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.170
police brutality, violence
in all manifestation

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.194
but principally violence
against the world's poor.

00:04:45.194 --> 00:04:47.110
Over the last years,
I've served on the board.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.130
I've worked in my career
with over 40 non-profits.

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.880
And some of these
non-profits are amazing.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.332
I think they do incredible work.

00:04:53.332 --> 00:04:55.540
This is the first time I
worked with a nonprofit that

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.180
has as its dashboard monitoring
loss of life and limb

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:03.230
to staff, tracking assassination
attempts on their staff workers

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:04.150
in the field.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.680
The work they do is
really incredible.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.870
In 2013 alone, IJM
rescued over 2,000 victims

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.260
and secured over
100 convictions.

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.870
That's in one year.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.870
Over the past 18 years, IJM has
rescued over 18,000 victims,

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.390
trained 13,000
officers and officials

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:24.730
and secured over 700
convictions, much of them

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.850
in the past five years alone.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.350
However, more
significant than these

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.425
numbers is growing evidence
that IJM's model is beginning

00:05:31.425 --> 00:05:34.820
to result in structural
transformation and hopefully

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.830
permanent change.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.474
A Gates Foundation-funded
study, for instance,

00:05:38.474 --> 00:05:40.890
found that the number of minors
available for exploitation

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.990
in metro Ceba in the Philippines
plummeted 79% over four years.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.530
As a result of the
investigation's work in 2012,

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.880
Gary received the Trafficking
In Persons Report Hero Reward.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.200
IJM was also one of
11 organizations that

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.600
received a combined $11 million
grant from Google.org in 2011.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.050
A significant
portion of that grant

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.020
was allocated to
syndicate IJM's model

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.960
to other nonprofits in India.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.820
And in the first nine
months of 2013 alone,

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.660
that initiative and your
money, Google's money,

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:16.520
resulted in 830 victim rescues.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.640
Earlier this month,
Oxford University Press

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:21.070
released Gary's latest
book "The Locust Effect:

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:23.660
Why the End of Poverty
Requires the End of Violence,"

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.826
written with Victor Boutros,
who's here in the front

00:06:25.826 --> 00:06:27.480
as well, federal prosecutor.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:29.620
Let me just say, amongst
the many endorsements

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:31.730
that came from Bill Clinton,
Anne Marie Slaughter,

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.640
Madeleine Albright,
I think my favorite

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.970
is from Madeleine Albright
that says "the book is

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.000
a much-needed argument
for reducing violence

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.854
against the poor,
and a demonstration

00:06:39.854 --> 00:06:41.270
through firsthand
stories that are

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.580
both shocking and true of
why that goal is so vital.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.700
The book is both a vehicle for
sharing voices rarely heard

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.550
and a declaration of faith
that with sufficient will,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.530
there are ways to halt
the physical and financial

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.020
exploitation of
the disadvantaged.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.680
By reminding us that basic
legal protections are not

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.760
a privilege but a
universal right,

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.420
Gary Haugen has
issued a moral call

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.869
to arms that informs the
brain and touches the heart."

00:07:06.869 --> 00:07:09.160
That's my hope for us today,
that we'll keep our brains

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.810
and our hearts open as we
welcome Gary to Google.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.316
Please join me.

00:07:14.316 --> 00:07:20.052
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.740
GARY HAUGEN: Thanks,
Paul, very much

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.300
for the extravagant
introduction.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.220
I appreciate that you got
all the material from my mom,

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:31.730
and you did a great,
great job with it.

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:33.340
Thanks very much.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.570
And Kevin, thanks for dragging
all your friends here.

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:40.500
He told me this is the
smartest people at Google.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.921
So congratulations for that.

00:07:41.921 --> 00:07:43.920
Or the people who couldn't
afford to buy a book,

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.710
so the first 10 who
showed up got a book.

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.320
So way to go.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:51.540
I'm glad you mentioned the hair.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.760
I did a Google
Hangout in New York,

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:56.370
with your colleagues
in New York.

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.570
And Justin introduced me.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.879
That pretty much was
the entire introduction

00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.170
was just making fun of my hair.

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.835
So this was really
cool in the '50s.

00:08:04.835 --> 00:08:06.270
It really, really was.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.740
Anyways, it's marvelous
to get to be with you.

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:13.080
Thank you for the
Google grant, that

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.310
allowed us to replicate
the work in India.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.730
Thousands of people
now have been

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.400
rescued as a result of that.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.400
I've been in places
of literal slavery

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.520
and are now free because
of the willingness

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.450
to engage in this work and to
train others in how to do it.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:29.490
But I'd like to start this
afternoon with a story much,

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:32.440
much closer to home-- actually
just a few hours from here

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:37.330
across the California border in
Oregon, in a rural county where

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:39.500
there was a woman,
not too long ago,

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.750
who was home alone at night.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.480
It's dark out.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.480
And she starts to
hear an intruder begin

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.530
to break open her side door.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:53.310
And she looks over,
and sees this man

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.870
breaking his way into her house.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:57.470
It's terrifying,
especially for her,

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.780
because two weeks before,
this same man in her community

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.570
had put her in the hospital
through an assault.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.620
And now he is clawing
his way into her house.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.850
So she does what any
sort of terrified person

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.560
would do in their
house in America.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.100
She picks up the phone,
and she calls 911.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:20.130
And what proceeds is a pretty
horrific 10 minute conversation

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.080
with this 911 operator
who proceeds to explain

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.340
that due to budget cuts
in her rural county,

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.730
law enforcement is only
operating on the weekdays.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.750
And this is a weekend.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.420
And so she's simply
explaining to her

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:39.210
that you don't have law
enforcement in your area.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:40.998
Listen to this
for just a moment.

00:09:40.998 --> 00:09:41.664
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:45.410
-I don't have anybody
to send out there.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:49.094
Uh, you know, obviously if
he comes inside the residence

00:09:49.094 --> 00:09:51.930
and assaults you, can
you ask him to go away?

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:54.034
Or do you know if he's
intoxicated or anything?

00:09:54.034 --> 00:09:55.034
-I've already asked him.

00:09:55.034 --> 00:09:56.707
I've already told him
I was calling you.

00:09:56.707 --> 00:09:59.814
He's broken in before, busted
down my door, assaulted me.

00:09:59.814 --> 00:10:00.770
-Uh huh.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:04.372
Is there any way you can
safely leave the residence?

00:10:04.372 --> 00:10:06.010
-No, I can't.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.264
Because he's blocking
pretty much my only way out.

00:10:08.264 --> 00:10:10.555
-Well, the only thing I can
do is give you some advice.

00:10:10.555 --> 00:10:13.455
And call the sheriff's
office tomorrow,

00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:19.030
Obviously, if he comes in and
unfortunately, has a weapon

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.435
or is trying to cause
you physical harm,

00:10:21.435 --> 00:10:22.552
that's a different story.

00:10:22.552 --> 00:10:24.343
The sheriff's office
doesn't work up there.

00:10:24.343 --> 00:10:26.315
I don't have anybody to send.

00:10:26.315 --> 00:10:28.780
[END AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.360
GARY HAUGEN: The Sheriff's
office doesn't work up there.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:34.690
I don't have anybody to send.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:39.140
Of course, what happens is
that man tears into that place,

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:43.610
assaults her, chokes
her, brutally rapes her.

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:46.840
This is what happens
if there's no law

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:52.300
enforcement in your area, if
there's no one to send for you.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.090
And yet, this book
that we've written,

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.180
"The Locust Effect,"
what this is about

00:10:56.180 --> 00:10:58.880
is the story that there are
about four billion people

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.900
in our world who have no
access to law enforcement.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.710
Especially for those
who are poorest,

00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:08.790
a study was done by the UN that
says quote-- listen to this--

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:14.385
"most poor people live outside
the protection of law."

00:11:14.385 --> 00:11:16.010
Now that's a phrase
that we can sort of

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.066
read and just let wash over us.

00:11:18.066 --> 00:11:20.440
But I think there's perhaps
nothing quite like this phone

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.590
call that allows us
for just a moment

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:25.730
to step into the shoes
of the common poor person

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:28.340
in the developing world
who has no access to law

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.919
enforcement and the terror that
that represents in their lives.

00:11:32.919 --> 00:11:33.960
So that's the big number.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.520
Four billion people
do not have access

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:38.595
to law enforcement
that will actually

00:11:38.595 --> 00:11:39.720
protect them from violence.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.940
But what does that actually look
like in the developing world?

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:44.910
Well, it looks like
this in Bolivia,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:47.340
where if you were
to sexually assault

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.760
a child in Bolivia,
statistically,

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.780
you would actually be at greater
risk of slipping in the shower

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.540
and dying than you
would have ever

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.770
being sent to jail
for that crime.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:00.030
Imagine a state of
such impunity-- yes,

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.260
it's completely against the law.

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.170
But the problem for the poor is
not that they don't get laws,

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.980
it's they don't get
law enforcement.

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:12.220
This means, in India and
other places in South Asia,

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:17.730
if you enslave someone,
literally enslave someone,

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.230
you're at greater risk of being
struck by lightning than you

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:25.880
are of ever being sent to
jail for the crime of slavery.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:30.400
This is a profound
and massive phenomenon

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.270
across the developing world
that receives very, very

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.520
little mention at all,
which is the utter breakdown

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.950
of basic criminal justice
systems in the developing

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:39.450
world.

00:12:39.450 --> 00:12:43.500
And what it has done, then,
is unleash this epidemic

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:45.670
of violence against the poor.

00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:47.420
And in "The Locust
Effect," this is really

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.169
what we're trying to
bring to the surface.

00:12:49.169 --> 00:12:51.800
Because if I say the
word global poverty

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.020
and if you try to bring
sort of images to mind,

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:55.030
what comes to mind?

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:56.620
I mean immediately
you start to think,

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:58.410
don't you, about dirty shacks.

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:00.290
You think about the dirty water.

00:13:00.290 --> 00:13:01.370
You think of sickness.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:04.760
You think of kids who
can't go to school.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.260
You think of lack of capital,
the need for microfinance,

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:09.870
all those sorts of needs.

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:12.500
One of the things that does not
commonly come to the surface

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.140
for us is the way
that to be poor

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.970
is to be chronically
vulnerable to violence.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.560
But the problem is
all that violence

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.700
stays below the surface.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.800
Many of us have traveled
to the developing world.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.630
And we've seen the dirty shacks,
the dirty water, the hunger,

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:29.400
the people who are sick.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.180
But very few of us will ever
just visually see the violence.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.610
And so it takes something
for us to be traveling

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:38.110
into that subterranean
world to see

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.360
what that violence looks like.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.330
And this is what we try
to do in the opening

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.060
chapters of "The Locust
Effect" is take you

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:46.140
with a common poor person
in the developing world

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.570
to see what this
violence is like.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.820
And we begin with
the first category

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:53.781
of most pervasive violence
among the poor in the developing

00:13:53.781 --> 00:13:54.280
world.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.960
And that's basically
gender violence.

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:59.720
That's sexual violence
and domestic abuse

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.020
of women and girls.

00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.520
It is, in the collapse
of law enforcement,

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:05.990
open season on women and girls.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.160
In fact, gender
violence accounts

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.130
for more death and disability
for women and girls

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.630
between the age of 15 and
44 than malaria, cancer, car

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:19.570
accidents and war combined.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:23.784
This is why we're calling this
epidemic "every day violence,"

00:14:23.784 --> 00:14:25.950
because, again, if we are
familiar with the violence

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.366
against the poor,
most of the time

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:30.670
we're thinking about the sort of
catastrophic spasms of violence

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:32.250
that are in the headlines.

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:34.920
Like the wars, the
conflicts, and for sure,

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.190
those do decimate
people's lives.

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.700
And I know something about
that myself, of course,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.650
having been the director of
the genocide investigation

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:45.130
in Rwanda where,
as Paul mentioned,

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.910
I just was given this list by
UN military intelligence of 100

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.490
different mass graves
and massacre sites.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.260
And we just tediously sorted
through these thousands

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:56.690
and thousands of
people who'd been

00:14:56.690 --> 00:14:59.860
butchered by their neighbors.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.700
And when you're doing
that work, especially

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.824
as an investigator, what
you're really trying to do

00:15:03.824 --> 00:15:06.330
is recreate visually
how did this happen

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.320
from the forensic
evidence that's there.

00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.900
And what is it like for
that family pressed up

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:14.120
against the wall of that
stadium or that school

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.010
or that cathedral, as they
see those machetes coming

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.800
towards them?

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.530
And the thing that
was so manifest to me

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.980
is that, yes, all these
Rwandans were overwhelmingly

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.030
very, very poor.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:29.520
The average Rwandan is
living off about $0.65 a day.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:32.856
But in that moment of
terror, when the machetes

00:15:32.856 --> 00:15:34.480
are coming towards
you and your family,

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:37.200
you're actually not
crying out for some food.

00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:38.917
You're not crying
out for a doctor.

00:15:38.917 --> 00:15:40.500
You're not crying
out for a microloan.

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.120
You're not crying out for
a teacher in education.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.960
You're crying out for
someone to restrain

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.230
the hand of that machete.

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:52.030
And this is the thing that
makes violence different.

00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.710
It is a profound
affliction of the poor,

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:58.410
but it's different than the
other problems that we engage.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:01.070
And this first category
of massive abuse

00:16:01.070 --> 00:16:02.280
is gender violence.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.190
But like so many things,
it stays below the surface.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.280
At the beginning
of the book, I just

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:09.770
invite readers to come with
me to meet Lucilla who's

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.490
this woman that I met in a small
town in the Andean mountains

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.492
in Peru.

00:16:14.492 --> 00:16:16.700
Very common woman, lives in
a town that you would not

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.340
necessarily notice or
pay any attention to,

00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:24.370
except for the fact it has
a rate of sexual assault

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:27.080
that is worse than the sexual
assault rates that were coming

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.520
out of the worst war
zones of the Congo.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.760
And if you follow through
the story of Lucilla

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.600
as she has to endure
the rape and murder

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.010
of her eight-year-old
daughter, who's just dumped out

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:40.310
on the street one night.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:42.940
And to follow Lucilla in
what it is like for her

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.920
to try to get justice in a
totally broken criminal justice

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.260
system.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:52.830
Gender violence is
this massive epidemic

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.570
against women and girls who
are poorest and most vulnerable

00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:56.340
in the world.

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.760
The second massive category
of violence against the poor

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.640
is a kind of violence
that actually

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.150
keeps people in poverty by
force, and that's slavery.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:08.890
You may already know that there
are about 30 million people

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:12.010
held in slavery in
the world today.

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.950
These are not people held
in slave-like conditions

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.050
or metaphorical slavery--
in actual slavery.

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:20.970
At IJM, we've met
thousands of them.

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:22.589
And thanks to
Google's work with us

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:25.050
have also been able to
bring rescue to thousands.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:27.630
But there remain
actually more people

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:32.780
in slavery today than in any
other time in human history.

00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:34.540
Mind boggling, right?

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.120
It's true that a smaller
proportion of human beings

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.890
are in slavery.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:38.920
That's true.

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.740
A smaller proportion
of the economy

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.020
is produced by slave labor.

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:42.520
That's true.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.930
But there's just so
many more human beings

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.070
that the absolute number
of people in slavery

00:17:47.070 --> 00:17:50.380
is greater now than any
other time in history.

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.720
One of the ways we try to
bring readers into this again

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.390
subterranean reality
is to take people

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:59.180
to Bangalore, which is sort of
the shining high-tech capital

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.860
in India, really sort of the
icon of the booming economies

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.160
of India.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:08.050
But an Indian lawyer takes me
on a drive just a few minutes

00:18:08.050 --> 00:18:10.390
outside the beltway
of Bangalore and shows

00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:12.130
me a brick factory
where scores of people

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.160
are held literally as slaves
working seven days a week,

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.700
12 to 14 hours a day,
making and carrying bricks.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.450
And anybody's who's
ever tried to run away

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.190
from the facility
is chased down,

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.170
dragged back and beaten
in front of the others.

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.157
In fact, when this one
couple was able to escape,

00:18:28.157 --> 00:18:30.740
the owner of the brick factory
was able to go to their village

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.910
and actually kidnap and
hold some family members

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.780
and neighbors as
hostages, and just

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:39.390
publicly proclaim until you
bring me back my slaves,

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:44.470
I'm going to continue to detain
and torture their neighbors.

00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:47.437
In other words, he was
very happy to let everyone

00:18:47.437 --> 00:18:49.520
know that he was exercising
this kind of violence,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.600
because he had zero
fear that he would ever

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.350
be brought to account
under the law.

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:58.300
So I got a chance to sit
with Mariamam for instance,

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.010
as she explained what
it was like to live

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:04.300
as a slave with her
family and about two dozen

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:07.200
other over of her
neighbors as literal slaves

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:10.410
in the 21st century.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.440
So the book takes us again
to that subterranean world

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:16.930
that we would otherwise
have no idea about.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:18.800
The third sort of
catastrophic form

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.290
of violence against the
poor, surprisingly perhaps,

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.040
is police abuse.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.740
It turns out that
the World Bank did

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.710
this study called
"Voices of the Poor"

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.340
which gave to the tens of
thousands of poor people

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:34.400
just the chance to say what is
it about your poverty that's

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.280
most painful to you.

00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:38.140
And the study was
very rigorous, and one

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:44.100
of things it was
saying that police

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.170
and courts in the
developing world

00:19:46.170 --> 00:19:50.910
actually make poor people
poorer and less secure.

00:19:50.910 --> 00:19:51.845
What?

00:19:51.845 --> 00:19:53.220
I mean that's like
a finding that

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.130
says the hospitals in
the developing world

00:19:55.130 --> 00:19:56.940
are making everybody sicker.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.820
Or the schools are
actually the places

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.760
where everyone's
prohibited from reading.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.290
This is what public
justice systems

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:05.180
have become in the
developing world--

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.490
places actually of harm.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:08.960
If you're poor, you run away
from the police to be safe.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.130
You don't run to the
police to be safe.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.550
One of the
manifestations of this

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.620
is the reality of pretrial
detention, where the police are

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:20.400
able to throw people
into jails and hold them

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.500
without any charge or trial.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.470
In any given year, there's
about 10 million people,

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.460
overwhelmingly the poorest, who
are held in pretrial detention.

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.307
What you don't see in
that statistic though,

00:20:30.307 --> 00:20:31.890
that of the tens of
millions of people

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:34.440
who are attached to
those families, when

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.740
the breadwinner is
taken into prison,

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.660
the way that devastates
the capacity of that family

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:41.170
to move forward.

00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:45.910
So police abuse is the
third and just horrific form

00:20:45.910 --> 00:20:47.780
of violence
confronting the poor.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:52.400
The fourth, interestingly,
is violent land theft.

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.200
Just a way that the poor
will have their land stolen

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.690
from them by people
of power and violence.

00:20:57.690 --> 00:21:01.640
In any given year,
about 5 million people

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.505
will get themselves violently
ejected off of their land.

00:21:05.505 --> 00:21:06.880
And if you were
to look at, well,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.420
who's most vulnerable
to this, it

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.810
turns out that widows are,
especially widows in Africa.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.560
As the AIDS epidemic
has devastated

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:17.440
much of the male population, it
leaves these families, right?

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.160
And what happens is that
stronger families will come

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.270
and they'll just throw a
widow like Susan and her kids

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:25.150
off their land.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:28.590
One of the things that's amazing
that I had no understanding of

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:33.040
was the idea that widows like
Susan in the developing world

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.279
support a half a
billion orphans.

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:38.070
So you imagine a poor
person who their sort

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:40.070
of one asset for
moving out of poverty

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.210
is their little plot of
land, which gives them

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:45.540
a little shelter and then also
the little garden where they're

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:46.540
able to raise some food.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:49.830
But if you steal that
land away, you've

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:55.220
taken a very most basic means
for progress away from them.

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.640
And you've left
them in destitution.

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.800
So that's the fourth
largest pervasive form

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.365
of violence against the
poor is violent land theft.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.450
The things that we want to
bring forth from the book

00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:14.410
is not only this sort of
subterranean world of violence

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:18.320
that we might not be aware of--
and why aren't we aware of it?

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.410
It's hard to visualize--
but secondly, there's

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.310
human beings actively hiding it.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:26.340
Dirty water does not
actively hide itself.

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:29.620
Nor do shacks nor generally
do diseases, but human beings

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:32.530
when they commit violence,
they work hard to hide it.

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.620
And likewise, the
survivors and victims

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.650
of abuse also because of
fear and shame many times

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:39.260
are also hiding it as well.

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:41.850
So the book is trying to bring
this back up to the surface.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.650
But not only that,
but help people

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:47.750
begin to think about what
are the implications of this

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.890
for our dreams for
the poor, that is,

00:22:49.890 --> 00:22:52.592
that they would be able
to get out of poverty.

00:22:52.592 --> 00:22:54.800
And this is why we're calling
it "The Locust Effect,"

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.120
because one of the pictures
we want people to have

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:01.829
is just the way that
over the millennia,

00:23:01.829 --> 00:23:03.620
these poor farm
communities, who are trying

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.530
to scrape their way out of
poverty by all this farm work,

00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:10.090
in a single day would
see the locusts descend

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:13.020
and just destroy
all of those years

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.500
of hard work in a single day.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.220
And this is the way
predatory violence

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.920
works in the life of the poor.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.590
In a moment, they descend
and destroy that work.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:25.140
But not only did it destroy
the fruit of the farm work,

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.630
but what's interesting
about the locust is

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:31.440
that farm work doesn't
stop the locust.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.330
So not only does
violence destroy

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:35.790
the fruit of the
efforts of the poor

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.970
and the efforts of those
who attempt to help them,

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.170
but also the traditional things
that we do to assist the poor,

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.310
they don't stop the violence.

00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.940
So that suggests
that we need to start

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.580
talking about
poverty differently

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.110
and start doing things
differently about poverty

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.750
as well.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.820
So then that raises
the question that we

00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.680
try to address a bit in
the book is my goodness,

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.580
why are criminal justice
systems so completely useless,

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.640
backwards, brutal and broken
in the developing world?

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.310
And there is four pretty
interesting surprises

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:08.310
that explain this.

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:11.440
One of them, which if you
traveled in the developing

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:15.267
world you probably noticed,
but it didn't really

00:24:15.267 --> 00:24:17.350
come to your mind what it
was that you are seeing.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.570
And that is, you probably went
to a restaurant and a hotel,

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:22.279
and you exchanged
some money, and you

00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:24.570
went to some other places,
novels and almost everywhere

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.810
that you and I would go
in the developing world,

00:24:26.810 --> 00:24:31.020
someone will be there
with a gun guarding you.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:34.230
Because with the collapse
of public justice systems

00:24:34.230 --> 00:24:37.780
in the developing world,
what's come into its place?

00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.650
Well, people with wealth
and money and businesses

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.770
have set up a completely
parallel system

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:45.600
of private security.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.050
So now, in fact, in a
country like Guatemala,

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.880
private security forces
are seven times larger

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:54.380
than the public police force.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.070
In Africa, the largest
employer on the continent

00:24:58.070 --> 00:25:00.490
is private security.

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.870
In a way that almost we have
not remarked upon at all,

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:06.420
a massive social
transformation has taken place

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:09.640
in the developing world, where
security, instead of it being

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.670
a public good that's
provided to everybody

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.140
through public institutions of
policing and criminal justice

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:18.520
system has been privatized.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.420
So now there's two kinds of
people in the developing world.

00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.670
Those who can pay for their own
security and those who cannot

00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.880
afford to pay for security,
cannot pay to be safe,

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.410
and so they're not.

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:35.920
So we now have to picture 2 and
1/2 billion people who live off

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.370
less than $2 a day, who
cannot purchase into their own

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:42.750
security and are living
in this lawless chaos.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:47.060
What is the impact for them on
trying to get out of poverty?

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.770
There's several
other explanations

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:51.130
in the book that are
pretty surprising about how

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.960
it is that criminal justice
systems and law enforcement has

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.199
become so broken in
the developing world.

00:25:57.199 --> 00:25:58.740
But then what we
try to do is finally

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:01.330
sort of pivot towards
some hope, because I

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.140
realize I've pretty much
decimated your Wednesday

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.910
right here that was going
along very well just fine.

00:26:07.910 --> 00:26:10.220
And then we hear about
all this massive violence

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:11.110
and human suffering.

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.090
It's like, thank
you very much, Gary.

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:16.080
I'll take a nap now.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.430
But we've been at this work
now for almost 20 years.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.730
And you think we'd be pretty
much in a fetal position

00:26:22.730 --> 00:26:25.940
somewhere, because of all the
sort of overwhelming corruption

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:27.680
and abuse and violence.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.060
But actually I have never
been and we've never

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:33.170
been more hopeful about
coming to a tipping

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:36.540
point of transformation
in the developing world.

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.480
And why is that?

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.940
Where is the hope come from?

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:42.490
The first place that hope
comes from is history.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:43.990
Most of us just
have never thought

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:47.790
for a few minutes of like,
where did our own reasonably

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.480
functioning public
justice systems come from?

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.500
Our public justice system,
our police and courts

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:53.870
aren't perfect, for sure.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.060
I spent a career at the
Department of Justice

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:00.010
going after corrupt and brutal
cops in the United States.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.830
And my co-author Victor
d does this currently

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.413
and works in the
Civil Rights Division

00:27:04.413 --> 00:27:06.260
of the Department of Justice.

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:09.320
All the sort of abuses that
happen anywhere in the world

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:11.080
can also happen here.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:17.140
But we breathe, like the
invisible oxygen in the air,

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.780
functioning criminal justice
systems that keep us safe.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.560
So we are outraged, are
we not, when it turns out

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.620
that law enforcement can't
come to my house right now.

00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:28.290
That seems like a completely
intolerable situation.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:31.570
Because we have reasonably
functioning justice systems.

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:33.960
But if you lived in
the San Francisco Bay

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:39.170
Area 120 years ago, what
kind of law enforcement

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.886
would you be experiencing?

00:27:40.886 --> 00:27:42.260
What I could tell
you for sure is

00:27:42.260 --> 00:27:45.360
that it would be either
non-existent brutal or corrupt

00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:47.040
or completely
captured by whatever

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.539
local political
party was in charge.

00:27:49.539 --> 00:27:51.080
In fact, what we do
in the book is we

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:53.660
set forth these various
examples, these scenarios,

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.990
and have you try to guess.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:59.010
Is this one of the familiar
cities that you enjoy and walk

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:01.780
in currently and a story of
what their public justice

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:04.040
system looked like
140 years ago?

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.240
Or is this a current city
in the developing world?

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.730
And the descriptions are
indistinguishable, one

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:12.860
from another.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.990
In other words, criminal justice
systems that work and protect

00:28:15.990 --> 00:28:17.710
people, they don't
descend from heaven

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:19.550
as wonderfully operating.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.750
They always start out
brutal and corrupt.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:28.000
And a fight is engaged to make
them actually serve everybody,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.501
so that everybody's
protected from violence.

00:28:30.501 --> 00:28:33.000
And this is the history that
most of us have just forgotten.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.150
But what it reminds us is
that this is possible actually

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.920
for those who are living in
the developing world as well.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.600
So that's the other way we begin
to turn to look for hope too,

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.225
because there actually
are some stories

00:28:44.225 --> 00:28:46.730
and examples around
the world now

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:48.600
where some best
practices are beginning

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:51.970
to emerge of how the
international community can

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:55.100
join with local
champions in the fight

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.710
for trying to secure
justice for the poorest.

00:28:57.710 --> 00:28:59.590
One of the best
examples that we share

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.500
in the book is the one
that Paul alluded to,

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.800
which was this experiment we
did with the Gates Foundation

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.030
in the second largest
city of the Philippines

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.970
called Ceba which had a
terrible problem with child sex

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:11.150
trafficking.

00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:13.390
And we were given
this grant to look at,

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.680
well, let's see if
we can do two things.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.620
Number one can we stand up local
law enforcement, the police

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.250
and the courts so they
actually effectively enforce

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.240
the law against child
sex trafficking.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:25.260
Is that even possible?

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.490
Because maybe it's so
hopelessly corrupt and brutal

00:29:27.490 --> 00:29:29.150
that's not even possible.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:31.560
And if that does happen,
will that actually

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.000
reduce the amount of
violence against kids

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.450
in the commercial sex trade?

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:37.280
Or is this just
hopelessly some part

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.530
of a massive problem of
poverty that will never

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.790
be affected by good
law enforcement.

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:44.530
Well, outside auditors
went in before the project

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:46.310
began and sort of
drew a baseline

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.280
of how much
victimization of children

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:50.280
there was in the
commercial sex trade.

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.000
And the goal of the project
over a four-year period of time

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.360
was to try to demonstrate
a 20% reduction

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.320
in the victimization
of these kids.

00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.370
That would have hit the ball
out of the park, home run.

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:03.710
Gates Foundation would have
been super, super proud

00:30:03.710 --> 00:30:06.040
of this amazing winning project.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:09.760
But after four years of standing
up local law enforcement

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:12.840
by deploying, as
IJM does everywhere

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:18.450
in the world, local,
indigenous Filipino lawyers,

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.740
criminal investigators
and social workers

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:23.540
to actually turn law
enforcement around,

00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:26.840
what we saw after four short
years was their auditors

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.520
found a 79% reduction in
the victimization of kids

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.300
in the commercial sex trade.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:34.490
Why is that?

00:30:34.490 --> 00:30:36.970
Fundamentally, you
learn two things.

00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.210
Number one crimes against the
poor is crime of opportunity.

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:43.151
You do it, because you
can get away with it.

00:30:43.151 --> 00:30:45.400
And it turns out that when
you can't get away with it,

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.160
you don't do it anymore.

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:49.380
It also turns out that
people who oppress the poor

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:51.270
are not brave people.

00:30:51.270 --> 00:30:54.309
And when they start to feel
a sense of reasonable risk

00:30:54.309 --> 00:30:55.850
that they could pay
a price for that,

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.884
they just leave them alone.

00:30:57.884 --> 00:30:59.800
There are a number of
stories in the book that

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:04.640
begin to show, not only
from IJM but from other NGOs

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:06.960
around the world, other
government organizations that

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:11.620
are beginning to turn this
plague of violence around.

00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.750
Our invitation to you
is just really two-fold.

00:31:14.750 --> 00:31:18.254
One is to help us to change
the conversation about poverty.

00:31:18.254 --> 00:31:20.420
/ of you have probably been
engaged because you even

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.960
came here this afternoon.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.682
You probably have some
heart for the struggle

00:31:24.682 --> 00:31:25.890
against poverty in our world.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:27.610
And we are at an
inflection point

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.210
in history of making really
some tremendous improvements.

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.960
But we're also
stalling out in terms

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:37.320
of trying to help the
the 2 and 1/2 billion

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:41.184
who are living off $2 a day, in
them actually breaking through.

00:31:41.184 --> 00:31:42.600
And so what we
would want to do is

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:46.200
begin to make sure
that we don't fail

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.960
to include the
problem of violence

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.160
when we talk about poverty.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.700
So I would love it if you
got a hold of the book,

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.010
read it, got yourself educated,
so you yourself are capable

00:31:57.010 --> 00:31:59.945
advocate of just almost
always asking the question.

00:31:59.945 --> 00:32:01.522
Yeah, but what
about the violence?

00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:03.230
And how are we dealing
with the violence?

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:05.460
And how are we strengthening
local law enforcement

00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:07.340
to be able to address it?

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.130
The second thing we
would love for you to do

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:13.780
is not only get the book,
educate yourself, participate

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:17.160
in the discussion,
but right now, there

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.750
is a very, very important
conversation going on

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:22.220
with the United Nations about
the Millennium Development

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:22.927
Goals.

00:32:22.927 --> 00:32:24.260
You might have heard about this.

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.260
In the year 2000,
the UN put together

00:32:27.260 --> 00:32:31.020
from the international community
a blueprint-- the blueprint--

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:33.280
for trying to address
poverty and to try

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.050
to make massive
progress over 15 years.

00:32:36.050 --> 00:32:39.210
So they came up with these
eight Millennium Goals.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.790
Well, in many
respects, those have

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:43.970
been really helpful
and very powerful.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.830
But one of the grand
mistakes that was made

00:32:46.830 --> 00:32:50.470
was that they drew up a
blueprint to address poverty

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:54.320
and didn't say a word about
violence, this horrific force

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.460
that undercuts so
much of what's being

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:58.610
done to try to assist the poor.

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.070
An example of
that, for instance,

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:02.870
is girls' education in the
developing world, which

00:33:02.870 --> 00:33:08.070
is this amazingly powerful way
to actually bring prosperity

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:10.900
to a whole community, not
only for the individual girls

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.700
but for that whole community.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.380
The problem is now
studies show that one

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:15.890
of the primary
reasons girls don't

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:19.200
go to school in the developing
world is because of violence.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.140
Violence on the way
to school, violence

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:22.700
in school, violence
in the home that

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.690
keeps them from going to school.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.780
And so we want to make
sure that as the UN now

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:31.170
is rewriting the Millennium
Development Goals, so

00:33:31.170 --> 00:33:34.370
that in the year
2015, they'll launch

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.940
this new blueprint for
addressing poverty,

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.510
we just simply
want to make sure,

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.420
let's not leave out violence.

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.460
It's a bit like
the AIDS epidemic

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.020
when it began to really
roll through the developing

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:46.730
world in the '90s.

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:50.100
And millions of people
were being decimated.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:56.145
Really you could not be serious
about addressing poverty

00:33:56.145 --> 00:33:57.974
in the developing
world if you are not

00:33:57.974 --> 00:33:59.640
willing to confront
the problem of AIDS,

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.390
because whatever it
is that you are doing,

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:03.490
AIDS is going to show
up and impact it.

00:34:03.490 --> 00:34:06.900
In the same way, we are hoping
to engage the conversation

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.460
about poverty in the
developing world to say,

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.670
unless you're dealing with
the problem of violence

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.949
and the lawlessness
unleashed by the collapse

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:15.699
of criminal justice
system, it's going

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:18.989
to roll over almost everything
else you're trying to do.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:22.449
And so we would love
it if you would go

00:34:22.449 --> 00:34:26.199
to the
locusteffect.com/petition,

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.100
and just joined
a petition there.

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:31.500
That goes to the Secretary
General of the UN.

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:34.020
It ought to just be
millions of common people

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:36.662
who say, as they did with regard
to the AIDS epidemic, hey,

00:34:36.662 --> 00:34:38.120
I'm not an expert
about everything,

00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.415
but I care about this stuff.

00:34:39.415 --> 00:34:41.790
And it seems to make sense to
me that if we don't address

00:34:41.790 --> 00:34:44.040
violence, we're not going
to make the progress that we

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.360
want in addressing poverty.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.380
Simple as that.

00:34:46.380 --> 00:34:50.080
But what I can tell you is
that this stuff matters.

00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:52.340
And it's a tremendous
way for you

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.210
not only to engage
yourself, but begin

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.450
to mobilize all of your
networks into the fight.

00:34:57.450 --> 00:35:00.880
So that's all I have to
share this afternoon.

00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:03.470
I'd be happy to take
questions or interaction.

00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:07.290
AUDIENCE: In your first example,
the local police station

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:09.030
had lost funding.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.330
So my question to you would
be in these developing world,

00:35:12.330 --> 00:35:14.730
where the governments
themselves often

00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:18.239
lack funding, if you
have any ideas for

00:35:18.239 --> 00:35:19.280
had to attack that angle.

00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:20.105
GARY HAUGEN: Yeah.

00:35:20.105 --> 00:35:23.560
In many respects, we'll
look in the developing world

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.292
and we'll see, especially
in low income countries,

00:35:26.292 --> 00:35:28.910
you think, wow, they really
don't have enough resources

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.326
in the country to
actually provide

00:35:30.326 --> 00:35:31.470
for decent law enforcement.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:33.150
Except when you look
at all the dollars

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.680
that are being spent
on private security.

00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.750
And then you realize,
oh, in the aggregate,

00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:39.730
this economy actually
has plenty of money

00:35:39.730 --> 00:35:44.010
to be able to provide for public
security, public law and order.

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:48.380
And so what it takes
is a groundswell

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:55.060
of social demand within
these communities--

00:35:55.060 --> 00:35:58.030
a groundswell of demand
to actually reallocate

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:03.460
resources to the priority of
providing for law enforcement.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:05.450
That's why I want to
emphasize this is not

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:09.580
a problem is going to be solved
from outsiders paratrooping

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:12.250
in and setting up
American justice systems

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:13.220
or something like that.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:17.160
This is a fight that the
community itself, the nation,

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.030
must own.

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:23.210
And part of that is to
rally the community,

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:27.280
to begin to demand that the
public justice system is well

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.542
provided for.

00:36:28.542 --> 00:36:30.750
So that's one of the things
the International Justice

00:36:30.750 --> 00:36:31.670
Mission does.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:34.540
And a number of
the other examples

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:36.190
that we given in the
book is how do we

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:39.930
come alongside local
champions in those communities

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:42.780
and help resource them to
be able to draw attention

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:48.210
to the problem, but
also realign resources

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:50.040
so they're providing
for a public justice

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.370
system that cares for all.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:57.320
One of the amazing, of
course, examples of this

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.740
is the country of Georgia, which
is a former Soviet republic,

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:07.240
which in 2003 was ranked
something like 145 out of 190

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.320
countries as most corrupt.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.660
It was ranked as more corrupt
than any country that we

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.370
work in, especially the police.

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:17.830
But there was a demand
amongst the citizenry

00:37:17.830 --> 00:37:20.540
and a new election that
brought to bear leaders

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.240
into power who began
to attack corruption.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.130
And they started with
police corruption.

00:37:25.130 --> 00:37:27.790
And the thing that
they found was

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:32.220
that police officers in Georgia
would pay a $10,000 bribe

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.280
in order to get a job,
for which they were

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.780
paid by the government
$10 a month.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.326
Why would you do that?

00:37:39.326 --> 00:37:41.200
Because basically you've
been given a license

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:43.450
to then extort
money from people.

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:46.304
And then those high authorities
in the Georgian government

00:37:46.304 --> 00:37:47.220
also figured that out.

00:37:47.220 --> 00:37:48.770
Let me see, I get $10,000 bribe.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:50.760
We need a lot of police.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.930
Because the more police we have,
the more bribe money I get.

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:56.590
And so they have this
bloated police force

00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.520
that was ill trained and
ill equipped and completely

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:00.660
abusive.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.930
So when this new leadership came
in, the first thing they did

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:07.630
is they fired 16,000 police
officers in a single day, sent

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:12.030
them home and the
city was safer.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.390
Then they rebuilt the
police from the ground up.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:18.830
And they were able to
pay them good wages,

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.460
provide them with
good equipment,

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.210
and provide them with
good management that

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:25.490
was able to secure integrity
to the police force.

00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:31.350
And the transformation for the
common person is tremendous.

00:38:31.350 --> 00:38:32.880
So the resources are there.

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.820
It's just how you allocate them.

00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.410
Yeah.

00:38:35.410 --> 00:38:38.130
AUDIENCE: There's a sort of
a stereotype about violence

00:38:38.130 --> 00:38:40.627
against the poor,
which is maybe part

00:38:40.627 --> 00:38:42.960
of the self-defense mechanism,
like you're saying, well,

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.560
after this, we'll feel
like going and taking a nap

00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:46.690
and forgetting about the
whole thing, which is, oh,

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:48.691
those poor people over
in the poor part of town.

00:38:48.691 --> 00:38:50.648
They have all this violence
in their community.

00:38:50.648 --> 00:38:52.080
They're all beating
each other up.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.205
But as long as they don't
come into my neighborhood

00:38:54.205 --> 00:38:57.840
and break into my house, I just
don't have to think about it.

00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:59.400
I'm wondering
especially, it seems

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.650
like this might differ across
the different categories

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.108
of violence you
were talking about,

00:39:03.108 --> 00:39:07.070
but to what extent are
we looking at lawlessness

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:09.690
within the poor community, and
to what extent are we really

00:39:09.690 --> 00:39:12.550
looking at the people who
are much better off going

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:15.830
in systematically taking the
land, as you were saying,

00:39:15.830 --> 00:39:17.980
from the poor and
enslaving the poor and so

00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:20.520
forth, as opposed to domestic
violence, which might be more

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.220
of a poor-on-poor
or kind of thing.

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:23.220
GARY HAUGEN: Yeah.

00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.640
It's both.

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:33.431
Poor-on-poor violence is sort of
 relatively-poor-against-the-poorest

00:39:33.431 --> 00:39:33.930
violence.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:34.429
Right?

00:39:34.429 --> 00:39:36.160
So the opening
story, for instance,

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:44.220
of the rape and murder of the
child in Bolivia in this town,

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:47.380
that was committed
by the wealthy family

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:54.460
inside the town, who are not
wealthy from our perspective.

00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.950
But in that town, they are
the wealthy or powerful ones.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:40:00.310
So it is sort of the strong
preying upon the weak.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:03.470
But it is also true that,
for instance, the people who

00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:08.730
run slave operations in rice
factories, brick factories,

00:40:08.730 --> 00:40:11.830
these are people of
substantial economic power

00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:14.120
and substantial political power.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.020
So those kinds of
crimes and especially

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:18.955
the land theft,
those are also crimes

00:40:18.955 --> 00:40:21.480
that have substantial
economic power behind them,

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.090
so you are dealing with people
who are actually making money

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:25.180
off the violence.

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:28.310
There's not a lot of people
making money off malaria.

00:40:28.310 --> 00:40:30.790
There's not a lot of
people making money off

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:35.430
of contaminating water or
making hospitals run badly.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.160
You could make up an
instance, I guess,

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.030
in which that's the case.

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:39.821
But for the most part,
that's not the case.

00:40:39.821 --> 00:40:43.080
But there is a massive
business of economic advantage

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:45.120
from violence against
other human beings.

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.870
And if you don't have
a good system that's

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.820
prepared to fight
that, that's going

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:52.030
to roll all over
the most vulnerable.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:53.950
AUDIENCE: Two kind
of related questions.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:56.700
Or it might just be that
I'm trying to jam two in.

00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:01.700
One, you made a good case for
how violence affects the poor.

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.650
I'm curious about flipping
that around and thinking

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:07.630
about how does poverty
actually create violence.

00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:11.880
How much of this is from
people being poor and having

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.860
no other opportunities?

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.380
How much does that impact
the police situation

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:19.470
where you talk about police
who are very underpaid?

00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:21.454
And getting this
into the equation,

00:41:21.454 --> 00:41:22.870
the second part
of the question is

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:25.920
where is the most
leverage to this.

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:28.140
There were some big
numbers thrown out

00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:31.520
around 4 billion people without
law enforcement protection,

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.526
30 million in
slavery, where do we

00:41:33.526 --> 00:41:34.900
get the most
leverage to actually

00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:38.274
have the most impact
on a problem like this?

00:41:38.274 --> 00:41:39.690
GARY HAUGEN: From
our perspective,

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:42.650
there's no question that
the biggest leverage comes

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.940
from a credible criminal
deterrent in the community.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:52.200
Because crime proceeds
along elasticity to risk.

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.940
And different kinds of
crime is sensitive to risk

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.840
in different ways.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.890
So if you have social
pathology, sort of deviancy,

00:41:59.890 --> 00:42:03.330
that the pedophilia's sort
of a crime, where somebody,

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:05.942
just out of deviancy, is
going to commit that crime.

00:42:05.942 --> 00:42:07.900
And actually, it's not
very responsive to risk.

00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:10.625
You can ratchet up the
law enforcement on that,

00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:12.500
and those people commit
those crimes anyways.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.640
And they end up going to jail.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.160
So it's not very
responsive to risk.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.972
Also true with
crime of necessity,

00:42:20.972 --> 00:42:23.180
where some one feels like,
I gotta commit this crime.

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.402
And., that's what a
lot of state crime

00:42:25.402 --> 00:42:26.860
is that's committed
by governments.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.776
They think I have to
torture this guy in order

00:42:28.776 --> 00:42:29.570
to stay in power.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:31.680
So this is a crime
of necessarity.

00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:35.970
So that responsiveness to
risk is also not that great.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:38.550
I also crime of
desperation where

00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:41.510
you feel like I got
a steal the bread,

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:44.200
I have to hijack the car
because my family's starving,

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.860
and so this is necessity.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.000
That's also not very
responsive to risk.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.310
But the vast,
vast, vast majority

00:42:51.310 --> 00:42:54.780
of crime against the poor
is crime of opportunity.

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:57.550
You do it because you
can get away with it.

00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:59.280
And what you find
there on the curve

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.910
is that as soon as there
is a little increase

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:04.760
in the risk, that falls
very, very sharply,

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.010
especially things like any
kind of crime of opportunity

00:43:09.010 --> 00:43:10.950
that produces an
economic reward.

00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:12.390
That's certainly like slavery.

00:43:12.390 --> 00:43:16.254
That step drops off like 79%
in a four-year period of time

00:43:16.254 --> 00:43:17.670
when people who
were doing it just

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:21.640
for the purposes of making money
find that the risk calculation

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:26.100
has changed so we have seen
the greatest returns from just

00:43:26.100 --> 00:43:28.867
making sure that those
who would be drawn

00:43:28.867 --> 00:43:30.950
to that crime against the
poor feel like they have

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:32.980
a reasonable chance
of going to jail.

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:36.840
That means you get rid
of all the soft crime.

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.120
That will leave you
with a hard crime, which

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.730
is the crime of desperation,
the crime of necessity,

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.380
the crime of social deviancy.

00:43:43.380 --> 00:43:45.840
And in the West,
that's what we're

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:48.840
trying to mostly battle
in our communities.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:52.467
But we have a really
different struggle

00:43:52.467 --> 00:43:54.050
in the developing
world, where there's

00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:56.810
a tremendous amount of soft
crime, crime of opportunity

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.290
that hasn't been
addressed at all.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:00.540
And we will have to eventually
get to the other stuff.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.090
But right now, the
massive numbers

00:44:03.090 --> 00:44:06.010
are coming from just
pure opportunity.

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:06.510
Yeah.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:12.140
The second question was
about-- the prior question--

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:14.350
AUDIENCE: The first was, I
think, what you mentioned,

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:17.030
which is the crimes of
necessity or desperation,

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:19.240
that how much does
poverty itself create

00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.895
the violence versus violence
exacerbating the poverty?

00:44:22.895 --> 00:44:23.770
GARY HAUGEN: A cycle.

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:24.645
They're interrelated.

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:29.900
But it's a mistake
to imagine that you

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.350
have to wait to solve poverty
before you can drastically

00:44:33.350 --> 00:44:36.050
reduce the amount of
violence against the poor.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:40.130
You can addressed
violence because it's

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:43.840
driven by the incentives of
the perpetrator, substantially.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.590
And so those risk calculations
are very, very powerful.

00:44:47.590 --> 00:44:50.500
You will need to address
the other sort of caught

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.940
complicated social
causes for crime.

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:56.180
But a massive
amount of it can be

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.060
addressed by addressing the
incentives of the perpetrators

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.560
unlike dirty water
or disease they

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:03.970
don't have human will behind it.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:05.590
All crime does.

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:09.420
And so you affect the
incentives of the perpetrators

00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:11.842
quite powerful and faster than
you might otherwise think.

00:45:11.842 --> 00:45:14.050
AUDIENCE: I realize you're
focusing on the developing

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:15.240
world.

00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:18.350
And you just
mentioned that, say,

00:45:18.350 --> 00:45:20.230
in a society like ours
in the United States,

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:25.640
we deal with maybe, you say
less of this soft crime.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:26.714
More the hard crime.

00:45:26.714 --> 00:45:29.130
I feel like we have the same
thing happening in the United

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.515
States where money
pays for protection.

00:45:31.515 --> 00:45:33.360
For instance, our
property taxes pay

00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:38.430
for a safe neighborhood
and the poor neighborhoods

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:40.340
may not get lights.

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.004
Whoever's causing the
crime, whether it's

00:45:43.004 --> 00:45:45.420
for economic opportunity by
the more, more powerful or out

00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:47.610
of desperation,
the same people are

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:49.780
suffering with the people
in those communities.

00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:53.980
Or why do people feel they don't
trust law enforcement states?

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:56.490
Or you could pay for a good
representation in court.

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:58.100
Or you can get a
state appointed one

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.640
that only gives your
case five seconds.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:03.320
So I don't see that
those problems don't

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:08.280
exist in the quote
"nondeveloping world."

00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.830
Have you given or
are there others

00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:13.510
doing similar lines of research?

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:16.450
GARY HAUGEN: Yeah,
and that is the case

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:19.610
and as I said the
first half of my career

00:46:19.610 --> 00:46:21.507
was addressing those
failures actually

00:46:21.507 --> 00:46:22.590
here in the United States.

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.923
So there's no abuse taking
place overseas that I haven't

00:46:24.923 --> 00:46:27.660
seen somewhere here
in the United States.

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.530
What we do have is just
massively greater resources

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:31.845
to address them.

00:46:31.845 --> 00:46:33.970
But it's also true that
those with wealth and money

00:46:33.970 --> 00:46:36.220
supplement the provision
of public service

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:39.540
with private security and with
private legal representation

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:40.560
and so forth.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.160
And so it is certainly
true that you

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.830
get better security
the wealthier

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.100
you are in the United
States and in any country.

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.058
That's true, but the
question is whether or not

00:46:49.058 --> 00:46:51.490
you're going to have any sort
of even reasonable baseline

00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:53.170
of protection for those reports.

00:46:53.170 --> 00:47:00.790
You might look at Katherine
Boo's recent book on, I think,

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:03.690
"Behind the Beautiful Forevers,"
where she lived for three years

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.130
in a slum in India.

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:06.900
And she's this
amazing journalist

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.510
who's actually written a lot
about the failures of law

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:10.051
enforcement in the
United States too.

00:47:10.051 --> 00:47:13.760
But she wrote about just
the realities of poverty

00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.010
in the slum, and one of the
things, when she came home

00:47:16.010 --> 00:47:19.730
and she was on NPR, talking--
She says well, one thing I can

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:22.380
say is different about coming
home to the United States

00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:26.910
is that the basic level of
opportunity for law enforcement

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:29.390
to provide basic
order in the community

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:36.200
is order of magnitude different.

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.000
It's also true for instance
that the poor-- and we have

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.770
mass incarceration of the
poor in the United States,

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:46.000
because of poor legal
services in many respects--

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.750
but what's true
in the developing

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:52.420
world is that if you're too
poor to have an attorney,

00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.570
you get no attorney.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:57.680
So you don't get a sleepy
attorney or a drunk attorney,

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.892
or you get none at all, and
it's ap overwhelmingly likely

00:48:01.892 --> 00:48:04.100
that if you're a poor person
in the developing world,

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.730
you will appear in court in a
proceeding that is conducted

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.670
in a language you
do not understand.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:12.060
So you will appear,
because actually conducted

00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.180
in the colonial
language, whether that's

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:17.210
English or Spanish or French.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:18.960
Because the legal
institutions were set up

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.710
by the colonial powers, and they
have never been re-engineered.

00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:23.840
This is the other amazing thing.

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.830
The laws have changed?

00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:27.820
Post-colonial
wonderful embedding

00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:32.370
of human rights standards
in domestic law.

00:48:32.370 --> 00:48:34.910
But the pipeline that
actually delivers those rights

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:38.810
is law enforcement, which has
been set up by a colonial model

00:48:38.810 --> 00:48:40.360
and never changed.

00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:44.650
And so one of the
things that manifests

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:48.400
is that you don't have
any representation at all.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.040
And you do it in a
proceeding that's

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.430
conducted in a language
you don't understand.

00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:56.450
So imagine, you're
accused of a crime.

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.440
You are thrown into a
proceeding in which you

00:48:58.440 --> 00:49:00.140
have no legal protection.

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.620
And you can't understand a word.

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:04.920
And then you just get
shuffled off to jail.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:06.640
And you're sort of
asking, as I see

00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:09.440
this many times, the
defendant who's poor,

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.360
asking the guard, of course,
who has no education,

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:14.860
is illiterate generally,
but to ask the guard,

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:17.770
can you just please
explain what just happened?

00:49:17.770 --> 00:49:21.349
So ever society needs
to carry vigilance

00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:23.640
on behalf of those who are
poorest and most vulnerable,

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:27.300
who are going to get run over
by a criminal justice system,

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.810
But the utter collapse of these
systems in the developing world

00:49:30.810 --> 00:49:34.120
is something, as we
wrote in another article,

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.620
you almost have
to see to believe.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.369
And we're hoping to just
bring that to the surface.

00:49:38.369 --> 00:49:38.910
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:42.400
I was just curious if you
had any thoughts on any ways

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.630
that information technology has
impacted this problem at all.

00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:48.179
Have you seen this
through your work?

00:49:48.179 --> 00:49:49.845
Are there things that
we could be doing?

00:49:49.845 --> 00:49:53.777
You know, a big place like
Google-- that could help.

00:49:53.777 --> 00:49:54.860
GARY HAUGEN: Massively so.

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:58.360
And in fact, we have
had some opportunities

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.270
to bring out our director
of investigations,

00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:04.360
for example, who was
formerly the director of NCIS

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:07.130
to talk about the amazing ways
that actually technology can be

00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:09.990
leveraged in on
behalf of the poor

00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:11.720
to fight much of this crime.

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:13.960
In many ways in the
developing world,

00:50:13.960 --> 00:50:16.640
these technological
advances are leapfrogging

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.600
in ways that are able to
empower the poor tremendously.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:23.010
When I started doing this
work, there-- I know,

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:25.280
it's dating me a bit, but
there were no cell phones

00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.400
in the developing world.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.790
And now we give cell phones to
slaves inside brick factories.

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:33.230
And they are able to
communicate with us.

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:37.410
And then there's
using imagery to find

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:42.530
places that are more likely
to be using slave labor,

00:50:42.530 --> 00:50:44.960
the way of creating
sort of hot spots

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.030
where abuse is
taking through data.

00:50:48.030 --> 00:50:50.230
The truth is though
every word I just

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:52.740
used I was acting like I knew
what I was talking about.

00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:53.960
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:56.250
GARY HAUGEN: You guys are
more likely to be the ones

00:50:56.250 --> 00:50:58.740
to actually get
to know the needs,

00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.790
and then to begin to dream and
imagine what technology can do.

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.090
So that would be another
wonderful thing for you guys

00:51:04.090 --> 00:51:06.980
to read the book, acquaint
yourself with the problems,

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.660
and then begin to imagine with
us the way in which technology

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.800
can be leveraged.

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.340
Because one of just absolute
things that technology

00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:17.450
is able to do is to bring
transparency to what's

00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:20.810
happening by empowering people
to signal what is happening

00:51:20.810 --> 00:51:23.445
or communicate what's happening
and to shrink the world

00:51:23.445 --> 00:51:25.410
and to do it to do it real time.

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:27.510
I think technology is
fundamentally just going

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:29.135
to make it harder
and harder and harder

00:51:29.135 --> 00:51:30.690
to get away with these things.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:33.210
And that is what the victims
of abuse and violence

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.870
need most is for other
people to know about it.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.390
Because if you think about it,
what does a violent criminal

00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.890
always do?

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:42.510
And its part of the thing
that makes them so scary

00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:45.450
is they hide what
they do in the dark.

00:51:45.450 --> 00:51:48.750
And they try to intimidate
other people from seeing it.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:50.500
Why do they do that?

00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:52.840
They do it because
they're afraid.

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:54.660
Criminals are
fundamentally afraid,

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.859
that if other people
know what's going on,

00:51:56.859 --> 00:51:58.900
they won't be able to
withstand the power that we

00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:00.191
brought to bear upon the theme.

00:52:00.191 --> 00:52:04.160
So that way the technology can
bring us much more to actually

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.790
be transparent about what's
going on in the world

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:09.227
and empower even the weakest
to be able to do that.

00:52:09.227 --> 00:52:11.810
I think we're going to be living
in a very different and safer

00:52:11.810 --> 00:52:12.605
world for the poor.

00:52:12.605 --> 00:52:14.480
PAUL LEE: Just join me
in giving Gary a hand.

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:17.530
Thanks for coming
over, appreciate it.
