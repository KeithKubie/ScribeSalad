00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.280
The Truth About Medieval Chastity Belts

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.650
The lasting images of what most of us perceive
to be the “medieval times” includes heroic

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.290
knights, stampeding horses, court jesters,
giant turkey legs, ruling kings, and pure

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.600
maidens wearing chastity belts.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.290
But the fact is that, besides the more obvious
of those that aren’t accurate, most scholars

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.550
believe that the chastity belt didn’t actually
exist during medieval times, but rather is

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.910
a product of 18th and 19th century obsession
with masturbation as a societal ill and safeguarding

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.730
women in the workplace.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.160
According to the popular myth, chastity belts
were locked metal or leather belts that young

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.010
maidens wore to keep themselves “pure.”

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.120
The myths usually date the belts to the Crusades
(an approximately two hundred year period

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.560
between the 11th and 13th centuries) when
knights would be gone for years, raping and

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.870
pillaging in the name of God, and their wives
would be left at home, perhaps lonely and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.170
looking for companionship or at the least
vulnerable to unscrupulous men.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.290
So to guard against this, the story goes that
the knights would make their wives wear chastity

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.560
belts as a pledge of fidelity and for protection.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.880
Except these stories weren’t true and, in
fact, knights and maidens had likely never

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.400
even heard the term “chastity belt.”

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.640
The adjective “chaste” first appeared
around the 12th century with an original meaning

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.030
of, “virtuous, pure from unlawful sexual
intercourse” (“unlawful sexual intercourse”

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.420
as defined by the Church).

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.140
The first time “chaste” appeared as a
noun was in the 14th century with the definition

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.640
of “virgin person.”

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.260
The first known depiction of a chastity belt,
or “female chastity device,” only dates

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.540
back 600 years to Konrad Kyeser’s 1405 book
on military technology, Bellifortis.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.080
In the book, Kyeser writes about and draws
battering rams, crossbows, instruments of

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.450
torture, mentions how to castrate a man, and,
though not particularly related to war directly

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.119
(merely soldier’s pastimes), describes a
female chastity device.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.259
The “female chastity device” drawn by
Kyeser is accompanied by this text (translated):

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.060
These are hard iron breeches of Florentine
women which are closed at the front.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.049
He goes on to state in an equally ironic tone,

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:21.109
Padlocks unto the four-legged creatures, breeches
unto the women of Florence, A joke binds this

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:25.799
lovely series together, I recommend them to
the noble and obedient youth.

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:30.359
Given the lack of any verifiable artifacts
from this era (or indeed for a couple centuries

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.370
more), and the tongue and cheek manner such
devices are mentioned here, it is thought

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.760
by most historians that they either weren’t
widely used or he simply made them up and

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.529
was insinuating that Florentine women were
not generally open to soldier’s advances.

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:48.419
That said, several poems of this era do refer
to chastity belts, though as simple strips

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.730
of cloth that covered the female’s privates.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.790
They are also generally mentioned as more
of a symbolic gesture.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.599
Essentially, it was a promise ring…. but
a bit further south.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.969
Paintings and drawings from 15th and 16th
centuries depict women wearing metal chastity

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.620
belts (even, padlocks on their tongues), but
these appear in stories as fictional narrative

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.620
elements.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.249
As in, a story where a jealous husband forces
his wife to wear a lock and key belt to prevent

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.379
her from running off with a rival of his.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.949
Certainly no one would have worn a padlock
on their tongue, and wearing such metal devices

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.480
directly against the skin and genitals for
lengthy periods of time was a sure-fire way

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.029
to get abrasive wounds and infection, which
particularly back then could be lethal.

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:35.049
The lack of surviving artifacts or direct
documentation of anyone actually wearing these

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.189
once again has historians skeptical that anyone
did at this point in history, but at the least

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:44.650
with the increasing number of mentions in
fiction, it’s possible that some individuals

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.290
really did wear them.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.989
So when did the first, verifiable chastity
belt come about?

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.680
You might have heard that the first was from
1388, owned by Francesco di Carrara II, the

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.220
last sovereign lord of Padua (the oldest city
in northern Italy).

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.010
The belt was supposedly designed by him presumably
for his wife.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.779
The belt is still on display at the Doges
Palace in Venice, but many historians doubt

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:08.779
its legitimacy.

00:04:08.779 --> 00:04:13.620
In fact, several prominent museums, including
the world-renown British Museum, have either

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.269
removed or changed the dates listed on their
collection of similar chastity belts due to

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.540
concerns that they weren’t from the 14th,
15th, or 16th centuries.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.970
For instance, one of the chastity belts housed
at the Musée de Cluny (National Museum of

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.960
the Middle Ages) in Paris, long thought to
belong to Catherine de Medici, was erroneously

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.150
labeled as from the 15th century.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.110
In the 1990s, they tested the metal and, as
it turns out, it dates only back to the early

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.210
19th century.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.750
This perhaps shouldn’t be a surprise as
the Victorian era was when chastity belts

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.750
had their heyday.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.760
To get around the metal on skin problem, these
chastity belts typically included some sort

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.630
of padding like leather or cloth, which was
changed frequently.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.750
These belts were typically used for two reasons
– to prevent masturbation, and to protect

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.340
women in the workplace.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:06.190
For much of the 19th and even into the 20th
century, masturbation (by both men and women)

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.200
was considered a societal ill.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.760
An 1853 book entitled “The Silent Friend”
gives the example of “L.D.” and what happened

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.330
to him due to his constant masturbation,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.270
He less resembled a living creature than a
corpse, lying upon straw, meager, pale, and

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.120
filthy, casting forth an infectious stench,
almost incapable of motion, a watery palish

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:32.870
blood issuing from the nose, the tongue frightfully
swelling, and saliva constantly frothing from

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.810
his mouth…the disorder of the mind was equal
to the body.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.140
A few decades later in a medical text, it
was said you should,

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.900
Teach your boy that when he handles or excites
the sexual organs, all parts of the body suffer.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.700
This is why it is called “self-abuse.”

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.700
The sin is terrible, and is, in fact, worse
than lying or stealing.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.960
For, although these are wicked and will ruin
the soul, self-abuse will ruin both soul and

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:58.960
body.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.330
This loathsome habit lays the foundation for
consumption, paralysis, and heart disease.

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.670
It makes many boys lose their minds; others,
when grown, commit suicide.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.930
A few centuries earlier, one of the many problems
Martin Luther had with the Catholic Church

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.670
was the idea that the clergy should be celibate,
which he felt encouraged the “sinful”

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:19.000
act of masturbation.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.120
As he stated, “Nature never lets up…

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.120
We are all driven to the secret sin.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.890
To say it crudely but honestly, if it doesn’t
go into a woman, it goes into your shirt.”

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.710
Fast-forward back to the 19th century and,
according to the “Cultural Encyclopedia

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.490
of the Body,” in some circles, girls were
not allowed to even ride bikes or horses for

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:40.390
fear that this simulated masturbation.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.530
Special boys’ pants were designed to prevent
them from touching their genitals through

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:45.530
the pockets.

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.970
To that extreme end, chastity belts were forced
upon some young women during the Victorian

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.960
era to prevent masturbation.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.320
Also during this time, some women found wearing
chastity belts quite handy outside of any

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.450
temptation.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.560
With the Industrial age commencing in America
and Europe, more women found themselves in

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.490
factories and the workplace.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.050
At times, these were dangerous places for
women, particularly with the rampant drunkenness

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:11.870
often found by workers in the factories of
this era.

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.600
Locked metal chastity belts worn away from
the home provided a great deal of protection.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.740
Today, chastity belts have made a resurgence
for use in sexual role-playing.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.700
We will leave it at that, but next time, someone
talks about a fair maiden from medieval times

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.990
and her chastity belt, you can let them know
that the evidence that chastity belts were

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:35.730
used during the medieval times is scant, being
more a product of the much more recent Victorian

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:48.510
era.
