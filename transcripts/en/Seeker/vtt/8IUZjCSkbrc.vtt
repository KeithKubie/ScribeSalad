00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.840
Oh gosh I’m so stressed.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.370
Ugh it’s the worst.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:14.849
I feel so sick.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.740
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.190
Stress is really really awful for your body.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.090
You know when you get scared, embarrassed
or anxious - your face flushes and you get

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.529
hot and sweaty?

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.039
This is called psychogenic fever.

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.730
Well your body temperature actually increases
when you’re stressed, it’s warming up

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.550
the muscles in case you need to get the hell
out of dodge.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.470
Most of the short term effects are the result
of this flight or fight response.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.530
The Adrenal gland in your brain releases the
hormones in response to some stressor.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.260
This in turn releases glucose into the bloodstream
to power you up, ready to take on a threat.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.040
It suppresses your digestion and your immune
system to save energy for hightailing it away

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.240
from a bear.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.050
But now a days we aren’t threatened so much
by bears, but school, work, and family matters

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.530
stress us out just the same.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.050
All those good things cortisol did to save
us from the bear, does bad things us when

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.230
we’re faced with these chronic stressors
we can’t run away from.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.970
One of the hormones, cortisol, is called the
stress hormone.This hormone does a lot of

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:08.970
things.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.120
It affects things like blood pressure, metabolism,
and immune reactions such as inflammation.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.620
Basically chronic stress makes your body continually
release cortisol.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.670
Normally this hormone keeps inflammation in
check, but after a while your cells get burnt

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.670
out and become less receptive to the hormone.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.830
Inflammation then kind of runs amok.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.660
And causes its own host of problems.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.920
Inflammation can lead to heart disease and
obesity and is now being implicated in some

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.200
mental health disorders like depression and
anxiety.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.530
Inflammation can also damage your DNA.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.800
A recent study linked stress and DNA damage.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.870
The study, Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences, found that stress damages your

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:41.870
telomeres.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.600
Telomeres are often compared to that plastic
tip on your shoelaces.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.630
They sit on the ends of your chromosomes to
keep them from unraveling.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.190
As cells divide and DNA replicates, these
telomeres shorten throughout your life.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.640
Eventually leading to cell death.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.130
The erosion of telomeres is a pretty good
indicator of someone’s health.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.780
Smokers often have shorter telomeres than
nonsmokers, for example.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.979
In this study the researchers found that displaced
Indian villagers had shorter telomeres than

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.200
other villagers who didn’t go through the
stress of relocating.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.209
Which is similar to other studies on the effects
of stress on telomeres.

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.620
But it’s not just having your entire village
moved.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.780
The American Psychological Association found
that Americans are most stressed about work,

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.010
money and the economy.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.010
Does this sound like you?

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.780
If you are chronically stressed there is some
hope.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.370
Being socially connected helps.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.980
One study published Social &amp; Personality Psychology
Compass in 2011 found that “People who have

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.280
supportive, close relationships have lower
levels of systemic inflammation compared to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.190
people who have cold, unsupportive and conflict-ridden
relationships.”

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.180
Some studies show that mindfulness based practices,
like yoga and meditation, can reduce stress.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.490
Being mindful means you accept each moment
as it is without judgment.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.740
Seeing something as neither good or bad, it
just IS.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:49.920
And it’s really hard to do.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.400
It definitely takes some training, but it’s
worth it.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.180
One study published in the Annals of Behavioral
Medicine reaffirmed previous studies that

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.710
mindfulness decreases distress and increases
quality of life.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.120
So go get your yoga on so you don’t die!

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.770
What are you most stressed about?

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.830
How do you deal with it?

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:19.310
