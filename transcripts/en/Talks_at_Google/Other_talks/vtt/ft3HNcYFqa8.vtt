TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
Good afternoon.

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:03.100
Welcome everyone.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.120
My name is Trisha Ocona Francis.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.240
I'm a real estate
professional, and today we're

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.240
going to talk about
real estate home

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.340
buying and investing
the right way.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.470
There are so many
scams out there.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.455
So many of us want to
get into homeownership,

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.880
or if we're already a homeowner,
we want to go into investing.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.460
And we want to make sure
that we do it right.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.040
So how do we do it right?

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.190
So before we start,
I'm just going

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.940
to tell you a little bit about
myself, and why I do what I do,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.250
and I know what I know.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.790
I am the broker and owner of
Real Estate Ocona in New York

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:36.460
City.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.390
My office is downtown
Manhattan in Cadman Plaza.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.720
I've been a broker
for over 16 years.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.110
I am also licensed in
New Jersey, Georgia,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.100
and Pennsylvania.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.770
I just came from a Sotheby's
in Alpine, New Jersey,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.940
which is rated the wealthiest
town in the country.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.110
Medgar Evers College,
I teach real estate

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.480
at Medgar Evers College.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.180
I'm an educator.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.120
That's where a lot
of my passion is--

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.670
to educate a lot of people who
don't real estate real estate.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.780
I remember taking my course with
my mom many, many years ago,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.522
and she said, if I knew
then what I knew now,

00:01:14.522 --> 00:01:15.980
I wouldn't have
bought her a house.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.300
I would have bought a
house, but I wouldn't

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.300
have bought her a house.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.280
Because she realized
her attorney robbed her,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.990
the real estate
agent robbed her,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530
the mortgage person robbed
her, because after learning

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.040
all the education
as she did, she

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.160
realized she did not go
about it the right way.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.280
I also have spoken on
Hot 97, Street Soldiers

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.600
with Lisa Evers.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.370
I've been interviewed
on Here and Now

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.500
with Sandra Bookman on ABC7.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.410
I've spoken across the country
at the National Association

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.550
of Realtors
conventions in Orlando,

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.800
in San Francisco,
all over the country.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.560
I am also an appointed member
of the New York State Department

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.330
of State Real Estate
Board, which means

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.090
I'm appointed by the governor.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.930
There are five brokers
in the whole state

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.660
of New York that makes the rules
and regulations of New York

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:00.925
State real estate.

00:02:00.925 --> 00:02:01.800
And I am one of them.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.810
We meet four times
a year in Albany,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.980
and we just create all
the rules that real estate

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.680
agents must follow.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:12.750
I write for the Huffington
Post business section.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.920
I do the "YPN Lounge,"
just quite a few things.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.450
But this is just helps me
give you better education.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.999
Between me teaching and
sitting on the board, you know,

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:25.540
I just try to get
all the information

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.030
to give the people
what they really

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.855
need to know about real estate.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.390
Why?

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.520
Why do I do this?

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.210
Because I believe that I need to
turn to renters into homeowners

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.640
and homeowners into investors.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.190
Many of you may be renters.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.441
How do you become a homeowner?

00:02:42.441 --> 00:02:44.773
How do you stop paying that
rent and become a homeowner?

00:02:44.773 --> 00:02:46.350
And if you are a
homeowner, how do

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.331
you start getting more-- more
assets, and more property,

00:02:49.331 --> 00:02:50.330
and turn into investors?

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.280
So my goal is to help you
achieve your real estate goal.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.100
Whatever your personal
real estate goal is,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.020
you may want to rent
forever, but also

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.430
how do you rent properly?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.190
You may want to buy
your first home.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.660
How do you buy your first home?

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:08.890
You may want to invest.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:09.770
How do you invest?

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:14.370
And that's my goal, helping you
achieve your real estate goals.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.030
First of all, before we
get into the worksheet,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.570
I just want to go into
the value of real estate.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.080
Some people don't
really understand

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.080
how valuable real estate is.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.300
Anyone who gets any type of
money, the first thing they do

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.680
is they invest it
in real estate,

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.530
because the value
always goes up.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.560
So we have to think every
single thing is real estate.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.540
This building is real estate--
millions of dollars, right?

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.060
Longstanding asset.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.410
A home has been around forever.

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.540
It's an investment, and
it's a legacy builder.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.500
Many people get into
real estate because they

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.570
want to have something to
leave off for their family.

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.100
Everyone with wealth
goes into real estate.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.590
Who profits off of your home?

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.800
You or someone else?

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:59.990
How to profit?

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.070
Appreciation.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.927
Why do people get
into real estate?

00:04:02.927 --> 00:04:04.260
And how to get into real estate.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.510
These are some of the
things I'm going to cover.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.080
First of all, what
is real estate?

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.610
It may sound so simple, but I've
been teaching for over eight

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.910
years, and many people come
into my class, some people who

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.290
own over seven homes and
still don't understand

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.970
what real estate really is.

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.270
It's land plus anything that's
permanently attached to it,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.557
including buildings,
sheds, and other items

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:26.640
attached to the structure.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.734
That is the legal definition
of what real estate is.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.990
And as simple as this may sound,
every single thing around us

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.940
is in real estate.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.560
So why aren't more of us
investing into real estate?

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.410
The parking lot, the school,
the place of worship,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.940
the building, the house, the
court-- all of these things

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.650
are real estate, and
all of these things

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.050
are worth something.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.900
Think about it.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.174
These people, they're at home.

00:04:59.174 --> 00:04:59.840
They're working.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.540
They're paying bills.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.130
They go shopping, right?

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.250
They're spending their
money in shopping.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.705
Then they, the people
that are shopping--

00:05:08.705 --> 00:05:10.330
what I'm trying to
get to is everything

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.980
revolves around real estate.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.280
Once these people-- if
these people don't shop,

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.340
then the store clerk
doesn't have a job.

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.260
The truck driver cannot
put stuff on the truck.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.040
These people cannot
work in the factory.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.106
This lady cannot
work in her office.

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:29.480
And the whole
point of the matter

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.440
is, what is the first bill
that we pay every month?

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.360
Housing.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.590
That's the first bill
that we pay every month.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:39.390
And if we cannot afford
our housing bill,

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.770
then this whole
cycle cannot happen.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.820
If we cannot afford
to pay our rent,

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:47.480
or afford to pay our mortgage,
we don't go shopping.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.590
And then this whole
cycle doesn't happen.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.360
So it's very important that
whether you're renting,

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.520
you own, or you're
investing, that you're

00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:00.380
doing it properly so you don't
cause any hardship later on.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.240
Real estate is the number
one asset, number one asset

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.020
across the ball.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.310
Real estate has
always been around.

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.780
Just think about it.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.790
This particular home
was around in 1930.

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.700
It cost maybe $35,000.

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:21.430
1950, $70,000.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.870
1970, $110,000.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.570
1990, $170,000.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.450
2010, $300,000.

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.990
Right?

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.350
Every year, it goes
up and up and up.

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.120
In the year 2020, which product
do think will hold its value

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.140
or appreciate for someone
who buys it today?

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.640
Right?

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.860
We have a lot of young
kids buying sneakers.

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.340
We have people buying cars.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.330
But the only thing that's
going to go up in value

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.730
is the property.

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.930
So the question is, do you
profit off of real estate,

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.870
or does someone else
profit off of you?

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.220
Are you paying rent, or
are you collecting rent?

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:06.590
Or are you paying a mortgage?

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:09.760
What are three ways that you
profit off of real estate?

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.640
Appreciation.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.410
Cash flow.

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.070
And flipping.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.320
Appreciation, we spoke about
that house a while ago.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.960
Every single year if this
person bought it in the family

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.980
since 1920, over 90
years, it would have

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.360
appreciated this much money.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.330
Cash flow, if you have
an investment property,

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.390
let's say you have a
parking space, cell phone

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:40.740
tower, laundry, income,
this is how much you're

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.740
netting monthly.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.770
And this is how you how
much you can net annually

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.230
on an investment property.

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:51.070
And then some
people do flipping.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.540
That's another form
of real estate, right?

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.060
They buy low.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:57.790
They fix it up, and
they sell it higher.

00:07:57.790 --> 00:08:06.090
The profit off of
that house, $75,000.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.010
What are the three main
reasons that people

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.230
get into real estate?

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:09.730
Right?

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.250
I've been teaching, like I
said, for over eight years.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.990
I've taught hundreds of students
who come into my classroom,

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.830
and they want to get into
real estate for some reason.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.990
Passion, they just love it.

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.230
Free time, they have
time to do other things.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.220
And money.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:26.720
Money.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:32.440
OK.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.481
So now we're going to get
into the real learning.

00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:35.909
How do you buy your property?

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.600
How do you invest your
property without the scams,

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.280
without people trying
to rip you off.

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:41.720
Real estate is not easy.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.810
Real estate is like a
whole different language.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:48.150
I'm in real estate, and if I
ever go to a real estate event,

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:50.480
you hear a totally
different language.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.220
And if you don't
understand the language,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.820
people just tell you whatever.

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:56.020
I get phone calls every
single day of people

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:59.035
who bought homes and
were scammed in some way

00:08:59.035 --> 00:09:00.660
because they didn't
have the knowledge,

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.201
and they just trusted
the person they

00:09:02.201 --> 00:09:04.490
were dealing with, whether
their real estate agent,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:07.230
their mortgage person,
even their attorney.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.100
So the more you
know, the better you

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.650
are when you go
into the situation.

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:12.990
Me, personally, I like
to educate the people

00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:15.500
before I help them.

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.250
So these are some of
the things that we're

00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:19.260
going to learn
throughout this process.

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:19.980
You have a paper.

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:21.560
Now this paper is for you.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.380
It's for you to sit down
and take notes for yourself

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:27.020
and decide within
yourself if you're

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.080
ready to buy, when
do you want to buy,

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.740
and what questions you need to
ask yourself before you even

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.020
think about buying.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.430
Now the average real estate
agent that you call up

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.950
is not going to do this.

00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.530
But I think it's important
that if more people do this,

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:42.380
we will have less foreclosures.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.970
Do you know right now in New
York City there are over 30,000

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.240
people facing foreclosure.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.440
30,000 people.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.130
Why?

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.640
Because they got
into real estate,

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.850
and they didn't plan properly,
they weren't educated,

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:58.340
and they weren't guided right.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.860
So it's important that
you know these things.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.350
First, your credit.

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.520
Many of you may already
know what your credit is,

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.020
and that means, you know what?

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.730
You're one step ahead of it.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:15.180
But for those of you who do
not-- or even if you do-- just

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.530
think about it.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:18.560
What do I think my credit is?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:21.710
Sometimes we think our credit
is a totally different number

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:22.900
than what it really is.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.950
Sometimes it's higher than we
think, and it's much lower,

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.760
or sometimes we
think it's so bad,

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.490
and really it's not that bad.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.160
So think to yourself, what
do I think my credit is?

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.000
Also, I want you to look
at your long-term debt.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.710
What is your long-term debt?

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.452
Because when you go to get
a loan, a mortgage loan,

00:10:41.452 --> 00:10:43.160
they're going to ask
you these questions.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.580
They are going to look at these
things on your credit report.

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.390
Long-term debt.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.270
Credit cards.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.030
I'm sorry, not credit
cards, car notes.

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.550
Do you have a car note?

00:10:53.550 --> 00:10:55.630
If you're thinking
about buying, hold off

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.390
on buying that car
for a little bit.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.310
But if you have one on there,
you need to calculate that.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:05.190
Because they're going to look
at your income to your debt

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:07.430
and see how much money
you have available.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:09.740
Because at the end of the
month, they want to know,

00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:11.010
can you pay this loan?

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.290
Or are you going to
pay this car note?

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.170
A lot of people will
pay the car note first,

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:17.640
because they don't want the
repo man to come for the car.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.330
But the bank is not going
to put you in a loan

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:23.400
that you can't afford,
or you hope not.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.220
Also, do you have
any other mortgages?

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.620
And then student loans-- now
student loans don't disqualify

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:33.360
you from buying a
house, but you want

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.210
to look at your student loans.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:37.310
You want-- they want to
make sure that, you know,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:39.510
student loans can't go away.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:41.990
So if they're giving
you a loan, they

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.230
want to make sure that you can
cover the loan and the mortgage

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:48.150
payment at the same time.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.380
OK?

00:11:49.380 --> 00:11:50.290
Credit cards.

00:11:50.290 --> 00:11:52.140
Do you have any credit cards?

00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:55.220
Nobody says you have to pay
off all your credit cards,

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.730
but you want to make sure
that they're on time,

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:01.720
and you want to make sure that
the balance is not as high.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:04.540
So if your credit card
is a $5,000 credit card,

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.710
you don't want to be at $4,000.

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:11.960
You want to be below, below
half, and also on time.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.710
Negative history.

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:17.110
Use this form to write
down any negative history

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:19.250
you may have on your credit.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.500
Because that is something
that's not going to go away.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.590
When you try to go to
a bank and get a loan,

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:25.173
they're going to
look at these things,

00:12:25.173 --> 00:12:27.610
and they're going to ask
you, what's up with this?

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:28.900
What's up with that?

00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:30.960
Make sure it's not in judgment.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.160
Call up those companies.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.920
A lot of people go to these
credit repair companies.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.000
I don't advise it.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.450
A lot of these credit repair
companies, they're scams.

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.095
Unless you go to a nonprofit
agency, don't do it.

00:12:45.095 --> 00:12:46.470
They're doing--
they're not doing

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.670
nothing you can't do yourself.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:51.440
Basically, when you go
to the credit report,

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.960
you can go and dispute
these credit ratings.

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.870
OK?

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.930
Sometimes you just
have to pay it off.

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:00.300
Sometimes, if you
can't pay it off fully,

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.250
you could do a settlement.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.670
But a settlement
will show, you know,

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:06.270
it won't be as great
as paying it off

00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:08.120
because it shows
that you settled,

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.980
but at least it's off
your credit as well.

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:14.230
All I'm saying to you is, you
have to look at these things

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:17.310
before you start to go buy
a house because the loan

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.590
officer will look at them.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:22.350
You also may not know that maybe
somebody is using your credit

00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:23.840
that you didn't know.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.920
I spoke to this
gentleman, and his father,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.780
who has the same name as
him, was using his credit.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.000
Yeah.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.230
So he had no idea,
because he had not

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.780
checked his credit report.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:37.820
So now he's coming
to go buy a house,

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.010
and he's seeing this credit.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.060
I know another guy had
not used his credit,

00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:48.140
had not checked this credit, saw
a student loan on his credit.

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.220
I couldn't believe it.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.830
I could not believe he had a
student loan on his credit.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:52.996
And he didn't go to college.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:59.665
So you need to check and make
sure that those things that are

00:13:59.665 --> 00:14:00.290
on your credit.

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.300
Also, things on
your credit can not

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.590
be there for longer than seven
years once they're finished.

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:08.140
So if somebody is keeping
something on your credit,

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.350
you need to dispute it.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:10.870
Disputing it is free.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.010
It takes the--
just take the time.

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:15.140
The websites are
so much easier now.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:16.930
You can just put in
what the issue is.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.550
And by law-- I'm not a
lawyer-- but by law, they

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:22.870
have to remove it off your
credit for a certain amount

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:26.900
of days while they
contact the company

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:31.220
and find out if
it's valid or not.

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:34.520
After you write down what
you think your credit is,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.810
find out what your
credit really is now.

00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.540
Right?

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:40.850
Credit scores go
between 500 and 800.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.510
Obviously 500 is
really, really bad.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.510
800 is really, really good.

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:47.930
You have 800, you can
walk into any bank

00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:50.160
and say, give me what I want.

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:50.900
OK?

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.610
The three major credit companies
are Transunion, Equifax,

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.670
and Experian, and if you go
to annualcreditreport.com,

00:14:58.670 --> 00:15:03.380
you can get a free credit
report every single year.

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:10.390
What I personally do is I
subscribe to one of these,

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.940
and it gives me an alert
every time my credit goes up,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.930
every time my credit goes down,
anytime someone runs my credit.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.920
Anything that happens to
my credit, I get a notice.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.950
And I can get my credit
report any time I want.

00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:29.329
So for a couple bucks a month
you can get one of those.

00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:30.620
AUDIENCE: Can we ask questions?

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:31.703
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Yes.

00:15:31.703 --> 00:15:32.240
Absolutely.

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.906
AUDIENCE: I have a
couple of credit cards

00:15:33.906 --> 00:15:34.740
I don't really use.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:38.172
I use them once every few months
just so that they stay active.

00:15:38.172 --> 00:15:39.589
They don't go dormant.

00:15:39.589 --> 00:15:41.714
But if, given that that I
have a lot of credit that

00:15:41.714 --> 00:15:43.485
is available to me
that I'm not using,

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.410
is that actually
hurting my credit score,

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:46.692
or is that helping?

00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:47.900
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: It can.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.530
A loan officer will look
at that, and it can hurt.

00:15:50.530 --> 00:15:53.870
Because they can give you a
loan today for a house for like,

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.250
let's say, $800,000.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.900
And their fear is that the
next day you max it out

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.030
with furniture or whatever.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:02.110
And now you've put
yourself in debt

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:04.240
that's going to hurt you
from paying your loan.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:07.060
So yes, it can
hurt a little bit.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:10.432
But until you are really ready,
you don't have to close it.

00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:12.140
Because when you speak
to a loan officer,

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:13.700
as long as they're
paid and everything,

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.920
loan officer will probably
just say, hey close, this one.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:16.550
Close that one.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:19.042
Close that one, And
that's not a big deal.

00:16:19.042 --> 00:16:19.750
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.750
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
You're welcome.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:24.082
OK.

00:16:24.082 --> 00:16:24.582
Oh.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.670
Your money.

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:38.640
You will need money
to buy a house, right?

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.810
I know sometimes you can go
to a car, a car dealership,

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.310
and they say, you know,
0% down, 0% financing.

00:16:45.310 --> 00:16:45.810
No.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:48.310
When you buy a house,
you will need money.

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:50.270
So this is something on
the worksheet for you

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:54.170
to look at yourself and say, how
much money do I have saved up?

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.660
How much money can I
put towards my house?

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.750
You may have a 401(k)
plan, a retirement plan.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.540
Well, many people don't
know, with your 401(k) plan,

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:07.099
you're allowed to take $10,000
out your retirement money

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:11.529
without penalty for the
purchase of a house.

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:12.028
Yes?

00:17:12.028 --> 00:17:13.694
AUDIENCE: Is it
possible to borrow money

00:17:13.694 --> 00:17:15.310
from your own 401(k)?

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.839
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: You can.

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:17.790
Everyone is different.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:20.119
So you have to check
with your particular one,

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.319
but I do know you can take
$10,000 without penalty,

00:17:23.319 --> 00:17:26.510
but it has to be for
the purchase of a home.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:27.010
OK?

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.310
AUDIENCE: It has to be for the--

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:29.726
TRISHA OCONA
FRANCIS: The $10,000?

00:17:29.726 --> 00:17:32.340
The $10,000 has to be for
the purchase of a home.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.360
Gifts.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.370
Yes, sorry.

00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.072
Go a--

00:17:36.072 --> 00:17:38.532
AUDIENCE: Is the $10,000, is
that per-- so a couple buying

00:17:38.532 --> 00:17:40.500
together, is that per person?

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.490
Or is--

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:43.823
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: I've
seen people do it separately.

00:17:43.823 --> 00:17:48.085
I think it's per
person's 401(k).

00:17:48.085 --> 00:17:48.585
Yes?

00:17:48.585 --> 00:17:51.060
AUDIENCE: That $10k, is that
for your primary residency?

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.350
Can you use it for like
an investment property?

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:54.600
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Primary.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:58.140
But like I said, check with
your-- because everyone,

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:00.820
I've seen so many different
401(k)s, and you know,

00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.410
they call it the
401(3) sometimes,

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:06.470
have different provisions,
so check with that one.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.272
Gifts.

00:18:08.272 --> 00:18:10.730
Maybe you just got married,
and your parents are giving you

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:12.330
money to buy a house.

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:18.040
I know a couple, and
the husband's father

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.700
had silver coins.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.240
And he traded them in,
and he took the money,

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.090
and he split it
between his two sons,

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.010
and that's what they
used to buy the house.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:29.840
Here's the thing with gifts.

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.940
They're going to trace where
that person got the money from.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.510
OK?

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:37.970
Because they want to avoid
any money laundering.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:40.275
So if someone is giving
you a gift, a lot of times

00:18:40.275 --> 00:18:42.900
they're going to have to sign an
affidavit that this was a gift

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:45.056
also, that it was not a loan.

00:18:45.056 --> 00:18:46.680
The bank wants to
make sure that you're

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.190
not-- they're not
giving you this money

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:52.145
and then you have to pay it
back on top of that loan.

00:18:52.145 --> 00:18:53.520
So if it is a
gift, they're going

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.160
to have to say it's a gift.

00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.170
And if there's a gift, it's
going to go into your account,

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.660
and they're going to have to
trace where that person got it

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.250
from.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:04.022
Because the IRS wants
all that reported.

00:19:04.022 --> 00:19:06.480
And if you have any other money,
if you have anything else.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:06.980
Yes?

00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:09.830
AUDIENCE: So if it's a gift, do
you have to pay different tax?

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:12.330
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: It depends
on, I mean, you're allowed,

00:19:12.330 --> 00:19:13.500
depending on who
you're getting it

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.060
from-- I'm not an
accountant-- but it

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:18.830
depends on who you're getting
it from, and how much it is.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:19.350
Right?

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:22.100
But if they do give you,
you have-- they're basically

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.660
just checking to make
sure that this wasn't

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.820
drug money under the mattress.

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:31.480
So but other than that, you
know, if it's like $10,000,

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.360
you know, it could be
from a parent, right?

00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:35.901
So a parent is allowed to give
you a certain amount of gifts.

00:19:35.901 --> 00:19:40.100
But also, my disclaimer is
check with your accountant.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:41.720
Any other money?

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.160
I know a new couple
who was getting ready,

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.180
they were selling their car
so they could have more money

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.550
to buy their house.

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:49.370
OK?

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:52.230
How much money will
you really need?

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:53.950
Well, it depends.

00:19:53.950 --> 00:19:56.560
If you're going an FHA
first time homebuyer

00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:59.750
loan-- your first
time buying a home,

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:03.140
you're getting an FHA
loan-- you need 3 and 1/2%.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.680
3 and 1/2% of whatever
the loan is, that's

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:07.940
what you're going to
need for the house.

00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:08.730
OK?

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:13.330
Conventional or, if you're a
vet, you can get a VA loan.

00:20:13.330 --> 00:20:15.570
These are the type of
loans you should explore

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:17.230
with the mortgage
person that you're

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.740
dealing with to see
what rates they have,

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:21.550
what programs they have.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:23.860
There are many different
types of loans.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.650
But FHA, just to note, is a
first time homebuyer loan-- 3

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.060
and 1/2%.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.760
You also need closing costs.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:33.300
Closing costs is going to
pay for the filing fees.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.070
It's going to pay
for your attorney.

00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:41.910
Closing cost is anywhere
between 4% to 6% of the loan.

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.120
That, give or take, if
you want to calculate

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.920
how much money you will need.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.100
So whatever the purchase
price of your home, 3 and 1/2%

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.340
of that will be your down
payment, about 4% to 6% of that

00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:54.480
will be for your closing costs.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.310
How much is the value of
your home is going to be?

00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:59.450
That depends on what
the bank qualifies you

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:04.130
for based on your income,
based on your debt.

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.860
OK?

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:07.430
You also have
something called PMI.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:11.640
PMI is, if you purchase a
home, and you put down--

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:14.930
now the average for
FHA is 3 and 1/2%--

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.920
but if you put down less than
20%, which 3 and 1/2% is,

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:23.400
you are considered a risk to
the bank, which means that,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.470
God forbid you
were to foreclose,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:30.110
there's a short margin
to sell the home back.

00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:33.510
If you put down less
than 20% of the loan,

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:37.410
the bank will charge you PMI.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.830
That is an insurance to
protect them in case you

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:42.430
default on your loan.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:45.830
But, with all this
training, you won't do that.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:46.700
OK?

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:49.130
Owner occupant
versus investment,

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:50.350
that's something else.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.000
If you get a first
time homebuyer loan,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.760
you have to live there.

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.720
It's to help people
become homeowners,

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.860
so you have to live there.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.190
There's also loans
for investors.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:04.801
So if you have a home already,
you don't plan to live there,

00:22:04.801 --> 00:22:06.800
and this is just going
to be an investment home,

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:08.050
you can do that.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.980
I also want to take
a second to let

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.480
you understand
what's the difference

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.330
between a banker and a broker.

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.870
I learned this the hard way.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.040
When you go for a loan,
find out from the person,

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.280
are you a banker?

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.020
Or are you a broker?

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.990
A banker is the
person with the money.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:29.380
They're the one
lending you directly.

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:32.470
A broker is the one
shopping the loan for you.

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:34.980
So what does that mean?

00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.080
They come with a cost.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.550
Why would someone go to
a broker versus a banker?

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.150
Maybe your income
is not that high.

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:47.630
Maybe your credit
is not that great.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.780
So the broker gathers
all your information

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:54.200
and shops it out
to different banks.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.710
Believe it or not,
you are paying

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.540
that broker for that service.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.750
So your closing cost
is going to be high.

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:05.480
I've seen people pay up
to $20,000 for that broker

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:07.685
in their closing
costs and not realize

00:23:07.685 --> 00:23:10.060
they were paying that broker
why their closing costs were

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:11.790
so high.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:16.820
A banker would be going up to
Chase, Bank of America, Wells

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:19.140
Fargo, one of these banks.

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.940
That would be a banker.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:21.700
OK?

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:25.190
A broker would be
another company

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.820
who's shopping it for you.

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:28.798
Yes?

00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:30.710
AUDIENCE: 3 and 1/2% and 20%.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.670
I don't understand.

00:23:31.670 --> 00:23:32.711
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: OK.

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:35.570
So an FHA loan is a first
time homebuyer loan.

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.830
And in order as an incentive to
become a first time homebuyer,

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:42.100
you only have to put down
3 and 1/2% of the loan

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.594
as your down payment, as
your part of the investment.

00:23:44.594 --> 00:23:46.260
Why the bank makes
you do an investment?

00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:48.420
Because, you know,
if someone is asking

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:51.910
you to go into business with
them, and they're saying, hey,

00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.149
I can I borrow $90 grand?

00:23:54.149 --> 00:23:56.690
You're going to say, well, how
much money are you putting up?

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.230
So that's why the bank wants
you to put up something.

00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.840
So you're putting up 3 and 1/2%.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.190
Now, you're still considered
a risk because you only put up

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.120
3 and 1/2%.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:11.890
If you put up 20%,
you're no longer a risk.

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:13.940
Because if you
default on the loan,

00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.930
and the bank has to sell it
at auction in a foreclosure,

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.960
they still have this 20% cushion
that they can make it back

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.710
with.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.770
3 and 1/2%, anything
could happen.

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:27.630
The market could drop, the
property could need repairs,

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:30.010
and they may go underwater.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.200
So that's why, if you
put down less than 20%,

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.500
they make you pay
PMI-- Premium Mortgage

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:39.130
Insurance-- to cover
them, and protect them,

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:40.670
in case you default. Yes?

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:44.149
AUDIENCE: So then in the case
you're a first housebuyer,

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:47.090
and you put 20%, then you don't
need to pay the PMI anymore?

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:48.340
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Correct.

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.210
Now it depends.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:50.180
They changed the law.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:55.140
So now, on an FHA loan, the PMI
is for the life of the loan.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.840
It never was like that.

00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:59.650
On a conventional
loan, so in order--

00:24:59.650 --> 00:25:02.610
if you get an FHA loan, if you
want to get out of the PMI--

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:07.520
because PMI could be like $450
a month added to your loan--

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.930
if you want to get
out of the PMI,

00:25:09.930 --> 00:25:12.070
you would have to
refinance out the loan.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:16.210
On conventional,
once you get 20%

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:19.840
in equity, which means either
you've paid down your mortgage,

00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.510
or the value of your house has
gone up, you can call them up

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:27.875
and say, I'm by it, I'm
20%, take off my PMI.

00:25:27.875 --> 00:25:30.250
But you have to call them,
because they won't take it off

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:31.560
on theirself.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.101
OK?

00:25:33.101 --> 00:25:33.600
Yes.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:34.074
AUDIENCE: Is there
any way for a tenant

00:25:34.074 --> 00:25:36.602
to go to bank for a
mortgage, than to go

00:25:36.602 --> 00:25:38.296
to broker for mortgage?

00:25:38.296 --> 00:25:39.670
TRISHA OCONA
FRANCIS: Absolutely.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:41.128
Like I said, the
only reason people

00:25:41.128 --> 00:25:44.404
go to a broker is because they
don't have that much income,

00:25:44.404 --> 00:25:45.820
or their credit
is not that great.

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.130
But you have to pay
them for their service.

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.210
Whereas a banker, you're going
directly to the person who has,

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:53.020
the entity that has the money.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.392
So what's a good way to
do it is, a lot of times,

00:25:55.392 --> 00:25:57.600
you know, you're shopping
and people run your credit.

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.220
Every time you run your
credit, your credit rating

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:00.490
goes a little bit down.

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.390
They do understand
that you're shopping,

00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:04.010
so they give you a little way.

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.630
But you want to make sure
that that one or two points

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.090
don't really hurt you.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.360
Go to annualcreditreport.com,
get a copy of your credit

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:15.330
report, do the tasks that
I gave you, and go to them

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:18.410
and say, listen, this is my
credit, this is my score,

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:20.320
what can you do for me?

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.180
Do not pull my credit.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:25.140
Because they pull your credit,
it would be a hard pull,

00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.690
and you can lose a point or
two every time somebody pulls

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:28.220
your credit.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.594
Because what it looks like is
you're just shopping around

00:26:30.594 --> 00:26:32.010
for credit, credit, credit.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:32.765
Yes?

00:26:32.765 --> 00:26:34.348
AUDIENCE: Is there
any online resource

00:26:34.348 --> 00:26:36.681
where I can compare [? ten ?]
bank rates before actually

00:26:36.681 --> 00:26:38.840
going to go see them?

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.710
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
What their rates are?

00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:41.210
Yeah.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.943
There's a, yeah,
there's a website like--

00:26:42.943 --> 00:26:43.984
ABBY ONTODD: Bizrate.com.

00:26:43.984 --> 00:26:46.234
AUDIENCE: And they don't
know my credit, I just check.

00:26:46.234 --> 00:26:48.924
ABBY ONTODD: No, it just
compares the rates of credit,

00:26:48.924 --> 00:26:53.380
you know, what they're
offering for mortgages.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.950
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: That's
Abby Ontodd, my assistant.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:57.450
OK.

00:26:57.450 --> 00:27:00.400
So here, yes?

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.687
AUDIENCE: What do you
think about LendingTree?

00:27:02.687 --> 00:27:04.645
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: I
don't really, you know,

00:27:04.645 --> 00:27:08.760
I don't endorse any
particular bank.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.640
Right?

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.870
I don't-- I've seen some, you
know, do good, some do bad.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:16.770
I think what you just need to do
is just, at the end of the day,

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:20.580
make sure that they are
fulfilling what you need.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:21.350
Right?

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.808
The interest rate, make sure
the interest rate is something

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:24.840
you're comfortable with.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.442
Make sure the down payment, make
sure all those things stand.

00:27:28.442 --> 00:27:30.650
And then make sure you have
a really good real estate

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:33.090
agent and a real
estate attorney who

00:27:33.090 --> 00:27:36.330
is going to be with you
throughout the process

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:39.460
to make sure that
the i's are dotted,

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.030
and the t's are crossed.

00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:42.720
OK.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.734
These are questions
to ask yourself also

00:27:44.734 --> 00:27:45.900
when you're starting to buy.

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:48.066
A lot of people don't do
this until the last minute.

00:27:48.066 --> 00:27:49.660
Who do I want to buy with?

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:52.320
You've got to be careful
who you want to buy with.

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:54.890
Because, you know, buying with
someone is like a marriage.

00:27:54.890 --> 00:27:56.486
Once you're in, you're in.

00:27:56.486 --> 00:28:00.720
And in order to get out, either
through separation-- or even

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.950
death-- you have to figure
out, you have to plan ahead,

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:06.690
is this somebody I
want to buy with?

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:07.360
OK?

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.504
How soon do I want to buy?

00:28:09.504 --> 00:28:11.170
I spoke to a lady the
other day, and she

00:28:11.170 --> 00:28:14.110
said she's been looking
for a house for a year.

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:17.540
And she's not ready to buy then.

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.550
Because the market is changing.

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:22.180
The value of a home last year
is different from the value

00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:23.510
of a home this year.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:26.802
So if you do want to buy, you
need to look at when is it

00:28:26.802 --> 00:28:27.510
do I want to buy?

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.560
You may not be ready
to buy now, but that's

00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:32.490
why this, this handout
is so important.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:34.991
Because it's preparing you
for when you do want to buy.

00:28:34.991 --> 00:28:36.740
You don't want to wake
up one day and say,

00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.110
you know what, I'm
ready to buy, and then

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.940
you missed all these steps.

00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.490
So it's important to start with
these steps before you say,

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:47.080
I'm going to buy.

00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:48.670
Right?

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:52.830
You're going to need to take
some serious steps in order

00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.940
to start purchasing your home.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.600
If you don't have enough saved,
you're going to have to save.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:28:59.450
Right?

00:28:59.450 --> 00:29:03.005
You're going to
have to, you know,

00:29:03.005 --> 00:29:05.536
pull back on the
movies, or the clothes,

00:29:05.536 --> 00:29:06.660
or whatever you want to do.

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:09.090
You're going to have
to make commitments.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:10.580
And then, when you
purchase, you're

00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:11.900
going to have commitments.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:14.520
Some people don't know that
when you purchase a home,

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.490
not only do you have the
home loan you've got to pay,

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:18.780
you have interest on the loan.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:23.140
It's called PITI--
Principal, Interest, Taxes,

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.150
and Insurance-- you
have to pay on the home.

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.760
Plus you have utilities.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.890
New York City, we
have water as well.

00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:31.596
You have property maintenance.

00:29:31.596 --> 00:29:32.970
These are all
things that are not

00:29:32.970 --> 00:29:35.990
factored in when you're renting.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:40.400
So you have to make sure that
you're able to do those things.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.230
Another thing that when you
get a loan what they look for,

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.110
they look that you
have a steady income.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.607
You all have great jobs.

00:29:49.607 --> 00:29:50.940
That's what they're looking for.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.320
Because they want
to know that you

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.560
are going to be consistent
with paying this loan.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.480
If you have any
degrees, they want

00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.034
to look at that as well, right?

00:30:01.034 --> 00:30:02.450
God forbid you
lose your job, they

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:03.830
know that you're employable.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:06.130
These are things that
they want to look at.

00:30:06.130 --> 00:30:08.970
They're going to want to
look at your tax returns,

00:30:08.970 --> 00:30:11.700
two to three years out.

00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:12.480
Right?

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.322
Let's say you weren't here
before, you weren't here six

00:30:15.322 --> 00:30:17.280
months ago, but you were
working somewhere else

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.840
doing the same
thing that you do.

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:19.539
That's OK.

00:30:19.539 --> 00:30:21.080
Because they want
to know that you're

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.175
not jumping around from
industry to industry,

00:30:24.175 --> 00:30:25.550
that you're in
the same industry.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.870
Maybe you've changed
companies, but you're

00:30:27.870 --> 00:30:30.615
in the same industry, which
means that you're consistent.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:37.690
Now, question.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:40.330
In a real estate transaction,
who does the real estate agent

00:30:40.330 --> 00:30:41.380
work for?

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:43.634
Does anyone know
the answer to this?

00:30:43.634 --> 00:30:44.134
Yes?

00:30:44.134 --> 00:30:45.009
AUDIENCE: It depends.

00:30:45.009 --> 00:30:48.490
If you're talking about the
buyer or seller's agent.

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:50.140
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Right.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.030
Hear what he said?

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.470
Depends on who
you're talking about.

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:55.730
Most people think
that the real estate

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:59.980
agent works for the seller.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.270
Wrong.

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:05.220
The real estate agent
works for whoever is hired.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:10.820
So someone can be a buyer,
and I can work for that buyer.

00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.560
And I'm working for that buyer,
trying to find that buyer

00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:17.050
the best house for
the cheapest price.

00:31:17.050 --> 00:31:21.180
Or I can work for the
seller, and at that point,

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:26.210
I'm helping the seller sell
their home for the most money.

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:29.559
Whoever you work for doesn't
determine who pays you.

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:31.100
That's a little
secret that I'm going

00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:32.550
to tell you that real estate
agents won't tell you.

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:33.050
Yes?

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:35.550
AUDIENCE: My question
is on the seller.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.266
An agent gets paid like
a percentage of the deal.

00:31:38.266 --> 00:31:39.349
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Yes.

00:31:39.349 --> 00:31:42.283
AUDIENCE: So what's the
incentive for the buyer's agent

00:31:42.283 --> 00:31:45.502
to find the cheaper, the lower
price, because their percentage

00:31:45.502 --> 00:31:46.460
would be lower as well.

00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:48.600
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
Good question.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.761
They don't have an incentive.

00:31:50.761 --> 00:31:51.260
Right?

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.340
His question is,
if a real estate

00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.530
agent is paid by
commission, why would they

00:31:56.530 --> 00:32:00.410
help a buyer find
the cheapest house?

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:02.510
Most of the time they won't.

00:32:02.510 --> 00:32:06.490
I would, because I do this
because I like doing this.

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:09.080
But my whole job is, like I
told you from the beginning,

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.820
is to help people achieve
their real estate goals.

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:13.630
Right?

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:16.430
And if your real estate
goal is to get the best

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:19.176
house at the cheapest
price negotiated properly,

00:32:19.176 --> 00:32:20.550
then that's what
I'm going to do.

00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.140
But you're absolutely right.

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.250
Most real estate agents will not
try to find the cheapest house,

00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:28.010
because they know that
the more expensive

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.100
they help you buy
this house for,

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.720
the bigger their
commission will be.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:33.620
Absolutely.

00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:34.330
OK?

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:39.155
So the person, the one
who hired agent, yes?

00:32:39.155 --> 00:32:41.280
AUDIENCE: So just a follow-up
to that question too,

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.460
so what's the
incentive for me then,

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.284
as a buyer, when I see
a property listing.

00:32:47.284 --> 00:32:49.200
Why don't I just go
directly to that property,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.909
go to that real estate
agent and say, we

00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:52.200
have two ways we could do this.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.805
I can bring in my
real estate agent

00:32:53.805 --> 00:32:55.410
and you can half
your commission,

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:57.898
or I can work with you,
and you can get double

00:32:57.898 --> 00:32:59.280
what you're going to get.

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.640
Why don't we play nice?

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.690
Like, do people do that?

00:33:01.690 --> 00:33:03.065
TRISHA OCONA
FRANCIS: We're going

00:33:03.065 --> 00:33:04.640
to go right into that right now.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.350
The seller's agent.

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.700
When you go into these
real estate websites,

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:12.950
and you see these houses for
sale, and you click that house,

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.530
and you call up that real
estate agent, guess what?

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:19.440
That real estate agent is
working for the seller.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:23.060
So that term that the police
says, anything you say or do

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.730
can and will be
held against you,

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.950
is exactly what's happening.

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:30.310
Any single thing you
tell that agent who

00:33:30.310 --> 00:33:34.080
is working for that seller,
they will use against you.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:39.310
So you tell them you
just won the lotto.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.140
What you think
they're going to do?

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:45.030
They're going to tell the
seller, you won the lotto.

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:50.760
You tell them that you
are approved for $500,000.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:57.020
This house that you
want is $450,000.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.800
You put in the
offer for $420,000.

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.760
They're going to
tell the seller,

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.140
he's approved for $500,000.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.720
He can come up.

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.920
They're not working for you.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:11.850
They're working
for their seller.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:15.070
Now a buyer's agent.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:18.120
So just to go back,
what are they doing?

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.560
When you're working
for the seller,

00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.420
you're helping that
seller market their house,

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:26.550
show their house, find
a qualified buyer,

00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:29.460
approve the buyers, right?

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:31.389
That's what you're trying to do.

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:36.000
Where are you
working for a buyer,

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.830
we're helping you
shop for a house,

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.690
you may find houses you
like and send to the agent.

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:43.020
The agent is going to
research that house.

00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:46.030
The agent is going to find out
any secrets about that house.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.199
What if the house
is in foreclosure?

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.480
What if the asking
price of that house

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:56.909
is $799,000, but that person
is in foreclosure for $500,000

00:34:56.909 --> 00:35:00.150
and needs to be
out in two months?

00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:02.830
Do you need to offer $799,000?

00:35:02.830 --> 00:35:03.890
No.

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:06.040
That's what their real
estate agent's going to do.

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:08.710
I showed a house last year.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:12.562
The real estate agent who works
for the seller never showed up.

00:35:12.562 --> 00:35:15.780
I came with my client,
who were the buyers.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:20.350
When I opened the door, the
old woman, very sweet and nice,

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:22.210
her husband was
sitting on the sofa.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:24.210
What do you think she
told me the whole way?

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.140
My knees, my knees, my knees.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:28.100
I can't go up these
stairs any more.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:29.027
You like the house?

00:35:29.027 --> 00:35:30.110
You want to buy the house?

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:31.700
How much you want to
buy the house for?

00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:32.616
Can you buy the house?

00:35:32.616 --> 00:35:34.580
Please buy the house.

00:35:34.580 --> 00:35:38.190
I turned to my clients and said,
we can offer whatever you want.

00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:40.230
They gotta go.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:44.000
Because I was working
for my buyer, right?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.880
Because they were telling
all the information.

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:49.300
And that's why, when you
have somebody working

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.060
for the seller, and you have
somebody working for the buyer,

00:35:52.060 --> 00:35:53.800
it's almost like two lawyers.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.970
Listen, I tell my client,
don't say a thing.

00:35:57.970 --> 00:35:59.230
Let me talk.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:02.980
I was showing a house, a condo,
the other day, and the agent

00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.520
asked my client,
so what do you do?

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.275
I said, talk to me.

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:13.310
And then he says, yeah, so
the bathroom is up there,

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:14.850
he says, could you
please tell your client

00:36:14.850 --> 00:36:16.100
that the bathroom is
up-- like, you know,

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.724
he made a joke about
it the whole time.

00:36:17.724 --> 00:36:20.220
But listen, I'm very
serious about that.

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:21.180
Talk to me.

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.370
Because anything you
say will be used--

00:36:23.370 --> 00:36:25.370
and a lot of real estate
agents don't know that.

00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:28.350
Because, matter of fact, when
we're walking into the condo,

00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:31.870
he collected his client--
the seller, I guess,

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:34.450
doesn't live there anymore--
and he collected the mail.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:37.430
And he said, oh man, my
client got to go to court.

00:36:37.430 --> 00:36:41.151
And we're looking at him like,
your client got to go to court?

00:36:41.151 --> 00:36:41.650
Great.

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:43.316
You just gave me a
piece of information.

00:36:43.316 --> 00:36:45.709
Now I have to research
it and find out why

00:36:45.709 --> 00:36:47.000
your client has to go to court.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.530
And maybe now I don't
have to offer you

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:50.940
what you are asking because
your client has to go to court.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:51.440
Yes?

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.190
AUDIENCE: I don't know if you're
going to get into this later,

00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.940
but like for properties that
are like going into foreclosure,

00:36:55.940 --> 00:36:57.601
like what is the
process for that?

00:36:57.601 --> 00:36:59.350
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
I have it at the end

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:01.150
if we have extra time.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:02.750
But I kept it as a backup.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.470
Yes?

00:37:03.470 --> 00:37:06.800
AUDIENCE: Is it a good
idea to get pre-approvals

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.464
at multiple price points, then?

00:37:09.464 --> 00:37:10.880
TRISHA OCONA
FRANCIS: Pre approval

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.120
at multiple price points.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.940
You should get a pre-approval
at what you could afford.

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:16.700
Because I've seen
loan officers do that.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:18.850
How much do you
want the loan for?

00:37:18.850 --> 00:37:20.200
How much you want the loan for?

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.590
How much can they afford?

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:26.020
So do it at what-- now
if they approve you

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:29.710
for $800,000, that doesn't
mean you could go to $800,000.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.460
I'm going to get to
that in a few minutes.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.280
Go at what you feel
you can afford.

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:35.440
You had a question.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.399
Yes?

00:37:36.399 --> 00:37:38.894
AUDIENCE: So there's a bit
of physical game there.

00:37:38.894 --> 00:37:41.727
Let's say I come in
with an all cash offer.

00:37:41.727 --> 00:37:44.226
That's something ideally I'd
want to disclose to the seller.

00:37:44.226 --> 00:37:46.681
Because they know they can trust
I'm not going to, you know,

00:37:46.681 --> 00:37:47.222
fail on that.

00:37:47.222 --> 00:37:51.490
But at the same time, it's kind
of telling them something too.

00:37:51.490 --> 00:37:54.300
How do you balance, you
know, showing yourself

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:58.256
as a worthy-- somebody who
can afford to actually go

00:37:58.256 --> 00:38:02.030
through with the purchase--
yet without saying, you know,

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:07.790
about-- without disclosing that
there's little, how can I say?

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:09.174
That you've got
a limited budget.

00:38:09.174 --> 00:38:11.340
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: One,
you need a representative

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:12.720
to do that for you.

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.820
Because the other agents know
how to pick-- like I know,

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:18.580
depending on what side, like
I can work on either side.

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:20.320
I can work on the
seller's side, or I

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.025
can work on the buyer's side.

00:38:21.025 --> 00:38:22.733
And depending on the
side I'm working on,

00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:25.012
I know how to pick
and ask the questions.

00:38:25.012 --> 00:38:26.970
AUDIENCE: How would you
present that situation?

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:30.120
Do you say, I've got a buyer,
and he's got an all cash offer.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.840
The seller is like, OK,
this is awesome, right?

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:35.502
But then that also tells
them that you might be--

00:38:35.502 --> 00:38:36.710
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Loaded?

00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:39.044
AUDIENCE: --able to bid higher
than you otherwise would.

00:38:39.044 --> 00:38:40.418
TRISHA OCONA
FRANCIS: Not really,

00:38:40.418 --> 00:38:41.960
because-- this is what I do.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:46.200
If my client has a pre-approval,
or a bank statement--

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.440
I had a client that had a
bank statement of $22 million

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.680
on the statement.

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.440
I'm not going to send
them over the $22 million.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.210
We got a statement
that shows less money.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:38:59.860
So they don't really
see how much money

00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.660
you're really working with.

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:03.460
So this is my offer,
and then, also

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:05.410
justify why you're
giving this offer.

00:39:05.410 --> 00:39:08.030
So the house may
be asking $900,000,

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:09.447
but you're only
offering $800,000.

00:39:09.447 --> 00:39:11.363
And you're saying, well,
I'm offering $800,000

00:39:11.363 --> 00:39:12.640
because I'm giving all cash.

00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.026
All I need is a clear title.

00:39:14.026 --> 00:39:16.650
I can close in 30 days, so that
should be an incentive for you.

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.210
You don't have to wait for
someone who may not qualify.

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.877
And two, listen, I need
to change the boiler.

00:39:21.877 --> 00:39:22.960
I need to change the roof.

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:25.190
These are the reasons
why I'm offering less.

00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:26.400
So you have to justify.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.940
Now, once again, I said
you need a representative.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:32.211
Because the representative
knows how to talk to the person.

00:39:32.211 --> 00:39:32.710
Right?

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:35.710
So this woman who came and
said her knees, her knees.

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.670
If her representative
was there--

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:40.970
if I was representing
her, I would have said,

00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:43.120
Mr. and Mrs. Jones,
please sit your butt down,

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:44.630
don't say a word.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.010
Just sit still.

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:46.750
Right?

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:48.460
But they didn't do that.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:52.750
So now I saw what was wrong,
and I was able to use that.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.680
Or, if I go show a house, and
the real estate agent's not

00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:00.169
there, right, they just
say whatever they want.

00:40:00.169 --> 00:40:01.960
Sometimes I'll go up
to another real estate

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.209
agent who I can tell doesn't
have that much knowledge,

00:40:04.209 --> 00:40:06.650
and say, how much
will the owners take?

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:09.710
So the house is asking
$500,000, and you just

00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:11.180
say, how much will
the owners take?

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.530
And they'll say, well, the
owners will take $450,000.

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:16.427
And I'm like, who
do you work for?

00:40:16.427 --> 00:40:18.760
You're supposed to be getting
the owners the most money.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.860
Why do they do that?

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.910
Because they're looking
for a quick, fast deal.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:25.360
The correct answer to say is,
the owner will take $500,000.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.670
Put in an offer.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.170
Right?

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.760
If I'm working for the seller.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.260
OK.

00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:34.090
So you have buyer's
agent, and then you

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.010
have fiduciary responsibilities.

00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.620
So there's an agency
disclosure form

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:40.280
that a real estate
agent is supposed

00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:43.520
to present to you as
soon as they meet you.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:46.290
They're supposed to
present this form to you.

00:40:46.290 --> 00:40:47.400
It's not a contract.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:49.650
It'll say big and
bold, not a contract.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:51.350
It's if you're
renting an apartment,

00:40:51.350 --> 00:40:53.390
or if you're buying
a house, selling,

00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:54.610
and it's a disclosure form.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:56.730
State law says
that you must, they

00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:59.890
must sign it just to prove
that they presented it to you.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.960
Because most people don't
know who works for them.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.090
A lot of times they
think the person they

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:07.750
call-- when they
look online-- is

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:09.170
the person who works for them.

00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:12.150
You may see a real estate
agent, and one Sunday you

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:14.670
see 10 houses with
that real estate agent.

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.280
You talk about children,
you talk about family,

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.890
and then that real
estate agent shows

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:20.856
you one of their listings
with their seller.

00:41:20.856 --> 00:41:22.230
You think the
agent works for you

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:24.063
because you spent the
whole Sunday together,

00:41:24.063 --> 00:41:27.260
when, really, still, that
agent works for the seller.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:30.040
So that disclosure form
completely tells you

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:31.000
who they work for.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.020
So now you know to
keep your mouth zip,

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.670
or get your own
buyer representation.

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:39.480
How do you remember the
fiduciary responsibilities?

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.190
Old car.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:41.090
It spells old car.

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:43.650
This is how I teach it when
I teach it in the college.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:44.860
Obedience.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.570
The person-- and this is for
the seller or the buyer's agent.

00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:49.670
The person that you
hired, a real estate agent

00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:52.280
that you hire, has to
be obedient to you.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.150
Right?

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.250
As long as not
discrimination, they

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:59.160
have to be obedient and
follow, you know, whatever.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.120
If you tell them to put
in an offer for $350,000,

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:04.370
they can't put in an
offer for $355,000.

00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:07.060
They have to, you know,
go with what you say.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:07.740
Loyalty.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.070
They are loyal to you.

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.910
They can't be going
back and forth

00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:13.660
between the buyer
and the seller.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:14.990
Right?

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.890
They owe you all that respect.

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:18.410
Disclosure.

00:42:18.410 --> 00:42:21.500
Anything they know, they've
got to disclose to you.

00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.990
Now, when you buy
a house, if there's

00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:26.420
something wrong with
the house, by law

00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:27.850
they must disclose that to you.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:30.660
They're not allowed to sell
you a lemon without telling you

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.540
it's a lemon.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.960
That must be disclosed
automatically.

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:36.320
But, if I'm working for
a buyer, and I find out

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.140
some good juice
about the seller,

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.040
I'm going to let the buyer know.

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:42.030
That's what they're
supposed to do.

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:44.310
Confidentiality-- some
people don't want.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.270
I had a client a
while ago who did not

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:49.006
want anyone-- a neighbor
was buying the house.

00:42:49.006 --> 00:42:50.630
She didn't want anyone
to know that she

00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:52.100
was buying the house,
because she didn't

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.590
want the people on
the block to know

00:42:53.590 --> 00:42:54.630
that she was buying the house.

00:42:54.630 --> 00:42:56.296
She didn't even want
the tenants to know

00:42:56.296 --> 00:42:57.380
she was buying the house.

00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:00.450
So confidentiality is
very, very important.

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:02.850
You also get a lot of people's
information sometimes.

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:06.290
A loan officer gets your social
security number, your income,

00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:08.750
but I mean, I get a
lot of information.

00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:09.250
Right?

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:13.790
I helped a friend of mine
and his wife buy a house.

00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:18.914
And his wife is pretty famous.

00:43:18.914 --> 00:43:20.830
And I know how much she
makes because I helped

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.770
them buy their house, right?

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:24.930
That's confidentiality.

00:43:24.930 --> 00:43:25.480
Right?

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.230
So my father would
come to me and be like,

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:28.890
so how much was their house?

00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:30.310
I'm like, none of your business.

00:43:30.310 --> 00:43:31.768
Like you know, you
can't tell them,

00:43:31.768 --> 00:43:34.950
because that's
between you and them.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:36.820
Accountability.

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:38.460
People are going
to give you things.

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.845
They're going to give
you maybe some documents.

00:43:40.845 --> 00:43:42.220
You have to make
sure that you're

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.860
accountable for everything,
and that you don't turn around

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:46.284
later and say, oh, I lost that.

00:43:46.284 --> 00:43:47.950
Could you send that
to me again, please?

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:49.450
You want to make
sure you have that.

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:51.812
And reasonable care means
that the real estate

00:43:51.812 --> 00:43:53.520
agent knows what
they're doing, that they

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.620
understand real estate.

00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:56.540
I always, when I
teach, I always tell

00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:01.400
my students, a lot of
people teach to pass a test.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.810
I teach you to teach
you real estate.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:06.580
So it's very important that the
real estate agent you work with

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:09.130
understands the
dynamics of real estate.

00:44:09.130 --> 00:44:11.630
So they can tell whether--
we're not roofers,

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:14.510
we're not plumbers, but they
can tell that there's a leak.

00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:16.970
Hey, you need to have
roofer check that out.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:19.692
Or that's signs of termites.

00:44:19.692 --> 00:44:21.400
You need to have, you
know, somebody look

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.161
at these termites.

00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:24.660
That's what someone is supposed
to be doing as a real estate

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.230
agent.

00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.860
OK?

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:29.480
Also, back to the
worksheet that you have.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:33.480
Now, you went and got
qualified for a loan, right?

00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:35.470
This is to answer your question.

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:39.410
They qualify you for $800,000.

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:43.530
That comes to $5 grand a month.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.710
Am I comfortable
with that number?

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:49.230
Just because a
bank says that you

00:44:49.230 --> 00:44:52.180
are qualified for a
certain loan does not

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:55.330
mean you have to max it out.

00:44:55.330 --> 00:44:58.250
After you do this,
when my clients come

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.860
to me with a pre-approval
from the bank,

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.840
I tell them to sit down and
do a personal budget now.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.210
Look at your income.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:07.880
Look at your expenses.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:10.530
And figure out
now, personally, do

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:13.070
you think you can
cover $5 grand a month?

00:45:13.070 --> 00:45:15.740
And if you think you can't,
then bring it down to the number

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:16.689
that you can.

00:45:16.689 --> 00:45:18.230
Because they loan
you all this money,

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:22.020
it's like you get a
credit card for $30,000.

00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:24.570
You don't have to use that
credit card for $30,000.

00:45:24.570 --> 00:45:26.540
Use what you want.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:29.120
Location.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.280
By law, real estate agents
cannot put you into an area.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.700
You have to decide what
neighborhood you want to go to.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:39.870
So you need to sit down and
figure out what location

00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:41.590
you want to live in.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:44.720
Maybe where you live now, maybe
where you know friends are.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.700
Drive around, ride around,
walk around and figure out

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.580
what neighborhood it is
that you want to go to.

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.880
How many units?

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.640
Do you-- yes?

00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:54.622
A question.

00:45:54.622 --> 00:45:58.059
AUDIENCE: From what I hear,
being in a good school

00:45:58.059 --> 00:46:01.005
district increases the
price of the property

00:46:01.005 --> 00:46:02.478
quite significantly.

00:46:02.478 --> 00:46:04.442
I just want to know
your thoughts on those.

00:46:04.442 --> 00:46:08.420
And is it a big difference
between, let's say,

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:10.420
Manhattan and
Brooklyn and Jersey?

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:13.276
Or like what would be some
recommendations about that?

00:46:13.276 --> 00:46:14.650
TRISHA OCONA
FRANCIS: Absolutely.

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:18.337
You have-- if it's a good
school, a good school

00:46:18.337 --> 00:46:20.170
district, yeah, the
value is going to go up.

00:46:20.170 --> 00:46:22.750
I sold a home
where everyone that

00:46:22.750 --> 00:46:25.910
came to see that home, their
whole purpose for buying

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:28.199
that home, was because
of the school district.

00:46:28.199 --> 00:46:30.490
Because they couldn't get
their children to that school

00:46:30.490 --> 00:46:32.240
unless they lived in
that neighborhood.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.700
And that raised the value.

00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:36.760
So absolutely, that's
something that a lot of people,

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:40.200
if you're planning on
planning on having children,

00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.860
even if you just want a
good value, a good resale

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:45.380
value in a house, that may be
something you want to look at.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:47.785
AUDIENCE: Are there any other
points for a good resale value?

00:46:47.785 --> 00:46:49.520
I'm just trying to
think, you know what--

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.228
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
A good resale value

00:46:51.228 --> 00:46:55.860
are-- anything-- I study
real estate every single day.

00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:59.270
So I look at the Department
of City Planning with Zoning.

00:46:59.270 --> 00:47:02.520
I look at what the
mayor is doing, right?

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:05.610
What neighborhoods
are they revitalizing?

00:47:05.610 --> 00:47:06.530
What's coming up?

00:47:06.530 --> 00:47:08.238
Obviously, you know,
in Brooklyn you have

00:47:08.238 --> 00:47:09.540
the Barclay Center coming up.

00:47:09.540 --> 00:47:11.850
You have the 7
train in Manhattan.

00:47:11.850 --> 00:47:13.810
So these are things
you need to look at.

00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:14.930
Where are they rezoning?

00:47:14.930 --> 00:47:16.777
Where are they building
shopping malls?

00:47:16.777 --> 00:47:18.985
These are things that you
have to look at and decide,

00:47:18.985 --> 00:47:22.777
you know, that's going to
be another hot spot of where

00:47:22.777 --> 00:47:23.610
people want to live.

00:47:23.610 --> 00:47:26.140
People want to live near
the train station, right?

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:27.980
People want to live
near the attractions.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:30.405
So that's where you
have to look at.

00:47:30.405 --> 00:47:31.780
ABBY ONTODD: You
have a question.

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.370
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Yes?

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:34.245
AUDIENCE: So are you
going to talk about some

00:47:34.245 --> 00:47:35.540
of like the New York specific--

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.240
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Locations?

00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:38.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah because we've
got like nine minutes left.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:39.010
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:39.510
OK.

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:42.253
AUDIENCE: So it's like, you
know, I look at the taxes,

00:47:42.253 --> 00:47:44.086
and things like that
are different for like,

00:47:44.086 --> 00:47:45.840
I don't know, four story
buildings versus, you know,

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:47.393
there's like all
these crazy things.

00:47:47.393 --> 00:47:49.760
I just moved to New York.

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:54.505
What are the New York things
that like you gotta know about.

00:47:54.505 --> 00:47:56.630
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Be
a little bit more specific

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:57.330
in your question.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:57.955
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:57.955 --> 00:47:59.346
Like taxes, property taxes.

00:47:59.346 --> 00:48:01.470
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: How
to find out property tax?

00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:02.514
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean,
there's like a whole bunch

00:48:02.514 --> 00:48:03.638
of crazy things like that--

00:48:03.638 --> 00:48:05.000
AUDIENCE: Tax abatement.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.720
AUDIENCE: Condos versus co-ops.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.460
TRISHA OCONA
FRANCIS: Ooh, you're

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:11.280
going into a whole course.

00:48:11.280 --> 00:48:13.510
This course is-- my
courses are very--

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:18.560
I try to bring all this
course into one hour.

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:21.920
Co-ops and condos, you
know, condos, you own it.

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.280
Co-ops, you don't own it.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.220
You own a share in a
building, but your maintenance

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:29.040
is more money in a co-op,
because your maintenance

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.980
is going towards
the underwriting

00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:34.600
mortgage over the building.

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.220
Property tax, you know, you can
go to the Department of Finance

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:42.520
to find out property
tax on any property.

00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:45.680
As far as abatements go, a
lot of the new developments

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:47.180
are giving
incentives, so they do

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:50.760
have tax abatements
that are great

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:52.560
that you can take advantage of.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.690
It also depends on
the neighborhood.

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:56.800
I just spoke about
revitalization.

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.110
So the city is giving
a lot of developers

00:48:59.110 --> 00:49:01.160
in certain
neighborhoods incentives

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.990
in order to revitalize
those neighborhoods.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:05.650
So it all depends.

00:49:05.650 --> 00:49:07.530
I'm going to just go real quick.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:08.310
I put my contact.

00:49:08.310 --> 00:49:12.840
You could always email me if you
have any question further, OK?

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.410
Also any features that you
have on the home that you're

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.190
looking for.

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:19.240
Once you found
your home, you have

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.670
to make sure that you or
the real estate professional

00:49:21.670 --> 00:49:24.230
and your attorney that
you have-- now an attorney

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.310
is not enough.

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:28.220
Because an attorney all
they do is-- you know,

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:30.790
they do a lot of work, right?

00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:33.410
But they never see the house.

00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:35.300
They don't know what
you're interested in.

00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:38.010
So you do need someone
to help you research.

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:40.679
You contact their attorney
once you've found a house.

00:49:40.679 --> 00:49:42.720
And they're going to work
with the other attorney

00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.560
to put the legal
language together.

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.400
But what you need to do
is get the research done.

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.590
Find out what's going
on with that house.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:50.230
Right?

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:53.590
Find out if there was any
fires ever in that house.

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:55.770
Find out if the house
is for foreclosure.

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:58.700
Find out if there's any liens
or judgments on that house.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.250
Very important, Right?

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.060
Then you put in the offer.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.820
Once you put in
the offer, you have

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.360
to worry about negotiation.

00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.050
Be careful with negotiating by
yourself, because once again,

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:10.349
if they know stuff
about you, then

00:50:10.349 --> 00:50:11.640
they're not going to negotiate.

00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:14.223
You're not going to-- it's going
to be very tough negotiating.

00:50:14.223 --> 00:50:17.840
But if you have this wall
up with a representative,

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:22.610
then it'll be harder for them to
know what cards you're playing.

00:50:22.610 --> 00:50:25.710
Then you have the contract
which goes with the attorney,

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:28.880
and then you have closing.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.980
And once again, this is
just the real estate process

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:34.680
that we just spoke about.

00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.440
Right?

00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:37.060
After you find the
home, you're going

00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:38.840
to want to do an
inspection on the home.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.560
An inspection is
basically like a checkup.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:45.130
An inspection should be done
every 15 years on a property

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:45.690
anyway.

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:47.210
The same way you
go to the doctor

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.160
and you get a
checkup every year,

00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.410
is the same way an
inspection will tell you

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:53.080
what's wrong with this house.

00:50:53.080 --> 00:50:55.705
So you know what you're getting
into and making sure you're not

00:50:55.705 --> 00:50:58.079
buying a house that's going
to collapse the day after you

00:50:58.079 --> 00:50:58.750
close.

00:50:58.750 --> 00:51:01.820
An appraisal, the bank
will use an appraisal

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.240
to determine what's the
real value of a home.

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:06.990
Somebody can put a house on
the market for $10 million.

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:10.090
They're allowed to ask
whatever they want.

00:51:10.090 --> 00:51:12.110
The appraisal is going
to say, whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:51:12.110 --> 00:51:15.260
that house is only
worth $2 million.

00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:19.100
So an or appraisal
will always be done.

00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:22.590
A title search-- your attorney
will pull a title search

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:25.500
to make sure that that person
really owns that house.

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:27.800
Believe it or not,
there's a lot of people

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:30.860
who try to sell houses
in New York City who

00:51:30.860 --> 00:51:32.830
don't own their houses.

00:51:32.830 --> 00:51:33.952
Right?

00:51:33.952 --> 00:51:34.910
I mean, it's very easy.

00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:37.300
They forge deeds, or
they didn't know they

00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.680
don't own that house anymore.

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.650
That's also going
to make sure there's

00:51:39.650 --> 00:51:41.110
no judgments on that house.

00:51:41.110 --> 00:51:44.250
You don't want to buy a house
that has a whole bunch of liens

00:51:44.250 --> 00:51:46.500
and judgments because then
you can inherit those liens

00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.410
and judgments.

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:49.120
So that's very important.

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.560
And then underwriting.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.130
Your bank is going to take
your tax returns, your pay

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.720
stubs, the title
search, the appraisal,

00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:59.750
they are going to take
everything, and say, hmm,

00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:02.830
yes, I will give
money on this house.

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:04.130
Absolutely.

00:52:04.130 --> 00:52:07.410
And then you have the closing.

00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:11.450
So this is who I am.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.210
This is what I do.

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:17.780
Like I said, my goal is
to help people achieve

00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:20.660
their real estate goals,
turning renters into homeowners,

00:52:20.660 --> 00:52:22.152
homeowners into investors.

00:52:22.152 --> 00:52:24.360
And if you have any questions,
I know the time is up.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.070
I thank you.

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:27.740
I thank Google.

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:29.980
I thank Terrence [? Coltney ?].

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:32.910
I thank [? Evian. ?] And if
there's any, any questions,

00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:34.642
I'm here to answer.

00:52:34.642 --> 00:52:40.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:40.330 --> 00:52:42.330
AUDIENCE: There is something
in the appendix you

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:44.066
said someone had a question on.

00:52:44.066 --> 00:52:45.070
Can you clear that up?

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:45.580
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS: Anyone?

00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:46.040
Question?

00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:46.998
AUDIENCE: Foreclosures.

00:52:46.998 --> 00:52:48.400
I think about foreclosures.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.340
TRISHA OCONA FRANCIS:
Oh, foreclosures.

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:49.840
OK.

00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:57.410
So what is-- see?

00:52:57.410 --> 00:52:58.150
I came prepared.

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:00.806
I had right behind it,
what is a foreclosure?

00:53:00.806 --> 00:53:02.680
Now, a lot of people
always ask the question,

00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:04.370
what is a foreclosure?

00:53:04.370 --> 00:53:07.580
People always think, oh, I
can just buy someone's house

00:53:07.580 --> 00:53:09.110
who's in foreclosure.

00:53:09.110 --> 00:53:13.800
If someone has not
foreclosed on that home,

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:17.290
then they still own that home.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:20.760
That home does not-- you cannot
go and take someone's home

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.080
if that person still
owns their home.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:23.850
OK?

00:53:23.850 --> 00:53:27.010
They had to have
lost it in auction.

00:53:27.010 --> 00:53:30.700
Now people can sell it if
they feel they're behind,

00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.130
and they want to get out of
it before they foreclose.

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:37.810
But until they foreclose
on it, they still own it.

00:53:37.810 --> 00:53:38.420
OK?

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:40.290
Because there's
a big difference.

00:53:40.290 --> 00:53:43.800
Pre-foreclosure--
your mortgage is

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:46.080
due on the first of the month.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.850
The bank gives you
five days grace period.

00:53:48.850 --> 00:53:54.180
By the 16th day, after the 15th
day, you are considered late.

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.370
You get a blemish on
your credit report

00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:59.990
because you're one month
behind-- 30 days behind.

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:04.280
If you fall four to
five months behind,

00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:07.980
the bank files something
called a "lis pendens."

00:54:07.980 --> 00:54:10.320
A lis pendens is public record.

00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.180
You can go to the
courthouse and see everyone

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:15.580
who's listed as a lis pendens.

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:19.610
These are people who
are facing foreclosure.

00:54:19.610 --> 00:54:21.460
In New York City,
there's-- I mean,

00:54:21.460 --> 00:54:24.270
this is happening all across
the country-- but like I said,

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:28.120
there are 30,000 people facing
foreclosure in New York City.

00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:32.660
So it's so much a
backlog that some people

00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:36.920
are in pre-foreclosure
for over five years, which

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:42.450
means they have not paid
their mortgage in five years.

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:47.170
Once that bank files that lis
pendens, more than likely,

00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:49.890
they're not taking
your money anymore.

00:54:49.890 --> 00:54:51.550
You try to send
in, like let's say

00:54:51.550 --> 00:54:55.140
you owe $20,000 for the
five months, you send it,

00:54:55.140 --> 00:54:57.260
they're going to send
that money right back.

00:54:57.260 --> 00:55:00.560
Because now they
want all their money.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:02.030
OK?

00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:06.730
So there's a big difference
between foreclosure

00:55:06.730 --> 00:55:09.690
and pre-foreclosure.

00:55:09.690 --> 00:55:12.010
So what is actually foreclosure?

00:55:12.010 --> 00:55:16.180
Foreclosure means you
lost it at auction.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.550
The time passed,
and the bank finally

00:55:19.550 --> 00:55:23.480
got the OK from the
courthouse to foreclose.

00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:29.660
Now every state, all 50 states,
have judicial foreclosure.

00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:33.410
Judicial foreclosure means if
someone is facing foreclosure--

00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:38.090
in pre-foreclosure-- the bank,
in order to get that home,

00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:43.800
they have to go to the court
and follow rules and steps

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.860
to get your home from you.

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:51.620
To take a step back, when you
get a loan, you get a mortgage.

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:55.030
A lot of people say, I'm
going to go get a mortgage.

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:56.650
You don't get a mortgage.

00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:58.790
You give a mortgage.

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:00.300
What is a mortgage?

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.040
A mortgage is a promise--
it's collateral--

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:04.670
it's a promise to pay.

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:08.870
You're basically telling the
bank, you loan me this money,

00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:11.180
and I'm going to sign
this piece of paper

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:15.560
that if I default on this loan,
you can have my house back.

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:17.960
You can have my house.

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:23.960
So within New York State,
there's judicial foreclosure.

00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:28.940
Now, remember I said every
state has judicial foreclosure.

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:30.130
Oh.

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:31.610
OK.

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:34.690
No, he's saying I got to stop.

00:56:34.690 --> 00:56:35.190
Oh.

00:56:37.790 --> 00:56:39.640
I could just wrap
it up real quick?

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.290
OK.

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:43.440
Every state have
judicial foreclosure.

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:46.620
Some states have a
non-judicial foreclosure.

00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.280
Non-judicial
foreclosure, New York

00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.220
is not a non-judicial
foreclosure.

00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:53.510
Judicial means that
in order for a bank

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:55.780
to take your home, if
you're in pre-foreclosure,

00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.010
they have to go through
the court system.

00:56:58.010 --> 00:57:00.620
Non-judicial means they
can just send you a letter

00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.830
and says, give me back my house.

00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:06.640
Foreclosure means that
the time has passed,

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:09.000
the bank has granted
them permission

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.940
to take your home from you.

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:12.730
OK?

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:15.710
Foreclosures don't look
like foreclosures anymore.

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:17.360
You know, before,
foreclosures used

00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:19.040
to look like abandoned houses.

00:57:19.040 --> 00:57:22.230
With 30,000 homes in
foreclosure in New York City,

00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:24.680
foreclosures don't
look like that anymore.

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.460
They look like regular homes.

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:29.100
You never know what
a foreclosure is.

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:30.810
And the scariest part
is, a lot of people

00:57:30.810 --> 00:57:34.290
are renting and paying
rent to homeowners,

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:36.330
and that home's in foreclosure.

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:37.330
I've seen a lot of that.

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:38.900
I've seen a lot
of people, they're

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.450
paying their rent every month
to their landlord, have no idea

00:57:42.450 --> 00:57:44.340
that their home
is in foreclosure.

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.130
Matter of fact, this woman
told me the other day,

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:50.090
when I was doing another
speech somewhere else, that it

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:52.590
was happened to be her day off.

00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:54.600
And she saw the marshal there.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:56.930
And the marshal asked
her for an address.

00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:59.290
And she said, wait a
minute, that's my address.

00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:01.950
The marshal came to evict her.

00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:03.550
And she said, I
didn't know about it.

00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:05.590
The landlord was
removing-- and by law, they

00:58:05.590 --> 00:58:07.440
have to put the
notices on the door--

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:11.480
the landlord was removing the
notices while she was at work.

00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:13.110
So if she didn't
have that day off,

00:58:13.110 --> 00:58:15.120
that home would have
been foreclosed on.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:18.890
So I just want to
wrap it up real quick.

00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:22.222
Just, you know, I do do a
whole course on foreclosures.

00:58:22.222 --> 00:58:23.930
So if, you know, I
ever come back, then I

00:58:23.930 --> 00:58:26.700
could do the whole, it's a
whole full course understanding,

00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:28.080
how did this happen?

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:28.930
How can we fix it?

00:58:28.930 --> 00:58:30.370
How can you invest in it?

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:32.460
Where to find the foreclosures?

00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:35.680
You know, how to evaluate
the distressed property.

00:58:35.680 --> 00:58:36.770
But once again, thank you.

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:37.960
I know we're out of time.

00:58:37.960 --> 00:58:39.550
My contact is here.

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:42.950
You can e-mail me, call me,
and if I ever come back,

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:45.030
I'll be happy to do that course.

00:58:45.030 --> 00:58:47.130
Thank you.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:49.071
Thank you.
