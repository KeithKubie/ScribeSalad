00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.670
Tell us a little bit more about the DNA

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:05.030
extraction step. What actually happen? You get the, the

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.800
DNA or the saliva sample in the lab. What, what do you do to get the DNA out?

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.380
&gt;&gt; So DNA extraction is very, you know, normal thing that

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.300
happens in labs all over the world. There's nothing special about who

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.740
we, how we do our DNA extraction. But the process is

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.150
really. Trying to separate the DNA in the nucleus of the cell,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.600
from the proteins and other components of the

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.140
cell that otherwise would be in the way.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.020
&gt;&gt; I see, and, I mean, how much DNA do

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.760
you get out of the saliva sample that someone sends in?

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.620
It's actually varying variable. And depending on the person, we can

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.110
get anywhere from 10 micrograms to over 100 micrograms of DNA.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.530
&gt;&gt; And does most of that variation happen just based on the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.940
number of cells that were in that spit sample, or saliva sample?

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.970
We'd think so, but we actually don't have very good information on that.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.300
We know that some people's saliva is more watery than other people, and we

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.520
know that, for example, infants to do not often give us good data,

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.660
and we think that's partially because of the wateriness of the, of that saliva.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.100
&gt;&gt; Well, for those people who might be

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.580
wondering, you know, what kinds of cells do

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.200
you actually getting in my spit, what, what,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.890
what are the actual cells that, You know,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.940
you're extracting DNA from, when you're looking at my saliva.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.020
&gt;&gt; So in a sense it doesn't matter in that almost all of your cells have

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.300
your genome in there and it's always the same genome. So we don't look at that,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.690
too closely. We know that the major components

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.510
there, are epithelial cells, so the inside of

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.890
your cheek, the skin cells there. And the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.980
and white blood cells are the other major component.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.980
&gt;&gt;

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.050
Now, I, I, I do floss and brush my teeth.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.390
But I know that I'm sure I have some kind of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.570
bacteria or germs in there. Even still is that a

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.270
concern at all, worrying about sort of having other non

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.110
me DNA in my spit sample? Again, it's not something

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.250
we worry about too much. We know that people have

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.950
a lot of bacteria in their mouths, and we know

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.880
that from person to person there's huge variability in the composition

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.259
of those bacteria. But for amplification we're happy

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.210
to amplify up all of your human and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.610
bacterial DNA. And then let the sequencing or

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.640
genotyping process sort out the human from the bacteria.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.220
&gt;&gt; I see. So as long as it's human it's good but does that mean like

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.870
I, you know, I shouldn't go kiss anybody

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.386
right before I, I, I give my DNA sample.

00:02:25.386 --> 00:02:28.000
&gt;&gt; For the 23 Me test we actually

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.050
collect 2 milliliters of saliva from you which

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.520
doesn't sound like a lot but it can take up to five to ten minutes to fill that.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.020
It's a lot of saliva. You would have to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.100
be kissing a lot to make a difference there.
