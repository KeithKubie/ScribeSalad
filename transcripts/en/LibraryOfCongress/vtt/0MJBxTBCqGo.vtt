00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.570
&gt;&gt; Mark Sweeney: Good afternoon.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.240
Welcome to the Library
of Congress.

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.410
I'm Mark Sweeney, the
Principal Deputy Librarian

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.200
and it's my pleasure to
welcome you here today

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.940
to the historic Thomas
Jefferson building

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.590
for this afternoon's panel
discussion, The United States

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.040
and World Legacy of the
Paris Peace Conference.

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.640
It's hosted by the John
W. Kluge Center here

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.940
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.910
On January 18th, 1919, the
Paris Peace Conference opened.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.510
Today, almost 100 years later,
we gather to discuss the legacy

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.760
of a pivotal period
for world history.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920
So the library's
been very involved

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.040
in commemorating the role of the
United States in World War I.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.040
Our exhibition Echoes from the
Great War: America's Experiences

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.370
in World War I, located

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.360
in the galleries just off the
great hall on the second floor,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.960
opened to the public
in April of 2017.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.200
When the library staff began
to develop the expedition,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.040
they recognized that many
Americans had an interest

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.470
in learning more about the
United States during this

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.200
important period in our history.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.800
The number of visitors
witness to that interest.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.600
Since its opening, more

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.890
than 1.25 million visitors
have toured the exhibition.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.620
Echoes of the Great War

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.760
examines the upheaval
of the World War

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.600
as Americans confronted it,
both at home and abroad.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.550
The exhibition considers
the debates and struggles

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.770
that surrounded US engagement,

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.710
explores US military and
home front mobilization

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.750
and the immensity of
industrialized warfare,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.050
and touches on the worst effects

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.000
as an international peace
settlement was negotiated.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.940
National borders were
redrawn and soldiers returned

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.510
and reintegrated into
American society.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.740
Well, with the most
comprehensive collection

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.560
of multi-format World War
I holdings in the nation,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.720
including those materials
that we gathered and preserved

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.840
in the library's
Veterans History Project,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.520
the library uses unique
exhibitions to tell stories

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.120
through words and
images of those both

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.060
in seats of power but as

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.790
well as the lesser-known
participants whose lives were

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.090
shaped by the war.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.020
Featuring newly digitized film
footage, some not seen in more

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.470
than 100 years, Echoes of the
Great War visits a turning

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.190
of the tide in American history.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.490
In addition to the expedition,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.380
papers from President
Woodrow Wilson from his time

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.050
in the White House, also
as a scholar of New Jersey,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.550
have been digitized and are
available from the Library

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.280
of Congress more than 100
years after his presidency.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.630
The Wilson papers, the largest
presidential collection held

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.320
by the library,

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.650
consisting of approximately
280,000 documents and comprising

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.200
about 620,000 images,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.620
the collection reflects
Wilson's innovative efforts

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.340
and accomplishment and
the enduring controversies

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.810
he engendered.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.380
Many of these documents
are featured

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.210
in the library's exhibit.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.590
So if you haven't visited yet,
please take some time to go

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.190
out to the great hall,
to the second floor,

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.950
to see the exhibit
before it closes

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.510
on Monday, January the 21st.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.940
Before we begin,
I especially want

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.340
to thank panelist Michael
Neiberg for serving as

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.750
one of our expert
advisors and consultants

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.060
to the Echoes of the Great War.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.730
Thanks are also due
to Margaret MacMillan

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.740
for her own advisory
contributions

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.070
to this landmark exhibition.

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.580
And now I'd like to invite
Kluge director John Haskell

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.600
to the podium to introduce
our distinguished panel.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.900
John?

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.410
&gt;&gt; John Haskell:
Thank you, Mark.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:23.710
At the Kluge Center,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.820
our in-resident scholars
have been awarded fellowships

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.570
and chairs in competitive
processes to take advantage

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.490
of the library collections in
their work in the humanities

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.120
and the social sciences.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.990
The fundamental aim
of the center is

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.350
to bring relevant scholarship
to the attention of Congress,

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.230
other policymakers, as well
as the interested public

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.690
by a variety of means,
including events like this.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.650
Our panel chair,
Margaret MacMillan

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.040
who is the driving
force behind this event,

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.610
I want to recognize
her as Mark just did.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.350
I also want to thank
the panelists

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:55.660
who haven't been recognized yet,

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:00.250
Harold James and
Charlie Kupchan.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.720
Margaret has been on the Library
Scholars Council since 2012,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.800
and get ready to be impressed.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.120
The council advises the Kluge
Center and the librarian

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.630
of Congress on a range of
issues including nominations

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.690
for Kluge Center chairs
and the Kluge Prize.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.940
We're grateful to Margaret for
all the ways she's been involved

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.240
with the library over
the last seven years.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.990
She's professor of history
at the University of Toronto.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.780
Previously she was the warden of
St. Anthony's College at Oxford.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.410
She is a prolific author.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.770
Her most recent book about
World War I is titled The Road

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.010
to 1914: The War
that Ended Peace.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.070
Among her many honors, she is
a fellow of the Royal Society

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.360
of Literature and a senior
fellow of Massey College

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.300
at the University of Toronto.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.460
She is an honorary
fellow of Trinity College,

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.600
University of Toronto,
and honorary fellow

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.090
of Lady Margaret Hall and
of St. Hilda's College,

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.580
University of Oxford.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.980
She's also a trustee of the
Central European University

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.330
in Budapest, and sits
on the Editorial Board

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.850
of International History
and First World War Studies.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.830
She's also a companion of honor.

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:06.970
She's a trustee of
the Rhodes Trust.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:10.740
In 2006, Professor MacMillan
was invested as an officer

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.500
of the Order of Canada and then
in 2015 became a companion.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.180
Without further ado,
let me turn the event

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:19.620
over to Margaret MacMillan.

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:22.390
The lectern is blocking
some view here,

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.260
so we have a couple folks who
are going to be moving that,

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.020
but don't worry about that.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.320
Thanks, Travis.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.040
If you were going move over
there I think you better not.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.200
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: I'll
wait for the lectern to move.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.460
Well, while you're
moving the lectern,

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.640
let me say thank you very much
for that very nice welcome

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.240
from both the deputy librarian

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:43.620
and the head of the
Kluge Center.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.440
It's a great privilege
and pleasure to be here

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.050
in this very beautiful building,
and it's a great moment I think

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:54.250
to be talking about what
the First World War meant

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.550
for the United States.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.960
We know that it meant a
great deal for the world,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.700
but it also meant
a lot to people

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:01.000
who were involved in that war.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.600
And I think it was a war in
which old orders were destroyed.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.150
Russia had its revolution,
Austria-Hungary disappeared,

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.810
the Ottoman Empire disappeared
shortly after the war ended.

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.920
But it also marked the
arrival of new powers,

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.970
not least among them -- in
fact foremost among them the

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.270
United States.

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:19.900
And I think we'll be
hearing in this panel

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.770
about how the United States
through its participation

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:25.500
in the war, and it was a
controversial participation,

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.550
but what it did was help

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.010
to create the modern
America of today.

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.730
It helped to give the United
States a sense of itself

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.090
and its place in the world.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.960
It also of course left
a legacy of debate

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.260
over whether the
United States should

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.180
or should not have
gone into that war.

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:44.100
But I think you can
see the First World War

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.100
and American involvement
in the making of the peace

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.840
as a very important step
towards the emergence

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.950
of the United States as
a major power and then

00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:54.820
of course a super power
on the world stage.

00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.240
And I think we're very lucky
on this panel to have people

00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.430
who have been thinking
about these issues

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.190
for a great many years
and writing about them.

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.250
We're going to each talk
for about ten minutes,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.130
and then we'll have a few
comments among ourselves.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:10.810
We may disagree with each other.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.710
This sometimes happens
with academics.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.010
I'm warning you.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.740
And we may agree with each
other which happens more rarely.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.830
And then we'll throw
it open for questions

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.230
and comments from the floor.

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:24.930
We're going to go in
the following order,

00:08:24.930 --> 00:08:27.800
and I won't give long
introduction to the panelists,

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.100
although they deserve it,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.520
because you have I think
before you the program.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.820
And I think it's more important

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.120
that they get the
chance to speak.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.150
But the first speaker will be
Michael Neiberg who's going

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:40.990
to talk about World War I and
the creation of the US identity.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.890
Michael, among many other
things, is the inaugural chair

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:46.240
in war studies at
the Army War College.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.540
He's been thinking and writing

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.780
about the First World
War for a long time.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.670
I first encountered him through
one of his books called Dance

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:56.140
of the Furies: Europe and
the Outbreak of War in 1914,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.820
which is a wonderful look
at that world that was

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.750
about to be destroyed.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.920
And one of his latest works,
I think his last book,

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.470
is The Path to War: How
the First World War Created

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.250
Modern America.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:11.590
Harold James, who's then
going to speak, is professor

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.570
of history at Princeton
University as well

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:16.750
as in the University's
Woodrow Wilson School of Public

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:18.840
and International Affairs.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.930
He writes international history
with a particular interest

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.940
in the financial
international history.

00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.070
And his scale is extraordinary.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.370
He goes from the Roman
Empire to the present.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.280
He wrote a book on Weimer
Germany, he wrote a book

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.790
on the European monetary union.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:37.080
And in 2001 he wrote a book

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.180
that unfortunately was rather
prescient called The End

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.200
of Globalization.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.440
His most recent book is The
Euro and the Battle of Ideas.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.300
Charles Kupchan is both
practitioner and a scholar.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.520
He was national security
director

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.520
in President Obama's
administration

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.500
for European affairs.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.620
But he teaches and
writes at Georgetown.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:04.480
His most recent book is No
One's World: The Rising Rest

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:07.010
and the Coming Global Turn.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:08.970
He is a frequent
commentator in the press

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.390
and writes f foreign
affairs quite often.

00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:16.340
In September 2018 he published
an article called Trump's 19th

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.370
Century Grand Strategy.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.050
His current work
is on isolationism.

00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:22.800
You needn't see a
connection there,

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.480
but this is what he's
working on at the moment.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.970
So I'm going to ask Michael
if he would start by talking.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:31.780
And then I'm going to follow
him and then I'm going to talk

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.530
about the United States and
the making of the peace,

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.890
and then Harold James
and then Charles Kupchan.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.190
So Michael?

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.490
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: Thank you.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:39.790
Thank you, Margaret.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:41.090
Thank you to everybody for
taking up part of your day

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.390
to come here on what
is a beautiful,

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:43.690
beautiful day here in DC.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:45.740
I don't know how many of you are
fans of the TV show Jeopardy,

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.330
but a couple of days ago there
was a category called Memos.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.030
And the question was,
the memo from Germany,

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.310
the blank check memo
from Germany

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.420
to this country helped
precipitate the outbreak

00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:58.920
of the First World War.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.430
And I'm sitting in my
living room and I'm like,

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.880
"My kids should know this.

00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:03.410
My dog should know
this from living

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.890
with me for so many years."

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.710
Two of the contestants did
not even bother to ring in

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:10.660
and the third responded Russia
which is not only wrong,

00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:13.030
it is galactically wrong.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:18.430
So it was a reminder to me
that obviously we as a society,

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.560
we as a country need to
be talking and thinking

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:24.680
about this event, the First
World War, which I hope

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.880
by the end of today
you will come away --

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.490
even if you know
a lot about it --

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.630
thinking that you need to
know even more about it.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:34.600
A friend of mine says a good
historian makes the familiar

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.940
unfamiliar and the
unfamiliar familiar.

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.100
So I'm hoping we do a
little of both here.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:41.540
But obviously we need to be
doing much more discussion

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.840
and much more dialogue.

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.760
So I'm just delighted
to be on this panel.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.500
I'm thrilled to be here in this
gorgeous building and I want

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.190
to thank everybody from
the Library of Congress

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.620
for the exhibit and the
invitation to be here,

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:54.520
and the chance to be with
my fellow panelists here.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.570
Margaret told me to
stick to about 10 minutes

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.700
which most academics are
very uncomfortable with.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:02.140
So I'm going to see if I can do
a very big topic very quickly.

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.200
I'm going to talk about
America's relationship

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.350
to the world in terms of foreign
policy and in terms not just

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.470
of the American elite who's
making foreign policy,

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:13.110
but in terms of what the
American people themselves are

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.150
debating about what they think
the United States ought to do.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:18.020
And in the book that
Margaret mentioned,

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.110
I talk about America's
relationship

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.040
with the First World War of
being kind of an hourglass.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:27.420
And the metaphor that I'm using
is that in 1914 it's very wide

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.340
with a lot of different
viewpoints among Americans,

00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:33.480
many of which are beautifully
displayed in the exhibit here.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:36.680
I argue in the book that by
the time you get to April 1917,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.590
there's very little debate
among Americans about whether

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.840
or not entry into the
war is the right thing.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.500
They may not like it, they
may be upset about it.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.810
They may be opposed to the
policy that got us to the point

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:51.360
that we were in in 1917.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.990
But there's actually
very little debate

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.370
that the country had tried
everything else; now we're in.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.090
As early as late October 1918 --

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.250
that is even before the
armistice is signed --

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:04.900
you see the hourglass
begin to open up again

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.230
with a wide variety of
viewpoints among Americans

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:10.520
about what this war
ought to be about

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:11.990
and what America's relationship

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:14.180
to the peace process
ought to be.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.880
And it's an oversimplification,
but I only have 10 minutes;

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.710
I would argue the great
American disillusion is not

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.290
with the war itself.

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.770
It is with this process
of peace.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:29.040
It is with the reality that
Americans are beginning to see

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.340
and the people that are

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:33.260
in the Paris Peace Conference
are noting it as early as March

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.970
or April of 1919, that the
world is likely to be worse

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:40.870
on the other end of it than
it was at the beginning.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.360
And William Bullitt
who would later go

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.860
on to be the first
American ambassador

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:46.680
to the Soviet Union left
the Paris Peace Conference

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.920
about midway through
and he wrote a letter

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.380
to his mother I think in which
he said, "I'm going to go lie

00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:55.970
on the sand and watch
the world burn to hell."

00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:59.020
And he's on a little bit of an
extreme, but there are a lot

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.180
of Americans who are
very uncomfortable.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:03.830
Tasker Bliss who was the
American military representative

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:06.850
to President Wilson is writing
letters back to his wife

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.810
that are incredibly
pessimistic about the way

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:11.350
that this process is going.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.360
So what I want to do is cover
a little bit of that debate.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.740
I'm really not going
to talk very much

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:17.910
about Woodrow Wilson at all.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.050
I want to talk about the
people who are advising him,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.960
the people back in the United
States who are observing this.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.320
And since I only
have 10 minutes,

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.500
I want to break the American
people really into two groups.

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:33.800
And what was surprising to
me without getting partisan

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.240
or political was that the 2016
debate about America's role

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.940
in the war sounded at least

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:43.250
to me very much like
the 1919 debate.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.680
And I don't know whether the
candidates involved recognized

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.130
it, but it certainly
struck a chord with me.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.880
So what I want to do here is
talk about those two groups.

00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.900
One group is really
arguing for multilateralism,

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:59.500
which is really an argument for
connecting the United States

00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:03.680
to the world either through
institutions or through trade

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.190
or through some other mechanism,
connecting all the nations

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.630
of the world together
with the underlying theory

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.800
that the more nation-states
were connected to one another,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.240
the more incentive they
would have to cooperate.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.310
And the less incentive they
would have for conflict.

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:20.640
And the argument ran --
it's a very complex argument

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:23.370
but I'm going to boil it down
to ridiculous simplicity.

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:26.770
One was that in order
for markets to work,

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.150
multilateralism had
to be in place.

00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:32.190
In other words, if markets
are going to be global

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.170
as they were before World War I,
and everyone hoped they would be

00:15:35.170 --> 00:15:38.700
after World War I,
multilateralism is the only way

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:40.690
to get those markets
to function.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:45.090
Second, multilateralism was
the best way to get states

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:47.500
to have an incentive
to cooperate,

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.650
either through binding
arbitration

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.190
or through some sense
of collective security.

00:15:52.190 --> 00:15:55.810
The idea here being that even
Germany, even pariah states

00:15:55.810 --> 00:15:58.970
like Germany, could be
brought into this system,

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:01.780
could be incentivized
into the system.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:05.550
And third, that multilateralism
could grow the international pie

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.630
so that the world didn't have
to become a zero sum game.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.930
Competition for markets,

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.540
competition for natural
resources

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:14.610
which had fueled imperialism
wouldn't necessarily have

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.180
to be zero sum anymore.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.220
And again, you don't have
to agree with any of this.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.900
You don't have to like any of
this, but it's a dominant way

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:23.730
of understanding America at
the end of the First World War.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.650
And I think you can clearly
hear echoes of it in the way

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.560
that some Americans
think about their role

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.060
in the United States today.

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.360
And if I have time at the end,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.660
if Margaret doesn't
give me the hook,

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.380
I want to talk a
little bit about the way

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.410
that vision gets implemented at
the end of the Second World War.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:38.740
Because we do it a
little bit differently,

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:40.740
although the fundamental
vision remains.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.880
The second group, and I know
Charles is going to talk

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.950
about them in greater detail,
and he may disagree with some

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:47.400
of what I'm about to
say, but go by the name

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.860
of isolationist in 1919.

00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:53.100
But I think we've somewhat
misunderstood what this group

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.400
stood for.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.950
They are led by Henry
Cabot Lodge

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:57.740
who had an office
right in that building.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.770
And they are led until his death
in 1919 by Theodore Roosevelt

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.800
as well, at least
intellectually.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.160
And they made a lot
of arguments,

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:06.610
a lot of very sophisticated
arguments, but I'm going to boil

00:17:06.610 --> 00:17:08.400
down just three of them.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.160
One is that great power
simply shouldn't play the game

00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.430
by the same rules
that small powers do.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:18.220
And a line that Lodge threw out
that America is not Ecuador,

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.490
that great powers play the
game by different rules.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:24.360
And I was just reading
on the metro down here,

00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:29.010
the United States only submitted
to binding arbitration one time

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:31.130
in its history, just once.

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:32.430
Right, and I used to
joke with my students

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:34.440
that the Army War College
and sometimes still do,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.810
if there's a treaty out there

00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:39.380
that only one nation
hasn't signed, you can count

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:40.680
on it being a super power.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.070
You can count on it being
a great power, right?

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.070
The idea being that
you don't need

00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:47.000
to play by those same rules.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.590
Are you disagreeing
already, Charles?

00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:49.890
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan:
Yeah, you're way off.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.190
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: Am I?

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:52.490
Okay.

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:53.790
[ Laughter ]

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.090
And I'll turn it over
to you in a minute.

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:56.500
The second is a Constitutional
question.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.600
That is, if you join a
multilateral organization,

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.080
as the League of Nations
at least in writing seemed

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.260
to suggest, if the League

00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:07.660
of Nations committed the United
States to use military force

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.340
to resolve a situation,
it was taking a power

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.230
that was the responsibility
of those people

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.670
in that building right there.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:17.250
That in effect it was by
definition unconstitutional,

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.660
that the power to send
American troops overseas,

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.150
the power to raise an
army, those were reserved

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:23.450
to the United States Congress

00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:25.460
and the United States
Congress only.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.760
And third, the argument

00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.140
that I think Theodore
Roosevelt would have made more

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.180
articulately had he not
passed away in early 1919,

00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.680
is that you cannot ask the
global system to function

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.840
in ways it's not
designed to function.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.520
And for people like Theodore
Roosevelt, it was designed

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.800
for nation-states to operate
independently of one another.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.070
It's not really set up for
nation-states to cooperate.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.650
Now to be sure, these
arguments got quite personal,

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:54.110
especially between Woodrow
Wilson and Henry Cabot Lodge

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.710
who despised one another,
and between Wilson

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:59.460
and Theodore Roosevelt
who despised one another.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.760
But I think we also have

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.860
to understand the ideological
differences in the way

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:04.510
that they were seeing the world.

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:05.810
And what I try to do at least

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.500
with my students is say
it's a mistake to think

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.200
of the war producing
an American identity.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.310
And the reason I say
it's a mistake is

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:15.880
because I think it projects
into the past a unanimity

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.610
that simply didn't exist.

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:20.280
There was debate then
as there is debate now

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.310
about the way the United
States is supposed to do this.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.610
Do I have two minutes left?

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:25.910
Or am I already out?

00:19:25.910 --> 00:19:27.210
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
Yeah, you're pretty close.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:28.510
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg:
I'm pretty close.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:29.810
Okay, so let me just very
quickly state that at the end

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:31.920
of the Second World War,
the Americans decided

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.550
to play this game a
little bit differently.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.570
And Harry Truman when he
took the oath of office

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.510
after the death of Roosevelt
did it underneath a portrait

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.550
of Woodrow Wilson for a reason.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.920
He wanted to keep Wilson's
vision of multilateralism

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.100
but the institutions
that he wanted to create

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.720
and many Americans wanted to
create -- the United Nations,

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.820
the World Bank --
would be institutions

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:53.130
that could not harm
the United States.

00:19:53.130 --> 00:19:55.510
The UN especially with
the Security Council vote.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:58.310
So the basic fundamental
idea remains,

00:19:58.310 --> 00:20:02.220
but the way in which you're
going to engage it will change.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.130
I think I'll stop there and
let Charles tell me everything

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:06.430
that I got wrong.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.730
Thanks very much.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.030
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
Thank you.

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:10.330
Thank you.

00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:11.630
Charles?

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:12.930
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan:
I think you're next.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:14.230
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
Oh sorry, I'm next.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.530
Yeah, sorry.

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:16.830
So one of you is going to
have to tell me when I'm going

00:20:16.830 --> 00:20:18.620
on too long, so I'll trust
one of you to do this.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.630
I'm going to look
at just the way

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.300
in which the United
States had changed

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.790
and the way it was
participating in the world

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.120
and what the Paris Peace
Conference meant, the conference

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:29.750
at the end of the
First World War.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:33.660
Even before the war, the United
States had begun that process

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.710
of transforming what
was tremendous economic

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.240
and demographic and
geographical power

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:41.220
into actual military power.

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.600
In 1900 the United States ranked
I think 14th among the world's

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.900
military powers.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.200
It had a very small army.

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.810
It had a very small navy.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.300
Even before 1914
it was beginning

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:53.840
to grow its military power.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.840
Because it's one thing to
be economically powerful

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.080
and occupy a huge and important
landmass, and another thing is

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.670
to actually transform
that into military power.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.370
It was also beginning
to expand territorially,

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:07.660
of course across the United
States itself but also

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.080
in the Pacific, into
the Caribbean.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.950
Theodore Roosevelt as president
instituted a two-ocean navy,

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:16.270
and the United States was
becoming more involved

00:21:16.270 --> 00:21:19.180
in international organizations,
international meetings.

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.030
It went to the Hague
Disarmament Conferences.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.590
It got involved in brokering
the Treaty of Portsmouth

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:26.710
between the Russians
and the Japanese

00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:28.460
after the Russo-Japanese War.

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.550
And so it was not unused
to international affairs

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:34.150
by the time the First
World War started.

00:21:34.150 --> 00:21:37.880
And Woodrow Wilson who
was sitting at the bedside

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:41.290
of his first wife who
was dying did break away

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:44.910
as Europe plunged towards war
to offer his services and that

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:48.160
of the United States
as an arbitrator to try

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.270
and bring some sort of peace
before Europe plunged into war.

00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:53.570
The Americans and Wilson

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.060
of course watched what
was happening in Europe

00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:57.240
with a certain amount
of horror and dismay.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.620
But increasingly, large
numbers of Americans,

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:03.010
and I think this is true of
Wilson himself, became convinced

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:05.520
that the United States
had a duty to try not just

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.070
to bring the war to an end,
but if necessary, to intervene.

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:10.710
And a number of things
contributed to that.

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:12.010
The sinking of the Lusitania

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.980
for example was a moment
American lives were lost

00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.260
and it was a moment in which
American public opinion I think

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.820
began to shift from
neutrality to both sides

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.590
to really hostility to what
they saw not so much as Germany,

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.490
but what they saw as
Prussian militarism.

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:30.430
This became something of
an ideological crusade,

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.520
and then of course the folly
of the German high command

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:38.550
in reinstituting unrestricted
submarine warfare in 1917

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.410
and beginning to sink
American freighters

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.740
and destroy American lives.

00:22:42.740 --> 00:22:45.160
And then offering in
the Zimmerman Telegram

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.550
to Mexico their support

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:49.160
if Mexico would attack
the United States and try

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:52.070
to seize back territory that
the US had taken from Mexico

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.950
in the middle of
the 19th century.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.620
This really was a
decisive shift.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:22:56.950
Woodrow Wilson went to Congress

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:00.300
and got a declaration
of war in April 1917.

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.700
But he was very clear from the
beginning, and I think a lot

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:04.140
of Americans supported this view

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.230
that the United States was
not a power like other powers.

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:08.650
And it's symbolic I think

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.700
that the United States
never became an ally.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.930
It was always an
associate power.

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:15.590
And this was something the
Americans took very seriously.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.900
They were there to try to
bring an end to the war.

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.620
They were not there,
they kept on saying,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:22.060
to gain anything for themselves.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:23.910
Of course they did.

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:27.200
The United States expanded
economically enormously.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.920
It moved into British markets.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.760
By the end of the war it was
a much greater power both

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.890
in military terms but
also in economic terms

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:37.200
than it had been
at the beginning.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:39.200
Now the American war
aims as enunciated

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.240
by Woodrow Wilson were very much
tied up with this peace aims.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.370
This was a war, a
crusade for peace.

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.150
A peace he said in
his many addresses,

00:23:48.150 --> 00:23:50.020
a peace without victory.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.340
He wanted a community of power
to replace balance of power.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.870
The old European
idea that as long

00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:58.040
as the powers were balanced,
you wouldn't get conflict seemed

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.870
to Wilson and others
to be folly.

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.820
That a balance of power
was inherently unstable

00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:05.150
and likely to lead to war.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:08.010
He also talked about how
this was a war for democracy,

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.400
for the right of those
who submit to authority

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:12.450
to have a voice in
their own governments.

00:24:12.450 --> 00:24:17.990
And I'm quoting from an
address he gave in April 1917

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.720
with the declaration of war.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:21.560
"For the rights and
liberties of small nations,

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.280
for universal dominion of rights
by concert of free people,

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.390
and shall bring peace
and safety of all nations

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:29.010
and make the world
itself at last free."

00:24:29.010 --> 00:24:31.680
And he talked also
about mechanisms

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.220
by which this might be
done in his 14 points.

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.710
Later on his four principles,
he talked about free trade --

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:40.830
although the phrase was
never one he used much,

00:24:40.830 --> 00:24:43.490
but he certainly talked
about self-determination.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.760
Unfortunately, he never really
defined it very clearly.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.220
And this is one of
the real problems

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:49.470
with self-determination.

00:24:49.470 --> 00:24:52.320
So he went to Paris and the
American delegation went

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.590
to Paris very much in the
frame of mind that it was there

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:56.890
to set the Europeans free.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:24:58.480
It was there to tell
them how they were going

00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.780
to make a better world.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.590
It was there to make sure that
the sacrifices as they were seen

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.510
of Americans, of the American
public, of American soldiers,

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:08.880
of American sailors,
would not be in vain.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.570
Now there are many myths
about what happened.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:13.520
And I think perhaps the
most prevailing one,

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.010
persistent one is that Wilson
came as a sort of Galahad --

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:20.460
and this was certainly the
image given by his supporters --

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:24.230
and was greeted on the shores of
Europe by these black-hearted,

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:26.550
bestial Europeans who
didn't want anything

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:27.850
of what he was talking about.

00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.980
And this I think
is utterly false.

00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.350
A lot of Europeans had already
been talking before the First

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:34.650
World War about the very things

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.950
that Wilson himself
was talking about.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:39.470
In fact, many of the ideas
he drew on for a community

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:42.550
of nations, for collective
security, for free trade

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:45.100
as a way of knitting together
the peoples of the world,

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.090
came from things
Europeans had been talking

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:51.160
about since the 18th and 19th
centuries and sometimes earlier.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.250
And a lot of Europeans welcomed
Wilson as someone who is going

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:55.550
to bring a better world.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.130
And of course, they knew --
I mean, if you were in Paris,

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:58.730
you could see what
the war had done.

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:00.970
And you got to the battlefields
on the western front

00:26:00.970 --> 00:26:03.670
for the day, and these
had not yet grown over.

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.360
You could see what
that battle had done.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:09.250
And so I think Wilson
came actually with a lot

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:11.100
of support both from
the American people

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.770
and from the Europeans
themselves.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.090
So what went wrong?

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.340
And I think a number
of things went wrong.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:20.270
I think Wilson himself
wasn't politically astute.

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.750
He did not make making the
peace a bipartisan affair.

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:28.550
He brought what was really
exclusively a Democratic

00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:30.840
delegation and he brought one
or two nominal Republicans

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.960
that they had been
Republicans so far back

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.130
that no Republicans
recognized them as such.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.560
And he made the election

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.210
of November 1918 a
partisan election,

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.830
"A vote for the Democrats
is a vote for peace."

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:45.770
And he did not manage
his relations either

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.880
with the Republicans
or with Congress well.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.340
And in the end, I think
the treaty and the covenant

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.420
of the League of Nations --
it was embedded and it failed

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:55.730
in Congress because Wilson
wasn't sufficiently politically

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.440
astute to get it through.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.120
I think also what went wrong is

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:00.700
that the expectations
were too high.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.000
At the end of such a great
struggle and such loss --

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.310
and we have to remember what
that meant, particularly

00:27:06.310 --> 00:27:07.900
for Europe but for
the world in general:

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.220
nine million men maybe dead.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.370
Nobody knows for sure
how many men died

00:27:11.370 --> 00:27:15.320
and how many more were going
to be wounded and destroyed

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.810
by the war, never
really to recover.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:20.590
It was not a time that
was easy for making peace.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.510
The real contrast I
think is with the end

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:26.680
of the Napoleonic Wars
in 1814-15 when Europe

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.870
and European powers
were ready for peace.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.250
And this wasn't the
case in 1918-1919.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.190
In fact, a lot of fighting
was going to go on up

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.100
until the mid-1920's in
the center of Europe,

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:39.950
in the Caucuses,
in the Middle East.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:44.200
You also had two waves of
emotion if you want to call it,

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.640
ideology, that were rising
rather than declining.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.800
By 1815, the excitement set off

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.880
by the French revolution
was over.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:56.530
In 1919, the Russian
Revolution was only beginning

00:27:56.530 --> 00:27:58.300
to have an impact on
the rest of the world.

00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.600
And all over Europe,
there were going

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.330
to be revolutionary outbreaks.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:04.080
What was also happening
was ethnic nationalism

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.430
because the world had
destroyed old empires.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:08.920
Austria-Hungary had gone,
Germany had fallen to pieces,

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:10.220
Russia had fallen to pieces.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.130
The Ottoman Empire
was about to go.

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:15.450
And suddenly all these peoples
who had wanted some sort

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:17.560
of autonomy now saw a
chance for full independence

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:19.000
in their own territory.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.210
And so making peace in those
conditions was not easy.

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:25.260
I'm not sure anyone
could have succeeded.

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:28.830
My own view is they
didn't do such a bad job.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:33.580
William Bullitt I think
was a young, impatient man,

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.450
highly idealistic, if I may
say so, very self-centered

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:40.740
and was furious because they
wouldn't listen to his advice.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.150
And I think his attacks
and the attacks

00:28:43.150 --> 00:28:47.300
of others were not recognizing
the very real political

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.990
and economic and social
difficulties that lay in the way

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:52.080
of making peace,
which is not to say

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.250
that it was necessarily
a good peace.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:57.200
But I think what they
did was try and deal

00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:58.730
with a range of problems.

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.010
They tried to deal with
the problem of Germany.

00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:02.990
Germany remained a power.

00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.500
In fact, in some ways
Germany was better off,

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.180
although the Germans
certainly didn't feel it,

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:10.400
in 1918 than it had
been in 1914.

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.530
It no longer had a
common border with Russia

00:29:12.530 --> 00:29:14.150
which had given the Germans

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.400
and the German high command
nightmares for decades.

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:21.620
Poland had emerged on the map
of Europe to separate the two.

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.650
Instead of an Austria-Hungary,
it had a series of small

00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.960
and quarrelling new or in some
cases old states like Poland.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.920
And its infrastructure was
largely untouched by war

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.740
because virtually all of the war

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.530
on the western front
had been fought

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.630
on either Belgian
or French soil.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:38.750
And although some of the war
in the east had been fought

00:29:38.750 --> 00:29:42.070
on German soil, Germany came
out of the war less damaged

00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:44.620
by war than the victors.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:46.800
The treaty with Germany,
the Treaty of Versailles

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.970
which included the
covenant of the League

00:29:48.970 --> 00:29:51.620
of Nations has often
been condemned as harsh.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.080
John Maynard Keynes wrote
a famous attack on it

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:57.680
in The Economic Consequences
of the Peace.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.660
It is difficult to see how they
could have done anything other

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:04.160
than impose conditions
on Germany.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.450
As Georges Clemenceau the
French Prime Minister said,

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:08.830
"How can I tell the French
public they have to pay

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:11.490
for the damage that Germany
did to French soil and did

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.950
to French villages and
did to French industry?"

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.550
And the British prime minister
David Lloyd George felt the

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:17.850
same thing.

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:20.730
It was a treaty that
was loathed in Germany,

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.120
but I suspect they wouldn't
have liked any treaty.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:25.140
Because what began to
happen almost as soon

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.120
as the guns fell silent
in November 1918 was

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:30.390
that the high command and
its supporters began to put

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.640
on the story that Germany had
not lost on the battlefields;

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.480
it had been stabbed in the
back by traitors at home.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.250
So if you don't think
you're lost,

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.860
it's like people
who go to court.

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:41.360
If they think they have
a case, they're not going

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:43.990
to say the judge was
really fair and I lost,

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:45.730
but it was a fair decision.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.030
People don't think like this.

00:30:47.030 --> 00:30:49.340
And the Germans felt it
was an unfair decision.

00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:51.540
They felt they had been
promised something.

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.840
They thought they'd
been promised

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.480
by Woodrow Wilson
they'd be treated gently.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:57.050
They thought they
might grow in territory

00:30:57.050 --> 00:30:58.350
because they'd been allowed

00:30:58.350 --> 00:31:00.740
to absorb the German-speaking
territories of Austria-Hungary.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.550
And they found they
weren't allowed to do that.

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:07.930
So I think Germany would not
have accepted any peace I think

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:11.060
that was imposed on it, and
peace was imposed on it.

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.030
And gradually in the 1920's
and 1930's, what you began

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.140
to get was the development
of other myths,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.850
that Germany hadn't
started the war;

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.540
that it somehow had
just happened,

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.920
and so everyone was guilty.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:24.400
And that again undermined
the legitimacy of the treaty.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.960
So I think the Americans
contributed to the making

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:31.140
of that treaty, but they
didn't I think contribute

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.230
to the troubles that followed.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.210
The troubles that followed were
a result of the First World War.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:40.050
And the 1920's and '30's might
have turned out differently

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:42.990
if it hadn't been for
political decisions,

00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:44.840
bad political decisions,
if it hadn't been

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.140
for the Great Depression.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:49.000
The one thing I think
that came out of this

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.140
that I think was good was
that Wilson did give a vision

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.440
and a very powerful vison

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.440
of how the world might
be run in a better way.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:58.380
We still haven't got there, and
we still haven't really figured

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.960
out how to end wars
without causing trouble.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.700
And I think that is something
we should remember before we

00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:06.760
condemn what happened in Paris.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.800
So I'm sorry if I
went on too long.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.100
You should have told me.

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.000
&gt;&gt; Harold James: It was
absolutely fascinating.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.680
And thank you so much
for the invitation.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.160
I'm just very happy to be here.

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:24.360
I think you've heard some key
themes already really very,

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.630
very beautifully and
very eloquently laid out.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:31.360
The war was a great success,

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.040
but the peace was
a terrible failure.

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:41.230
And the hopes of Wilson --
Wilson was deeply disillusioned

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:46.120
after 1919, and he ended
his presidency in despair

00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.840
and great, great sadness.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:54.560
But Margaret was saying
that Germany wasn't really

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:57.600
in such a bad position at the
end of the First World War.

00:32:57.600 --> 00:32:59.980
You should say that
the United States was

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.970
in this amazing position at
the end of the First World War.

00:33:02.970 --> 00:33:07.330
The First World War really
transformed the geopolitics

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:08.630
of the world.

00:33:08.630 --> 00:33:15.230
And the United States is really
a global power in 1918 and 1919

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:19.850
in the sense that it really
wasn't even in the 1890's.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:22.750
And the story that
you heard already,

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.560
that the US military
is terribly,

00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:29.010
terribly weak before
1914 applies equally

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:32.570
to the United States
as a financial power.

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:40.620
In the beginning of 1907, a
rather obscure immigrant banker

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.930
in New York called Paul Warburg,

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:47.470
although I think people now
know him better as Paul Warburg,

00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:51.280
wrote a long piece saying

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:55.850
that the United States financial
system was about as advanced

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:58.700
as that of the Middle East
at the time of Hammurabi,

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.350
or that of Italy at the
time of the Mendecci.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:06.180
And nobody really took
very much notice of that

00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:09.410
until October of 1907.

00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:11.940
And then there was an
enormous stock market crash.

00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.940
It was one of the
biggest financial panics

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.160
up to that point.

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.800
And Paul Warburg suddenly
looked like a prophet.

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.970
And so he becomes the person
who's really instrumental

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:25.830
in designing a new
banking system

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:30.090
and a new central bank
very much altered.

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:36.180
His vision becomes the
Federal Reserve system in 1914.

00:34:36.180 --> 00:34:39.700
And the United States is
a great financial power

00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.620
in 1918 and 1919.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:43.980
What does that really mean?

00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:49.310
It means that an awful lot
of people owe money to you.

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:55.480
And the United States is the
world's biggest creditor.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:02.930
But it's not really easy being
a creditor, because what's going

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:06.130
to make all these
people repay that money?

00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:09.250
And so there's a
fantastic problem

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:15.450
about whether all the money that
was lent by the United States

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:19.820
to its allies during
the war, to Britain,

00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.190
to France, will be repaid.

00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:29.290
There's a hope that it will,
but it's not at all clear.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:30.660
And there are all kinds

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:33.440
of sophisticated
arguments about that.

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.070
One of the problems
is that France

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:40.450
and Great Britain have
themselves also been great

00:35:40.450 --> 00:35:42.880
creditors during the
World War, but they,

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.510
unlike the United States,
lent a lot of money

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:50.120
to the czarist empire, to
Russia, to imperial Russia.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:54.050
Well, after 1917, Russia wasn't
going to repay any of that.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:58.730
And so the British and French
make a relatively reasonable

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:04.780
case that they can't really
fully bear the consequence

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:07.890
of having to repay
their own debt.

00:36:07.890 --> 00:36:12.050
Margaret made that point very
clear: France is wrestling

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:13.350
with the problem

00:36:13.350 --> 00:36:15.460
of fantastically
expensive reconstruction

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.940
because the war was fought
in the west through France

00:36:19.940 --> 00:36:21.730
and Belgium, not in the UK,

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:25.790
not in the United States
really, not in Germany.

00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:27.370
And so France has to pay this.

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:29.200
So France is going
to be really limited.

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.780
So France and Britain
look at Germany as a way

00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:36.870
of getting money to pay this.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:41.380
And they go on a kind of
historical tour and see

00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:45.470
that in 1870, 1871 after
the Franco-Prussian War,

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.790
France paid a big
sum of reparations.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.960
After the Napoleonic Wars,
there was a quite modest sum

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:54.160
of reparations that
were imposed on France

00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:56.120
in the Vienna Settlement.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.400
But in 1919 it's really amazing.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.860
Everybody wants to collect
money from somebody else.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:06.050
Even in the most
bizarre circumstances.

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:11.940
For instance, in the early
1900's an indemnity was imposed

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:16.280
on China as a consequence
of the damage

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.990
that the Europeans had
suffered in attacks

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:22.440
by the Boxer Rebellion on
the European settlements.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.210
They have to pay an indemnity.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:30.230
In the First World War, China
joins the allies and as a reward

00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:35.190
for good behavior, the
indemnity is cancelled.

00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:39.580
Well, not cancelled, because
in 1919 it comes back again.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:41.720
And that's a source
of immense resentment.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.110
So a lot of the resentments
that Margaret correctly talked

00:37:45.110 --> 00:37:48.530
about in the 1920's are
resentments of people

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:51.000
who actually have to
pay and find it very,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.210
very difficult to pay.

00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:59.240
So that's a really
problematic thing.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.430
It sounds nice being
the financial superpower

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:05.300
of the world and having lots
of people owing money to you.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:07.070
But the problem is
how to collect it.

00:38:07.070 --> 00:38:10.930
And if you base your
future expectations

00:38:10.930 --> 00:38:14.820
of your debt management
and your tax levels

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.840
and what you can pay American
citizens on the expectation

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:21.550
that you will be repaid, you're
basing that on an illusion.

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:23.520
And it proves to be an illusion.

00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:27.080
In that sense, the story
that you have about the end

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:28.960
of the First World War
and the Great Depression,

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.560
they're interrelated topics.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.660
It's that collapse
of the debt empire

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:40.300
that is the direct consequence
of the First World War

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:43.690
and the debts that
are at the end of it,

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:45.460
and they can't properly
be resolved.

00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:51.340
Let me make just two little
observations at the end of this.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:56.620
One is following Margaret
really on the peace treaty.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:58.700
Could anything better
have been done?

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:02.220
It's actually hard to think
of it, because these debts

00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:04.190
and the expectation that
they will be repaid --

00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:08.480
and they're part of
the political fabric.

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:14.210
And in fact, in fact,
the treaty of Versailles

00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:19.560
and the Paris Peace Settlement
was stabilizing and people began

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.690
to accept it in Europe.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:27.800
And the oddity of it is that
it was progressively revised

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.570
and then the reparation
provisions almost completely

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:35.930
eliminated, except for a tiny
symbolic amount, in 1932,

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.890
in the summer of 1932.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:42.560
And that actually is the fatal
movement for the development

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:44.060
of democracy in Germany.

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.620
Because as long as you
had that obligation,

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:52.400
as long as you had these ties,
the Germans had to negotiate,

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:55.390
had to try to get a little
bit of an improvement.

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:59.140
If it was lifted entirely,

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.360
you could have a radically
nationalist government

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.230
in Germany without
any penalties,

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:04.530
without any sanctions at all.

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:08.100
And so it's the lifting of
reparations in the summer

00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:10.870
of 1932 that sets the stage

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:12.950
for the dictatorship
of Adolf Hitler.

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:16.190
If Hitler had become chancellor
of Germany before the summer

00:40:16.190 --> 00:40:19.740
of 1932, he would
have completely failed

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.760
because either he would
have paid reparations

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.220
and then looked ridiculous
in the eyes of his followers

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.560
who would have abandoned him,

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.740
or he would have
not paid reparations

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:33.970
and the treaty is very clear
the French and the Belgian army

00:40:33.970 --> 00:40:37.430
and maybe the British army
would have invaded the Rhineland

00:40:37.430 --> 00:40:39.060
and occupied the Ruhr again.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.880
So it's the end of
reparations rather than the fact

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:45.160
of reparations that
makes Hitler possible.

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:48.090
The second theme that I would
like to take up is something

00:40:48.090 --> 00:40:49.390
that Margaret alluded to,

00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:52.830
but I would like to make it
maybe a little more polemical.

00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:56.080
But some people criticized
the treaty very bitterly

00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:57.380
at the time.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:59.140
It didn't do enough for
European reconstruction;

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:00.670
that's absolutely true.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:05.600
But the people who said that
were really quite divided.

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.820
They could have made
a better system.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.330
They could have thought of
a way of providing the kind

00:41:12.330 --> 00:41:14.990
of financial assistance that
flowed to Europe in the middle

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:17.740
of the 1920's much earlier.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:22.790
In October and November of
1919, there was some meetings

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:28.490
in the house of a Dutch banker,
Gerard Wiserink in Amsterdam,

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:34.000
where a number of
Swedish, Dutch, American,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.680
Swiss bankers took part,

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:41.140
but also the great British
economist John Maynard Keynes.

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:45.060
And John Maynard Keynes by
this stage had a big problem.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.500
He could really see
what should be done

00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:53.150
to make the world better, but
he had poisoned the atmosphere

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:56.990
to such an extent by his
famous and polemical book,

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:00.720
The Economic Consequences of the
Peace, that it was unrealistic

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.670
that anybody in authority
in London or Washington,

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.660
let alone in Paris,
would listen to him.

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:09.470
And so this brilliant
intellectual,

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.360
and The Economic Consequences
of the Peace is a beautiful,

00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:15.290
wonderful, eloquent book,

00:42:15.290 --> 00:42:21.090
made sure that that nothing
practically could be done.

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:26.120
And unfortunately, that it seems
to me is still something that is

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:29.240
out there in that
there are many --

00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:36.650
not many, but a few significant
very important economists

00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:38.540
who think of themselves
exactly in this role

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:41.260
of John Maynard Keynes of
being a public intellectual.

00:42:41.260 --> 00:42:46.010
Very evidently in the
recent financial crisis,

00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:47.800
in the aftermath of
the financial crisis

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:52.160
and the European debt crisis,
Joseph Siglet or Paul Kruppman,

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.390
they see themselves exactly
in the legacy of Keynes.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:58.310
And they do an incredible
job in making fun

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:01.060
of the European politicians
who are supposed

00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:02.890
to make sense of the mess.

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:07.710
But the constructive
proposals really as in the case

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.420
of John Maynard Keynes in
1919 are simply not there.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:17.280
And so Keynes and some of the
other critics of the peace went

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:20.390
on a great journalistic voyage,

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:23.700
but it was a voyage
that was destructive.

00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:25.720
Because it actually
encouraged the fantasy

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.190
that you could get rid of all
of these debts at the same time,

00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:31.650
rather than thinking, "Let's
tackle them one by one.

00:43:31.650 --> 00:43:34.810
Let's do a piecemeal bit
of tinkering on this,

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:38.450
and let's gradually get the
world to be a better place."

00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:45.690
So the quest for the best
was in this sense an enemy

00:43:45.690 --> 00:43:47.730
of a lasting peace treaty.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:49.030
Thank you.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:50.330
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
Thank you.

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:52.960
Charles, you can wrap it up
by disagreeing with us all.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.260
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan: Okay.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:56.870
I am the outlier up here
because I'm a professor

00:43:56.870 --> 00:44:01.150
of international relations,
not a distinguished historian.

00:44:01.150 --> 00:44:04.440
And as a political scientist,

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:06.850
our duty is to make
big arguments

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:10.010
that have no basis
whatsoever in fact or history.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:11.310
[ Laughter ]

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:12.640
So I'm going to try to do that

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.790
and then let my esteemed
colleagues shoot me down.

00:44:17.790 --> 00:44:22.550
And I want to spend a
lot more time talking

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:26.110
about what came before
Wilson than my colleagues.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:30.050
Because we usually understand
World War I and Wilsonianism

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:36.040
in terms of either what went on
from 1914-1919, or the failure

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:39.430
of the League of
Nations, or what happened

00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:40.870
in the '20's and '30's.

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:46.430
And I think understanding this
period required going backwards

00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:51.530
and starting to tell the
story really from 1789.

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:57.160
And in particular to understand
how committed Americans both

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.050
in terms of their
mindset and in terms

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:03.410
of our political system
were to being isolationist.

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:06.380
Isolationism was
part of our DNA.

00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:11.090
We defined ourselves as a
country that would stand apart

00:45:11.090 --> 00:45:15.300
from the rest of the
world with such conviction

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:18.300
that it rivals the
conviction today that we have

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.450
about being a global power,
about being Pax Americana.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:23.510
It was in our DNA.

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:26.980
It was part and parcel of
American exceptionalism.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:31.070
And I see the struggle that
Wilson went through as well

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:35.620
as the struggle that
McKinley and Roosevelt

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:39.620
and Lodge before him went
through as this struggle

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:44.610
to alter American identity, to
alter the American narrative,

00:45:44.610 --> 00:45:48.670
to alter what American
exceptionalism was about.

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:53.450
To try to turn this ship
around, and to get us away

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.330
from being an isolationist power

00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:58.350
to becoming an internationalist
power.

00:45:58.350 --> 00:46:02.220
And I think that we
tried in 1898 and failed.

00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.940
We tried in 1917,
'18, '19 and failed.

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.280
And then we succeeded
eventually under FDR.

00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.500
And so I want to
talk a little bit

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:16.340
about why I think the first two
attempts failed and then end

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:22.130
with some thoughts on the Cold
War and where we are today.

00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:28.760
As I said, it is difficult
to understate the degree

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:33.850
to which isolationism -- and
by that I mean an unwillingness

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:38.890
to extend strategic commitments
beyond the continental North

00:46:38.890 --> 00:46:40.570
American zone.

00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:42.650
I'm not talking about
as a commercial power.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:45.990
I'm not talking about
westward expansion.

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:49.530
What I'm talking about
is extending our reach

00:46:49.530 --> 00:46:51.170
with durable permanent,

00:46:51.170 --> 00:46:55.330
strategic commitments
beyond the motherland.

00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:58.500
And yes, we aggressively
expanded westward,

00:46:58.500 --> 00:47:01.470
and there are a lot of dead
people as a consequence.

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:05.640
Most people don't know it,
but we tried multiple times

00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:12.050
to invade and annex Margaret's
country and we lost, repeatedly.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:16.490
And then the last attempt was
made at the end of the Civil War

00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:19.710
when Seward and others
said to the British,

00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:24.560
we want you to compensate
us for supplying ships

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.450
to the south by giving
us Canada.

00:47:28.450 --> 00:47:31.820
And that didn't work, although
the British did eventually I

00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:34.990
think pay $15 million,
if the number is correct,

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:38.310
for the losses that
were incurred

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:41.840
by the Union during
the Civil War.

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:45.030
We made other attempts
in the 19th century

00:47:45.030 --> 00:47:51.710
to annex territories:
Haiti, Cuba, Santo Domingo,

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:54.570
the Virgin Islands, Hawaii.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:56.990
We mucked around
in Central America.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:48:01.410
We sent our forces to protect
our traders and our citizens,

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:06.940
but we never created a consensus
to actually extend our reach.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.450
Mainly because Congress
kept saying no.

00:48:10.450 --> 00:48:15.970
To the degree that we went
beyond the continental zone,

00:48:15.970 --> 00:48:18.280
it happened only twice,
at least as I can tell.

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.640
Maybe I will be corrected here,

00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.110
but I could find
only two territories

00:48:22.110 --> 00:48:24.920
that we took before 1898.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.400
One was Midway in
1867 which we took

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:32.070
under what was called
the Guano Act.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.380
And that's because Midway
had a lot of bird poop on it.

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.920
And bird poop is
good for fertilizer

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:39.720
and also for gunpowder.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:43.570
No one lived on it, but a
US Navy captain claimed it

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:46.820
for the United States and
it became a US territory.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:50.930
And the other was Pago-Pago
which was a nice deep harbor

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:54.920
in Samoa which we
took in the 1870s.

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:58.270
President Cleveland then
tried to offload it.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:00.710
It didn't succeed,
but other than that,

00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:02.400
I could find no instance

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:07.310
in which we extended our reach
beyond North America other

00:49:07.310 --> 00:49:12.210
than one island covered with
bird poop and one deep harbor

00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:16.950
in Samoa way off in the Pacific.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:21.250
What led to this conviction
that we should stay

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:23.440
at home and stand aloof?

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.460
I will quickly run
through what I take

00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:28.210
to be the main six arguments

00:49:28.210 --> 00:49:31.530
that dominated the
political dialogue

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:34.100
in what I would call
a bipartisan way.

00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:38.200
In some ways created a veto
over American state craft.

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:40.760
Beginning with Washington
and Jefferson

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:44.780
but really continuing right
through until the 1890's.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:49.250
One, bank on our
natural security.

00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:51.930
Big oceans to the
left and right,

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:55.620
relatively weaker neighbors
and generally nicer neighbors

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:57.890
to the north and south.

00:49:57.890 --> 00:49:59.670
Why mess with that?

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:03.470
Two, we are a redeemer nation.

00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:05.840
We are the new Israel.

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.230
We are going to save the world,

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:12.130
but we can't save the
world unless we remain pure

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.430
and pristine.

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:16.450
And if we go out and
become like other nations,

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:20.190
we will compromise the
American experiment.

00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:24.250
We need to save the
United States

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:25.810
if we are to save the world.

00:50:25.810 --> 00:50:30.360
But we can only do it
after we perfect ourselves.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:35.950
Three, if we become a
country with foreign ambition,

00:50:35.950 --> 00:50:39.450
we will compromise domestic
liberty and prosperity,

00:50:39.450 --> 00:50:41.850
principally domestic liberty.

00:50:41.850 --> 00:50:45.240
It's hard to overstate the
degree to which early Americans,

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.770
the founders in particular,
were much more scared

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.170
of domestic tyranny than
they were of foreign enemies.

00:50:52.170 --> 00:50:55.430
And they therefore didn't
want a standing army.

00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:57.700
They didn't want to
raise a big navy.

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:00.870
They wanted the separate states
to have their own militias.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:04.000
And they thought that if we
got into great power wars,

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.250
we would end up being a tyranny
just like every other country.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:13.460
Fourth, preserving
freedom of action abroad.

00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:18.270
The unilateralism, that
was referred to earlier.

00:51:18.270 --> 00:51:23.130
Fifth, protecting
social homogeneity.

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:28.280
Perhaps the main reason that
we never ended up taking Cuba

00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:33.600
or Haiti or Santo Domingo or
other islands in the Pacific is

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:38.150
because they were
populated by nonwhites.

00:51:38.150 --> 00:51:42.500
And effectively that was
a veto over expansion

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.700
because the largely
white population

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:47.210
in the United States did
not want to either rule over

00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:52.620
or incorporate into the body
politic nonwhite individuals.

00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:56.330
And then finally there
was a pacifist stream

00:51:56.330 --> 00:52:00.530
of isolationism going back
to the Revolutionary War.

00:52:00.530 --> 00:52:04.410
You find it in 1812, you find
it in the Mexican-American War.

00:52:04.410 --> 00:52:07.790
It actually plays a very
important role during World War

00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:11.120
I, and there are examples
of it in the exhibit here.

00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:15.990
But I take those to be the
main strains of isolationism.

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:22.040
So that gets us to the 1890's
when finally after many,

00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:26.610
many decades, McKinley
pushed by Lodge

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.250
and Mahon the naval
strategist decides

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:32.450
that we are finally going to
enforce the Monroe Doctrine.

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:36.700
And keep in mind the Monroe
Doctrine dates to the 1820's,

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:39.230
but we never really
did anything about it.

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:45.310
But finally we decide to
kick the Spanish out of Cuba.

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:50.640
And we go on essentially to
take Puerto Rico and Guam

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.070
and the Philippines,
and while we're

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.380
at it we finally take Hawaii.

00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:57.800
And all of this is
in the service

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.810
of essentially a
humanitarian cause.

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:08.000
Because Cubans are suffering
under the hand of the Spanish.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.080
And this is in part about the
next phase of manifest destiny.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.550
I think Americans did buy into
the narrative of the 1890's

00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:19.280
that the American
frontier had closed,

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:22.740
and that if the American
experiment and American dynamism

00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.910
and social vitality
was to continue,

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:28.810
we needed to expand overseas now

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:32.760
that we had completed
the mission at home.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.140
The problem is that what
we ended up with in 1899

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.870
and 1900 was nothing that looked

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:42.400
like what people
had been promised.

00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:46.210
We turned into a
ruthless imperial power.

00:53:46.210 --> 00:53:50.350
We were as oppressive and nasty
and brutish in the Philippines

00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:53.900
as the Spanish were in Cuba.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:58.910
And as a result, Americans
basically backed away from this.

00:53:58.910 --> 00:54:04.690
They said the founders warned
us that if we went abroad,

00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:07.570
we would lose our
special character.

00:54:07.570 --> 00:54:09.060
We would become like others.

00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:11.550
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:54:11.550 --> 00:54:14.130
And the anti-imperial
movement grew.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:16.070
Taft was elected.

00:54:16.070 --> 00:54:18.780
He sort of pulled away
from the extension

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.980
of foreign commitments except
in the western hemisphere.

00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:26.340
And importantly, he began to
talk about the legalization

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:30.160
and institutionalization
of international affairs.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.800
We generally think of Wilson
as the father of that,

00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:37.800
but keep in mind that the League
to Enforce Peace was founded

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.860
in Philadelphia in 1915 and
its first president was William

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:43.990
Howard Taft.

00:54:43.990 --> 00:54:48.020
And then Woodrow Wilson gave an
important speech to the league.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:51.820
I think it was not that much
longer after it was founded,

00:54:51.820 --> 00:54:55.660
but you begin to see the
American people move away

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:58.960
from the kind of realist
expansion imperialism

00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:02.740
to more a Wilsonian version
that is much more in keeping

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:05.110
with American traditions.

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:10.630
And so I see Wilson and the
reaction against realism as sort

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:13.570
of growing out of
the events of 1898.

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:17.660
He was a logical
reaction to what happened.

00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:18.960
The story I would tell

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.440
about what happened during
World War I is in some ways

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:25.640
that Wilson overcorrected.

00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:28.320
He did the idealism
but he forgot

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.980
to tell the realist story.

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:36.510
And it's interesting that
I, in addition to Margaret,

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:39.450
actually wrote down major
chunks of the speech

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:43.080
that he gave April 2nd in 1917,

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.160
because it's a remarkable
speech.

00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:48.030
I would encourage all of
you to go read it tonight.

00:55:48.030 --> 00:55:52.570
There is not one
reference to real politic.

00:55:52.570 --> 00:55:55.430
It's all about democracy
and justice

00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:57.870
and freedom of all peoples.

00:55:57.870 --> 00:56:02.230
And in fact, he disavows any
hint or whiff of realism.

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:05.400
He says, "We have no
selfish ends to serve.

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.360
We desire no conquest,
no dominion.

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.030
We seek no indemnities.

00:56:10.030 --> 00:56:12.920
We seek no material
compensation."

00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:17.680
That is pie in the sky, right?

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:18.980
That is in my mind --

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:22.310
and I think the mind of many
Americans -- overreaching.

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:24.760
And so I think part of
the reason that in the end

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:30.050
of the day Wilson fell short
is that he overcorrected

00:56:30.050 --> 00:56:34.190
for the realism, for the
republican imperialism

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:36.220
that came before him.

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:39.290
And he tried to sell a piece

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:44.560
that he couldn't convince the
individuals that were talked

00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:47.290
about earlier, the
Lodge's, the Roosevelts.

00:56:47.290 --> 00:56:49.640
It was too idealist for them,

00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:52.830
and it was too idealist
for the world.

00:56:52.830 --> 00:56:55.030
The world was still
an ugly place

00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:56.530
where lots of people were dying.

00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:59.310
It didn't correspond
to the vision

00:56:59.310 --> 00:57:01.390
that Wilson was laying out.

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:04.850
So yes, I agree with Margaret
that he failed in part

00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:09.500
because he was stubborn and he
forgot about bipartisanship.

00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:13.620
But I also think it was a vision
that was simply too idealistic.

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:16.310
It resonated with
American exceptionalism.

00:57:16.310 --> 00:57:18.680
It resonated with
America's past.

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:23.690
It resonated with manifest
destiny, but he went too far.

00:57:23.690 --> 00:57:26.380
Final comment I'll
make is that I think

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:31.230
in some ways what we saw
during the Cold War was the fix

00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:32.530
to the problem.

00:57:32.530 --> 00:57:35.440
Equal parts realism
and idealism.

00:57:35.440 --> 00:57:41.660
FDR was in some ways a clone
made by taking McKinley, Mahan,

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:47.100
Lodge and Wilson and
smushing them together.

00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:48.620
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
That's a lovely image.

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.920
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan: Right?

00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:53.480
Because he did support
a rules-based

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:54.780
international system.

00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:56.990
The United Nations
came into being.

00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:58.490
But he was also a realist.

00:57:58.490 --> 00:58:00.960
He understood power politics.

00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:06.000
And in the Cold War, we were out
there to kind of save the world.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.900
We were out there to
Americanize the system.

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:13.280
But it was also within the
bounds of power realities.

00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:15.830
And I think that's in
part why it resonated

00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:20.210
with the American people and
enjoyed bipartisan support.

00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:23.740
My final comment is
that I think this story

00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.720
that I've been telling
is very important today.

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:32.120
Because I think the
American past is coming back.

00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.830
Margaret mentioned an article
I published recently called

00:58:34.830 --> 00:58:37.920
Trump's 19th Century
Grand Strategy.

00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.220
And I think there is
an enormous resonance

00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:44.040
between what Trump is doing

00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:49.190
and the pre-Wilson,
pre-1898 America.

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:52.030
The unilateralism.

00:58:52.030 --> 00:58:54.870
The isolationism.

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:59.270
The racial-based
anti-immigrant sentiment.

00:58:59.270 --> 00:59:00.570
The protectionism.

00:59:00.570 --> 00:59:02.580
We were not a free
trading nation.

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.180
I don't think Trump
actually understands it

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:08.040
because I don't think he reads
a lot of American history,

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.840
but I do think there
is remarkable resonance

00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:16.130
between his narrative and the
narrative that existed prior

00:59:16.130 --> 00:59:20.310
to our push outward
that began in 1898

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:22.510
and continued with Wilson.

00:59:22.510 --> 00:59:26.160
And I do think that today we are
at a crossroads in some ways.

00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:29.360
I think much of the world
that Wilson envisaged came

00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:33.040
to life during World War
II and during the Cold War.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:36.330
I worry that it is
today slipping away.

00:59:36.330 --> 00:59:40.710
Slipping away because neither
the realist arguments nor the

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:43.570
idealist arguments
are being made.

00:59:43.570 --> 00:59:48.200
Slipping away because the world
isn't going America's way.

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.940
It is becoming more
illiberal, not more liberal.

00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:56.460
And that makes me worry that
the United States will go back

00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:00.780
to the narrative that dominated
this country for so long,

01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:05.700
and that is, "If we can't
change the world, then we need

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.820
to shield ourselves
from that world.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.550
Because it's a dirty,
ugly, nasty place,

01:00:11.550 --> 01:00:15.070
and we need to tend
our own garden."

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.370
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
Thank you.

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.950
I think we've had a, I think,
very good demonstration

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:23.460
of why history matters and why
we need to think about the past.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:25.570
Because it does help us to
think about the present.

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:29.010
It raises issues which
are important today.

01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:32.250
And I think I'm going to ask
each of the panelists to comment

01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.370
on what each other has said.

01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:37.240
But I'd also just like to
raise some general questions.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.510
And one is it seems we've
been talking about the nature

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.770
of power, what it actually is.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:44.190
I mean, we tend to think
too often you can count it.

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:45.490
You can count numbers of tanks.

01:00:45.490 --> 01:00:47.310
You can count numbers of heads.

01:00:47.310 --> 01:00:49.090
You can count GDP per head,

01:00:49.090 --> 01:00:52.040
and then you can somehow
say what power is.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:56.740
And I think what they found in
Paris in 1919 and afterwards

01:00:56.740 --> 01:01:00.660
and what powers are finding
today is that projecting power

01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:03.100
and what power is,
is complicated.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.630
And you can't always
get your own way,

01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:05.950
no matter how powerful you are.

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:11.310
And I think in Europe in 1919,
here are the victors sitting

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:14.330
in Paris; they can't stop
the Czechs and the Poles

01:01:14.330 --> 01:01:16.280
from fighting with each other
because they haven't got a way

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.910
of actually getting
their forces over there.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:20.950
And we think of what's
happening in Afghanistan.

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:24.380
It's 17 years now NATO
forces have been trying

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.950
to impose some sort
of order there.

01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:28.280
And these represent some of
the most powerful nations

01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.920
in the world, and before
that it was the Soviet Union.

01:01:30.920 --> 01:01:32.990
So I think that's one thing
we've been talking about.

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.820
We've also I think been
talking about how you end wars.

01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:39.290
How do you actually deal with
those who have been defeated?

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:40.980
How do you deal with
those who have won?

01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.130
How do you build
a lasting peace?

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:45.040
And this is not easy.

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:47.240
I mean, St. Augustine
said you should end a war

01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.590
as if you wanted peace,
but it's not easy to do.

01:01:50.590 --> 01:01:52.650
And I think these are still
issues we're grappling

01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:53.950
with today.

01:01:53.950 --> 01:01:55.250
And I think we've also seen

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:59.060
in the comments today the
importance of perception.

01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:02.520
Perception may be wrong, but
it can be a very powerful force

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.450
in politics both domestically
and internationally.

01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:07.470
And ideas matter as well.

01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:09.360
What people think
happened matters.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.570
What sort of world they
want to see matters.

01:02:11.570 --> 01:02:13.690
I mean, one of the things
that Wilson was facing

01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:16.280
in Paris was an alternative
vision of the future,

01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.300
and that was the Bolshevik one.

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:22.020
And both those sets of ideas
were going to be very powerful

01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:23.770
through the rest of the century

01:02:23.770 --> 01:02:26.770
and I think still
have resonance today.

01:02:26.770 --> 01:02:29.890
And it's a question I
guess I have for the panel.

01:02:29.890 --> 01:02:33.970
The role of public opinion.

01:02:33.970 --> 01:02:36.080
The Congress of Vienna,
they made peace

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.380
without really worrying about --

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.680
there was nothing
called the public.

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.530
And there was some
domestic opinion,

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:43.260
but it was usually very small
and confined to a few people.

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.540
And so they could sit down in
Vienna and do some horse trading

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.690
and they could come up
with a workable peace,

01:02:48.690 --> 01:02:51.490
and they did actually.

01:02:51.490 --> 01:02:53.830
In Paris, they had
huge public scrutiny,

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:57.090
huge public expectation and I
think Wilson himself said it

01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:59.470
on the boat going over to Paris.

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:02.330
He said, "I foresee an
agony of disappointment,"

01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:05.420
because there were so many
hopes, so many dreams.

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:07.940
And public opinion is
not always very coherent.

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.700
And what the publics in the
winning countries wanted

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.620
in 1919 was a better world, but
they also wanted someone to pay

01:03:14.620 --> 01:03:15.920
for the mess of the old world.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:18.110
And these weren't always
necessarily consistent.

01:03:18.110 --> 01:03:22.150
And I guess the final question
I have for the panelists is --

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:24.520
you know, these settlements
at the end

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.400
of the World War still
have a very bad press.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.990
I think unfairly so.

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:31.240
But as Harold James
said, the polemic written

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.820
by Keynes is still
enormously powerful.

01:03:33.820 --> 01:03:35.120
It's still in print.

01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:36.760
It's the envy of every academic.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.440
He wrote it in six weeks.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.740
It was an instant bestseller

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:41.580
and it's never been
out of print since.

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.230
And it is wonderful to read.

01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:46.640
It is totally unfair and I
think what he was suggesting was

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:47.940
totally unrealistic.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:51.010
I mean, at one point he
suggested not in the book

01:03:51.010 --> 01:03:53.110
but to Lloyd George and others,

01:03:53.110 --> 01:03:56.170
that all inter-allied
debts should be cancelled

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:58.420
and then there'd be no need
to collect reparations.

01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:00.880
I mean, this was a
lovely and unique idea,

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.620
but politically impossible.

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:05.660
I guess the question is, why
do the peace settlements have

01:04:05.660 --> 01:04:06.960
such a bad reputation?

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.010
Why are they seen
as so disastrous?

01:04:09.010 --> 01:04:11.250
When in fact if you look at the
peace settlements at the end

01:04:11.250 --> 01:04:14.930
of the Second World War, you
compare how Germany was treated

01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:18.680
after 1919 and how it
was treated after 1945,

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:22.020
it was never occupied in 1919.

01:04:22.020 --> 01:04:24.610
As Harold James has said, it
never ended up paying that much

01:04:24.610 --> 01:04:26.340
in the way of reparations.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:27.820
It did lose territory but a lot

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:30.460
of that was territory it
had seized from Poland

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.580
in the partitions of Poland at
the end of the 18th century.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:37.210
In the Second World War,
Germany was devastated,

01:04:37.210 --> 01:04:39.250
its cities were leveled.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.850
The whole of Germany
was occupied.

01:04:40.850 --> 01:04:42.400
It was ultimately divided.

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:45.020
Reparations were seized
whenever they could be seized

01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:46.600
by the Russians who
took anything

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.610
from their sector they
could get their hands on.

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:53.310
And yet we never hear about
how the way Germany was treated

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:55.840
at the end of the Second
World War led to conflict,

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:57.140
that it was a disaster.

01:04:57.140 --> 01:04:58.470
And it just seems to me
an interesting question.

01:04:58.470 --> 01:05:01.260
Why is it that we have
this persistent idea

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:04.330
that what happened in
1919 was a disaster

01:05:04.330 --> 01:05:07.070
that led directly to 1939?

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:10.680
And we don't have that view
of what happened in 1945.

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:13.930
Anyway, I don't know what
order you'd like to comment in.

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:16.750
Perhaps, since you started,
Michael, would you like to?

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:18.050
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: Well,
three thoughts come to me.

01:05:18.050 --> 01:05:19.350
I'll try to do them
very quickly.

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:21.180
I think one thing
that's happening in 1919,

01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:24.220
and it's happening now that
is extremely difficult,

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:25.990
and Charles you can speak
to this because you've been

01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:29.710
on the inside of this, is that
the world is changing in ways

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:33.030
that the people making
decisions can't fully grasp.

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:35.280
And what's happening
I think in 1919,

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.140
there are three massive
paradigm shifts

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:41.590
that I don't think the
leaders of 1919 fully grasped.

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:42.890
And I'm just going to comment

01:05:42.890 --> 01:05:44.290
on them very quickly
and then move on.

01:05:44.290 --> 01:05:47.170
One is that the four
main terrestrial empires,

01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:48.730
the Ottoman, German,
Austria-Hungarian

01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:50.710
and Russian, are just gone.

01:05:50.710 --> 01:05:52.530
They're not reformed.

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:53.830
They're gone.

01:05:53.830 --> 01:05:55.130
And they need to be replaced.

01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:57.360
That space has to be filled.

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.250
Second, I mean, I used to teach
the peace process by starting

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:02.750
with the Amritsa Massacre
in northern India.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:06.490
Also as a way of saying that the
Europeans really do believe they

01:06:06.490 --> 01:06:09.550
can go back to a status
quo ante in their empires.

01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:10.850
And they can't.

01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:12.150
There's no way.

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:14.440
And the third paradigm
shift is the development

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.950
of these two ideologies
that will dominate the '20's

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:20.300
and especially the 30's,
Bolshevism and Fascism.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:22.680
Margaret rightly pointed
out they're perfectly aware

01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:25.820
of Bolshevism and they're trying
to figure out what it means.

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:29.350
The second observation that
I would very quickly make,

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:32.130
I think one of the reasons that
this system is so difficult

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:35.090
to do and making peace
is so difficult to do is

01:06:35.090 --> 01:06:38.480
that the solutions in a peace
treaty are normally political

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.780
and economic.

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:42.610
But the problems are
also cultural and social.

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:45.040
So I was in Israel a couple
of years ago on the West Bank

01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:47.430
on the Israeli side
talking to both sides.

01:06:47.430 --> 01:06:49.760
And what kind of dawned on
me is that what we're trying

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.220
to do is fix the political and
economic and hope the social

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:55.380
and cultural just
comes along with it.

01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.250
And my impression, picking
up on things I've heard

01:06:58.250 --> 01:06:59.550
from other people in there,

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:01.830
that that pattern may
need to be reversed.

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:03.140
And that's a much
harder thing to do

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:05.980
because you can't control
culture and social the way

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.280
that you can political.

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.130
And the third thing that
I just wanted to point

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:12.580
out real quick is what we
historians call contingency

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.880
and context.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.180
And I think one of the
reasons why people were okay

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:17.480
with what happened
to Germany at the end

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.440
of the Second World
War is the sense

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.360
that the war was different.

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:24.870
That once soldiers had been
through Dachau, once they'd been

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:27.300
through Berg and Belsen,
there's no question

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.230
that you can't treat it the
way that you treated it before.

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:32.370
And the very last thing I
would say, I was trained

01:07:32.370 --> 01:07:33.670
as a social historian,

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:36.200
which meant that I was
really trained not to look

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.820
for individual points
where history changes,

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:41.820
but to look for these grand,
sweeping events in history.

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:44.380
And I'm coming as I get older
as an historian to think

01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.390
that maybe I was misled,

01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:49.120
and that these contingent
moments really do matter.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:52.680
I mean, Woodrow Wilson
won the 1916 election

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:54.660
by the second narrowest
margin in the history

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:55.960
of American elections.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:59.340
Now the war is actually not that
big a deal in the 1916 campaign

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.220
because he and the
Republican Charles Evans Hughes

01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:02.730
largely agreed.

01:08:02.730 --> 01:08:05.760
But if another person
is put into that office,

01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.230
how much of it goes differently?

01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:09.080
Even though again
it's not an issue

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.020
that they're talking
about in 1916.

01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.180
And Harold's point
which is just brilliant,

01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:17.800
if they keep the debt structure
at least in place in 1932,

01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:21.920
is that enough to prevent
something like Nazi extremism

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.390
from taking over inside Germany?

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.480
So I'm getting to think as I get
a little older, I at least need

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.560
to balance the structure
and the contingency

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.080
in the way we think
about these things.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.970
And in an event like
peacemaking,

01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.230
there are so many
contingent moments

01:08:35.230 --> 01:08:37.600
where a decision could
have been made differently

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.660
at a different point
by a different person,

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:42.430
that it's entirely feasible

01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:45.720
to envision other
outcomes coming out.

01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:54.080
&gt;&gt; Harold James: I
couldn't be more awake.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.140
[ Laughter ]

01:08:56.140 --> 01:09:02.840
This is absolutely,
really the central topic.

01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:05.620
I'm really glad we've
got to this comparison

01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:12.870
of the post-war settlements of
1918-1919 and 1945, because yes,

01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:19.600
1945 is clearly a much
more substantial success.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:22.360
And it really builds
a stable order.

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:27.520
Just a couple of points on that.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:31.730
One thing is that there was
no peace conference in 1945.

01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:33.970
So there's no peace treaty.

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:35.760
There's nothing that's
the equivalent

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.770
of the peace of Versailles.

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:42.000
And legally the document
that brought an end

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.350
to the Second World War

01:09:43.350 --> 01:09:47.000
in Europe is the two-plus-four
treaty that was signed

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:52.320
in October 1990 when the
Germany's became united again.

01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:56.940
So they just dealt with it in
a very, very different way.

01:09:56.940 --> 01:10:02.090
And I think on the other hand
if you mention particular bits

01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:06.410
of Allied planning, if
you talk about Yalter,

01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:10.450
you would get a very strong
reaction in many parts

01:10:10.450 --> 01:10:12.140
of eastern and central Europe.

01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:17.190
There's an enormous feeling if
you just have the word Yalter.

01:10:17.190 --> 01:10:19.220
It's portrayed in
the same way --

01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:28.270
it's like talking to Hungarians
and mentioning the word Freanor.

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:31.620
It produces an explosion.

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.440
And so it's just
very, very difficult

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.760
to produce a peace treaty.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:41.530
But what happened in 1944 and
1945 is that the world produced,

01:10:41.530 --> 01:10:49.280
the Allies produced, a working
political and economic order.

01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.990
And that was enormously
successful.

01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:58.630
I think also, I love the way
that Charlie put it together

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:04.410
in saying that FDR and Truman
synthesized American history

01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:09.040
and bring it to a
kind of culmination.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.580
But in a sense, the
1944-45 settlement was also

01:11:14.580 --> 01:11:15.880
very partisan.

01:11:15.880 --> 01:11:18.050
It was designed to
lock in the New Deal

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:20.220
on an international level.

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.160
And Roosevelt and
Truman were really aware

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.460
of that and they pushed that.

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:27.570
The bit that I'm most
familiar with are the financial

01:11:27.570 --> 01:11:30.050
and monetary arrangements
made at Bratton Woods.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:34.000
And they are exactly
designed to allow the New Deal

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.130
to live internationally because
it's recognized I think rightly,

01:11:39.130 --> 01:11:42.520
and it's one of the key
insights of that period,

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.540
is that you can't
have either prosperity

01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.020
or peace in one country alone.

01:11:48.020 --> 01:11:52.270
And so Henry Morgenthau put it
very brilliantly at the opening

01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:54.820
of the Bratton Woods
conference, that prosperity

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:56.470
and peace are indivisible.

01:11:56.470 --> 01:11:58.940
And you can't expect them --

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:01.200
that goes very much
to Charlie's point.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:03.520
You can't expect the United
States to be prosperous

01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.900
and peaceful if the rest
of the world is not.

01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:10.290
But in order to do that, it
needs a specific architecture.

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:15.350
And the elements of the New
Deal -- I mean, for instance,

01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:20.660
really going into detail, how
to make the modern economy work,

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.140
how to stop the disasters
of the Great Depression.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:28.880
It's about monetary policy,
it's about financial policy,

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:31.060
but it's also about
competition policy.

01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:35.520
And the people who designed
the competition policy

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:37.710
in the second part of the
New Deal were the people

01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:42.060
who then went to Germany
and broke up all the cartels

01:12:42.060 --> 01:12:44.350
that had been the key feature

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:47.230
of the German industrial
structure before.

01:12:47.230 --> 01:12:51.510
And then in turn, the people who
made the new cartel settlement,

01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:56.280
anti-trust settlements in
the German case in 1949

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:59.430
and later became on a
European level the key people

01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:01.910
who pushed this through
in the European community

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.240
and the European Union.

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.350
So there is a real
learning from the past,

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:11.670
but a sense that there's a
kind of structure that needs

01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:14.950
to be internationalized.

01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:17.660
And that's why I
think another part

01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:20.600
of the complicated question
is, do ideas matter?

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.430
Yes, they do matter enormously.

01:13:22.430 --> 01:13:28.910
And this was really a global
vision of interconnectedness.

01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:33.460
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan: On the
question of war settlements

01:13:33.460 --> 01:13:37.110
and peacemaking, I'd offer
three quick observations.

01:13:37.110 --> 01:13:39.990
The first picks up on
something that Michael said

01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:44.070
about I think some
misconceptions

01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:47.310
about how peace breaks
out, and the sense

01:13:47.310 --> 01:13:50.150
that I think people tend to
focus a little bit too much

01:13:50.150 --> 01:13:54.030
on functional explanations and
getting the economics right

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.460
and getting parties
that are hostile

01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:58.540
to trade with each other.

01:13:58.540 --> 01:14:00.760
I haven't so much looked
at peace settlements,

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:04.100
but I have done a lot of
work on when peace breaks

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:07.530
out among longstanding
adversaries.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:12.010
And I've found no evidence to
support the claim that it's

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.720
about economics, that
it's about transactions.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.960
It is basically about diplomacy

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.960
and reconciliation
over the core issues.

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:25.790
So if you take the US and
the UK and we keep in mind

01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:29.710
that we were enemies for
most of the 19th century,

01:14:29.710 --> 01:14:34.220
the key turning point was
a settlement that emerged

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:37.890
through arbitration over the
border between British Guyana

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:42.210
and Venezuela when the United
States stuck it's schnaus

01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:45.020
in to this situation and
asked the British to go

01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:47.800
to neutral arbitration
and eventually they did.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.120
And then we started settling
all kinds of other things.

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:53.780
The border of Alaska, you
mentioned fishing rights.

01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:57.340
And then the traders get in.

01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:00.370
Then the transactions
start to matter.

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:03.410
But if you don't fix the
underlying core diplomatic

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:07.010
geopolitical problems,
I don't think it works.

01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:10.450
Second observation I would make
is I think a lot depends on --

01:15:10.450 --> 01:15:14.310
I think one of the mistakes of
the World War I settlement was

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:17.230
that Germany was
not a stakeholder.

01:15:17.230 --> 01:15:19.830
Germany was acted upon.

01:15:19.830 --> 01:15:23.740
That's not true at the
end of World War II.

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.810
Odenower was a major
figure in the post-war era.

01:15:27.810 --> 01:15:32.320
Margaret mentioned
1815 and the Concert,

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.350
the powers that formed
the Concert.

01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:38.200
Yes, they were the victors
in the Napoleonic Wars,

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:41.100
but in 1818 they
had the good sense

01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:43.850
to invite France to participate.

01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:46.090
They gave France a seat at
the table and that's one

01:15:46.090 --> 01:15:48.540
of the reasons that
the Concert worked.

01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:52.140
I think to some extent
we have made a mistake

01:15:52.140 --> 01:15:57.260
in the post-Cold War settlement
by not really making Russia feel

01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:58.690
like it had a seat at the table.

01:15:58.690 --> 01:16:03.300
This is probably not the place
to talk about the enlargement

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.640
of NATO, but I think in
some ways it was a mistake

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:11.390
to use NATO to create a post-war
European security architecture,

01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:13.960
because it's basically
left the Russians feeling

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:17.450
as if they're out in the cold.

01:16:17.450 --> 01:16:19.790
Final comment I'll make, and
this is more of a question

01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:22.180
and I guess it will push us in
a somewhat different direction.

01:16:22.180 --> 01:16:24.750
But I was thinking about this
this morning, and it's relevant

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:27.120
to the speech that you

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.010
and I both mentioned
of April 2nd, 1917.

01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:35.040
If you look at Wilson prior
to his decision to go to war

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.830
after Germany starts
sinking US merchant vessels,

01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:44.670
he basically attributes moral
equivalence to the belligerents.

01:16:44.670 --> 01:16:49.580
He says that the war in Europe
is really about a war emerging

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:53.800
from countries committed
to the balance of power.

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:58.520
This is just another garden
variety European case of avarice

01:16:58.520 --> 01:17:01.040
and jealousy and intrigue.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.730
And he doesn't really
attribute it to regime type.

01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:08.710
If you look at the speech
that Margaret and I refer to,

01:17:08.710 --> 01:17:11.300
when he's making the case
for war, he spends a lot

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:16.260
of time talking about Prussian
autocracy and about the need

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:20.890
to build a world that rests
only on democratic people,

01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:23.380
countries with freewill.

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:25.940
And I'm wondering if
any of my colleagues

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:29.780
who have studied this much
more closely than I can speak

01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.130
to Wilson's change of mind.

01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:35.800
Did he actually think that
regime type mattered much more

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:39.070
in 1917 than he did in 1914?

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:41.470
Was this a tactical maneuver

01:17:41.470 --> 01:17:43.050
because he knew it
would resonate

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:44.990
with American exceptionalism?

01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:47.000
Anyone have any thoughts
on that?

01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.300
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Michael.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.600
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg:
He tended to believe

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:52.800
that democratic states don't
go to war with each other,

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:56.280
democratic peoples don't go to
war unless they're attacked.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.060
So I don't think
Wilson was so naïve

01:17:58.060 --> 01:18:00.840
as to believe you fix one
problem and you fix everything.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:05.810
But by and large,
democratic states,

01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:09.060
states where the rules have
to answer to their people,

01:18:09.060 --> 01:18:11.770
are less likely to engage
in destructive wars.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:13.770
At least that's what
he believed.

01:18:13.770 --> 01:18:20.590
I talk about this a lot,
when I go to audiences

01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:23.350
where there are large German
populations and they say, "Well,

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.880
my grandparents came
from the old country."

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:29.080
Americans understood Prussia
as being a different entity

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:32.870
from Germany, as did the French,
as did even many Germans.

01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:34.740
So when you start
to look at this,

01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:38.450
there are many German Americans
who are not from Prussia,

01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:40.610
who are arguing very
different things

01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:42.900
about what they think is
happening in the old world.

01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:46.260
And they can live with a war
that isn't against Germany

01:18:46.260 --> 01:18:48.720
but is against the
Prussian government,

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.020
which I think is part

01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:51.710
of the reason why Wilson
is parsing his words

01:18:51.710 --> 01:18:53.440
so carefully in April.

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.760
And it's the same thing that
President George W. Bush did

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.280
when he said, "We're not going
to war against the Iraqi people.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.300
We're going to war
against their government."

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:04.700
But that's pure Wilsonianism.

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:08.370
&gt;&gt; Harold James: If I could,
there's a particularly sort

01:19:08.370 --> 01:19:14.100
of difficult story
about this transition.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:18.730
Because in 1914 it was a
bit problem for both Britain

01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:22.230
and France if they were going
to try to present the war

01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:25.510
as a war for liberalism.

01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:29.760
Their ally was clearly the
most autocratic power in Europe

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:32.020
and the most despotic
power in Europe.

01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:36.420
And so by April 1917, the
Czar has been overthrown

01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:39.720
and that problem was removed.

01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:42.270
But there's also a sort
of conceptual issue

01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:44.660
that I think is very
interesting at the root of this.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:50.140
That in a way, the 1918-1919
vision is the 1815 vision

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.440
flipped around.

01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:54.000
Because the people
who made peace

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.700
in Vienna also had a vision of
how in order to prevent conflict

01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:03.710
in the future you needed
to avoid the possibility

01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:05.570
of ideological clashes.

01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:08.680
And so it wasn't about
having popular governments,

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:11.020
but it was about having
monarchical governments.

01:20:11.020 --> 01:20:13.160
As long as every
government was monarchical,

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.500
you would never get this crazy
kind of liberation experiment

01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:21.070
that started in France in 1789.

01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:22.880
And so it's exactly
the idea that as long

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.130
as you have a uniformity,
then you won't try

01:20:27.130 --> 01:20:32.420
to impose your will on other
monarchs or other republics.

01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.310
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: We do forget
how unbelievably important the

01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:38.360
abdication of the czar was to
American entry into the war.

01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:39.660
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yeah.

01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:40.960
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: Because
it's only then that you can talk

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:42.700
about this is a war to make
the world safe for democracy.

01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.000
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.300
I do think there's a
moral element there.

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.120
I mean, Wilson blamed the
balance of power as many did

01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:51.850
for the breaking out
of the First World War,

01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:53.870
because they saw it
as inherently unstable

01:20:53.870 --> 01:20:56.430
and big power politics.

01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:59.860
But I do think there
was antipathy

01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:01.720
to something called Prussianism.

01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:03.350
It wasn't just the
regime in Prussia.

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:06.720
It wasn't just the
dominance of the Kaiser.

01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:11.500
It was things like the burning
of the library at Luwan,

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:14.050
the execution of
Mercitias Kuvel,

01:21:14.050 --> 01:21:16.690
the sinking of the Lusitania,
the sinking of other ships,

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:18.420
the Sussex for example.

01:21:18.420 --> 01:21:24.120
I think this was seen as the
mark of an out-of-control set

01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:27.270
of ideas and something
had gone badly wrong.

01:21:27.270 --> 01:21:31.620
Because Wilson does say in Paris
that once the Germans are freed

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.610
from Prussianism, once they
become more democratic,

01:21:33.610 --> 01:21:36.020
they can join the
League of Nations,

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.450
that they can redeem themselves.

01:21:37.450 --> 01:21:40.010
So I think he enters seeing

01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:43.250
that the Allied side has
got the moral upper hand.

01:21:43.250 --> 01:21:44.550
And you're absolutely right,

01:21:44.550 --> 01:21:46.930
once Russia has had
its revolution

01:21:46.930 --> 01:21:49.820
and has a democratic government,
then it's very different.

01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.710
Now one last word and then I
think we might throw it open

01:21:52.710 --> 01:21:55.440
to these very patient people
who have been sitting here.

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.420
Any last words any
of you would like?

01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:00.850
No? Okay.

01:22:00.850 --> 01:22:02.150
&gt;&gt; Harold James: Sorry.

01:22:02.150 --> 01:22:03.450
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yes.

01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:05.190
&gt;&gt; Harold James: Just one
very, very obvious thing.

01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:11.540
I think all my classes have
endless discussions about what

01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:13.540
and who caused the
First World War.

01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:15.830
But it's very, very difficult
to have that discussion

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:17.720
about who caused the
Second World War.

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:19.020
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yes.

01:22:19.020 --> 01:22:20.320
&gt;&gt; Harold James: It's
a kind of no-brainer.

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.270
So in that sense, very, very
different situations, yes.

01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:24.570
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: They are.

01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:25.870
You can go to any
bookshop or library --

01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:27.930
if you look at the books on the
causes of the First World War,

01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:29.260
they go on indefinitely.

01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:32.920
The causes of the Second World
War is usually one shelf.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.280
We don't debate about it.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.930
We're pretty clear
how it started.

01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:41.010
Okay, we have two people
rushing around with microphones.

01:22:41.010 --> 01:22:44.750
And can I ask you not to
make very long speeches

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:46.050
but to ask questions?

01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:47.580
Thank you.

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.030
Over there, please.

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:55.890
&gt;&gt; At the very end in
Versailles when they're ready

01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:59.830
to announce the treaty, at that
point didn't Wilson show himself

01:22:59.830 --> 01:23:01.130
to be a realist?

01:23:01.130 --> 01:23:04.300
Didn't he insist on, as
harsh as everyone had agreed

01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:07.090
against Germany, when other
people were beginning to doubt

01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:10.350
and maybe be willing to go
back and change something?

01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:13.050
And my other question was

01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:15.090
if it had been Charles
Evans Hughes instead

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.860
of Woodrow Wilson, might he
have had a different approach

01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:19.160
to the peace treaty?

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:21.330
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
That's very interesting.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:23.900
I think Wilson felt, if I
can just go on the first part

01:23:23.900 --> 01:23:25.450
of your question,
I think Wilson felt

01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:28.000
that he had done the best
job he could have done.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.750
And they'd put it together and
he always thought the League

01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:34.010
of Nations would be the
body that would change it.

01:23:34.010 --> 01:23:35.830
He said, "Whatever
we've done now,

01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:37.200
it will be changed
by the League.

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:43.230
The League will help change
the treaty and it will adapt."

01:23:43.230 --> 01:23:45.120
I don't think he
had any feelings

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:47.830
that the treaty was a mistake.

01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:51.660
I think he felt they'd done
the best job they could.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.570
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan:
I would just add,

01:23:53.570 --> 01:24:01.360
I do think that by overselling
and then having to compromise

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:05.600
when he negotiated with
the Europeans on Germany

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:09.830
on other issues, he
disappointed the left.

01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:13.540
And it's worth keeping in mind
that his initial secretary

01:24:13.540 --> 01:24:20.590
of state was William Jennings
Bryan who resigned in 1915

01:24:20.590 --> 01:24:24.140
over the preparedness
movement and the response

01:24:24.140 --> 01:24:25.990
to Lusitania basically.

01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:30.880
And that there was a strong
left-wing peace movement

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:35.490
around Bryan and Jane Adams and
others who weren't supportive

01:24:35.490 --> 01:24:38.240
of Wilson because
they thought he caved.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:42.740
So he mainly lost the fight
for the League of Nations

01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:46.530
because of the irreconcilables
and people like Lodge

01:24:46.530 --> 01:24:50.420
on the unilateralism versus
multilateralism issue.

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:53.710
But he also faced
trouble on the left

01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:56.300
because they thought
he caved in.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:57.600
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.900
Anyone want to try
Charles Evans Hughes?

01:24:58.900 --> 01:25:00.200
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: Well,

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.500
there's no obvious
way to answer it.

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.630
But this gets to that question
I was talking about before.

01:25:04.630 --> 01:25:06.930
The way I was trained
would say it's really

01:25:06.930 --> 01:25:08.360
about the environment
and the context.

01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:09.660
That the problem is the same

01:25:09.660 --> 01:25:13.330
and the solutions are roughly
the same because the structures

01:25:13.330 --> 01:25:14.630
of the globe are the same.

01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:16.600
All those major changes
that I talked about.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.650
But as I said, as I'm getting
older and studying this more,

01:25:19.650 --> 01:25:23.460
I think a Charles Evans Hughes
administration might well have

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:26.280
listened to Taft and the ideas
of the League to Enforce Peace

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:27.620
which were slightly different

01:25:27.620 --> 01:25:30.970
than what Wilson
was trying to do.

01:25:30.970 --> 01:25:33.790
My sense is it probably
would have been different

01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:37.380
at the margins, but the
fundamental problems would still

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:40.270
have been there and the problems

01:25:40.270 --> 01:25:44.230
that faced Woodrow Wilson also
would face Charles Evans Hughes.

01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:46.730
So not really sure.

01:25:46.730 --> 01:25:48.590
It's what we historians
call a counter-factual,

01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:50.010
and my line is always

01:25:50.010 --> 01:25:52.900
that I would rather discuss
a counter-factual at a bar

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.990
than an academic setting.

01:25:54.990 --> 01:25:56.830
Because there's really
no way to prove it.

01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:58.840
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: But
it makes a good discussion.

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.140
Yes?

01:26:00.140 --> 01:26:01.520
&gt;&gt; My question has to do

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.700
with why have we not
really discussed --

01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:07.570
you briefly touched
on it at the very end

01:26:07.570 --> 01:26:11.330
of your discussion --
the role of Russia?

01:26:11.330 --> 01:26:16.890
And it seems to me this 100-year
misunderstanding of Russia

01:26:16.890 --> 01:26:22.580
or not having an understanding
hardly of all of Russia --

01:26:22.580 --> 01:26:28.100
in political discourse as
far as history is concerned,

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.440
if you look at all the
First World War exhibitions,

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:36.160
they're all about Great
Britain, France and the US.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.850
Very little about Russia's role.

01:26:38.850 --> 01:26:44.150
Hardly any at all,
or Turkey or Italy.

01:26:44.150 --> 01:26:45.530
But especially Russia.

01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:49.300
And I think just
tossing it under the rug

01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:55.070
and never addressing the
history of what Russia did

01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:57.140
in the First World War
and its accomplishments,

01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:01.690
how much it helped
the Allied effort.

01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:05.720
It comes up at the
peace conference.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:08.960
There could have been some
representatives from Russia

01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.260
at the peace conference.

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.660
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: The
question is how do you do that?

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:12.960
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
How do you do it?

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.260
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg:
So you're not going

01:27:14.260 --> 01:27:15.560
to invite the Bolsheviks.

01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.860
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: And
they wouldn't have come.

01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:18.160
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: And
they wouldn't have come.

01:27:18.160 --> 01:27:19.460
And you really don't want to
invite the whites, the czarists,

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:22.360
because you really don't want
Russia to become czarist again.

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.890
And I would just state,
I think you're right

01:27:24.890 --> 01:27:26.190
about the general perceptions.

01:27:26.190 --> 01:27:29.180
But there are specialists
working in these areas

01:27:29.180 --> 01:27:30.830
who are working in
these archives --

01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:33.260
and I've never worked in
Russian archives, but my friends

01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:36.450
who have, it is maddeningly
difficult.

01:27:36.450 --> 01:27:38.500
It makes working in the
French archives that I work

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:41.830
in look incredibly easy, and
that is saying something.

01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:43.130
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yes, yes.

01:27:43.130 --> 01:27:45.180
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: So there are
specialists working in Russia

01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:48.360
and the Ottoman Empire and
Italy and doing remarkable work.

01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:50.180
But it's not easy work to do.

01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:54.110
&gt;&gt; Harold James: I think it's
a very important question.

01:27:54.110 --> 01:28:01.240
And there are really bits of it
that are not sufficiently known

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:04.840
and not sufficiently understood.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:08.580
But you know, maybe because
I'm a financial historian

01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:12.810
so I come back to
these financial things.

01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:15.360
Russia found it, of
all the great powers,

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.100
the hardest to fight a world
war, a novel world war.

01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:23.500
They could fight a short war,
but they were out of resources.

01:28:23.500 --> 01:28:28.180
And at the beginning of
1915, as a result of that,

01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:32.310
there was really a
quite serious proposal

01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:37.760
that there should be a
political union between Britain,

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.680
France and imperial Russia.

01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:42.270
It's something that is
absolutely mind-boggling,

01:28:42.270 --> 01:28:44.400
you know, what it
would have looked like,

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.400
what it would have meant
for Russian reform.

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:50.650
It invites one of those
counter-factual speculations.

01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:51.950
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
Yes, it does.

01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:53.250
&gt;&gt; Harold James: But it might
well have been the better world,

01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:54.750
but that wasn't realized.

01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:57.660
And just the administrative

01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:02.370
and the financial strain
was in the end too much.

01:29:02.370 --> 01:29:04.340
What really destroyed Russia

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:10.700
in 1916 was the inability
to pay for the war.

01:29:10.700 --> 01:29:13.550
The consequence was
hyper-inflation of the kind

01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:17.990
that Germany had in the
middle of the 1920's, in 1923.

01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:21.740
And in this hyper-inflation,
people lost any sense of wanting

01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:24.260
to do anything and so the
economy just completely

01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:25.560
broke down.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.940
They couldn't feed
the troops anymore.

01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:29.310
And the soldiers
started to melt away.

01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:33.310
So it's an administrative,
bureaucratic collapse

01:29:33.310 --> 01:29:37.930
that has an inability
to fund the basis of it.

01:29:37.930 --> 01:29:39.230
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
You're going

01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:40.530
to have to put your hands up.

01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:41.830
I've got the lights in my eyes.

01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:43.130
Have we got another question?

01:29:43.130 --> 01:29:45.590
Oh, over there, thank you.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.890
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'd like to
go to a different part

01:29:50.890 --> 01:29:52.310
of the world for a second.

01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:57.320
The war had impacts all over
the world, including in Asia.

01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:04.850
Could you comment on how the
results of World War I led

01:30:04.850 --> 01:30:06.840
to changes in Asia

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:13.230
and specifically the US
increasing involvement in Asia

01:30:13.230 --> 01:30:17.070
in the lead-up to World War II?

01:30:17.070 --> 01:30:18.700
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
Should I start?

01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.000
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: Please.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.300
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: I mean,

01:30:21.300 --> 01:30:22.600
I think the United States
was already involved

01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:23.900
in Asia before the
First World War.

01:30:23.900 --> 01:30:26.120
And that involvement was
going to grow deeper.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.620
I mean, the United States
had a huge naval presence,

01:30:28.620 --> 01:30:31.210
and its acquisition of the
Philippines of course took it

01:30:31.210 --> 01:30:32.980
that much closer to
the mainland of Asia.

01:30:32.980 --> 01:30:36.480
And it had huge trading
interests as well.

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:38.200
What the First World
War did I think

01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:42.570
in Asia was it helped weaken
the great European empires

01:30:42.570 --> 01:30:44.370
and that was going to bring
about long-term change,

01:30:44.370 --> 01:30:46.920
although they didn't
appear immediately

01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:49.020
after the war to be weakened.

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:53.100
But they had been, and certainly
in India you had the development

01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:56.260
of a broadly-based
nationalist movement.

01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:59.190
What it did for two great
Asian powers is it left them

01:30:59.190 --> 01:31:01.420
with significant resentments.

01:31:01.420 --> 01:31:04.350
The Chinese were an ally
in the First World War

01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:07.180
and they contributed
not soldiers but labor.

01:31:07.180 --> 01:31:10.460
Something like 100,000 Chinese
laborers came and worked

01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:13.110
in the north of France, and
you can still see the graves

01:31:13.110 --> 01:31:14.850
of those who died there.

01:31:14.850 --> 01:31:18.270
And the Chinese felt that they
would gain what Germany had

01:31:18.270 --> 01:31:19.790
taken in China.

01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:22.700
European powers were dividing up
China before the First World War

01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:24.580
in what were called concessions.

01:31:24.580 --> 01:31:27.470
They'd get the exclusive
rights to develop mines

01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:30.100
or build railways or ports
in a particular area,

01:31:30.100 --> 01:31:32.500
of ten on 99-year leases.

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:37.250
And Germany had concessions
in the Shandong peninsula.

01:31:37.250 --> 01:31:38.640
And the Chinese thought,

01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.940
"Rightly we've contributed
to the war.

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:41.700
We'll get those back."

01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:44.350
Instead, the Allies
awarded them to Japan

01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:47.770
because Japan was also an ally
and Japan had contributed.

01:31:47.770 --> 01:31:49.150
There were Japanese naval ships

01:31:49.150 --> 01:31:51.830
in the Mediterranean
helping to patrol.

01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:53.390
And the Japanese
had at the beginning

01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:55.090
of the war seized the
German concessions

01:31:55.090 --> 01:31:58.130
in China plus various German
islands in the Pacific

01:31:58.130 --> 01:32:00.010
and those were awarded to Japan.

01:32:00.010 --> 01:32:03.200
Because the calculation made in
Paris was that China was weak

01:32:03.200 --> 01:32:06.620
and divided and helpless and
Japan was coming to power,

01:32:06.620 --> 01:32:08.760
and better to keep on
good terms with Japan.

01:32:08.760 --> 01:32:10.460
And so the Chinese
resented this.

01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:13.770
It became part of what was
called the May 4th movement

01:32:13.770 --> 01:32:17.770
which was a nationalistic
cultural movement of resentment

01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:19.070
and resistance to the west.

01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:21.220
And it I think led fairly
directly to the establishment

01:32:21.220 --> 01:32:22.980
of the Chinese communist party.

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:26.070
Because up to this point,
Chinese nationalists had looked

01:32:26.070 --> 01:32:27.860
to the west; they
believed in liberal ideas,

01:32:27.860 --> 01:32:29.160
they believed in democracy.

01:32:29.160 --> 01:32:31.870
And this really helped
to change it.

01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:34.800
The Japanese got what they
wanted but not everything.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.150
And what they wanted in
the mandate of the League

01:32:37.150 --> 01:32:39.860
of Nations was a racial equality
clause as it was called,

01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:43.720
a clause which said something
about no discrimination

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:45.570
on the basis of religion.

01:32:45.570 --> 01:32:48.520
But what the Japanese wanted was
no discrimination on the basis

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:50.590
of ethnicity and it
wasn't put in that way.

01:32:50.590 --> 01:32:53.040
It was race in those
days, they called it.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:55.610
And they didn't get it because
Woodrow Wilson was worried

01:32:55.610 --> 01:32:56.960
about opposition at home.

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:00.520
The Australians were
vehemently opposed to it;

01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:03.530
so were the South
Africans on racial grounds.

01:33:03.530 --> 01:33:05.910
And so the Japanese didn't
get everything they wanted.

01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:08.470
And that led to an undercurrent
and eventually it came

01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:11.330
up into the surface in
Japan that, "We contributed

01:33:11.330 --> 01:33:13.870
to the First World War but the
western powers still will never

01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:15.170
treat us as equals."

01:33:15.170 --> 01:33:18.040
And it fed into the
enhanced Japanese militarism

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.840
and nationalism of the 1930's

01:33:20.840 --> 01:33:22.430
with really profound
consequences.

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:24.700
So the First World
War had in a number

01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:27.520
of ways a really
real impact on Asia,

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.640
which in some ways we're
still seeing the results of.

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.820
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: The
only thing I would add

01:33:31.820 --> 01:33:34.010
to that brilliant
erudite description

01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:36.010
of a complex problem
very quickly is

01:33:36.010 --> 01:33:38.500
that it is exactly the
Shandong peninsula question

01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:42.190
that drives people like
Tasker Bliss to disillusion

01:33:42.190 --> 01:33:43.700
with the Paris Peace process.

01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:47.170
It gives away every principle

01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:49.400
that Bliss believed the United
States had entered the war

01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:50.700
to fight.

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:54.380
And Bliss who's a dedicated
career soldier actually thought

01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:56.060
about resigning his commission.

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:59.290
And he and several members
of the US delegation talked

01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:00.750
about a joint resignation

01:34:00.750 --> 01:34:03.180
until they realized it
just wouldn't matter.

01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:05.460
And Bliss rights this
very beautiful letter back

01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:08.660
to his wife in which he says,
"The only good thing that came

01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.910
out of Shandong is my
conscience is clear."

01:34:10.910 --> 01:34:15.260
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan: I would
just add this conversation

01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:19.310
underscores the degree to which
Wilson is a complicated figure.

01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:25.680
Because we tend to think
about him as this idealist,

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:27.410
forward-leaning visionary.

01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:29.610
But he was also a racist,

01:34:29.610 --> 01:34:32.770
particularly here in
the United States.

01:34:32.770 --> 01:34:34.690
And he was an imperialist.

01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:38.010
He was one of the most
interventionist presidents

01:34:38.010 --> 01:34:41.740
in American history when it
comes to the western hemisphere.

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:47.070
In fact, he tried to pass
what was essentially the Platt

01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:48.520
Amendment for Nicaragua.

01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:52.260
The Platt Amendment came out
of the Spanish-American War

01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:55.440
and it basically said the
United States can intervene

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.440
in your country whenever
we feel like it.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.740
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yeah.

01:34:59.740 --> 01:35:03.030
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan: And the
Senate actually rejected it.

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:05.900
I don't remember what it
was called, the equivalent

01:35:05.900 --> 01:35:07.200
to the Platt Amendment.

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:12.650
So just to underscore that
this is a complicated guy.

01:35:12.650 --> 01:35:15.170
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
If I can just add a quote

01:35:15.170 --> 01:35:17.200
from a British diplomat
before the First World War.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.300
He said, "I am going to teach
the South American republics

01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:20.600
to elect good men."

01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.900
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: Right.

01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:23.410
[ Laughter ]

01:35:23.410 --> 01:35:24.710
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yeah.

01:35:24.710 --> 01:35:26.650
Is someone over there?

01:35:26.650 --> 01:35:27.950
Yeah, just back there.

01:35:27.950 --> 01:35:29.250
Thank you.

01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:34.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think one term you
sort of touched on with Japan

01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:37.470
and what I think is really
important is respect.

01:35:37.470 --> 01:35:40.890
I think Germany in part
went to World War I

01:35:40.890 --> 01:35:44.550
because they were a new
great emerging power

01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:49.170
and they didn't think they
got the respect they deserved.

01:35:49.170 --> 01:35:51.750
And then I think the Treaty

01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:55.980
of Versailles was extremely
disrespectful in their mind.

01:35:55.980 --> 01:35:59.940
But also with Italy, they
didn't think they got respect.

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:02.630
Japan didn't think they got
the respect they deserved.

01:36:02.630 --> 01:36:07.400
These are the countries that
go Fascist after the war.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:10.800
And I think that's an
important aspect of this.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:14.330
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: I'll ask
the panel if they agree or not.

01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:22.570
&gt;&gt; Harold James: It may be worth
telling the story of the article

01:36:22.570 --> 01:36:27.810
in the Treaty of Versailles
that created the most problems

01:36:27.810 --> 01:36:31.930
and the most resentment in
Germany and why it was inserted.

01:36:31.930 --> 01:36:35.220
So it's article 231.

01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:37.800
It's at the beginning of
the reparation section

01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:39.320
of the peace conference.

01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:40.870
And it's the war guilt clause.

01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:46.950
And the story of the debate
over who is responsible

01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:50.890
for the First World War was
one that went on and on right

01:36:50.890 --> 01:36:53.380
through the 1920's and beyond.

01:36:53.380 --> 01:36:55.510
I mean, indeed up to this day.

01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:57.430
And the foreign offices

01:36:57.430 --> 01:37:00.360
of all the big powers produced
these editions of documents

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:03.400
that showed that it
wasn't them that did it.

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:07.800
It's quite a plausible case.

01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:10.320
So why put this into the treaty?

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:17.870
Well, it was a relatively young
Princeton graduate lawyer called

01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:21.910
John Foster Dulles who
insisted that this be included

01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:24.080
because the argument
was a very legal one,

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:26.990
that you can't impose
an indemnity

01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:28.970
without specifying the tort.

01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:32.400
So there has to be something
that has been done long.

01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:35.360
And in order to justify
the restoration claim

01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:38.310
which was done simply
for the financial reasons

01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:41.980
that we started out with, you
had to insert this tort clause.

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:48.090
And it's the tort clause
that is endlessly the subject

01:37:48.090 --> 01:37:54.000
of pushback in the German
case, in the democracy.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:55.300
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: To
me it's less respect

01:37:55.300 --> 01:37:58.300
than it is justifying
to your people the cost.

01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:02.230
So again the case I know best,
the French, there's nothing

01:38:02.230 --> 01:38:04.850
in the Treaty of Versailles,
and I mean nothing in the Treaty

01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:07.320
of Versailles, that explains
to the average French man

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.990
or woman why 1.2 million
Frenchmen are dead.

01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:12.700
The recovery of Alsace-Lorraine
just doesn't do it.

01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:14.000
They don't care.

01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.390
The extension of
concession rights

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:17.800
in Syria just doesn't do it.

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:20.050
So the question that the
French are asking at the end

01:38:20.050 --> 01:38:23.070
of the war isn't so much,
did we get our respect?

01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:25.730
It's, tell us again
why we did this.

01:38:25.730 --> 01:38:27.970
Tell us again what went wrong.

01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:29.570
That's to me the fundamental.

01:38:29.570 --> 01:38:32.140
And again, to me that's
a sociocultural problem

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:35.090
that a political document
isn't going to fix.

01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:36.390
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan:
I would just add

01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:40.480
that I do think respect
is extremely important.

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:45.380
If I think today about the
grievances that a country

01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:51.000
like Russia or China brings to
the table, a lot of it has to do

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:54.360
with humiliation and respect.

01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:57.390
You know, the Chinese feel that
they were the Middle Kingdom

01:38:57.390 --> 01:39:00.520
for centuries and then
they started to skid

01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:03.890
in the 19th century and they
have been given the back

01:39:03.890 --> 01:39:06.160
of the hand ever since.

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:09.170
The Russians, they
propagate that same narrative.

01:39:09.170 --> 01:39:12.430
So in some ways, respect
and humiliation are

01:39:12.430 --> 01:39:14.560
in the eyes of the beholder.

01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:18.830
But there's no question that it
is an extremely powerful tool

01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:20.820
in the hands of leaders.

01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:23.280
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: We've got
a question over here somewhere?

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.250
We've got at least two.

01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:28.550
Oh, sorry.

01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:31.560
Is there -- I'm not
seeing very well.

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.380
Anything over here?

01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:36.680
What about the people in the
middle who have been very quiet?

01:39:36.680 --> 01:39:37.980
Okay, here we go.

01:39:37.980 --> 01:39:39.280
Thank you.

01:39:39.280 --> 01:39:40.580
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:39:40.580 --> 01:39:46.580
I think there's been some
mention of the Middle East,

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:50.020
but in your book, there's a lot
of discussion about the Treaty

01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:53.300
of Versailles and the effect on
countries of the Middle East.

01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:54.600
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yeah.

01:39:54.600 --> 01:39:57.420
Well, what came out of the Paris
Peace Conference was a series

01:39:57.420 --> 01:39:59.690
of arrangements, and they
were sort of consolidated

01:39:59.690 --> 01:40:03.070
at conferences after the peace
conference formally ended

01:40:03.070 --> 01:40:05.930
about how to divide up
the Arab territories

01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:07.230
of the Ottoman Empire.

01:40:07.230 --> 01:40:09.330
And the British and
French and Russians

01:40:09.330 --> 01:40:13.460
and Italians actually during the
war had arranged how they would

01:40:13.460 --> 01:40:14.760
divide them up.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:17.530
The Ottoman Empire had been the
sixth man of Europe for so long.

01:40:17.530 --> 01:40:20.300
They felt it was probably
doomed to disappear

01:40:20.300 --> 01:40:22.230
and indeed it did disappear.

01:40:22.230 --> 01:40:23.530
And there was a feeling,

01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:25.170
and I don't think
Woodrow Wilson disagreed,

01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:28.440
that these people weren't
yet ready to rule themselves.

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:31.480
I mean, Wilson was all
for self-determination

01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:34.500
for what he saw as advanced
peoples or advanced races.

01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:36.190
I mean, this is the way
they talked in those days.

01:40:36.190 --> 01:40:38.780
At one point there was a
question of having a mandate

01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:42.000
over some part of Europe.

01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:43.940
Wilson said, "You
can't have mandates

01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:46.280
over civilized peoples."

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.030
But the peoples in the
Middle East and the peoples

01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:49.760
in Africa were seen
as not yet being ready

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.880
to govern themselves,
if they ever would be.

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:55.020
It was seen that the Arabs
were probably further along.

01:40:55.020 --> 01:40:57.920
And so part of what came out
of the Paris Peace Conference

01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.920
and these subsequent
arrangements was an arrangement

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.420
that -- by this point Russia of
course was no longer involved

01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:04.720
because it was in revolution.

01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.090
And Italy had really
dropped out in a way.

01:41:08.090 --> 01:41:11.070
It had fallen out with
its former allies.

01:41:11.070 --> 01:41:13.270
So really it was the
British and the French

01:41:13.270 --> 01:41:14.740
who divided up the Middle East.

01:41:14.740 --> 01:41:16.960
The Americans were withdrawing.

01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.370
Woodrow Wilson had
gone back to the US.

01:41:18.370 --> 01:41:21.030
He had lost the treaty
fight in the Senate.

01:41:21.030 --> 01:41:23.440
He was of course very
sick and was really not

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:24.870
in a position to do very much.

01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:27.770
And I think the US was
turning its back on Europe

01:41:27.770 --> 01:41:29.570
and beginning to regret.

01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:33.760
[ Inaudible ]

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:36.070
The question is, is
today's turbulence

01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:37.370
in the Middle East
an inheritance?

01:41:37.370 --> 01:41:38.670
A lot of people would say so,

01:41:38.670 --> 01:41:42.810
because the Arabs were
not consulted really

01:41:42.810 --> 01:41:44.850
on how these countries are
going to be divided up.

01:41:44.850 --> 01:41:48.080
Having said that, a number of
the countries, Iraq for example,

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.980
were created using boundaries
from the old Ottoman Empire.

01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:55.580
Syria was carved up
a bit more and part

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:57.800
of what traditionally had
been seen as Syria was given

01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:01.530
to a greater Lebanon, and that's
still resented by Syria today.

01:42:01.530 --> 01:42:04.690
What also happened of
course is at the same time

01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:06.640
as the Arabs were being
secretly divided up,

01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:07.980
they didn't know
this was happening,

01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:09.470
they were also being
encouraged to revolt

01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:11.850
against the Ottoman
Empire with the promise

01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:13.320
of some sort of Arab
independence.

01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:15.670
And the third thing that
was happening was the Baltha

01:42:15.670 --> 01:42:18.300
Declaration which part

01:42:18.300 --> 01:42:22.580
of the former Ottoman Empire was
promised for a Jewish homeland.

01:42:22.580 --> 01:42:27.040
And so these three came together
really to be resented enormously

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:29.350
by many peoples living
in the Middle East.

01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:33.480
However, if I just could finish
here, I think there's a danger

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:34.780
in saying that things

01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:36.730
that happened 100 years
ago are responsible

01:42:36.730 --> 01:42:38.410
for all the problems of today.

01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:42.100
And I do think there's a
tendency particularly among

01:42:42.100 --> 01:42:45.020
intellectuals and leaders
and others in the Middle East

01:42:45.020 --> 01:42:47.630
to blame all their
problems on outsiders.

01:42:47.630 --> 01:42:50.370
And it seems to me
they've certainly got a lot

01:42:50.370 --> 01:42:51.750
that they can blame
on outsiders,

01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:54.570
but they've also got
responsibility for themselves.

01:42:54.570 --> 01:42:58.840
And I do think it's being
psychologically crippling

01:42:58.840 --> 01:43:01.550
for people in the Middle East
to be able to keep on saying,

01:43:01.550 --> 01:43:03.230
"None of it's our fault."

01:43:03.230 --> 01:43:07.330
And I'm not suggesting there's
any easy solution to this,

01:43:07.330 --> 01:43:11.180
but it seems to me
that 100 years later,

01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:14.120
can you really blame
arrangements that were made

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.350
in 1919 for everything
that's gone wrong

01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:17.650
in the Middle East since?

01:43:17.650 --> 01:43:18.950
I mean, there have been
dictatorial regimes

01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:20.620
that have been unrepresentative
regimes.

01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:23.050
There have been tyrants.

01:43:23.050 --> 01:43:24.350
It's difficult.

01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:26.380
I mean, I'm not saying I know
the answer, but I don't know

01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:27.680
if the rest of the panel --

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:28.980
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: I
was going to say one

01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:31.290
of the things I'm happiest
about at the Army War College is

01:43:31.290 --> 01:43:35.580
that my seminar group decided
that the wars America's fighting

01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:37.530
in the Middle East should
together be called the War

01:43:37.530 --> 01:43:39.010
of the Ottoman Succession.

01:43:39.010 --> 01:43:40.740
[ Laughter ]

01:43:40.740 --> 01:43:42.680
In other words, that we're
still trying to figure

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:45.380
out what political structure
will govern that part

01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:46.680
of the world 100 years later.

01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:49.270
And I take Margaret's point 100%

01:43:49.270 --> 01:43:50.670
that I don't even
believe the Treaty

01:43:50.670 --> 01:43:53.650
of Versailles can be
cited as a proximate cause

01:43:53.650 --> 01:43:55.690
of the Second World War because
of everything that happens

01:43:55.690 --> 01:43:57.330
in the 20 years in between.

01:43:57.330 --> 01:43:59.800
Nevertheless, as Margaret
pointed out actually

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:02.110
in her book, the treaty
actually has two histories:

01:44:02.110 --> 01:44:04.140
what it actually did
and what people kind

01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:05.660
of remember that it did.

01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:07.890
And both of those things
are very important.

01:44:07.890 --> 01:44:09.190
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yeah.

01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:10.490
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan: I would
just add to bring this

01:44:10.490 --> 01:44:14.630
up to the present day, if you
go into the '20's and the '30's,

01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:16.270
I think one of the reasons

01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:21.420
that we became isolationist is
Americans were questioning both

01:44:21.420 --> 01:44:25.690
the realist and the idealist
rationale for World War I.

01:44:25.690 --> 01:44:27.460
And they were coming
up empty-handed,

01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:30.430
and that's what began the
narrative particularly strong

01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:35.300
in the 1930's that this was
a war pushed upon us by banks

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:37.490
and by finance and
by corporations.

01:44:37.490 --> 01:44:38.790
The Nigh Committee.

01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:40.090
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
And arms manufacturers.

01:44:40.090 --> 01:44:41.390
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan:
And arms manufacturers.

01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:43.560
Because they couldn't come
up with another explanation.

01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:47.160
And I think we're now
starting that narrative

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.730
about the Middle East.

01:44:48.730 --> 01:44:53.320
Because if you look at
Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria,

01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:56.720
Libya and you say, "What
do we have to show for it?

01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.650
And is the Middle
East going our way?"

01:44:59.650 --> 01:45:01.850
The answer is no.

01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:05.720
And that is why I think we're
right now in this weird kind

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:09.110
of warp where the president
of the United States says,

01:45:09.110 --> 01:45:11.490
"We're getting out
of Syria tonight."

01:45:11.490 --> 01:45:13.710
And then the secretary resigns

01:45:13.710 --> 01:45:16.110
and then Putin says,
"Oh no, we're not."

01:45:16.110 --> 01:45:19.630
And it's a mess because we
are seeing this debate play

01:45:19.630 --> 01:45:21.580
out before our eyes.

01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:22.880
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Sorry,

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:25.460
we can continue this
discussion later,

01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:27.030
but I've got one
person back there who'd

01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:28.330
like to ask a question.

01:45:28.330 --> 01:45:30.370
So if you don't mind,
I think it was someone

01:45:30.370 --> 01:45:31.700
in the middle back
here had their hand up.

01:45:31.700 --> 01:45:33.090
Yes, that gentleman.

01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:34.390
Thanks.

01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:38.180
&gt;&gt; You implied that if
Wilson had brought some real

01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:43.420
Republicans to Paris, that the
handling of the treaty back

01:45:43.420 --> 01:45:45.180
in the United States
might have been different.

01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:47.650
Would he really have
been capable

01:45:47.650 --> 01:45:52.070
of having some Republicans with
clout with him at the treaty?

01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:53.700
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
Well, Roosevelt did.

01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:56.570
FDR made it bipartisan.

01:45:56.570 --> 01:45:57.870
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg:
Very self-consciously.

01:45:57.870 --> 01:45:59.170
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yeah.

01:45:59.170 --> 01:46:00.470
I think he learned
a lesson, don't you?

01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:01.770
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg: Yeah.

01:46:01.770 --> 01:46:03.070
He was picking his secretary
of war and secretary of navy

01:46:03.070 --> 01:46:05.350
who were Republicans
consciously which is something

01:46:05.350 --> 01:46:09.150
that didn't happen during at
least the war years for Wilson.

01:46:09.150 --> 01:46:10.450
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yeah.

01:46:10.450 --> 01:46:11.750
&gt;&gt; Michael Neiberg:
It's possible.

01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:13.050
Again, we don't know.

01:46:13.050 --> 01:46:14.350
I mean, it's possible that those
Republicans could have come

01:46:14.350 --> 01:46:17.050
to Paris and been as
appalled as Bullitt and Bliss

01:46:17.050 --> 01:46:20.390
and others were, and those
were people who admired Wilson.

01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:21.700
And they might have
come back and said,

01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:24.520
"You can't believe the
mess that we just saw."

01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:27.510
I mean, that's distinct
possibility as well.

01:46:27.510 --> 01:46:28.810
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Yeah.

01:46:28.810 --> 01:46:30.270
I think we've had
a long session.

01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:31.950
I think people probably
want a reception.

01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:33.250
Is it short?

01:46:33.250 --> 01:46:34.550
&gt;&gt; It's short.

01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:35.880
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan: Okay.

01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:38.050
Hang on. Let's get
you a microphone.

01:46:38.050 --> 01:46:44.830
&gt;&gt; The question relates to
Wilson's personal psychology.

01:46:44.830 --> 01:46:47.740
Was he coming apart
in many ways?

01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:53.280
And had he been more vigorous
in the Paris Peace Conference,

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.470
might there have been, do you
think based on your research,

01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:58.980
a vastly different outcome?

01:46:58.980 --> 01:47:03.280
&gt;&gt; Harold James: Well, if I
may, it's very, very interesting

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.580
and important question.

01:47:04.580 --> 01:47:07.070
Because it's a question
about the health

01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:09.360
of the president of
the United States.

01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:11.710
[ Laughter ]

01:47:11.710 --> 01:47:17.460
And the story is indeed
that Woodrow Wilson suffered

01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:21.070
from an enormously
high blood pressure,

01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:22.520
untreated blood pressure.

01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:23.960
There's a wonderful older work

01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:28.000
by a Philadelphia physician
called Park which tries

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:31.120
to explain the nature of
international failures

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:37.530
of the 1920's and '30's in
terms of the blood pressure

01:47:37.530 --> 01:47:40.000
and the strokes and the
case of Woodrow Wilson.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:45.190
In the Great Depression,
Ramsey McDonald was suffering

01:47:45.190 --> 01:47:47.010
from Alzheimer's disease.

01:47:47.010 --> 01:47:50.440
Paul von Hindenburg the
German president who handed

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:54.710
over essentially to Hitler was
in advanced Alzheimer's disease.

01:47:54.710 --> 01:47:59.210
So it does raise exactly
that kind of question.

01:47:59.210 --> 01:48:03.760
And I think he had
a stroke in Paris

01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:06.740
and it clearly incapacitated
him.

01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:08.040
&gt;&gt; Charles Kupchan: Yeah.

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:10.920
I would add that I think
we should be careful not

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:16.830
to overstate how much depends
upon the particular individual.

01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:20.200
Because I do think that coming
back to some of the comments

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:26.130
that Michael made, that the
nation was not in a situation

01:48:26.130 --> 01:48:30.170
in which a bipartisan
center was available.

01:48:30.170 --> 01:48:33.410
Really beginning in the
1890's, the Democrats

01:48:33.410 --> 01:48:36.840
and the Republicans
split on foreign policy.

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:40.970
And Bryan who ran several
times for the presidency ran

01:48:40.970 --> 01:48:45.140
on a very anti-imperialist
platform.

01:48:45.140 --> 01:48:49.010
And you really saw the two
parties go their separate ways,

01:48:49.010 --> 01:48:51.170
and so it would have
been hard for Wilson

01:48:51.170 --> 01:48:53.830
to find the raw material.

01:48:53.830 --> 01:48:57.690
One of the things that FDR
and those after him found was

01:48:57.690 --> 01:48:59.770
that the country had changed,

01:48:59.770 --> 01:49:02.270
largely because of
industrialization.

01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:05.890
And a lot of southerners
moved to the northeast.

01:49:05.890 --> 01:49:09.270
A lot of people enjoyed
rising incomes during

01:49:09.270 --> 01:49:10.570
and after World War II.

01:49:10.570 --> 01:49:15.510
And that created a sweet spot
or bipartisanship when it came

01:49:15.510 --> 01:49:19.650
to foreign policy that
Wilson did not have.

01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:23.940
And that we lost here
beginning in 1994.

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:29.060
And right now if you look at
how much bipartisanship is there

01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:32.230
on anything, the
answer is very little.

01:49:32.230 --> 01:49:34.950
And it's new that the
bipartisanship is gone

01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:36.350
on foreign policy.

01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:39.830
Because it used to be
restricted to domestic policy;

01:49:39.830 --> 01:49:42.800
now it's infected everything.

01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:44.100
&gt;&gt; Margaret MacMillan:
On that cheerful note --

01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:45.730
[ Laughter ]

01:49:45.730 --> 01:49:48.560
If I could on your
behalf ask you to thank --

01:49:48.560 --> 01:49:51.280
I meant to mention
this at the beginning,

01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:53.380
but there's also a great
team at the Kluge Center

01:49:53.380 --> 01:49:54.680
who have done all this work

01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:56.570
and have prepared
a reception for us.

01:49:56.570 --> 01:49:58.850
So Dan Torello and all the
people he's worked with,

01:49:58.850 --> 01:50:00.150
I think we should also thank.

01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:03.730
But can I ask on your behalf,
may I thank the panel for this?

01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:05.030
Thank you.
