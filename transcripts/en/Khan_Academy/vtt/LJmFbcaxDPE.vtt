00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
SAL: Let's say I have
some weak acid.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.770
I'll call it HA.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.030
A is a place holder for really a
whole set of elements that I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.590
could put there.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.340
It could be fluorine, it could
be an ammonia molecule.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.400
If you add H it becomes
ammonium.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.090
So this isn't any particular
element I'm talking about.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.170
This is just kind of a general
way of writing an acid.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.330
And let's say it's in
equilibrium with, of course,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.520
and you've seen this multiple
times, a proton.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.846
And all of this is in
an aqueous solution.

00:00:36.846 --> 00:00:39.350
 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.080
Between this proton jumping
off of this and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.300
its conjugate base.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:44.820
A minus.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.510
And we also could have written
a base equilibrium, where we

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.370
say the conjugate base could
disassociate, or it could

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:55.770
essentially grab a hydrogen from
the water and create OH.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.170
And we've done that
multiple times.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.970
But that's not the point
of this video.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.160
So let's just think a little bit
about what would happen to

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.580
this equilibrium if we were
to stress it in some way.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.780
And you can already imagine that
I'm about to touch on Le

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.410
Chatelier's Principle, which
essentially just says, look,

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.850
if you stress an equilibrium
in any way, the equilibrium

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.930
moves in such a way to
relieve that stress.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:28.755
So let's say that the stress
that I apply to the system--

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.870
Let me do a different color.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.990
I'm going to add some
strong base.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.100
That's too dark.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.490
I'm going to add some NaOH.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.240
And we know this is a strong
base when you put it in a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.050
aqueous solultion, the sodium
part just kind of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.570
disassociates, but the more
important thing, you have all

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.030
this OH in the solution, which
wants to grab hydrogens away.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.860
So when you add this OH to the
solution, what's going to

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.720
happen for every mole that you
add, not even just mole, for

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.250
every molecule you add of this
into the solution, it's going

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.900
to eat up a molecule
of hydrogen.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.190
Right?

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.360
So for example, if you had 1
mole oh hydrogen molecules in

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.140
your solution and you added 1
mole of sodium hydroxide to

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.270
your solution, right when you do
that, all this is going to

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.530
react with all of that.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.790
And the OHs are going to react
with the Hs and form water,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.320
and they'll both just kind of
disappear into the solution.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.390
They didn't disappear, they
all turned into water.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.220
And so all of this hydrogen
will go away.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.160
Or at least the hydrogen that
was initially there.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.890
That 1 mole of hydrogens
will disappear.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.980
So what should happen
to this reaction?

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.690
Well, know this is an
equilibrium reaction.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:49.470
So as these hydrogen disappear,
because this is an

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.200
equilibrium reaction or because
this is a weak base,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.130
more of this is going to be
converted into these two

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.110
products to kind of make up
for that loss of hydrogen.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.160
And you can even play
with it on the math.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.920
So this hydrogen goes down
initially, and then it starts

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.700
getting to equilibrium
very fast.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.600
But this is going to go down.

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.770
This is going to go up.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.540
And then this is going
to go down less.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.520
Because sure, when you put the
sodium hydroxide there, it

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.270
just ate up all of
the hydrogens.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.930
But then you have this-- you can
kind of view as the spare

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.440
hydrogen capacity here
to produce hydrogens.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.010
And when these disappear,
this weak base will

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.950
disassociate more.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.460
The equilibrium we'll move
more in this direction.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.190
So immediately, this will
eat all of that.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.010
But then when the equilibrium
moves in that direction, a lot

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.040
of the hydrogen will
be replaced.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.840
So if you think about what's
happening, if I just threw

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.350
this sodium hydroxide
in water.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:54.470
So if I just did NaOH in an
aqueous solution-- so that's

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.120
just throwing it in water-- that
disassociates completely

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:05.260
into the sodium cation
and hydroxide anion.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.810
 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.540
So you all of a sudden
immediately increase the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.320
quantity of OHs by essentially
the number of moles of sodium

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.060
hydroxide you're adding,
and you'd immediately

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.089
increase the pH, right?

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:20.470
Remember.

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.510
When you increase the amount of
OH, you would decrease the

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.940
pOH, right?

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.975
And that's just because
it's the negative log.

00:04:31.975 --> 00:04:34.700
So if you increase OH, you're
decreasing pOH, and you're

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.220
increasing pH.

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.170
And just think OH-- you're
making it more basic.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.530
And a high pH is also
very basic.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.360
If you have a mole of this, you
end up with a pH of 14.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.790
And if you had a strong acid,
not a strong base, you would

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.490
end up with a pH of 0.

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.300
Hopefully you're getting a
little bit familiar with that

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.860
concept right now, but if it
confuses you, just play around

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.260
with the logs a little bit and
you'll eventually get it.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.780
But just to get back to the
point, if you just did this in

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.150
water, you immediately get a
super high pH because the OH

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.290
concentration goes
through the roof.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.220
But if you do it here-- if you
apply the sodium hydroxide to

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.750
this solution, the solution that
contains a weak acid and

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.400
it's conjugate base, the weak
acid and its conjugate base,

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.690
what happens?

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.320
Sure, it immediately reacts with
all of this hydrogen and

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.090
eats it all up.

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.740
And then you have this extras
supply here that just keeps

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.300
providing more and
more hydrogens.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.200
And it'll make up a
lot of the loss.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.760
So essentially, the stress
won't be as bad.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.670
And over here, you dramatically
increase the pH

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.130
when you just throw
it on water.

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.150
Here, you're going to increase
the pH by a lot less.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.690
And in future videos, will
actually do the math of how

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.930
much less it's increasing
the pH.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.800
But the way you could think
about it is, this is kind of a

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.390
shock absorber for pH.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.500
Even though you threw this
strong based into this

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.660
solution, it didn't increase
the pH as much as you would

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:04.540
have expected.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.620
And you can make it
the other way.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:08.320
If I just wrote this exact
same reaction as a basic

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:12.040
reaction-- and remember,
this is the same thing.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.360
So if I just wrote this as, A
minus-- so I just wrote its

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.720
conjugate base-- is in
equilibrium with the conjugate

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.760
base grabbing some
water from the

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.640
surrounding aqueous solution.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.850
Everything we're dealing
with right now

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:30.480
is an aqueous solution.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.830
And of course that water that
it grabbed from is not going

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.360
to be an OH.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.880
Remember, are just equivalent
reactions.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.020
Here, I'm writing it as
an acidic reaction.

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.600
Here, I'm writing it is
a basic reaction.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.060
But they're equivalent.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:42.470
Now.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.470
If you were to add a strong
acid to the solution, what

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:47.390
would happen?

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:51.460
So if I were to throw hydrogen
chloride into this.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:54.920
Well hydrogen chloride, if you
just throw it into straight up

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:58.350
water without the solution, it
would completely disassociate

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:01.530
into a bunch of hydrogens and
a bunch of chlorine anions.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.120
 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.110
And it would immediately
make it very acidic.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.270
You would get to
a very low pH.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.510
If you had a mole of this-- if
your concentration was 1

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.380
molar, then this will
go to a pH of 0.

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.360
But what happens if you at
hydrochloric acid to this

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.450
solution right here?

00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:22.750
This one that has this
weak base and its

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.160
conjugate weak acid?

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.350
Well, all of these hydrogen
protons that disassociate from

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.380
the hydrochloric acid are all
going to react with these OHs

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.280
you have here.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.670
And they're just going to
cancel each other out.

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:37.820
They're just going to merge with
these and turn into water

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.050
and become part of the
aqueous solution.

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:44.280
So this, the OHs are going to
go down initially, but then

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.220
you have this reserve
of weak base here.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.690
And Le Chatelier's Principle
tells us.

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.370
Look, if we have a stressor that
is decreasing our overall

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:57.640
concentration of OH, then the
reaction is going to move in

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.290
the direction that relieves
that stress.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:02.930
So the reaction is going to
go in that direction.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:06.180
So you're going to have more of
our weak base turning into

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.260
a weak acid and producing
more OH.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:12.760
So the pH won't go down as much
as you would expect if

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.020
you just threw this in water.

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.100
This is going to lower the pH,
but then you have more OH that

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:20.420
could be produced as this guy
grabs more and more hydrogens

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.450
from the water.

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.310
So the way to think about it is
it's kind of like a cushion

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:30.150
or a spring in terms of what a
strong acid or base could do

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.580
to the solution.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.084
And that's why it's
called a buffer.

00:08:33.084 --> 00:08:38.890
 

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:41.780
Because it provides a
cushion on acidity.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.670
If you add a strong base to
water, you immediately

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.840
increase its pH.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.990
Or you decrease its acidity
dramatically.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.665
But if you add a strong base
to a buffer, because of Le

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:54.940
Chatelier's Principle,
essentially, you're not going

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.430
to affect the pH as much.

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.040
Same thing.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.650
If you add and acid to that same
buffer, it's not going to

00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:03.880
affect the pH as much as you
would have expected if you had

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:06.860
thrown that acid in water
because the equilibrium

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.070
reaction can always kind of
refill the amount of OH that

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.420
you lost if you're adding acid,
or it can refill the

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.090
amount of hydrogen you lost
if you're adding a base.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.190
And that's why it's
called buffer.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:20.090
It provides a cushion.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:23.250
So it give some stability
to the solution's pH.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:28.440
 

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.410
The definition of a buffer is
just a solution of a weak acid

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:36.450
in equilibrium with its
conjugate weak base.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.460
That's what a buffer is, and
it's called a buffer because

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.450
it provides you this kind
of cushion of pH.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.580
It's kind of a stress absorber,
or a shock absorber

00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.500
for the acidity of a solution.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.710
Now, with that said, let's
explore a little bit the math

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:55.090
of a buffer, which is really
just the math of a weak acid.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.580
So if we rewrite the equation
again, so HA is in

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:03.150
equilibrium.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.170
Everything's in an
aqueous solution.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:11.330
With hydrogen and its
conjugate base.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:14.530
We know that there's an
equilibrium constant for this.

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.620
We've done many videos
on that.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.400
The equilibrium constant here is
equal to the concentration

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.830
of our hydrogen proton times
the concentration of our

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:27.740
conjugate base.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.390
When I say concentration,
I'm talking molarity.

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.710
Moles per liter divided by the

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:36.020
concentration of our weak acid.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:37.270
Now.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.485
 

00:10:41.485 --> 00:10:44.520
Let's solve for hydrogen
concentration.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.330
Because what I want to do is I
want to figure out a formula,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.780
and we'll call it the
Hendersen-Hasselbalch Formula,

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:52.630
which a lot of books want you
to memorize, which I don't

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:53.210
think you should.

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:55.430
I think you should always just
be able to go from this kind

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:57.910
of basic assumption
and get to it.

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:00.240
But let's solve for the hydrogen
so we can figure out

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.810
a relationship between pH and
all the other stuff that's in

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:03.460
this formula.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.460
So, if we want to solve for
hydrogen, we can multiply both

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.180
sides by the reciprocal
of this right here.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:16.060
And you get hydrogen
concentration.

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.280
Ka times-- I'm multiplying
both sides times a

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:21.300
reciprocal of that.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:26.340
So times the concentration of
our weak acid divided by the

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:32.050
concentration of our weak base
is equal to our concentration

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.410
of our hydrogen.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.690
Fair enough.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.090
Now.

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:39.890
Let's take the negative
log of both sides.

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:50.590
So the negative log of all of
that stuff, of your acidic

00:11:50.590 --> 00:12:01.640
equilibrium constant, times HA,
our weak acid divided by

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.540
our weak base, is equal to the
negative log of our hydrogen

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.340
concentration.

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.000
Which is just our pH, right?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.500
Negative log of hydrogen
concentration is-- that's the

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:16.070
definition of pH.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.240
I'll write the p and the
H in different colors.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.790
You know a p just means
negative log.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:22.210
Minus log.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:22.580
That's all.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.770
Base 10.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.250
Let's see if we can simplify
this any more.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:29.670
So our logarithmic properties.

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:34.140
We know that when you take the
log of something and you

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:36.370
multiply it, that's the same
thing as taking the log of

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:38.000
this plus the log of that.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:49.370
So this can to be simplified to
minus log of our Ka minus

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:57.340
the log our weak acid
concentration divided by its

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.100
conjugate base concentration.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.880
Is equal to the pH.

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.175
Now, this is just the pKa of our
weak acid, which is just

00:13:09.175 --> 00:13:12.990
the negative log of its
equilibrium constant.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.000
So this is just the pKa.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.740
And the minus log
of HA over A.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.830
What we can do is we could make
this a plus, and just

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.820
take this to the
minus 1 power.

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:24.100
Right?

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.600
That's just another logarithm
property, and you can review

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.780
the logarithm videos if
that confused you.

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.980
And this to the minus 1 power
just means invert this.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:36.120
So we could say, plus the
logarithm of our conjugate

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:40.980
base concentration divided by
the weak acid concentration is

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.450
equal to the pH.

00:13:43.450 --> 00:13:45.110
And this right here,
this is called the

00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:49.250
Hendersen-Hasselbalch
Equation.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:52.240
And I really encourage you
not to memorize it.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.520
Because if you do attempt to
memorize it, within a few

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.220
hours, you're going to
forget whether this

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:58.900
was a plus over here.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.010
You're going to forget this,
and you're going to forget

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:04.190
whether you put the A minus or
the HA on the numerator or the

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.990
demoninator, and if you forget
that, it's fatal.

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:08.140
The better thing is to just
start from your base

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.470
assumptions.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:10.000
And trust me.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.100
It took me a couple minutes to
do it, but if you just do it

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.170
really fast on paper-- you don't
have to talk it through

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.920
the way I did-- it'll take
in no time at all to

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.120
come to this equation.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.520
It's much better than memorizing
it, and you won't

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.770
forget it when you're
30 years old.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:24.590
But what's useful about this?

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:29.550
Well, it immediately relates pH
to our pKa, and this is a

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:31.900
constant, right, for
an equilibrium?

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:36.110
Plus the log of the ratios
between the acid and the

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.340
conjugate base.

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:42.240
So the more conjugate base I
have, and the less acid I

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.940
have, the more my pH is
going to increase.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:45.130
Right?

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:47.740
If this goes up and this
is going down, my

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.740
pH is going to increase.

00:14:48.740 --> 00:14:49.780
Which makes sense
because I have

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:51.390
more base in the solution.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.700
And if I have the inverse of
that, might be just going--
