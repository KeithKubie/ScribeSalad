KRISTIN DAVIS: Hi, everybody.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.890
KRISTIN DAVIS: You're very
impressive with your laptops.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:18.784
It's like we're at school

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:22.060
DIANE SOLINGER: Well, to
formally welcome you, welcome

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.900
to this Talk at Google.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.170
I'm Diane Solinger.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.780
I'm the manager of Googler
Social Responsibility.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.689
Our team is the one that is
launching and hosting the

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.420
Hunger Relief campaign
that you may have

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.880
seen throughout Google.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.690
And this is a part
of the campaign.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.340
There's a three legged
stool with the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.850
Hunger Relief campaign.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.410
It's about learning
about the issue.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.690
And then it's about taking some
action, giving, and also

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:50.470
volunteering.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.860
And there's been amazing
activities across Google over

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.630
the course of the last month,
where Googlers are stepping up

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.940
to donate, to take the quiz to
learn more about hunger.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.330
And then we make a gift
on your behalf.

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.190
Or to volunteer in their local
communities, kind of

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.010
culminating next week with Alan
Eustace's huge food drive

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.010
here on the Mountain
View campus.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.380
So thank you all for being a
part of the Hunger Relief

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980
campaign, and for
being Googlers.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.280
You're fantastic and charitable
people that amaze

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.270
me every day at the interest
and the spirit and kind of

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.990
this unbridled will to try to
save the world and do great

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.470
things in the world every day.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.980
And thank you for being a part
of the Hunger Relief campaign.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.080
If you want to learn more
about it, you just go to

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.160
Hunger Relief.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.630
And there's been some things
on your chair, as well.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.140
Take the quiz. $10 will be
donated to a project of your

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.880
choosing through a global
giving platform.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.430
Some of the Oxfam projects
are actually

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.860
listed there, as well.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.990
So to kick off today, I'm just
going to introduce who our

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:54.270
panelists are.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.730
We have a wonderful panel
discussion here.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.680
Introducing Kristin Davis, star
of "Sex in the City" and

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.960
ambassador for Oxfam America.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.290
KRISTIN DAVIS: Hi,
how are you?

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.000
I'm happy to be here.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.270
I have been to New
York Google.

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.660
I'm getting educated
on the Googlers.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.824
I'm very impressed.

00:02:11.824 --> 00:02:13.320
DIANE SOLINGER: We're impressed
with you, too, for

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.960
doing what you're doing.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.130
We have Ray Offenheiser, who is
the CEO of Oxfam America.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.680
And Kristin serves as ambassador
for Oxfam America.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.790
And she'll talk a little bit
about her experiences.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.850
Susan Godwin is a farmer from
Nigeria who is really someone

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.540
who's going to tell us her
personal story about hunger

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.740
relief, and how she's really
making a go as a small farmer

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.420
in her country and in her
community, and getting others

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.670
inspired to do the same.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.710
And we have Aarti Sequeira.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.120
Did I say it right?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.970
Close?

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:53.460
AARTI SEQUEIRA: Sequeira.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.785
DIANE SOLINGER: Sequeira.

00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:55.355
AARTI SEQUEIRA: It's
fine, it's fine.

00:02:55.355 --> 00:02:56.130
DIANE SOLINGER: So sorry.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.260
AARTI SEQUEIRA: You got
the first name.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.260
DIANE SOLINGER: But you're
Aarti Party, right?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.210
AARTI SEQUEIRA: People
have asked me if

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.600
party's my last name.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.640
DIANE SOLINGER: She's
the host of "Aarti

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.890
Party" on the Food Network.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.130
And was the winner of season
six of the "Next Great Food

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.510
Network Star," right?

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.740
Fantastic.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.390
So going to start
really with an

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.910
opening question to Kristin.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.640
Because your story of getting
involved with Oxfam, choosing

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.740
Oxfam, and then some of the
experiences that you have.

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.590
We'd love to just start with
you, and hear why, and what

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.310
you're doing.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.930
KRISTIN DAVIS: Absolutely.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.970
After the tsunami in 2004, I
believe it was, in Indonesia,

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.100
I was doing some research about
who would be staying in

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.580
the region and helping
the farmers get

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:38.390
their businesses back.

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.480
Because I'd been to Indonesia,
and I knew how they lived.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.690
And how basic their
businesses were.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.330
And how it had really been taken
away by the tsunami.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.690
And while giving to
organizations that do the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.590
immediate relief in a
devastating situation is

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.250
obviously important, it's also
important to think about

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.380
helping the people develop their
businesses back so that

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.980
they can be self-sustaining.

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.200
And what I learned in that
research was that Oxfam kind

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.300
of specializes in that.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.020
We specialize in a
lot of things.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.250
We do do immediate disaster
relief as well.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.410
But we stayed in Indonesia
for eight years?

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.530
Five years.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.390
And then we continued on.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.260
We're still there.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.740
And after Katrina, we stayed in
New Orleans and the whole

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.360
Gulf region for five years as
well, helping people get their

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.820
lives back and their
businesses back.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.850
So that's the thing for me that
I think is so special and

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.500
impressive.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.780
Because it's not an
easy thing to do.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.020
You really have to commit.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.060
You really have to be in a
region and understand the

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.540
culture and the people and
what's going on for them.

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:36.800
And kind of be able to do a lot
of different things to be

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.800
able to help people be
self-sustaining,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.060
which is the goal.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.040
Our goal is not to create a
culture of need, where you're

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.030
constantly needing an
aid organization.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.840
We want people to be back up on
their feet, which is what

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.540
people all over the world that
I've met my travels with Oxfam

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:52.320
want as well.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.900
Everybody wants to work.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.920
Everybody, as we will hear
today, wants to be able to

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.480
make a living and feed
their family.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.080
And that's what Oxfam tries to
help people do if they're in a

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.220
situation where they can't.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.370
So that's, personally,
what I really love.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.060
I've traveled all around the
world, predominately Africa.

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.940
I focus on women's issues.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.490
Because they really
affect everyone.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.370
They affect the children.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.550
They affect the next
generation.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.570
And there's obviously many,
many issues for

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:16.840
women around the world.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.900
And I love it.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.810
If I could just quite my regular
job, sometimes, I

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.190
would just try to be Ray.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.440
Though I would never
live up to him.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.950
That was a short story.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:27.870
Tell me, anything else?

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.620
DIANE SOLINGER: No,
that's fantastic.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.900
So with respect to women and
some of the women that you've

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.570
met in your travels, I saw a
part of the BBC clip when you

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:35.480
were in a refugee camp.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.790
Was that near Somalia, Somalian
refugees in Kenya?

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.030
Or where was that?

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.380
KRISTIN DAVIS: Those words
Somalian refugees in Kenya,

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.790
just over the border
from Somalia.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.340
And that was actually a trip
that I had gone on to go to

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.050
Tanzania to launch the Female
Food Hero, which is what Susan

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.210
ended up winning, which was a
competition we were having for

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:56.060
female farmers, which is now
a huge predominance of the

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.460
farmers in especially
sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.100
But all over the world, most
of the farmers and small,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.420
private farms are women now,
which is a little known fact,

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:08.040
and quite fascinating.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.120
And we were there, we were
meeting these incredibly

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.830
successful women farmers
in Tanzania.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.670
They were growing 12
different crops.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.340
They were feeding their families
and their sisters'

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.410
families and everyone's
families.

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:18.540
And it was very inspiring.

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.800
And at the same time, this
horrible drought was unfolding

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.730
in Northern Africa.

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.430
And we were getting these
numbers of how many people

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.160
were flooding into Dadaab.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.660
So we were so close that we
decided that we should go and

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.800
try to see the situation
for ourselves.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.470
And when we got there, is was
a really horribly shocking

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.630
contrast to see the number of
people who literally had no

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.750
safety net available to them in
any way for themselves or

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.000
their children or
their families.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.560
I could talk for an
hour about it.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.540
But it was shocking that in a
modern world that we live in

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.270
today, where things are
accessible, there is enough

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.650
food to feed everyone
in the world.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.780
Yet, it is not available to
everyone in the world.

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.550
And to see just the dire, dire,
dire circumstances of

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:09.840
those people was really
heart-wrenching.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.510
Everyone tries to keep me
from talking about this.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.340
Because I can't talk about
it without crying.

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:15.460
But it is the truth.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.170
I mean, there are
really shocking

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.570
situations that happen.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.710
And there are a lot of people
who are trying to help.

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.340
So it's great to be part of
the trying to help group.

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:24.470
DIANE SOLINGER: Absolutely.

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:27.940
And kind of the longer term
sustainability piece of it is

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.220
what Susan's representing.

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.360
You mentioned women taking care
of their families, their

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.570
communities, bringing others
in through farming.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.110
So tell us about your
experiences, Susan.

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:39.480
And what's happening in your
life, because your life's

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.594
really been transformed.

00:07:41.594 --> 00:07:43.980
SUSAN GODWIN: Good afternoon.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:48.300
I'm Susan Godwin, a small scale
farmer from Nigeria.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.950
In fact, I was farming for
more than 10 years.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.430
But I don't have enough food
to eat with my family

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.870
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:57.180
to send my kids to school.

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:02.620
Not until when I meet with the
Oxfam program, which was sent

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:06.160
down to my community,
of which I enrolled

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.250
myself into the program.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:11.850
And after receiving all the
training, the training was all

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:16.300
about capacity building for
small scale farmers, which I

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:18.390
adopt a new method of farming.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:21.370
We are also trained to do some
little business attached to

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.980
our farm work.

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.170
And also train to add a little
value to whatever we produce,

00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.610
so that we can have
more money.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.679
So when I get that knowledge, I

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.809
quickly put it into practice.

00:08:34.809 --> 00:08:37.865
And I see my lifestyle
was changing.

00:08:37.865 --> 00:08:41.120
I can be able to feed
my family well.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.480
Assist other women in my
community to take good care of

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:46.600
their own family, too.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.750
And my life was changed to
good with my community.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.860
So that is the short story
I have to give for now.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.240
Maybe later, I explain more.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:08:59.790
DIANE SOLINGER: Susan,
what are your crops?

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.270
Because you had to learn a whole
new way of farming, but

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.050
then you also changed what you
were planting, correct?

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.560
So you're growing what?

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.080
What do you grow?

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.250
SUSAN GODWIN: My major crop I
grow was yam and peanuts.

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:17.830
I farm a little of sorghum to
feed my family, and cassava.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:21.500
But the major crop was
yam and peanuts.

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.860
It wasn't even enough for
me to eat with my

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.500
family at the beginning.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.520
But now, things change.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.290
DIANE SOLINGER: And you're
selling peanut butter, peanut

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:34.820
oil, right?

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.030
And you're leasing
your equipment to

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:38.030
other people now, too?

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.130
So you've got a business
going on here.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:42.240
SUSAN GODWIN: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:50.030
So when I quickly adopt that
methods, for the first year,

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:51.550
my harvest change.

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.700
I was having no less than, or
not more than five bags of

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.835
dried peanuts in the year.

00:09:56.835 --> 00:10:01.220
But now, I have up to
17 for that year.

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.485
And my yam, I normally
get less than 1,000

00:10:03.485 --> 00:10:05.490
tubers of yam a year.

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:09.960
But I was able to get up to
2,000 for that year, which I

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.140
know I have much money.

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:15.450
I have to sell some of the crops
that I produce to buy a

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:19.950
machine, to add value to my
own peanuts that I grow.

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:23.230
So the first machine,
I was using it.

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:25.160
And I was the first person
to start that

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.020
business in my community.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.790
So the business was
moving so fast.

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:33.205
I was doing it commercially for
people, and use this to do

00:10:33.205 --> 00:10:36.000
my own personal groundnut that
I found from the farm also to

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.160
get more money.

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.090
And out of the money,
I work for people.

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.660
I normally buy some of the
groundnut and so add to my own

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:46.030
when the market goes up.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:48.230
Then I sell it to
have more money.

00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:51.030
So I was doing it like that
for the first year.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:53.600
The second year, I now
have much money.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:57.850
I have to go and buy five more
machine, which I need to add

00:10:57.850 --> 00:11:00.560
more value to my peanuts.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.330
This time around, I wanted
to maybe struck

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.900
oil out of the peanuts.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.980
And have the oil, and sell
out the groundnut.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.480
So this time, the
machine are six.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.200
And I needed more hand to
operate the machine.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:17.250
I have to employ other women.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:21.160
Give them a little chance of job
opportunity, so that they

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.960
will work on the machine.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:25.610
And I get them paid at
the end of the day.

00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:28.420
So while we are doing this, I
also get them into group and

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.140
encourage them that the money
they are getting, they should

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:31.910
not spend it all.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:34.460
But they should try to
be saving something.

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.890
So that they can have money to
start their own businesses, of

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:40.110
which they did.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.090
After the first year, they have
a little morning that

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.190
they can start their
own businesses.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.600
After one, two, three years,
some of them now have their

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.560
personal machine that
they are working on.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.080
And they even employed other
less privileged women, too, to

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:56.040
work for them.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.720
And they get them paid.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:02.470
They also encourage them to do
some group savings, so that at

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:05.250
the end of the year, they can
also get something to start

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:07.300
their own business with.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.490
So this has been helping us.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:10.910
Before, no money.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.930
The men take charge of
everything that we have.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:19.050
If they want, they only train
the boys, leaving the girls

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.970
that their education has
more value, go to

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:23.760
their husband's house.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:27.080
So we women, so far in
it, we don't have

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.880
means to help our daughters.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.210
We look at it, so far, we may
not want our daughter to come

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:33.860
and face the same
thing tomorrow.

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.820
So with this little chance I
have, I now put more knowledge

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.700
on the women that we should
train our ladies so that

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.130
tomorrow, they will help our
community and help fight back

00:12:45.130 --> 00:12:48.070
this bad situation that
we are living in.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:54.500
Because down there in Nigeria,
you find out what the woman

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.980
has is for the man and
not for the woman.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:58.720
You don't have right
to spend whatever

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.630
you have for yourself.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:01.980
Let's say that I have
a model now.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.060
I have much money.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.840
I want to build a house
for my mother.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.020
I cannot do it-- or
for my father--

00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:09.600
unless my husband agreed
before I will do it.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.320
So that has been a problem.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.930
We now look at it, if we can
send our daughters to school,

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.090
maybe tomorrow they will
know their rights.

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.770
They will know how to fight
this thing back.

00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:21.500
And they will live better
than we are doing now.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.430
So in most of the communities,
there are a lot of challenges

00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:26.410
in doing this.

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:29.400
Because the men normally come
to me and say, Susan, you

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:31.860
better stop this thing
that you are

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.320
putting our wives into.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.080
Why do you make them to
come and work for

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.370
you and have money?

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.920
Our wives, we are [INAUDIBLE]
to ask all this.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.980
When we tell them to
eat, they eat.

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:42.350
When we tell them not to
eat, they sleep hungry.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.140
Why are you forcing them to
eat all the time now?

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.340
They are our wives, making
troubles with us because they

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:49.800
have something at hand.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:50.540
We don't want it.

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:51.960
We want you to stop it.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:56.690
What I always tell them is, they
should be kind with them.

00:13:56.690 --> 00:13:58.370
Because the women also
have rights.

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:01.310
They want something that will
help their future and their

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:02.180
children, also.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.380
So I talk to some of
them in that way.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.590
And some get to understand.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.930
Now, they are saying, Susan,
don't forget our wives.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:14.870
Because our wives help us to
take care of our family.

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.050
If there is anything good, you
try to let our wives know so

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:19.650
that you can carry them along.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.240
But some up to now, they
don't understand.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.260
They keep on fighting.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.000
At times, they even
harass my husband.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.800
You should tell your wife Susan
to stop taking our wives

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.240
outside, even those
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.480
So it has been like that.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:40.070
But the more hands that are
coming in, and the women are

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.210
getting what they want, and
taking good care of their

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:48.330
family, I think almost all the
problem is coming to an end.

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:50.680
Now the women themselves
have a lot of

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.080
machines they work on.

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.360
So when I was seeing my market
cannot longer move as it is

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.385
before, we have more than 50
houses now that have a machine

00:15:00.385 --> 00:15:02.130
on their own to operate.

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:05.400
Just because of one particular
person that start their

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.330
business, the business is all
over the community now and

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.480
around the community.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.020
So I quickly leave that
business on to them.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:15.610
I jump into selling
the machine parts.

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:16.180
Because when--

00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:17.970
DIANE SOLINGER: You
are so smart.

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:21.556
This is one smart entrepreneur
here.

00:15:21.556 --> 00:15:24.200
SUSAN GODWIN: You have to travel
to the town if you are

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.980
buying a lot of tatsi Naira.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.160
I don't know how to say your
money, so please pardon me.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.810
If you are buying a lot
of tatsi Naira.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.570
You have to spend 300 Naira.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.110
To go to the town, your
transportation, before buying

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.490
that note of tatsi Naira.

00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:40.600
So instead of that, I then
bought the spare parts of the

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.070
machine from the town,
and bring it and sell

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:45.290
at 40 Naira to them.

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:49.050
So to help them to save
their transport.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:51.460
And my market is also moving.

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:56.600
So one of the challenges I
have, after attending the

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.730
World Food Prize in Iowa, when
I went back home on the 24th

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:04.940
of December, when I gathered
some men to go and help me do

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:11.230
my heaps in my farm, only to go
there to discover that the

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:15.170
heaps that was done on my behalf
by my husband, the heap

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.300
was destroyed.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.050
So they now quickly call my
attention that my heap has

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:22.000
been destroyed.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.140
Am I aware of it?

00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:24.340
I say I don't.

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.330
So when I went, I went to the
person that I hired the land.

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:31.240
Because as a woman, you
don't own a land.

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.180
You have to hire from the
men, and work on it.

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.720
And where you want to hire, the
men now make sure that the

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.150
land they give you is not
the fertile land.

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:42.560
Because they don't want you
to get enough crop.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.840
Where you get so much harvest,
maybe you will

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.100
look down on them.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.180
So the land that was
given to me--

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.740
DIANE SOLINGER: A lot of social
norms that you're

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.775
trying to change while
you're doing this.

00:16:52.775 --> 00:16:53.420
It's hard.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.010
SUSAN GODWIN: So from that,
the heaps was destroyed.

00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:02.880
And what I get to do now,
I now buy cow, two

00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:03.450
of the young cow.

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.880
Because when I was here,
I was taken to farms.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:08.520
I see so many farms with
rearing animals.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.560
I said, OK.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.960
If there will no land, that
will not wear me down.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.940
Let me transfer to animal.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:17.230
So that is what I'm
trying to do now.

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.800
Thank you.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:18.030
DIANE SOLINGER: Wow.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.365
Three businesses
going on there.

00:17:19.365 --> 00:17:22.040
Phew!

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:22.575
Thank you.

00:17:22.575 --> 00:17:24.550
KRISTIN DAVIS: What a great,
great story, Susan.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:26.040
You're so impressive.

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.380
Wow.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.770
DIANE SOLINGER: So Ray, let's
kind of take it up a level.

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:33.320
And talk about the whole, the
food system in general.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.170
And give us, first of all,
Oxfam's mission, what you do,

00:17:37.170 --> 00:17:37.900
why you exist.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:41.360
And then explain to us the whole
systematic issue with

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.130
respect to the fact that there's
enough food in the

00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:45.216
world, but it's not getting
to everybody.

00:17:45.216 --> 00:17:46.810
RAYMOND OFFENHEISER: Well, first
of all, I just want to

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:50.040
say, just thinking a little bit
about Susan's story, what

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.380
you're looking at here is an
entrepreneur, feminist, and a

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.270
human rights activist all
rolled up into one.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.377
So kind of an interesting
embodiment of

00:17:57.377 --> 00:18:00.510
what we're after here.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.670
Let me just quickly, Oxfam's an
international development,

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:03.960
humanitarian organization.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.600
And our mission is really, in
some ways, to echo what Susan

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.610
said, to create lasting
solutions to hunger, poverty,

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:10.810
and social injustice.

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.620
Not to actually be remaining
in these countries forever.

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.980
Our hope is that one day, we
leave and people like Susan

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.720
are sort of taking over and
running the country, and

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.360
providing food for their
population in ways that are

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.080
going to meet everyone's
needs.

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.660
We live and work in
those regions.

00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:29.370
And so we know the hunger and
poverty challenges quite well.

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.540
There's 900 million people
in the world

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.340
today that are hungry.

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.650
This is a UN statistic that's
pretty recognized.

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:38.360
It's a very, very big number,
almost a billion.

00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.030
In fact, it crossed
a billion in 2008

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:41.310
with the hunger crisis.

00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:43.780
And it's fallen back a bit as
conditions have gotten a

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.460
little bit better.

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.890
I think one of the great ironies
that Kristin actually

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:51.870
mentioned is the fact that we
live in a world where actually

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:55.290
there is enough food
to go around.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.320
And the issues of hunger have
more to do oftentimes with

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.720
justice and access than they
have to do with pure supply.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.330
And we saw that dramatically
with the food

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:05.670
price crisis in 2008.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.810
It wasn't a question
of supply.

00:19:06.810 --> 00:19:09.360
It was a question of whether
people could actually afford

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.710
to buy the food.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:15.510
And so for us, the real issues
around hunger are not just

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.740
simply whether we produce
enough, or a

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.290
pure nutrition problem.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:21.860
It's actually a justice
question.

00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:25.130
And it's oftentimes about issues
that we don't often

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:27.510
talk about when we talk
about food and hunger.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.380
We think all we need to do
is provide more food.

00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:31.260
And actually, that may
not be the solution.

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:32.270
It's often about justice.

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:34.050
It's about access, about
market failure.

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:35.290
It's about policies.

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:38.190
It's about abuse of power
in different contexts.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:41.060
Whole range of complicated
issues that sort of constitute

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.530
the reasons in different
national contexts why people

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:46.920
aren't getting food, and aren't
adequately nourished.

00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.310
At the end of the day, these are
the kinds of issues that

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.720
Oxfam tries to address
in our policy work.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.390
And we can talk a little bit
more about that further into

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:54.415
the conversation.

00:19:54.415 --> 00:19:56.830
But I think maybe the bottom
line here is if we're going to

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:01.010
win the global hunger game, if
I can call it that, I think

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.720
what we need to be really
thinking about is changing the

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.210
rules which enable people to get
access, get investment of

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:09.180
the sort that you just heard
Susan getting, and taking

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.280
advantage of those investments,
investing in

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.190
women, and thinking about how we
deal with some of the other

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:16.690
big challenges like
climate change

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:19.260
that loom on the horizon.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.900
And the big challenge, maybe
thinking forward, is we will

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.090
be a world with 9 billion
people by 2050.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:28.930
And there's some real challenges
as to how we're

00:20:28.930 --> 00:20:31.160
going to feed that 9
billion by 2050.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:34.360
And when we think about issues
of climate change, impacts on

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.480
environment, impacts on
productivity, do we have the

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.120
approaches and the will to
meet that challenge?

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:46.000
DIANE SOLINGER: It really is,
it's a right to have food.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:46.280
Right?

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.235
RAYMOND OFFENHEISER: Some
countries, actually, the

00:20:47.235 --> 00:20:52.370
interesting thing is India has
actually made food a right.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.240
And they're trying
to figure out--

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.010
there you go.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.480
And it's an interesting
question.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.910
One of the things Oxfam had come
to realize was that there

00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:01.700
are a whole--

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.370
when the Human Rights Charter
was signed in 1947, it was

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:06.550
about civil and political
rights.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:09.950
But it was also about social,
economic, and cultural rights.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:11.850
But during the Cold War,
we lost sight of that.

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.740
But at the end of the Cold War,
I think there's a real

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.590
opportunity to ask questions
like, should there be a right

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:17.340
to education?

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.470
Should there be a
right to food?

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:19.690
Some of these basic needs.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:21.540
Or a right to health services.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.935
And other countries around
the world are

00:21:23.935 --> 00:21:24.690
actually embracing this.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.960
And the right to food is one
that, in the case of India,

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:27.810
has been embraced.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.660
And actually, they have programs
now to be executed to

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:33.445
actually realize that right
for their population.

00:21:33.445 --> 00:21:35.380
They're not always working as
well as they could, but they

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.060
are, in fact, under way.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:39.900
DIANE SOLINGER: So at Oxfam,
you're kind of dealing

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.310
literally at the highest policy
level, but also in

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.960
supporting courses like
Susan took to

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.800
transform the way she farms--

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.370
this whole spectrum of ways of
dealing with the issues.

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:52.930
RAYMOND OFFENHEISER: What we've
learned over the years

00:21:52.930 --> 00:21:56.550
is we can't solve these kinds of
issues at the local level.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:58.940
In some ways, we could have
great programs, and we did for

00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:01.210
many, many years at the village
level, and in certain

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:02.420
regions of countries.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:06.140
But we could address those
problems and have the sort of

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.540
satisfaction that we've solved
the problem in a sort of, if

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.310
you will, an island
of well being

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.540
surrounded by a sea of misery.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.250
And we realized that we had to
look beyond the problem at the

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:20.000
local level, and figure out
what was actually keeping

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.710
those people poor.

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.950
Why were they not accessing
inputs for agriculture, or

00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:27.970
credit And the answer we came
up with was that poverty is

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.480
not necessarily about
the absence of

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.620
those goods for people.

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:32.990
It's about questions
of access.

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:36.920
And we end up defining poverty
as social exclusion.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.960
And then trying to figure out,
if poverty is social

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.570
exclusion, that means there are
certain barriers that are

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:42.640
limiting people's access.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.230
And so what are those
barriers?

00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:45.230
How can they be addressed?

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:47.680
Oftentimes, they're about
ethnic conflict.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.710
Sometimes, they're about
policies that

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.450
governments have in place.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:54.940
And it leads us to be much more,
I suppose you might say,

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:57.500
systems thinkers, like many of
you here in the room are, in

00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.820
thinking about the
poverty problems.

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:01.730
And trying to sort of analyze,
what are the big systemic

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:04.900
barriers that can unleash the
kind of human potential that

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.910
you just heard unleashed in
Susan's African village?

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.670
Just think about what has been
spawned by her initiative and

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:14.080
those of her sisters in her
particular village.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.960
And why wasn't that happening
a long time ago?

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.360
What was limiting that
from happening?

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.070
And how can we help we attack
these kinds of issues

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.460
systemically, and leverage
far greater change?

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:28.160
DIANE SOLINGER: My team knows
I'm a big fan of this book

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.490
called "Switch," which Chip and
Dan Heath wrote, very much

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.620
focused on the idea
of bright spots.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:36.480
Susan's a bright spot.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.470
It works.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.358
So how does Oxfam, or how do
you in your celebrity, and

00:23:41.358 --> 00:23:43.910
you, Aarti, as well, how do
you take something that's

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.690
working well, and share that
story so that it is

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:47.660
replicated?

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.070
And find out the things that
made that, what was the secret

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.270
sauce with Susan's, that
made it work for her?

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:56.310
KRISTIN DAVIS: Well, I think,
Ray is our president, right,

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.090
of Oxfam America?

00:23:57.090 --> 00:24:00.640
So luckily, he is incredibly
knowledgeable about

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.940
everything, which is amazing.

00:24:01.940 --> 00:24:04.100
And to pick his brain is
a wonderful thing.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.020
And he can deal up here
on the policy level.

00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:07.360
I do not mess with that.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.360
I let the professionals
do that.

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.170
What I get to do is I get to
meet people like Susan in

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:16.200
their villages, in their
countries, and see what just

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.380
some knowledge, some
effort, can do.

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:23.640
And to me, it's completely life
changing for me, as well.

00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.020
Because it doesn't take--

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.130
I feel like sometimes what
happens for us here in

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:29.560
America, I know for me before
I started my travels with

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.950
Oxfam, you feel like these
issues are overwhelming.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:33.400
And that they cannot
be changed.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.500
And why should we try?

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:35.630
Sometimes, you get
really down.

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:38.770
Like it just seems like there's
so many problems in

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:42.330
the world, and even in
our own country.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:43.600
You're just overwhelmed.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.200
But once you go out and you see
how hard people want to

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:47.870
work-- like Susan was
there, wanting to

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:49.270
work this whole time.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.430
But because we've seen time
after time after time when the

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:54.140
husband are like, no, no, no.

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.690
And you're like, why would you
say no to your woman starting

00:24:58.690 --> 00:24:59.300
a business?

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:01.070
It is so crazy for
us to think that.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:03.900
But there are really ingrained
social issues.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:06.140
Like if a woman is not
allowed to own land,

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:07.610
just mull that over.

00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:09.910
I've been to so many countries
where that's true.

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.710
Where their husbands might die,
they and their children

00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:14.010
are kicked out of the house.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:16.390
And the husband's family takes
the house and the land.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:17.870
And that's just how it is.

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:21.080
Then a little bright spot, as
you said, Mozambique, which

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.100
was one of my first trips, a
group of women lawyers had

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.230
left Mozambique to get
their law degrees.

00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:28.850
And had come back to
help their country.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.550
And part of what they did was
they really focused on trying

00:25:31.550 --> 00:25:33.730
to change the law so that
women could own land.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:35.520
So they worked very hard
for a very long time.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:37.280
And they eventually did
change this law.

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.640
But the problem being, nobody
knew that the law was changed.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:46.010
Partly because there are 26, I
think, local tribal languages

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.380
in Mozambique, something
like that.

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.650
And they are really hard
to understand.

00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:52.990
And so no one was really
communicating with everybody.

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.300
And also, they couldn't
read the papers.

00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.910
So what these women lawyers then
thought, and this is part

00:25:58.910 --> 00:26:00.440
of what I love about Oxfam,
is they helped them.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.040
They thought, well, we need
to get the word out there.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:02.910
How could we do that?

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:05.320
We could start a radio program,
where different

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.760
people would come
who spoke these

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:07.720
different tribal languages.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.930
And talk about it, so that
people might hear it.

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.320
Then the next thing they did,
which we got to see, was they

00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.100
started a little theater
troupe that

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.120
would go to the villages.

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.050
And you'd sit on the ground, and
the little theater troupe

00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:17.490
would come in.

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:18.820
It would be all women.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.640
And the women would dress
up as the men.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.100
And they'd do, [GRUMBLING].

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.470
It was like a comedy thing.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:26.340
But it was all about AIDS.

00:26:26.340 --> 00:26:28.570
So all of us were like,
should we laugh?

00:26:28.570 --> 00:26:29.270
What should we do?

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:30.330
It was really confusing.

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:32.090
But it was about how the husband
dies of AIDS, and then

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.310
the woman feels she must marry
the brother so that she

00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:35.800
doesn't get kicked
out of the house.

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.526
And then, a woman would come
in and say, no, no, no, you

00:26:38.526 --> 00:26:39.150
don't have to.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.160
You can own the land.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.750
And everyone would
be like, ahh!

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:44.180
And we were like,
this is amazing.

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:47.450
So it was finding the way to get
the word out that this law

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:49.830
had been changed after these
women worked so hard

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:50.870
to change the law.

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:54.310
And that's Oxfam helping these
people to come up with this

00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:56.760
project and that project
to get the job done.

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.425
And then you see that women can
own their own land, and

00:26:59.425 --> 00:27:00.950
farm, and still have a home
for their children.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.330
And aren't put out on the street
by people who aren't

00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:06.230
necessarily nice to them.

00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.900
What was the question?

00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.490
I'm so sorry.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:10.430
DIANE SOLINGER: Fabulous
bright spot there.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.690
KRISTIN DAVIS: Welcome
to my mind.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:12.730
DIANE SOLINGER: I want to
bring Aarti in to the

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:13.940
conversation, as well.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.760
Because I think there's
this idea of local--

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.050
KRISTIN DAVIS: It's just
telling the stories.

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:19.790
That's all.

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:20.490
I'm just here to witness.

00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:21.360
DIANE SOLINGER: You tell
great stories, Kristin.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:21.940
That was awesome.

00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:22.690
KRISTIN DAVIS: That is my job.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.540
I am here to witness.

00:27:23.540 --> 00:27:25.370
That is how I look at it.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:26.950
Because I do feel like
it is inspiring.

00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:29.310
I feel like, Susan's story, like
hearing Susan's story,

00:27:29.310 --> 00:27:30.960
you're like, wow.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.730
I mean, that is amazing.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.730
And I could help somebody
do that.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:36.250
And that makes you
feel connected.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.550
And it makes you feel hopeful.

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.560
So that's how I look
at my job.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.160
DIANE SOLINGER: And Aarti,
I think something--

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.330
you're a foodie, let's
face it, right?

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.600
But you've also been really a
bit of an activist, I think,

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.350
about saying what you can do to
make a difference in your

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:55.480
daily life that helps with food
related security issues.

00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:55.670
AARTI SEQUEIRA: Yeah.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.600
I think that, and I don't
think I'm alone here, so

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.305
please raise your hand, that
probably the most we've ever

00:28:02.305 --> 00:28:04.520
been told growing up about what
we can do about world

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.730
food shortages is clean
your plate.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:09.470
Because there are starving
people in, insert country

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:10.290
here, right?

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.920
I mean, who has heard
that growing up?

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:15.500
That is not going
to do anything.

00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.700
So the thing that I love about
Oxfam and the Grow campaign,

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.250
if I can throw that out there,
is that it makes it very easy

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:29.420
for us, here, to make choices
in the way that we shop, the

00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:33.970
way that we cook, the way that
we don't waste quite as much

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.690
of our vegetables.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:37.990
Super guilty of that.

00:28:37.990 --> 00:28:40.650
That we can make these very
simple choices, and have a

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:46.120
real ding dang impact on food
shortages around the world.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.560
My dad, his side of the family
is a farming family.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:51.710
They grew rice.

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.410
And so I've heard the stories of
what happens when you don't

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.220
have enough rice that year.

00:28:58.220 --> 00:28:59.520
It's pretty dire.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.410
So I guess in a way, it's
pretty personal to me.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:05.600
And so it's very empowering
on this level.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.820
I mean, I think the thing that
is so amazing about listening

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.560
to Susan is that she
sounds very proud.

00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.720
We're not just talking
about food here.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.490
Food is sort of one of those
sacred things where when you

00:29:17.490 --> 00:29:21.340
feed somebody, or when you teach
someone how to cook, if

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.750
I could be so bold, you're
sort of telling them,

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:25.570
I care about you.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:26.800
You're important.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.690
And you are able to do
a lot of things.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:30.790
And I believe in you.

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.280
And so I think that
that's why this is

00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.390
such a powerful campaign.

00:29:34.390 --> 00:29:34.880
And--

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:35.950
DIANE SOLINGER: Explain
the Grow campaign

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:36.580
a little bit more.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.760
Because I'm not sure if Googlers
know much about it.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.570
AARTI SEQUEIRA: Well, I I
have a terrible memory.

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:41.050
But--

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:42.850
DIANE SOLINGER: We'll have Ray
here as the backup, right?

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:44.000
AARTI SEQUEIRA: Ray,
back me up, buddy.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.580
So there's five steps.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:46.990
There's five different
things you can do.

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:50.590
So one of them is, and you
guys might already do it,

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.000
meatless Monday.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:53.070
Not a big deal.

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:55.450
Eat some beans instead
of some meat.

00:29:55.450 --> 00:30:03.145
And that, raising meat, takes
up an awful lot of water.

00:30:03.145 --> 00:30:04.720
A ton of water.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.870
And so if you just did that, you
can save like 14 bathtubs

00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:12.820
of water, just by not eating
meat on Monday.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.200
That's pretty simple, especially
because you guys

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.950
have an amazing cafeteria
here.

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:21.240
And the fact is you make
a difference with

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.140
the money you spend.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.240
So if once a week, you're not
buying meat, you're telling

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.350
people something.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:30.640
Another thing is
to waste less.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:35.200
We waste like 1 in 16 apples,
is that right?

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:38.700
So instead of doing
that, buy less.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:40.100
Go to the store a little
more often.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.480
That's what I do.

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:43.340
And then you have to come
up with a strategy.

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:46.270
So whatever's left at the end of
the week, you make a soup.

00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:47.680
Or you make a frittata.

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:49.080
Or you make a scramble.

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.980
Or you put it in some sauce
and put it over pasta.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:53.800
So you just don't waste
those vegetables.

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:57.290
Because it took energy, and it
took money, and it took fuel

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.970
to get those vegetables
to you, or whatever

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.540
it is you're using.

00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:03.820
And then, what's another
one, Roy?

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:04.780
RAYMOND OFFENHEISER:
Buy seasonally.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.170
AARTI SEQUEIRA: Buy
seasonally.

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:06.770
I love this.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:07.800
I mean, we live in California.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.040
So we're really spoiled
this way.

00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:13.580
I was just in Orlando,
and I was like, eeh.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.220
DIANE SOLINGER: Florida,
really?

00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.170
AARTI SEQUEIRA: No slight
against Orlando.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.540
But I'm just saying, the
things we get at the

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:20.120
supermarket here,
I mean, come on.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.270
It's amazing.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.080
When you buy seasonally, it's
just going to taste better.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.800
Because it's meant to be
growing right now.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.310
It will also be cheaper.

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.180
And that also means it took less
energy, and less fuel, et

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.700
cetera, et cetera, to grow.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:33.920
And one of the secrets--

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.210
you can just shut
me up any time,

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.280
because I'll keep going--

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.910
the one thing about cooking
seasonally is it's almost like

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:39.960
God's gift to us.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:45.950
Because think about what
grows in one season.

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:50.590
So let's take the winter.

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:52.800
"Winter," California
standards.

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.200
So you have these hearty
greens like

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.860
kale, let's just say.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:32:00.160
Kale happens to go wonderfully
with butternut squash, which

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:03.440
happens to go wonderfully with
hearty herbs like sage.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:06.020
It's almost like God's
like, here you go.

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.430
Cook.

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:09.830
It's actually a lot simpler
when you think

00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:11.230
about things that way.

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:14.660
And also, when you eat
seasonally, you tend to crave

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.150
those things.

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.240
So in the summer when it's
hot, you're not craving

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:17.910
butternut squash.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:21.490
You're craving tomatoes and
cucumbers and watermelons,

00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:24.080
very light fruit
and vegetables.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.100
So you are actually doing
your body a service.

00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:29.603
And then, here is the thing
that's so awesome, not only

00:32:29.603 --> 00:32:32.150
are you doing yourself some
good, you're doing people

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.850
across the world from
you some good.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:35.420
It's like, come on.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.796
It's so easy.

00:32:36.796 --> 00:32:38.210
It's so easy.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:39.260
DIANE SOLINGER: And
supporting local

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.580
farmers often, too, right?

00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:40.855
AARTI SEQUEIRA: Yes.

00:32:40.855 --> 00:32:43.710
Buying fair trade and
buying local.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:47.460
And fair trade chocolate, if
you're not buying chocolate,

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.860
now you have your excuse.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.580
DIANE SOLINGER: So Ray, let's
talk about the big farming

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.670
issues, the ADMs of the world.

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:00.550
Dare I say ethanol with you?

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:03.754
I know that's kind of maybe a--
no, I shouldn't go there?

00:33:03.754 --> 00:33:08.510
But I mean really, when we're
thinking about the systemic

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:12.750
issues with respect to food
and security for food.

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:18.025
And then you have the farming
that we've gone to in most of

00:33:18.025 --> 00:33:22.340
the developed world, big,
massive conglomerate farms

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:25.950
versus really what we're talking
about for the rest of

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.860
the world, but also for us,
to buy local, small farms.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.072
There's a big kind of---

00:33:32.072 --> 00:33:32.900
I don't know.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:36.750
It's just a rub there, between
big business and really

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:40.220
probably what's maybe the better
thing for all of us.

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:42.620
Tell us where Oxfam stands
on those things.

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.270
RAYMOND OFFENHEISER: Well, let
me, since this is a room of

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:47.060
systems thinkers, I was told
everyone at Google's a systems

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.110
thinker, I'm going to venture
into this world of talking

00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.900
about the global food system.

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.190
And the fact that we live in a
world where basically, much of

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:57.730
the world subsists on
eight basic grains.

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.020
And I'm not going to name
them all for you.

00:33:59.020 --> 00:34:00.050
You can probably figure out.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:01.576
You can start with rice,
wheat, corn, and

00:34:01.576 --> 00:34:03.560
go on down the list.

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.760
And people eat some 257 other
crops around the world.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.330
But the big grains are
ones that sustain

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.239
life around the world.

00:34:11.239 --> 00:34:14.850
2008, we had this incredible
event happen, which was that

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:18.179
we suddenly discovered after 30
or 40 years of assuming we

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:21.400
had abundant global food supply,
that those grain

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.449
stocks had sort of run out.

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:27.900
And all these economists woke up
one day, and realized, wow.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:28.440
What happened?

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:31.300
Why are there no sort
of grain stocks?

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:33.560
And when the grain stocks ran
out, the prices started just

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.350
to spiral out of control.

00:34:35.350 --> 00:34:38.030
And they went up some 300%
around the world.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:40.420
Now, think about, if
you're Susan, and

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.940
you're living in Nigeria.

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.679
And you're a subsistence
farmer.

00:34:43.679 --> 00:34:46.080
And you're having a bad
year, as Aarti said.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:49.420
And suddenly, you may have to
buy food in the local market.

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:51.179
And you can't produce
enough to eat.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:53.290
And the prices have
gone up 300%.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.610
And on average, you generally
spend 75% to 80% of whatever

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:58.185
cash you have on food.

00:34:58.185 --> 00:35:01.310
Well, this was like an
impossible situation for poor

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.840
families all over the world.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.910
It was a little easier, maybe,
if you were a rural

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:05.870
subsistence farmer.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:06.850
Because you had some food.

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:10.400
If you were an urban or poor,
you had really no options.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.560
Because there was no
food around you.

00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:13.600
So what happened?

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.190
38 countries were rioting.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.540
Some people would claim some of
the Arab Spring is related

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.500
to, actually, food
price crises.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:21.950
These prices went up in 2008.

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:23.340
They haven't come down.

00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.480
So the world is still being
faced with this sort of food

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.140
price crisis.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:29.280
And these stocks have
not been restored.

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.360
So what was going on?

00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:33.200
And this is where I want to help
link, help you sort of

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.800
see some of the linkages.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.210
So that you could sort of
apply all your systems

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:40.000
thinking to kind of thinking
about this food system in a

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.340
way that will be helpful to you,
and simplify it for you.

00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:44.630
Climate change.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:48.030
Well, there was a drought in
Australia for seven years, in

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.640
the wheat growing regions
of Australia.

00:35:49.640 --> 00:35:51.350
The wheat crops collapsed.

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.750
And so the wheat prices were
just going up and up and up.

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:59.930
The stocks were falling, falling
down tremendously.

00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:04.050
Russia had a drought the winter
after the end of the

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.080
Australia droughts.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:08.910
More crisis in the
wheat markets.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.640
So climate change suddenly is
starting to affect our global

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.560
food supply.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.050
So if any of you are wondering
about whether climate change

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:17.860
is real, believe me, in the
world we live in, and we're

00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.720
looking at these food supplies,
it is really real.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.910
And it's here to stay.

00:36:20.910 --> 00:36:23.710
And in places like Africa, in
various parts of it, the

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.210
Somalia famine that Kristin
talked about, that was about

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:32.010
climate change impacts in a
drought prone region, where we

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.370
used to see droughts
every seven years.

00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.150
Now we see them every
three years.

00:36:35.150 --> 00:36:36.920
Other issue, ethanol.

00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:39.670
40% of the corn grown in
the United States goes

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:41.010
into your gas tank.

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:41.530
Why?

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.080
Because we have legislation
in the United States that

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.010
originally thought was going
to be part of a solution to

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.390
the climate problem and
reducing carbon in the

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:49.070
atmosphere.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:51.670
Turns out, it's not
actually the case.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:56.370
But we have laws now that
require 10% of every gallon of

00:36:56.370 --> 00:36:58.900
gas you put in your gas
tank is ethanol based.

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:00.820
And that is a congressional
mandate that's

00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.440
going to go up to 15%.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.080
This is the first time in
history we've had a

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.650
relationship between
food and fuel.

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:08.910
And we're taking that corn out
of the global food supply.

00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:10.390
What's the implication
of that?

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.990
Higher prices, because
you have less supply.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:16.560
So that's another sort
of a critical issue.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.680
Global oil prices, fossil
fuel, and industrial

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.870
agriculture, to Diana's point.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.540
This is what has sustained us
here in the United States.

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.960
But actually, it's a very
expensive way to do

00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.490
agriculture.

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:30.410
And when you think about the
fact that you're going to have

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:33.620
increasing demand for fossil
fuels globally, and that

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:37.170
fossil fuels provide inputs for
fertilizers, pesticides,

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:41.150
herbicides, if oil prices keep
going up and up and up, which

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:44.000
they're predicted to do, inputs
for people like Susan

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.190
are going to go up and up and
up, which take her out of the

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:46.960
production cycle.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.560
Because she can't afford
the inputs.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.280
Which is also, if you remember,
the fuel prices went

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:53.610
up in 2008, 2009 as well.

00:37:53.610 --> 00:37:56.860
So there were all of these
sort of confluent factors

00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.390
coming together that
drove this crisis.

00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:01.290
And it's still staying
with us.

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:03.020
And these are things we've
got to keep an

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.600
eye on going forward.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.730
Now, are there some things we
can be thinking about and

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:09.220
doing in order to address
these issues?

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.185
One, we need to be thinking
about climate change, and

00:38:11.185 --> 00:38:11.880
getting serious about it.

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.900
We've got to insure that our
government, this government,

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:17.650
does something about it.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:21.290
We consume 25% of the world's
energy in fossil fuels.

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.800
And that's driving a
lot of this climate

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.820
change that we're seeing.

00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:30.270
These degree changes that are
being talked about, the

00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:36.040
implications for African
countries, Nigeria and other

00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:39.380
parts of sub-Saharan Africa,
what are the implications?

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.950
More droughts, more frequently,
or extreme rain in

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.240
Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.800
We've seen the other
version of this,

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.260
which is massive flooding.

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:47.480
Huh?

00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:47.800
DIANE SOLINGER: Just kidding.

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.955
Or here today.

00:38:48.955 --> 00:38:50.500
RAYMOND OFFENHEISER: Or
here today, exactly.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.350
Massive flooding where
Sandy in New York, or

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:54.070
that part of the world.

00:38:54.070 --> 00:38:57.220
You're seeing these kind of
dramatic climatic effects.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.720
The ethanol issue, we actually
have been fighting, Oxfam's

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:00.920
been fighting that one
on Capitol Hill the

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.140
last couple of years.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:05.280
Because of the fiscal crisis,
we won on getting subsidies

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.540
cut to the ethanol industry.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.590
Because they kept building
more and

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:09.110
more and more factories.

00:39:09.110 --> 00:39:10.280
But we still have
the mandates.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.485
So we've got to get rid
of those mandates.

00:39:11.485 --> 00:39:12.130
And that's something--

00:39:12.130 --> 00:39:14.190
DIANE SOLINGER: What's happening
in some of your

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:17.470
travels, though, Susan, are you
seeing small farmers doing

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.170
biofuels instead of
planting crops?

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.555
Any of that happening?

00:39:21.555 --> 00:39:23.760
I've read some articles like
in Sierra Leone, that's

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:26.230
happening, where small farmers
are being displaced.

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:28.710
Because biofuel crops are
getting them more money.

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:30.280
KRISTIN DAVIS: Oh yeah,
it's everywhere.

00:39:30.280 --> 00:39:32.200
I mean, when you go into a
beautiful country, you'll be

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:35.940
driving along, like Mozambique,
Kenya, I think

00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:37.980
every country I've been to,
you'll be driving along.

00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:40.570
You'll see beautiful little
farms, little personal farms

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:41.520
like Susan's.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.780
And then you'll see some really

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.990
horrible, huge building.

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.940
And you'll say, what's that?

00:39:44.940 --> 00:39:47.730
And they'll say a company's name
that I don't want to say.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:50.770
But one of those big
agricultural companies.

00:39:50.770 --> 00:39:52.190
And it's not a pretty farm.

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:56.920
It's a horrible, huge building
where they're like controlling

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.440
the atmosphere inside
the building.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.870
I mean, it's a shocking thing.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.160
And you think, well, why
are they doing that?

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.770
Why don't they just
farm like regular?

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:04.190
Because they're not really
interested in

00:40:04.190 --> 00:40:05.590
farming like regular.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:06.165
So that's sad.

00:40:06.165 --> 00:40:07.350
DIANE SOLINGER: It's
displacing farmers.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.955
And it's displacing food,
right, Susan?

00:40:09.955 --> 00:40:10.680
Are you seeing that?

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:12.420
SUSAN GODWIN: I would like
to come in mean here.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:16.910
Because most of the foods, they
buy it from the small

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:18.020
scale farmers.

00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:18.740
So they take it there.

00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:20.880
They make it to destroy it.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.610
When the price go up,
they now sell it.

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:28.940
So even in Nigeria, this climate
change also affect,

00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.980
although there was no flood.

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:35.370
But in fact, some of our yam,
yam normally produce from the

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:38.060
soil, got bad this year.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.880
There's no good to have
a yam harvest.

00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:45.870
The yam leaves are supposed to
drop by October to December,

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:47.840
where January is due
for harvest.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:52.530
But our yam leaves started
dropping since July, which

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:55.820
even this year, I don't think,
most of us are going to lose

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.560
our seeds, because
of too much rain.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:02.450
When the rain start, it was
heavily up to when it end.

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:05.980
So everywhere, even where we
have places that water don't

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.830
flow before this year, you'll
find water flowing or over

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:10.370
everywhere.

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:15.000
So this is an issue that
need to be addressed.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.120
It's going to cause more problem
to what we are trying

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.210
to fight hunger.

00:41:19.210 --> 00:41:25.440
And this climate change may
still make it difficult.

00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:26.690
KRISTIN DAVIS: Can I just say
one other thing, just to

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.210
connect the dots?

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:30.860
Ray and I went up to Capitol
Hill last year on

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:32.910
International Women's Day,
which does exist.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:33.435
It is real.

00:41:33.435 --> 00:41:35.260
Everyone always says, did
you make that up?

00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:37.070
No, it exists all the way
around the world.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:39.050
It's just America, we don't
really celebrate it.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.770
So we decided 100 women from
around the country, with

00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.740
sisters on the planet,
went to Washington.

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.760
And I went with Ray,
so I could learn.

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.990
And we were talking to a bunch
of Republicans, actually.

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.240
And they were all very nice.

00:41:56.290 --> 00:41:59.000
And we were talking about
a lot of these issues.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.370
And one of the things that we
talked about and that they

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.860
asked us about, because
sometimes people say, well,

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:07.720
why does it matter to us here
what is happening in Nigeria?

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:09.540
What is happening in Kenya?

00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:12.600
Well, first of all, from my
travels, I mean, just as a

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.800
human being, I think that
it absolutely matters.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:17.970
I guess that is a moral decision
that each person has

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.310
to make for themselves.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.320
But separate from that, like Ray
was saying, people rioted

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:26.300
over the lack of food
and the food prices.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:27.550
This--

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:30.140
DIANE SOLINGER: Instability
that it causes.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.280
KRISTIN DAVIS: Thank you,
instability, not disability,

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.160
but instability.

00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:35.730
Instability is not good for
any of us, anywhere.

00:42:35.730 --> 00:42:37.900
And I could go down the
list of things that

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.760
have affected us.

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:40.950
Obviously, we all know the
things that have affected us.

00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:46.150
But the worse the situations get
in these poor countries--

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:47.800
we are all connected
at this point.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:51.220
There is no way that we can
say, well, we don't care.

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.770
We are not affected by them.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:55.490
Because we will be, in
one way or another.

00:42:55.490 --> 00:42:58.300
And that's why, even separate
from just a humanitarian, I

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.410
care about my brother, type of
an idea, which is how I feel,

00:43:01.410 --> 00:43:06.110
you also, from a very
real, practical,

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:07.490
monetary, and security--

00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:08.470
RAYMOND OFFENHEISER: National
security point of view.

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.940
KRISTIN DAVIS: Issue, really,
there are very, very real

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:11.670
issues to this.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:15.960
And the worse we let it get,
it's just dumb to let it get

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.480
to that point.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.770
Because once it gets to that
point, it's very, very hard to

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.020
pull it back.

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:25.740
DIANE SOLINGER: And
now to something

00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.990
a little more bright.

00:43:29.905 --> 00:43:32.200
RAYMOND OFFENHEISER: And what
were we saying to this

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.150
Republican group?

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:35.190
I mean, we were basically doing
a couple of things.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.500
One was we were encouraging
support for the president's

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.320
initiative on Feed the Future.

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:43.410
President Obama has a big sort
of international agriculture

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:45.120
and food program that
he's been trying

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:45.840
to get through Congress.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.920
There's been a lot
of resistance.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:47.950
And what is it about?

00:43:47.950 --> 00:43:50.960
It's about funding for small
farmer agriculture.

00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:53.260
It's about sustaining our
food aid program.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.800
United States has the largest
food aid program in the world.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.080
We provide 50% of the food
aid to emergency

00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.830
situations around the world.

00:43:59.830 --> 00:44:02.210
It's about increasing sort
of entrepreneurship and

00:44:02.210 --> 00:44:04.480
investment in entrepreneurship
of the sort

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.910
that Susan's doing.

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:06.800
Really important program.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:09.370
Something that you could
actually encourage your

00:44:09.370 --> 00:44:12.120
congressmen in this district,
or your districts in this

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.050
general area, to actually
get behind.

00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:16.940
And we were challenging them
on the ethanol question.

00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.830
And we were challenging them
to take the climate change

00:44:19.830 --> 00:44:23.820
challenge real, to see it as a
real challenge that needed to

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:24.690
be confronted.

00:44:24.690 --> 00:44:27.060
And we were encouraging them to
think about getting ahead

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.860
of the climate change issue by
addressing the question of

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:31.980
whether we need to be investing
in adaptation,

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.430
helping some of these contexts
to actually adjust their

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.070
farming systems to deal with
the challenges of climate

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:40.270
change, to deal with resilience
and adaptation,

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.100
which is sort of the front end
of dealing with climate change

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:45.710
in the short to medium term.

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:47.790
DIANE SOLINGER: Well, and we've
been talking a lot on

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:50.430
the global scale, but it
happens here, in our

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:51.580
backyards, as well.

00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:55.370
And you don't think about hunger
in the United States

00:44:55.370 --> 00:44:57.480
very much, because we are--

00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.530
we have an obesity issue,
and a health issue,

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:00.570
and diabetes issues.

00:45:00.570 --> 00:45:02.440
But it's very real.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.700
And that's why our food drive
here at Mountain View campus

00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:09.150
is so well supported.

00:45:09.150 --> 00:45:11.530
Because there's a definite
bifurcation even in our

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:13.650
community of the haves
and have nots.

00:45:13.650 --> 00:45:17.280
And I think there needs to be
something that addresses that

00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.300
gap locally and globally
at the same time.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:24.550
But Aarti, I love to
cook, as well.

00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:25.840
So I think we'll like flank
each other here

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.190
at the ends, talking.

00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:31.690
But with what you're doing with
the Grow campaign, how

00:45:31.690 --> 00:45:33.640
are you engaging
others in that?

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.500
Are you bringing in kind
of the concept

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:37.650
into the Food Network?

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:40.910
Are you using that as a platform
to talk about Grow or

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:43.920
about local and meatless
Mondays?

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.160
AARTI SEQUEIRA: Yeah.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.190
I mean, meatless Mondays, thank
goodness for whoever

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:47.320
coined that term.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:50.490
You do some alliteration,
suddenly it's a thing.

00:45:50.490 --> 00:45:54.010
But I think that the country as
a whole is already on board

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:55.960
with that, which is
kind of amazing.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.630
At least in terms of, I don't
know if you guys flip through

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:02.120
every food blog that there is,
but every Monday someone has--

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.370
Kristin's like, no.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.020
You know, someone's putting
a recipe up.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:10.000
But I think it is giving people
recipes, and putting

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:11.130
ideas out there.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:15.330
And helping people understand,
OK, I'm going to go with you,

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:17.260
and I'm going to go to
the farmer's market.

00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.560
And beets are on sale.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:19.110
So what do I do?

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:20.180
Buy five pounds of beets?

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.500
Yes, you do.

00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.770
And then what do you
do with them?

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:23.680
DIANE SOLINGER: You don't
waste them at

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.110
the end of the week.

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:24.850
AARTI SEQUEIRA: You
don't waste them.

00:46:24.850 --> 00:46:25.670
DIANE SOLINGER: You put
them on your pasta.

00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:26.160
AARTI SEQUEIRA: Yes.

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:27.790
And you eat the greens, too.

00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:30.340
Because they're wicked good
for you, and tasty.

00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:33.540
But yeah, I think it's just
sort of helping people--

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:35.710
to me, it just keeps coming back
to this, and I don't know

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:37.780
why-- but just feel empowered.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:46.210
To actually not only have a
wider impact in the world, but

00:46:46.210 --> 00:46:49.420
also feel empowered to just
cook the ding dang thing.

00:46:49.420 --> 00:46:50.680
DIANE SOLINGER: And it's like
Kristin said, it's a bit of

00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:51.710
connecting the dots.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:53.790
If it is overwhelming,
we don't feel

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:54.660
like we can do a lot.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:55.730
We can do something.

00:46:55.730 --> 00:47:01.510
And to that, wanted to toss it
to you about the great Oxfam

00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:02.720
Unwrapped campaign.

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.200
KRISTIN DAVIS: Absolutely.

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.250
This is something that
we do year round.

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:07.700
But then occasionally, we
do talk about it more.

00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:09.160
And this is one of
those times.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:11.970
We do a really great project,
it's called Oxfam Unwrapped.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:14.540
And we have a website,
Oxfamgifts.com.

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.960
And it's something where
you can go on.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.330
We have a variety of things.

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:20.250
They are very reasonably
priced.

00:47:20.250 --> 00:47:22.530
And sometimes, you can send
a goat to someone.

00:47:22.530 --> 00:47:26.750
Or you could send worms
to help a farmer

00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:28.440
change their soil.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.510
You can send bees.

00:47:30.510 --> 00:47:34.840
Bee keeping is a very amazing
business that you can do on

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.870
your own if you have the skill
and the basic beginning tools.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:41.370
One of the--

00:47:41.370 --> 00:47:42.150
well, not one.

00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:44.480
I've seen so many of
these items in

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:45.600
practice on my travels.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.140
And you kind of taken them
for granted here.

00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:48.790
Like, a handful of seeds.

00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:49.930
Again, something you
think like, a

00:47:49.930 --> 00:47:51.595
handful of seeds, really?

00:47:51.595 --> 00:47:53.880
This makes a huge difference,
does it not?

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.200
It is amazing.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:59.460
People do not have access to a
lot of the newer seeds that

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.420
have been, through trial and
error, come in to these

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:04.400
heartier seeds.

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.850
And that makes a huge difference
to a small farmer.

00:48:06.850 --> 00:48:08.960
So we have the training.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.420
People go and educate the
farmers or the women about how

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:13.450
to raise chicks.

00:48:13.450 --> 00:48:17.210
That's another amazing skill
set that is very simple.

00:48:17.210 --> 00:48:18.060
People can do it at home.

00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.450
You don't have to leave
your children.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:24.100
I've seen women have much
smaller but very similar

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.390
outcomes as Susan in terms
of their husbands

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:27.640
going no, no, no, no.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.610
And then, these are people, in
the mountains of Mozambique by

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:33.920
Zimbabwe we met women who were
literally living on less than

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.270
$2 a month.

00:48:35.270 --> 00:48:37.595
Extreme poverty is defined
as less than $2 a day.

00:48:37.595 --> 00:48:40.180
These people were living on
less than $2 a month.

00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.240
I mean, it was extreme.

00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.480
And they lived in the most
beautiful, beautiful region.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.780
We called it Shangri La.

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.730
Yet, they really had nothing.

00:48:47.730 --> 00:48:49.990
And they were given
organic seeds.

00:48:49.990 --> 00:48:52.260
And they were growing lettuce
bigger than my head.

00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:53.350
They were so proud.

00:48:53.350 --> 00:48:54.690
They were living on these
steep mountains.

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.020
And we taught them irrigation
methods.

00:48:57.020 --> 00:48:58.880
And then they were also
raising chicks.

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:00.690
And the husbands had said
no, no, absolutely

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:02.300
not, absolutely not.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:03.490
My wife does not work.

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:04.530
She is the mother
of my children.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:07.490
Well, when they got that $20
bill at the end of the month,

00:49:07.490 --> 00:49:10.830
they were like, OK!

00:49:10.830 --> 00:49:11.936
DIANE SOLINGER: Money
talks, right?

00:49:11.936 --> 00:49:12.362
KRISTIN DAVIS: Yeah.

00:49:12.362 --> 00:49:13.930
And it was just really
wonderful.

00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.580
Because that woman, you could
see the pride that she took in

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:17.630
what she had accomplished.

00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:20.610
And you would always ask the
women, we always would say,

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:23.860
what did you do with your money
when you had finished

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.140
the project and made
the money?

00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.660
And they would always say, I
bought the school uniform so

00:49:28.660 --> 00:49:30.330
my child could go
back to school.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:31.520
I bought the paper.

00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.430
So there are things we
take for granted.

00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:35.760
If you can't buy your
child paper, your

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.860
child can't go to school.

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:39.710
And school is often a tree
they are sitting under.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:40.910
That is school.

00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:43.340
But they can't go if there's
no paper or pencil.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:46.100
So school books are on
Oxfam Unwrapped.

00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:46.860
Really amazing things.

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:48.550
School meals for the children.

00:49:48.550 --> 00:49:51.050
Because a lot of the time, they
don't have a good meal,

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:53.590
which we all know you need to
eat to be able to think to be

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.520
able to learn.

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.610
And the next generation is going
to change the world, as

00:49:57.610 --> 00:49:58.300
my young faces now--

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:58.870
DIANE SOLINGER: It gets
them to school.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:00.470
KRISTIN DAVIS: Exactly, it
gets them to school.

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.520
But the little young people
here, you're so adorable.

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.910
And it makes me feel hopeful
that you're all interested in

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:06.800
these kinds of things.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.880
But when you're out in the world
you see these little

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:10.840
kids, and you see how much their
mothers really want to

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.610
send them to school,
it's really moving.

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.910
And it really makes a huge, huge
difference when they are

00:50:14.910 --> 00:50:16.010
able to do so.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:18.570
So there's a lot of things
on Oxfam Unwrapped

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:19.780
related to the kids.

00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:21.540
Then there's a lot related
to farmers,

00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.750
many of whom are women.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.920
Tools, seeds, worms.

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.830
Then there's a lot like
ducks, goats, bees.

00:50:28.830 --> 00:50:31.940
You can plant a field that
alpaca could graze in.

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:34.350
Because in South America,
you can raise alpaca.

00:50:34.350 --> 00:50:35.510
So it's a really fun thing.

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.750
And so this is what I get every
year for Christmas.

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:38.840
Because I don't need anything.

00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.700
I'm incredibly lucky
in my life, as you

00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:43.864
all helped make me.

00:50:43.864 --> 00:50:46.290
So I need no gifts.

00:50:46.290 --> 00:50:47.810
And my family just
gets to pick.

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:50.246
And they all talk like, I'm
going to get her this, I'm

00:50:50.246 --> 00:50:50.530
going to get her that.

00:50:50.530 --> 00:50:52.050
And they get things that
sometimes go together, which

00:50:52.050 --> 00:50:54.140
is really cute, like the
different things that a school

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.340
kid would need.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:57.500
And then the card goes
to the recipient.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.170
And then the gift goes
to people in

00:50:59.170 --> 00:50:59.990
need around the world.

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:02.050
And it's a pretty
good feeling.

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:04.570
DIANE SOLINGER: And there's a
way for Googlers here today.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.260
And if you go to the
website, too.

00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:08.910
So it's, what was that again?

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:10.563
KRISTIN DAVIS: Oxfamgifts.com.

00:51:10.563 --> 00:51:11.270
DIANE SOLINGER: .Com.

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.070
We talked about that.

00:51:12.070 --> 00:51:15.360
And at the back of the room,
we have a badge to donate.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:16.700
Oh, it's over there.

00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:18.450
So you can swipe your badge.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.680
And you can pick a project,
whether it's--

00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:22.020
I think we have goats.

00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:27.500
We have school meals for
two children, and bees.

00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.390
So three Oxfam projects
that you can unwrap

00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:33.800
and swipe to give.

00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:38.820
And also, we've talked today
high level systemic stuff, how

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:42.270
to cook to make a difference,
how to shop to make a

00:51:42.270 --> 00:51:45.910
difference, how to give in a
variety of ways, and how to

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:46.710
help farmers.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:52.500
And Googlers have 20 hours of
volunteer time off as a

00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:56.240
benefit that we want to
encourage you to use.

00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.040
Whether it's helping at the
biggest, highest level, and

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.550
trying to think about systemic
issues that you might be able

00:52:01.550 --> 00:52:06.000
to use your brains to support,
or even going out and going to

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:09.220
the food bank and making sure
that somebody gets a meal that

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.400
probably wouldn't.

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:13.400
Those opportunities are year
round, so it's not just now.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.420
Use that benefit.

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:16.300
We really want to encourage
you to do that.

00:52:16.300 --> 00:52:19.280
And when you do volunteer, when
you volunteer five hours,

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.350
we'll match that with $50.

00:52:21.350 --> 00:52:24.630
So every five hours gets $50 to
the organization that you

00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:26.440
volunteered to.

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.820
So use your gift match.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:29.240
Use your donations for doers.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:30.200
Use your benefits.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:32.500
Use your volunteer time off.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.290
That's one of the things
that makes Google

00:52:34.290 --> 00:52:35.330
such a great place.

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:40.350
And we hope that you go out and
help with this campaign.

00:52:40.350 --> 00:52:43.370
And thank you for being
a part of this today.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:45.110
KRISTIN DAVIS: You guys are
amazing, I just want to say.

00:52:45.110 --> 00:52:47.090
Google culture is amazing.

00:52:52.420 --> 00:52:53.580
RAYMOND OFFENHEISER: And maybe
for the activists in the

00:52:53.580 --> 00:52:56.500
audience, you can actually
sort of join the sort of

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.710
political work of Oxfam
and the Grow campaign.

00:52:58.710 --> 00:53:01.570
We actually have in the San
Francisco area an action

00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:04.080
corps, people who actually want
to do sort of activist

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.050
work on some of the
policy issues.

00:53:06.050 --> 00:53:08.840
So that's another option as well
for those folks who want

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.540
to do that kind of work.

00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:09.800
DIANE SOLINGER: Thanks,
everyone.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.450
KRISTIN DAVIS: Thanks
for coming.

00:53:10.450 --> 00:53:11.200
Have a goo day.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.450
Don't get too wet.
