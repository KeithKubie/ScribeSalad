00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.640
Two-way relationships.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.795
Gosh!

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.913
That was worse than the last one.

00:00:09.696 --> 00:00:11.494
Remember, data storage is cheap.

00:00:11.494 --> 00:00:15.851
The user's time is not.

00:00:23.447 --> 00:00:25.299
What else could go wrong?

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:26.496
What else could go wrong?

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:28.675
What else could go wrong.

00:00:28.675 --> 00:00:33.419

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:35.856
&gt;&gt; Corporate mandated
work time is now over.

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:41.310
Lunch time for
sectors 113, 114, and 115.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:42.994
Please enjoy your lunch.

00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:51.612
&gt;&gt; [SOUND] There's a protein
clump in my instarito.

00:00:51.612 --> 00:00:53.808
I really can't eat this.

00:00:53.808 --> 00:00:57.222
&gt;&gt; 9443, Walter, you have to keep up
your strength if you're going to keep

00:00:57.222 --> 00:00:58.800
filing these tax returns.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.065
You remember what happened to 1253?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.360
&gt;&gt; Her name was.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.056
But really, I wish our corporate
overlords Grocery Grabber LLC would

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:10.215
pay more attention to food quality.

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:13.609
You'd think they would, considering
they started as a food company.

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:16.050
I wonder what Shopping List++-
&gt;&gt; Quiet.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.853
You must not speak the forbidden name.

00:01:18.853 --> 00:01:22.403
9443, Walter, I know times are hard.

00:01:22.403 --> 00:01:24.385
Sometimes I wish I could talk to JP.

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:27.944
But I haven't seen him since
he joined the resistance.

00:01:27.944 --> 00:01:37.944
[MUSIC]

00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:43.740
JP, what happened to you?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.740
&gt;&gt; I've suffered a terrible injury
at the hands of the robot army that

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.180
controls our every move,
but it was worth it.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.730
Do you remember back in the days when
Grocery Grabber was just a small company

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.590
competing with Shopping List++ instead
of the evil megacorporation that

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.020
runs our very lives?

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.110
&gt;&gt; Yes, and we shan't forget.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.681
&gt;&gt; Well, back then, the evil programmers
at Grocery Grabber had discovered

00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:08.750
a little-known rule in Firebase.

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.710
[COUGH] This rule could be added to
a Firebase security and rules document.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.800
With this very rule, they could read
data more efficiently and faster.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.950
Hundreds and
hundreds of thousands of lines of data.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.410
It allowed them to eventually take over.

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.456
Here, let me pull up
an astral computer screen.

00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:27.956
