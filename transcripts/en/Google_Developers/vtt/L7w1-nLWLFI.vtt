TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.906
I'm Timothy Jordan for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:03.906 --> 00:00:06.030
This is your weekly update
on the coolest developer

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.070
news from Google.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.220
Android Studio 3.2 is now
available for download.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.590
Head on over to the post
linked in the description

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.860
below for the latest details
on key features such as Android

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.850
app bundle, the energy profiler,
and the new Android Emulator

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.500
snapshots.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.110
We recently released updates
to ARCore, our platform

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.730
for building augmented
reality experiences.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.510
We also updated Scene
Form, the 3D rendering

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.570
library for building AR
applications on Android.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.490
Included are
algorithm improvements

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.220
that will let your apps
consume less memory and CPU

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.980
usage during longer
sessions, as well as

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.220
new functionality that gives you
more flexibility over content

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.270
management.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.720
Code and example
screenshots are on the post.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.280
The Cloud Native
Community Foundation

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.547
announced Kubernetes
1.12 last week.

00:00:53.547 --> 00:00:55.380
This post highlights
some of the development

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.230
that Google Cloud is driving
in the Kubernetes open source

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.950
project, including faster
scaling, topology aware storage

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.730
provisioning, and
advanced auditing.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.040
Recently, we
announced Cloud Tasks.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.800
It's a task queue service
for App Engine Flex

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.990
and second generation
runtimes that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.270
provides all the benefits
of a distributed task

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.850
queue, including
task offloading,

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.030
loose coupling between
services, and enhanced system

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.240
reliability.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.190
For more details and
links to get started,

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.990
head on over to the post.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.820
The Google Fonts catalog now
includes Japanese web fonts.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.320
For some details on the
optimization involved,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.140
take a look at the post.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.050
It's been nearly a decade
since we launched the Chrome

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.070
extensions system, and nearly
half of Chrome desktop users

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.290
actively use
extensions to customize

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.050
Chrome and their
experience on the web.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.240
It's crucial that these
users be able to trust

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.200
that the extensions they install
are safe, privacy preserving,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.650
and performant.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.780
So we recently announced
some upcoming changes,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.650
including user controls for
host permissions, changes

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.930
to the extensions
review process,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.690
and new code readability
requirements.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.270

Yeah, OK.
