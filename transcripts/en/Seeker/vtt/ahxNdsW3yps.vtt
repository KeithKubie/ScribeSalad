00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.509
Can two brains really communicate DIRECTLY
with each other?!

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.920
Did science just invent Telepathy?

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:21.080
Howdy brain people, Trace here for DNews!

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080
Did you get my message?!

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.570
YES I transmitted it to you, brain to eye!

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.570
Science!

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.200
This week, a study in PLOS One detailed how
two brains were wired together via the internet.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.460
The news media went crazy, claiming telepathy
and ESP and all sorts of other magical nonsense.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.329
This isn't magic, it's science.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.680
Basically, what this international group of
scientists have done is use a brain computer

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.980
interface, or BCI, to read the activity from
one brain.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.150
They took that reading and translated it into
a binary message.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.210
Then they sent it to through the internet,
and decoded it on the other end to put it

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.560
into a different type of computer-brain interface,
or CBI.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.079
The CBI then sends the signal into the receivers
brain aaaaaand that's it.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.079
Yeah.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.989
It's a lot, but hang on, we'll go through
it.

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.750
First, reading a brain isn't anything new.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.729
We've been using the technology used in this
experiment since the 1870s; it's called electroencephalography.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.020
EEGs read the movement of ions through the
brain, and they've become sensitive enough

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.870
to do so without being physically implanted.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.830
Both the sender and the computer had to be
trained first to encode the binary message…

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.960
they did so by moving their hands for a 1
and feet for a 0.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.260
They did this so the "language" would be understood
by the sender and the receiver.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.340
The movement creates specific electrical signals
in the brain that were picked up by the EEG

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.610
and e-mailed to three computers 5,000 miles
away.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.439
We've done this a ton of times, this alone
isn't that big a deal.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.549
Usually, scientists do this to show that a
brain can control a wheelchair, robotic arm

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:54.869
or even another animal -- like the tail of
a rat. [a]But in this case, we can't beam

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.689
a signal right into another human's brain,
so the researchers analyzed the best spots

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.580
on the receivers' brains to stimulate phosphenes,
or little flashes of light on the periphery

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.580
of human vision.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.580
When you rub your eyes, the lights you see
are phosphenes.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.069
So when the receiving computer got the email
with the binary code, it was sent to a robot-assisted

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.300
transcranial magnetic stimulator, or TMS.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.470
The robot had been pre-programmed to select
the part of the brain that produces those

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.910
phosphenes in the subject's peripheral vision.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.150
It moved to that spot, and activated magnets
and created the phosphenes!

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.570
The subjects would then see lights corresponding
to the message in binary… so zero, one,

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.170
one, zero, zero, became long and shorts, like
morse code!

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.170
And that's that!

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.830
One brain, sent a message to another!

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.420
Great care was taken to keep the receiver
isolated from any other sensory input.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.660
They even made them wear blindfolds and earplugs.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.060
It's not exactly magical once you break it
all down, is it?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.450
It feels more like a jury-rigged set of science
experiments all thrown together… which is

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.819
exactly what it is.

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.530
As iO9 wrote, "it wasn't the most elegant
set-up," which is putting it lightly.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.720
All I can think is, we can TOTALLY simplify
this, which is really exciting.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.680
This is just the very first tiny step down
a long road of brain-to-brain networking.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.500
There may come a day when you can control
your computer with your thoughts, or shoot

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.900
a quick brain message to your boyfriend, transmit
a complicated emotion to your friend, or even

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.080
live as a Borgian collective with everyone!

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080
But, for now, this is what we've got.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.450
What would you want to say if you could communicate
brain-to-brain?

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.420

out some telepathy jokes!
