00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.110
Before we move on, let's get
another perspective on AI problems

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.970
by looking at how Sebastian Thrun
describes them in his artificial

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.180
intelligence class at Udacity.

00:00:08.222 --> 00:00:12.380
&gt;&gt; I'm going to briefly talk of
AI as something else which is

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.580
AI as the technique of uncertainty
management in computer software.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.010
Put it differently, AI is the discipline
that you apply when you want to

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.440
know what to do,
when you don't know what to do.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.320
Now, there's many reasons why
there might be uncertainty

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.300
in a computer program.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.420
There could be a sensor limit.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.930
That is, your sensors are unable to
tell me what exactly is the case.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.720
I would site the AI system.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.050
There could be adversaries,
who act in a way that makes it hard for

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.130
you to understand what is the case.

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.300
It could be stochastic environments
every time you roll the dice

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.240
in a dice game, the stochasticity of
the dice who will make it important and

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.610
impossible for you to be absolute
certain of what the situation.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.210
There could be laziness.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.140
So perhaps you can actually
compute what the situation is.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.470
But your computer program
is just too lazy to do it.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.070
And here's my favorite.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.150
Ignorance.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.700
Plain ignorance.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.340
Many people are just
ignorant of what's going on.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.470
They could know it, but
they just don't care.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.460
All of these things are cause for
uncertainty.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.590
AI is the discipline that
deals with uncertainty and

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.070
manages it in decision making.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.180
&gt;&gt; What's interesting here, is that
Sebastian's description suggest that AI

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.280
is specifically about
dealing with uncertainty, and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.300
to a large extent that's exactly what
artificial intelligence and machine

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.350
learning are about, designing programs
that can deal with uncertain input.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.220
Now let's go back to our course and talk
about what AI problems actually are.
