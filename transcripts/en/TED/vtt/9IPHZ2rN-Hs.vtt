00:00:13.286 --> 00:00:17.738
If you were to jump
into any random spot in the ocean,

00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:20.134
you would probably see
something like this.

00:00:20.897 --> 00:00:23.134
Empty of large animals.

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:26.236
Because we have taken them
out of the water

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.577
faster than they can reproduce.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.141
Today I want to propose a strategy
to save ocean life,

00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:35.625
and the solution has
a lot to do with economics.

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:40.410
In 1999, a little place
called Cabo Pulmo in Mexico

00:00:40.434 --> 00:00:42.101
was an underwater desert.

00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:46.752
The fishermen were so upset
not having enough fish to catch

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:49.760
that they did something
that no one expected.

00:00:49.784 --> 00:00:53.887
Instead of spending more time at sea,
trying to catch the few fish left,

00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:56.386
they stopped fishing completely.

00:00:57.498 --> 00:01:00.165
They created a national park in the sea.

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:03.291
A no-take marine reserve.

00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:08.774
When we returned, 10 years later,
this is what we saw.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.592
What had been an underwater barren

00:01:13.616 --> 00:01:17.116
was now a kaleidoscope of life and color.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.680
We saw it back to pristine
in only 10 years.

00:01:20.704 --> 00:01:22.918
Including the return
of the large predators,

00:01:22.942 --> 00:01:26.204
like the groupers, the sharks, the jacks.

00:01:26.823 --> 00:01:29.220
And those visionary fishermen

00:01:29.244 --> 00:01:32.728
are making much more money
now, from tourism.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:37.901
Now, when we can align
economic needs with conservation,

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:39.258
miracles can happen.

00:01:40.314 --> 00:01:43.274
And we have seen similar recoveries
all over the world.

00:01:44.672 --> 00:01:48.850
I spent 20 years studying
human impacts in the ocean.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:57.013
But when I saw firsthand the regeneration
of places like Cabo Pulmo,

00:01:57.037 --> 00:01:58.393
that gave me hope.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:03.847
So I decided to quit my job
as a university professor

00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:08.130
to dedicate my life to save
more ocean places like this.

00:02:09.053 --> 00:02:13.688
In the last 10 years, our team
at National Geographic Pristine Seas

00:02:13.712 --> 00:02:16.950
has explored, surveyed and documented

00:02:16.974 --> 00:02:19.815
some of the wildest places
left in the ocean

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:22.299
and worked with governments
to protect them.

00:02:22.704 --> 00:02:27.085
These are all now protected, covering
a total area half the size of Canada.

00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:32.934
(Applause)

00:02:32.958 --> 00:02:38.605
These places are the Yellowstones
and the Serengetis of the sea.

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:42.321
These are places
where you jump in the water

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:45.012
and are immediately surrounded by sharks.

00:02:45.036 --> 00:02:46.480
(Laughter)

00:02:46.504 --> 00:02:48.137
And this is good,

00:02:48.161 --> 00:02:52.053
because the sharks are a good indicator
of the health of the ecosystem.

00:02:52.998 --> 00:02:55.450
These places are time machines

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.958
that take us to the ocean
of 1,000 years ago.

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:02.164
But they also show us
what the future ocean could be like.

00:03:03.097 --> 00:03:07.161
Because the ocean has extraordinary
regenerative power,

00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:09.986
we have seen great recovery
in just a few years.

00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:14.112
We just need to protect
many more places at risk

00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:17.336
so they can become wild
and full of life again.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.997
But today, only two percent of the ocean

00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:25.621
is fully protected from fishing
and other activities.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.496
And that's not enough.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.219
Studies suggest that we need at least
30 percent of the ocean under protection

00:03:33.243 --> 00:03:36.260
not just to save marine life,
but to save us, too.

00:03:36.284 --> 00:03:41.683
Because the ocean gives us more than half
of the oxygen we breathe, food,

00:03:41.707 --> 00:03:44.204
it absorbs much of the carbon pollution

00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:46.115
that we throw in the atmosphere.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.433
We need a healthy ocean to survive.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.767
Now, is there a way
to accelerate ocean protection?

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.640
I think so.

00:03:57.077 --> 00:04:00.799
And it involves us looking
at the high seas.

00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:02.776
Now, what are the high seas?

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.315
Now coastal countries have authority
over 200 nautical miles from shore.

00:04:09.187 --> 00:04:13.141
Everything beyond those areas
are called the high seas.

00:04:13.165 --> 00:04:14.831
In dark blue on this map.

00:04:15.363 --> 00:04:17.791
No country owns the high seas,

00:04:17.815 --> 00:04:20.125
no country is responsible for them,

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.315
but they all are, so it's a little
like the Wild West.

00:04:23.923 --> 00:04:26.621
And there are two main types
of fishing in the high seas.

00:04:26.645 --> 00:04:29.026
At the bottom and near the surface.

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:34.431
Bottom trawling is the most
destructive practice in the world.

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:38.599
Super trawlers, the largest
fishing vessels in the ocean,

00:04:38.623 --> 00:04:45.062
have nets so large
that they can hold a dozen 747 jets.

00:04:46.417 --> 00:04:51.211
These huge nets destroy
everything in their paths --

00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:54.568
including deep corals
that grow on sea mounds,

00:04:54.592 --> 00:04:57.260
which can be thousands of years old.

00:04:57.284 --> 00:05:00.593
And fishing near the surface
targets mostly species

00:05:00.617 --> 00:05:03.656
that migrate between
the high seas and country's waters,

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.080
like tuna and sharks.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.077
And many of these species are threatened
because of too much fishing

00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:10.368
and bad management.

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.333
Now, who fishes in the high seas?

00:05:14.228 --> 00:05:17.450
Until now, it was difficult
to know exactly,

00:05:17.474 --> 00:05:19.791
because countries have been very secretive

00:05:19.815 --> 00:05:21.949
about the long-distance fishing.

00:05:22.252 --> 00:05:27.972
But now, satellite technology
allows us to track individual boats.

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:30.333
This is a game-changer.

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:32.862
And this is the first time

00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:36.326
we are presenting the data
that you are going to see.

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:39.830
I'm going to show you
the tracks of two boats

00:05:39.854 --> 00:05:42.188
over the course of a year,

00:05:42.212 --> 00:05:45.612
using a satellite automated
identification system.

00:05:46.386 --> 00:05:50.637
This is a long-liner, fishing
around the southern coast of Africa.

00:05:51.457 --> 00:05:56.101
After a few months fishing there,
the boat goes to Japan to resupply,

00:05:56.125 --> 00:05:59.609
and shortly after, here it is,
fishing around Madagascar.

00:06:00.371 --> 00:06:05.696
This is a Russian trawler
fishing, probably, for cod,

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.934
in Russian waters,

00:06:06.958 --> 00:06:10.025
and then across the high seas
of the north Atlantic.

00:06:10.895 --> 00:06:13.006
Thanks to Global Fishing Watch,

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.474
we have been able to track
over 3,600 boats

00:06:17.498 --> 00:06:20.840
from more than 20 countries,
fishing in the high seas.

00:06:21.625 --> 00:06:25.308
They use satellite positioning
and machine-learning technology

00:06:25.332 --> 00:06:30.116
to automatically identify
if a boat is just sailing or fishing,

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.658
which are the white spots here.

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:34.838
So with an international
group of colleagues,

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:36.679
we decided to investigate

00:06:36.703 --> 00:06:41.198
not only who fishes in the high seas,
but who benefits from it.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.573
My colleague, Juan Mayorga,

00:06:43.597 --> 00:06:45.823
at the University of California,
Santa Barbara,

00:06:45.847 --> 00:06:48.037
has produced detailed
maps of fishing effort,

00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:51.040
which means how much time
and fuel is spent fishing

00:06:51.064 --> 00:06:52.997
in every pixel in the ocean.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.814
We have a map for every country.

00:06:56.561 --> 00:07:00.109
China, Taiwan, Japan,
Korea and Spain alone

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:03.957
account for almost 80 percent
of the fishing in the high seas.

00:07:04.768 --> 00:07:07.403
When we put all of the countries together,

00:07:07.427 --> 00:07:08.760
this is what we get.

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:15.363
Because we know the identity
of every boat in the database,

00:07:15.387 --> 00:07:19.728
we know its size, its tonnage,
the power of its engines,

00:07:19.752 --> 00:07:21.485
how many crew are on board.

00:07:22.046 --> 00:07:26.547
With this information, we can calculate
fuel costs, labor costs, etc.

00:07:27.157 --> 00:07:29.087
So for the first time,

00:07:29.111 --> 00:07:33.361
we have been able to map
the costs of fishing in the high seas.

00:07:34.315 --> 00:07:37.049
The darker the red, the higher the costs.

00:07:37.855 --> 00:07:40.847
Thanks to our colleagues
at the University of British Columbia,

00:07:40.871 --> 00:07:43.926
we know how much every country
is actually fishing.

00:07:44.268 --> 00:07:47.513
And we know the price of the fish
as it comes off the vessel.

00:07:48.038 --> 00:07:50.403
Combined with the data on effort,

00:07:50.427 --> 00:07:54.137
we have been able to map
the revenue of fishing the high seas.

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:57.315
The darker the blue,
the higher the revenue.

00:07:57.982 --> 00:08:00.249
We have costs, and we have revenue.

00:08:00.887 --> 00:08:02.506
So for the first time,

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:07.658
we have been able to map the profitability
of fishing in the high seas.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.394
Now I'm going to show you a map.

00:08:10.712 --> 00:08:15.906
Red colors mean we are losing money
by fishing in that part of the ocean.

00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:18.841
Blue colors mean it's profitable.

00:08:19.619 --> 00:08:20.769
Here it is.

00:08:21.707 --> 00:08:23.746
It seems mostly profitable.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.107
But there are two more factors
we have to take into account.

00:08:28.635 --> 00:08:32.206
First, recent investigations reveal

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:35.712
the use of forced labor, or slave labor,

00:08:35.736 --> 00:08:37.045
in high seas fishing.

00:08:37.641 --> 00:08:41.180
Companies use it to cut costs,
to generate profits.

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:47.467
And second, every year,
governments subsidize high seas fishing

00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:49.892
with more than four billion dollars.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.008
Let's go back to the map of profits.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:55.308
If we assume fair wages,

00:08:55.332 --> 00:08:57.849
which means not slave labor,

00:08:57.873 --> 00:09:02.166
and we remove the subsidies
from our calculation,

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.243
the map turns into this.

00:09:05.807 --> 00:09:11.838
Fishing is truly profitable in only half
of the high seas fishing grounds.

00:09:12.992 --> 00:09:15.261
In fact, on aggregate,

00:09:15.285 --> 00:09:19.317
subsidies are four times
larger than the profits.

00:09:20.548 --> 00:09:24.032
So we have five countries doing
most of the fishing in the high seas

00:09:24.056 --> 00:09:27.572
and the economics are dependent
on huge government subsidies,

00:09:27.596 --> 00:09:31.063
and for some countries,
on human rights violations.

00:09:32.099 --> 00:09:34.354
What this economic analysis reveals,

00:09:34.378 --> 00:09:38.107
is that practically the entire high seas
fishing proposition is misguided.

00:09:38.647 --> 00:09:42.418
What sane government
would subsidize an industry

00:09:42.442 --> 00:09:46.049
anchored in exploitation
and fundamentally destructive?

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:48.625
And not so profitable, anyway.

00:09:49.307 --> 00:09:56.163
So, why don't we close
all of the high seas to fishing?

00:09:56.842 --> 00:10:01.469
Let's create a giant high seas reserve,
two-thirds of the ocean.

00:10:03.438 --> 00:10:05.225
A modeling study from --

00:10:05.249 --> 00:10:09.327
(Applause)

00:10:09.351 --> 00:10:12.236
A modeling study from colleagues
at UC Santa Barbara,

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:15.879
suggests that such reserve
would help migratory species like tuna

00:10:15.903 --> 00:10:17.553
recover in the high seas.

00:10:17.577 --> 00:10:21.858
And part of that increased abundance would
spill over into the countries' waters,

00:10:21.882 --> 00:10:23.636
helping to replenish them.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.731
That would also increase
the catch in these waters,

00:10:26.755 --> 00:10:28.072
and so would the profits,

00:10:28.096 --> 00:10:30.351
because the cost of fishing
would be lowered.

00:10:30.787 --> 00:10:33.372
And the ecological benefits would be huge,

00:10:34.463 --> 00:10:37.755
because these species of large predators,
like tuna and sharks,

00:10:37.779 --> 00:10:40.741
are key to the health
of the entire ecosystem.

00:10:41.606 --> 00:10:44.109
Therefore, protecting the high seas

00:10:44.133 --> 00:10:47.666
would have ecological, economic
and social benefits.

00:10:48.395 --> 00:10:50.704
But the truth is that most
fishing companies

00:10:50.728 --> 00:10:52.593
don't care about the environment.

00:10:52.617 --> 00:10:56.283
But they would make more money
by not fishing in the high seas.

00:10:56.307 --> 00:11:01.776
And this would not affect our ability
to feed our growing population,

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:06.909
because the high seas provide only
five percent of the global marine catch,

00:11:08.184 --> 00:11:11.644
because the high seas are not
as productive as near-shore waters.

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:17.395
And most of the catch of the high seas
is sold as upscale food items,

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:20.857
like tuna sashimi or shark fin soup.

00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:26.306
The high seas catch does not contribute
to global food security.

00:11:28.117 --> 00:11:29.537
So how are we going to do it?

00:11:29.561 --> 00:11:31.998
How are we going to protect the high seas?

00:11:32.022 --> 00:11:34.625
As we speak, negotiators
at the United Nations

00:11:34.649 --> 00:11:38.314
are beginning discussions
on a new agreement to do just that.

00:11:38.728 --> 00:11:41.662
But this cannot happen
behind closed doors.

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:44.299
This is our greatest opportunity.

00:11:44.323 --> 00:11:46.038
And we all should ensure

00:11:46.062 --> 00:11:51.133
that our countries will support
the protection of the high seas

00:11:51.157 --> 00:11:54.357
and get rid of subsidies
to industrial fishing.

00:11:55.395 --> 00:12:00.760
In 2016, 24 countries
and the European Union

00:12:00.784 --> 00:12:04.029
agreed to protect the Ross Sea,

00:12:04.053 --> 00:12:06.434
the wildest places in Antarctica,

00:12:06.458 --> 00:12:10.640
full of wildlife like killer whales,
leopard seals, penguins.

00:12:10.974 --> 00:12:16.204
And this included fishing nations,
like China, Japan, Spain, Russia.

00:12:16.228 --> 00:12:21.169
But they decided that protecting
such a unique environment

00:12:21.193 --> 00:12:25.387
would be worth more than exploiting it
for relatively little benefit.

00:12:25.883 --> 00:12:29.379
And this is exactly
the type of cooperation

00:12:29.403 --> 00:12:31.364
and willingness to set aside differences

00:12:31.388 --> 00:12:32.701
that we are going to need.

00:12:32.725 --> 00:12:34.368
We can do it again.

00:12:35.315 --> 00:12:37.903
If 20 years from now,

00:12:37.927 --> 00:12:42.116
our children were to jump
into any random spot in the ocean,

00:12:43.451 --> 00:12:44.785
what would they see?

00:12:45.737 --> 00:12:50.233
A barren landscape,
like much of our seas today,

00:12:50.257 --> 00:12:53.145
or an abundance of life,
our legacy to the future?

00:12:53.665 --> 00:12:54.992
Thank you very much.

00:12:55.016 --> 00:12:57.976
(Applause)

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.202
Thank you.

00:12:59.226 --> 00:13:04.015
(Applause)
