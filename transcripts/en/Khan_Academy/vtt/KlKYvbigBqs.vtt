00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.420
Let's draw ourselves a triangle.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.870
Let's say this
side has length 6.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.340
Let's say this side right
over here has length 10.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.580
And let's say that this side
right over here has length x.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.040
And what I'm going to
think about is how large

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.660
or how small that
value x can be.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.440
How large or small
can this side be?

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.080
So the first question
is how small can it get?

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.900
Well, if we want
to make this small,

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.479
we would just
literally have to look

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.380
at this angle right over here.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.560
So let me take a look at this
angle and make it smaller.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.050
So let's try to make that
angle as small as possible.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.280
So we have our 10 side.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.150
Actually let me do it down here.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.407
So you have your 10 side,
the side of length 10,

00:00:51.407 --> 00:00:53.990
and I'm going to make this angle
really, really, really small,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.250
approaching 0.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.795
If that angle becomes 0, we end
up with a degenerate triangle.

00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:01.510
It essentially
becomes one dimension.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.770
We lose our
two-dimensionality there.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.690
But as we approach
0, this side starts

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.461
to coincide or get closer
and closer to the 10 side.

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:11.460
And you could imagine the
case where it actually

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.689
coincides with it and you
actually get the degenerate.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.230
So if want this
point right over here

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.210
to get as close as possible
to that point over there,

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.520
essentially minimizing
your distance x,

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.940
the closest way is if you
make the angle the way

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.184
equal to 0, all the way.

00:01:26.184 --> 00:01:28.100
So let's actually-- let
me draw a progression.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.645
So now the angle
is getting smaller.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.180
This is length 6.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.277
x is getting smaller.

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:39.860
Then we keep making that angle
smaller and smaller and smaller

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.520
all the way until we get
a degenerate triangle.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.510
So let me draw that pink side.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.380
So you have the
side of length 10.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.940
Now the angle is essentially 0,
this angle that we care about.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.400
So this side is length 6.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.980
And so what is the
distance between this point

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.830
and this point?

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.730
And that distance is length x.

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.060
So in the degenerate case, this
length right over here is x.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.419
We know that 6 plus x is
going to be equal to 10.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:14.750
So in this degenerate case,
x is going to be equal to 4.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.460
So if you want this to be a
real triangle, at x equals 4

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.460
you've got these points
as close as possible.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.964
It's degenerated into a
line, into a line segment.

00:02:22.964 --> 00:02:24.380
If you want this
to be a triangle,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.400
x has to be greater than 4.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.130
Now let's think about
it the other way.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.710
How large can x be?

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.700
Well to think about
larger and larger x's, we

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.670
need to make this angle bigger.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.580
So let's try to do that.

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.370
So let's draw my 10 side again.

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.530
So this is my 10 side.

00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:48.880
I'm going to make that
angle bigger and bigger.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.959
So now let me take my 6
side and put it like that.

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.500
And so now our angle is getting
bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.800
It's approaching 180 degrees.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.802
At 180 degrees, our
triangle once again

00:03:01.802 --> 00:03:03.260
will be turned into
a line segment.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.860
It'll become a
degenerate triangle.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.800
So let me draw the
side of length x,

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.009
try to draw it straight.

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:09.675
So we're trying to
maximize the distance

00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:11.190
between that point
and that point.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.080
So this is side of
length x and let's

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.150
go all the way to
the degenerate case.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.250
In the degenerate case, at 180
degrees, the side of length 6

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.190
forms a straight line with
the side of length 10.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.960
And this is how you can get
this point and that point

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.116
as far apart as possible.

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:30.990
Well, in this situation,
what is the distance

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.940
between that point
and that point, which

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.470
is the distance which
is going to be our x?

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.350
Well in this situation, x is
going to be 6 plus 10 is 16.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.756
If x is 16, we have a
degenerate triangle.

00:03:42.756 --> 00:03:44.380
If we don't want a
degenerate triangle,

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.920
if we want to have two
dimensions to the triangle,

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.410
then x is going to have
to be less than 16.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.280
Now the whole principle that
we're working on right over

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.450
here is called the
triangle inequality theorem

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.440
and it's a pretty basic idea.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.979
That any one side of a
triangle has to be less,

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.645
if you don't want a
degenerate triangle,

00:04:04.645 --> 00:04:07.860
than the sum of the
other two sides.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.020
So length of a
side has to be less

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.405
than the sum of the
lengths of other two sides.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.000
If you're willing to deal
with degenerate triangles--

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.750
where you essentially
form a line segment,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.124
you lose all your
dimensionality,

00:04:29.124 --> 00:04:30.860
you turn to a
one-dimensional figure--

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.510
then you could say
less than or equal,

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.607
but we're just going to stick
to non-degenerate triangles.

00:04:36.607 --> 00:04:38.190
So the length of a
side has to be less

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.990
than the sum of the lengths
of the other two sides.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.800
And just using
this principle, we

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.570
could have come up with
the same exact conclusion.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.210
You could say, well look,
x is one of the sides.

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.420
It has to be less than the sum
of the lengths of the other two

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.980
sides.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.890
So it has to be
less than 6 plus 10,

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.530
or x has to be less than
16-- the exact same result

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:07.250
we got by visualizing
it like this.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.600
You want to say
how large can x be?

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:16.650
Well you could say, well,
10 has to be less than-- Or

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.460
how small can x be?

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.810
You have to say 10
has to be less than 6

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.840
plus x, the sum of the lengths
of the other two sides.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.950
If you subtract 6 from
both sides right over here,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:37.310
you get 4 is less than x,
or x is greater than 4.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.884
So this is a, in some level,
it's a kind of a basic idea,

00:05:40.884 --> 00:05:43.300
but it's something that you'll
see definitely in geometry.

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.040
And then you'll go far into
other types of mathematics

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.590
and you'll see other versions
of what's essentially

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.930
this triangle
inequality theorem.
