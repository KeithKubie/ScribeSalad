00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:03.290
Harvard has a long tradition of service

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.210
to all of our neighbors both near and far

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.089
and it has been a key part of the university since
its founding.

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:17.220
service is a core aspect of all we do at Harvard.
Service in terms of what we discover

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.820
and the ways it can change the world, service
in the form of

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.920
teaching and communicating knowledge, but also service
in the way

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.469
in which we relate to our communities both
local,

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:31.939
national and global.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:38.330
Service experience gives Harvard students an ability
to try out ideas, to understand

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.680
how they can have an impact on the world around them,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.550
how can we be vibrant and integral 
parts of the communities in which we are located

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.550
so that we serve them through being engaged with them
and it's not a one-way interaction but rather

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.580
a reciprocal interaction in which we understand
what we can bring to the communities in which

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:06.190
we're located but we also understand what those
community spring to us. We have a program

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.110
at Harvard

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.480
for service employees it's called the bridge
program. Recently I attended a celebration

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.910
of citizenship of the naturalization of thirty
three individuals who were participants in

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.410
the bridge program

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.290
and a considerable part of their preparation
for their citizenship exams

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.289
took place in conjunction with undergraduate
students who

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.189
tutored them on aspects of American history,
American government and other kinds of things

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.580
they needed to know for these exams

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.880
and wonderful relationships had grown up between
the undergraduate students

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.000
and the new American citizens and this celebration
for me marked

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.780
a marvelous achievement by a group of our
workers but also a marvelous

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.520
example of engagement by

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.160
our students. Tough economic
times make what we do all the more important

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.870
what we do in the communities that we can
help that surround us and the ways that we can

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.520
translate skills and engagement of our

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.989
students and faculty into helpful interventions
in community life

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:14.369
but also the ways in which our knowledge can
provide a means of service to help us understand

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.259
how to get out of these times.

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:21.569
It's a teaching experience, a learning experience often
and for our students and integral part of

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.949
their learning here Harvard
