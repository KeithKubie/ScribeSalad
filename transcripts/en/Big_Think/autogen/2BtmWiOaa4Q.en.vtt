the dismal science and it makes you feel
 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.820
the dismal science and it makes you feel
cold and almost like a bean counter if

you're just saying well how much money
does that cost and how much good does

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009
does that cost and how much good does
 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.730

that do but of course the alternative

constraint we only have a limited amount

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400
constraint we only have a limited amount
 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.880
constraint we only have a limited amount
of money to do good go away but it

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890

of money to do good go away but it
certainly means that we end up leaving

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050

this world less good than what it could
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.729
this world less good than what it could
otherwise have been so while I

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
otherwise have been so while I
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.579
otherwise have been so while I
understand the emotion we also want to

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589
understand the emotion we also want to
 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.950
understand the emotion we also want to
feel good we also want to make sure that

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
feel good we also want to make sure that
 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.490
feel good we also want to make sure that
we have done good the ultimate arbiter

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500
we have done good the ultimate arbiter
 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.950
we have done good the ultimate arbiter
of that will have to be well how much

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960
of that will have to be well how much
 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200
of that will have to be well how much
money did we spend and how well did we

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210
money did we spend and how well did we
 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.450
money did we spend and how well did we
spend it so I think it can inform our

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
spend it so I think it can inform our
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979
spend it so I think it can inform our
choices and hopefully make it possible

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989
choices and hopefully make it possible
 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080
choices and hopefully make it possible
for us to make sure that we didn't just

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090
for us to make sure that we didn't just
 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.240
for us to make sure that we didn't just
feel good that we didn't just feel like

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
feel good that we didn't just feel like
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.430
feel good that we didn't just feel like
oh this is really cool but that we

kids and grandkids are going to feel
 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.690
kids and grandkids are going to feel
great about what we did simply because

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700
great about what we did simply because
 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.940
great about what we did simply because
we had great speeches or felt very good

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950
we had great speeches or felt very good
 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.010
we had great speeches or felt very good
about ourselves but ultimately they're

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
about ourselves but ultimately they're
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.310
about ourselves but ultimately they're
going to judge us and how well we did

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320
 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.830
if you look through a human civilization

we've had lots of problems that seemed

we've had lots of problems that seemed
 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.430
we've had lots of problems that seemed
insurmountable at the time but we've

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440
insurmountable at the time but we've
 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.290
insurmountable at the time but we've
overcome them because we're quite

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300
overcome them because we're quite

innovative species so my biggest fear is

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360
innovative species so my biggest fear is
 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.600
innovative species so my biggest fear is
not that we are not going to do much

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610
not that we are not going to do much
 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.490
not that we are not going to do much
better in the future my biggest fear is

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500
better in the future my biggest fear is
 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.859
better in the future my biggest fear is
that we're not going to do as well as we

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869
that we're not going to do as well as we
 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.560
that we're not going to do as well as we
possibly could we have lots of solution

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570
possibly could we have lots of solution

let's pick those and let's not just make

simple politically correct but
ultimately feeble ways to tackle the

ultimately feeble ways to tackle the

looking at 50 years ahead is always
 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.730
looking at 50 years ahead is always
fraught with difficulty but if we look

fraught with difficulty but if we look

fraught with difficulty but if we look
at the only scenarios have actually been

better is the choices that we really
 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.660
better is the choices that we really
have to decide and I hope that we're

have to decide and I hope that we're
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.699
have to decide and I hope that we're
going to make good choices but I fear

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709
going to make good choices but I fear
 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:30.809
going to make good choices but I fear
that we're just going to make the

but by insisting in the public discourse
that this has to be about what is
