00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:14.990
Lactose intolerance is simply the body’s
inability to digest lactose.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.630
Lactose is a disaccharide, or a molecule made
up of two types of sugars, in this case, glucose

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.160
and galactose.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.539
Most people have an enzyme (a protein molecule
that breaks down other molecules) lactase

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.420
in their digestive systems.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.330
This enzyme breaks down lactose into glucose
and galactose.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.860
The body can then absorb and use these sugars
for energy.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.440
When someone has a lactase deficiency, lactose
cannot be digested and remains in the digestive

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.650
system causing a wide range of unwanted symptoms,
including abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea, nausea,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.300
and a bloated stomach.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.630
When you eat any food, your body has to process
it.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.041
You can think of your digestive tract, that
path between your mouth and your anus, as

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:02.630
a system that is essentially outside of your
body, just contained within it.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.040
It’s the job of your digestive system to
break down the foods we take in, allowing

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.100
the nutrients to “cross-over” into the
different body systems and organs for use

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100
as fuel.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.749
Each different part breaks these foods down
differently.

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:18.689
For example, the mouth chews it up into smaller
parts.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.990
The stomach uses enzymes and acids to further
break it down.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.229
The food then goes to the small intestine
where most of the nutrients that come from

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.770
our food (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates)
get absorbed into the bloodstream by a process

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.399
called diffusion.

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.810
What is left over is then passed to the large
intestine whose main job is the absorption

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.990
of water that remains in the indigestible
residue of food.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.689
Lactose, for the most part, gets broken down
by lactase in the small intestine.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.259
If this is done quickly enough, and completely,
then no lactose reaches the large intestine.

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.700
If lactose does reach the large intestine,
it will begin to ferment creating lactic and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.240
other fatty acids (ahhh the cause of the burning,
stabbing pain your watery stool invokes is

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.240
revealed).

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.380
Several types of bacteria (called intestinal
flora) will also begin to digest and use the

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.380
sugars.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.030
Their resulting metabolism can create the
unwanted flatulence submarine dwellers everywhere

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.060
fear!

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.870
The longer the lactose stays in your colon,
the greater the problem becomes.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.799
So pray your colon works quickly!

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:30.019
The question then becomes, how does one develop
the lactase deficiency that causes lactose

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.019
intolerance?

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.239
There are two types of lactase deficiencies,
primary and secondary.

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.379
Primary lactase deficiency (sometimes known
as Congenital Lactase Deficiency), for the

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:43.650
most part, begins after age 2 and develops
slowly over time.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.860
Before the age of two, children have a much
higher level of lactase in their digestive

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.860
tract.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.760
This is thought to help them better digest
breast milk from their nursing mothers.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.290
After the age of two the body begins to produce
less lactase, presumably due to the decrease

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.980
in milk consumption.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.170
As a person develops, the symptoms begin to
reveal themselves in late adolescence and

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.519
early adulthood.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.260
If you suffer from primary lactase deficiency,
blame your parents!

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.670
Researchers have now identified the gene (specifically
chromosome 2q21), most likely, responsible

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.140
for lactase deficiency and as such is thought
to be passed on from your parents.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:27.620
Although extremely rare (in one study, since
1966, only 42 patients in Finland have been

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.660
diagnosed), primary lactase deficiency can
happen before the age of two.

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.090
Secondary lactase deficiency is the result
of injury or illness affecting the small intestine,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.349
or the body’s ability to make lactase.

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.250
Some common causes include chemotherapy, celiac
disease, or Crohn’s disease.

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.270
So not only do you have cancer and have to
be treated with a poison, but you might not

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.040
even be able to enjoy a nice cup of warm milk
to settle your nauseated stomach!

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:05.430
The fates 
can be cruel!
