to all the underprivileged
children in the world.

00:00:06.306 --> 00:00:09.576
( clapping )

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.778
Incredible,
Charles, really incredible.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.647
Well, before we vote to
approve funding

00:00:13.747 --> 00:00:15.649
for Charles' project,

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.151
it's my honor to welcome our
newest board member,

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:19.620
Amy BlackBerry.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.621
Hey guys.

00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:21.955
I know you all think I'm
here just 'cause

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:23.624
my dad
owns this company

00:00:23.724 --> 00:00:25.959
and like a third of all
the phones on Earth,

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.694
but honestly, I
submitted for this job

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.162
under a fake name,

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.565
just like Tori Spelling
on "90210."

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:32.866
Well, regardless,

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.067
we are thrilled to have
you here.

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:35.269
Welcome to the team.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.337
( clapping )

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:41.074
Cool... how cool.

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:42.442
Well, let's vote.

00:00:42.543 --> 00:00:44.444
Oh, you know what, if I
could just interject here,

00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:46.880
I actually had a different
plan I wanted considered

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.449
for that same funding.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.418
I know my dad's really
behind it.

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.520
I don't want that
to affect anybody's decision,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.088
it's just an FYI.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:56.523
Okay, Amy,
yeah, go right ahead.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:57.391
Yeah?

00:00:57.491 --> 00:00:59.059
Yeah.
Okay, great.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.963
Um, I have two words for
you guys.

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.066
Just two words.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:08.569
"Cat park."

00:01:08.669 --> 00:01:10.504
Huh?

00:01:10.604 --> 00:01:11.772
"Cat park."

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:14.608
Raise your hand if you've
ever heard of a dog park.

00:01:17.244 --> 00:01:19.513
I know I have.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:24.618
And now raise your hand if
you've seen a cat park?

00:01:24.718 --> 00:01:26.920
Yeah, are you
guys with me right now?

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:29.957
We build the first
ever cat park,

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.592
right here
in our community.

00:01:31.692 --> 00:01:32.860
These are the ears,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.461
these are
the eyes, whiskers, nose.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.829
What's missing?

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.097
The mouth.

00:01:37.197 --> 00:01:38.298
Why is there no mouth?

00:01:38.398 --> 00:01:41.535
Because I'm speaking
for cat park.

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:43.337
Pass it
around, take a swig.

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:45.005
Okay, some of you still have
some questions,

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.206
that's fair.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.008

Cat park will
serve as a safe haven,

00:02:23.577 --> 00:02:27.781
not only for cats, but for
cat owners, too?

00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:28.882
Is this real?

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.551
Are you real?

00:02:30.651 --> 00:02:31.385
Yes.

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:33.086
Okay, I get it,
"cat park."

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.821
But why now?

00:02:34.922 --> 00:02:38.091
Why not meow?

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:41.161
There will be a section of
cat park with a slide

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.297
and you will
put the cat on the slide

00:02:43.397 --> 00:02:48.001
and you can watch that cat
slide down that slide.

00:02:50.804 --> 00:02:53.106
All right--
That kicks ass.

00:02:53.207 --> 00:02:54.141
I know
you're all thinking,

00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:55.375
will babies be allowed
in this park?

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:57.945
No, they will be arrested if
they enter the park.

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.214
This doesn't make
any sense.

00:03:00.314 --> 00:03:01.548
Shut up, Charles.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:02.950
Yeah, Charles.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.184
Cat park.

00:03:04.284 --> 00:03:05.185
It's simple.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.753
Well, I mean,
it's not that simple.

00:03:06.854 --> 00:03:08.055
No one's ever thought of
it before.

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:09.957
I am the first one.

00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:11.859
Well, I don't think
we need to vote on this,

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.160
but let's
just do it for fun.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.530
All in favor of approving
Amy's cat park?

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:23.303
We could have
saved millions of kids,

00:03:23.403 --> 00:03:26.573
but after
seeing that presentation,

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.809
I don't want to
save kids.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.411
I want
to entertain cats.

00:03:31.512 --> 00:03:34.882
Welcome to cat park!

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:37.084

ovation, everybody.
