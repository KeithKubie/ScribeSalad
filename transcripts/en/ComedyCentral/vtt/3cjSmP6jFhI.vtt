00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:03.269
WHEN WE ARRIVED,
WE MET OUR SPACE FAMILY--

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:04.737
THE THREE OTHER HUMANS
WHO WOULD JOIN US

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.639
ON OUR HEAVENLY JOURNEY.

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:08.908
THERE WAS BRYCE FROOD,
WHO TOLD ME SECRETLY

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:10.877
HE PLANNED TO PROPOSE
TO HIS GIRLFRIEND, CARRIE,

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.212
AT 300,00 FEET,

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.215
AND THE SINGER AND CERTIFIED
COSMONAUT LANCE BASS,

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:18.084
WHO HAD RAISED FUNDS
FOR HIS TRIP

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:19.886
THROUGH AN AMBITIOUS
SPONSORSHIP PLAN.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.654
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO HAVE.
- RIGHT?

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.489
- WERE WE ALL SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.425
- I WISH I HAD THOUGHT OF THAT.
- YEAH.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.527
- WE'RE GONNA BE LEAVING
THIS PLACE, EARTH.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.395
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE GOING
ANYWHERE NEAR THESE PLANETOIDS

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:31.164
OR ANY PLANETOIDS,
FOR THAT MATTER.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:34.200
WE'RE GONNA BE STAYING
RIGHT IN HERE.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:37.770
- WHAT WILL WE
BE LOOKING DOWN ON?

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:41.674
OVER ONE THRILLING WEEK,
THE FIVE OF US

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:44.911
COMPLETED AN EXHAUSTIVE SERIES
OF PREPARATIONS.

00:00:46.545 --> 00:00:48.481
- FLOCK OF SEAGULLS.

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.416
- WE SIGNED OUR LIFE AWAY
ON NUMEROUS FORMS.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.385
- EVERYBODY GETS ONE.

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:56.389
- WE LEARNED
SPECIAL SAFETY PROTOCOLS.

00:00:56.422 --> 00:01:01.194
- ONE, TWO, THREE.
VERY GOOD.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.396
- YOU KNOW, SOMEDAY
WE'RE GONNA LIVE IN OUTER SPACE

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.631
AND LIVE ON PLANETS.

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:08.234
I WON'T BE AROUND TO SEE THAT,
AND I DON'T THINK I WANT TO,

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.336
BUT JUST TO READ ABOUT IT
IS SO EXCITING.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.038
- NOW HIT
THAT THREE-POINT SAFETY CHECK.

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.773
- WHAT?
- THE THREE-POINT--

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.374
- YES, THEY ARE
ONE, TWO, THREE,

00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:17.009
AND OUT YOUR GO.
- OKAY.

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:18.545
GREAT. YEAH.
- GOOD JOB.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.382
- THEN WE SPENT A DAY JUMPING
ON TRAMPOLINES

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:26.152
TO PREPARE OUR BODIES AND MINDS
FOR ZERO GRAVITY.

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.488
- AND STRATOJUMP.

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.523
GOOD.
TOUCH YOUR TOES, SIR.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:32.792
- IT WAS THE FINAL STAGE
OF PREPARATION WE NEEDED

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:35.061
FOR THE RIGORS OF SPACE TRAVEL.
