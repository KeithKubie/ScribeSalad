00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.350
Oh wait, you're listening. Okay.

2
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:13.770
<v 1>You are listening to radio lab radio from W N Y.</v>

3
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.910
S. T. Yep. Hey,

4
00:00:19.911 --> 00:00:23.530
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and you know,

5
00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.810
here we are in this moment where we're about to get started with another

6
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:31.040
election cycle, another Iowa and other New Hampshire, Carolina, all of that.

7
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.050
And this is the time when we reporters decide, Whoa,

8
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.510
we're going to have to tell you some stuff and you're going to have to decide

9
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:38.030
what matters to you. And, uh, the story that we're gonna tell them.

10
00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:42.230
This podcast is about a moment, a shockingly recent moment.

11
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.590
That's how I felt when I first heard this story. A moment of when,

12
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.800
what reporters decide to tell on what people decide to value really changed.

13
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.970
So we're going to take you back to an evening in 1987,

14
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.180
Tom Fiedler, a split Hickle reporter for the Miami Herald.

15
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.540
It's late at night and he's in his office.

16
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.290
I'm at my desk and just in fact packing up to go home.

17
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.390
My phone rang and I'm thinking, oh, it's probably my wife.

18
00:01:08.391 --> 00:01:11.120
And she's wondering why I haven't left yet. I said, all right, I'll pick it up.

19
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.770
But when he picked up the phone, turned out this, uh,

20
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.260
it turned out it was not a voice.

21
00:01:15.261 --> 00:01:19.040
He recognized it was a woman's voice maybe in her late twenties.

22
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.780
And she said to him, I have something you need to know.

23
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.010
It was a tip about one of the most powerful and charismatic men in American

24
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.350
politics, former senator Gary Hart,

25
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.550
who at the time was not only the most likely candidate to become the Democratic

26
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:33.384
nominee,

27
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.750
he was very possibly going to be the next president of the United States.

28
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.270
Her words to me, whore,

29
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.580
Gary Hart is having an affair with one of my best friends.

30
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.080
<v 2>And she told him, basically I can prove it. And uh, you know, I,</v>

31
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.740
I was a rather I guess, uh, uh, dumps truck

32
00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.293
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

33
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.280
<v 1>any thought on our, what do we do now if you're of a certain age,</v>

34
00:02:02.281 --> 00:02:04.980
you probably remember this story. You probably know what happens next.

35
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:07.080
But even if you've never heard of Gary Hart,

36
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.010
you still probably know the outline of this story. The accusation

37
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.570
[inaudible] Elliott Spit John Edward. Then the denial.

38
00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.190
I did not have sexual relations with that woman. And then after that,

39
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.800
the whole wall, the wall media thing and thing scan, scan,

40
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.300
which just goes on and on and on until you want to take your head off your

41
00:02:27.301 --> 00:02:29.730
shoulders, put it on the sidewalk and beat it with a baseball bat.

42
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.410
But the thing that's easy to forget is that it wasn't always like this.

43
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:37.643
No

44
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.250
<v 2>was the first to walk into this vortex of social forces.</v>

45
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.210
And after that,

46
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.170
the rules of political journalism and politics change almost immediately,

47
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.160
<v 1>by the way, is mat by national political columnist for Yahoo News.</v>

48
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.880
He wrote a book about this incident, which he called all the truth is out.

49
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.130
And in that book he makes the argument

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.630
<v 4>that this is the moment Gary Hart,</v>

51
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.140
1987 when political journalism slid off the rails,

52
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.920
or you would argue when it finally got serious. Well, you know, it was fun

53
00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.590
<v 1>back a minute. Cause I think, I think the context is important.</v>

54
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.160
1984 heart kind of comes from nowhere.

55
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.880
It's a whole new ballgame in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination

56
00:03:19.881 --> 00:03:21.620
runs for president dorms.

57
00:03:21.621 --> 00:03:25.760
New Hampshire Senator Gary Hart is on his way to a clear cut victory over

58
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.440
Walter Mondale Mondale

59
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.740
<v 4>there and becomes a political celebrity that's country,</v>

60
00:03:30.741 --> 00:03:33.140
cannot stand for more years of

61
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.630
Reaganomics for the Rep. Very

62
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.540
<v 1>hard. Gary Hart, the Senator From Colorado, Gary Hart,</v>

63
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.470
I'm a Democrat and proud of it. Part was this tall, good looking democrat.

64
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.730
He's got great wavy hair. I mean dashing, handsome,

65
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.020
charismatic and young. This is Leslie stall, CBS.

66
00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.960
She's covered politics for 40 years now. Works for 60 minutes.

67
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:59.650
He was cool and smart women liked him too.

68
00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.250
He's an anti Orthodox Democrat, very liberal

69
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.720
<v 4>oral anti nukes is sort of the Bill Clinton before Bill Clinton.</v>

70
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.850
He doesn't get the Democratic nomination in 1984 Walter Mondale does by a nose,

71
00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:15.060
but when Mondale gets crushed by Ronald Reagan,

72
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.770
Hart is immediately presumed to be the next nominee of the party at a time when

73
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.880
these things were more obvious. So fast forward to 1987

74
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.040
<v 1>like it or not, campaign 88 is underway and the leading contender, front runner,</v>

75
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.990
Gary Hart in New Hampshire, he's, he's winning.

76
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.390
He's running double digits higher than any Democrat and he's projected to beat

77
00:04:36.391 --> 00:04:40.170
George Bush, the Republican front runner, ex president of the United States.

78
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.483
<v 0>Very hard.</v>

79
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:47.080
<v 4>It felt like, look, this is a guy who is changing politics,</v>

80
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:49.720
who is unafraid to speak the truth,

81
00:04:49.721 --> 00:04:52.960
who is willing to be really clear about what he wants to do.

82
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.130
That's Kevin Sweeney.

83
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:59.080
He was heart's press secretary in 1987 he joined the campaign a just a few years

84
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:03.700
out of college, 23. I'm idealistic. The first time we, um, we really met,

85
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.300
he, I was wearing a neck tie with pictures of Lincoln and Washington on it.

86
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:10.090
And Hart said, that's the ugliest neck tie I've ever seen in my life,

87
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.100
so that my mother made it and he said, I apologize. Well,

88
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:18.760
that's a good beginning. Yeah, I knew pretty early I wanted to work for a heart.

89
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.840
You remember why? Um, he was really liberal on social issues at the time.

90
00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:26.930
Unafraid to be specific or take a stand. I mean, he said heart, uh,

91
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.540
place an extraordinary amount of emphasis on not just winning the campaign,

92
00:05:31.541 --> 00:05:36.430
but what would they do when they gotten office? He commanded that attitude.

93
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.030
So they wrote out all these position papers on foreign policy, energy,

94
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:40.900
international trade,

95
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:43.960
the budget even what would his relationship with Gorbachev be?

96
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.470
There was something about heart and something about the,

97
00:05:47.471 --> 00:05:52.090
what happened on the campaign where it did feel like the kind of campaign that I

98
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:53.230
haven't seen since.

99
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.070
And when does the subject of what goes on below the belt come up, if at all? Um,

100
00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.750
<v 1>we'll, they were rumors, definitely rumors sign.</v>

101
00:06:01.751 --> 00:06:04.510
There are a lot of whispers about his personal life and a lot of speculation.

102
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.010
He's been married to his, uh, college sweetheart Lee for a very long time.

103
00:06:09.011 --> 00:06:12.970
They've been separated twice, no long separations. And during those separations,

104
00:06:12.971 --> 00:06:14.470
he's dated openly in Washington.

105
00:06:14.471 --> 00:06:19.390
So it's a well known a fact of life in Washington where he is a central figure

106
00:06:19.391 --> 00:06:22.180
and has a lot of friends in the press corps that he's dated, uh,

107
00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:24.250
that he's dated people for extended periods of time,

108
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:27.280
that he and his wife have a troubled marriage, uh, together and not together.

109
00:06:27.281 --> 00:06:30.580
He stayed on Bob Woodward's couch for a little while when she kicked him out at

110
00:06:30.581 --> 00:06:32.890
one point a, nobody wrote about that.

111
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:36.230
And the reason they didn't write about it was because of a very old,

112
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.100
very well established convention. I mean, look,

113
00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:43.580
go back to the 20th century. Franklin Roosevelt, Lyndon Johnson,

114
00:06:43.581 --> 00:06:47.360
Dwight Eisenhower, uh, you know, heroes towering figures,

115
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:52.010
their personal lives simply were not in play. Take for example, JFK.

116
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.890
Leslie stall says that when the press was covering him,

117
00:06:54.891 --> 00:06:59.891
vast numbers of reporters knew that John Kennedy was cheating on his wife.

118
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.430
That was no secret,

119
00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:06.610
but we wouldn't have dreamed of printing that even if the whispers were loud

120
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:11.450
enough to spread around the country. It just wasn't done is the thought. Hey,

121
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.620
I could, nobody does that. So I, you know, forget about it. Or, Hey,

122
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.240
that has nothing to do with with statecraft. I think the feeling was that,

123
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.620
so what, you know,

124
00:07:21.621 --> 00:07:25.510
we all get to have a zone of privacy and the assumption was that, uh,

125
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.270
what happened in your private zone behind closed doors had nothing to do with

126
00:07:29.271 --> 00:07:31.280
whether you were going to be a good president or not.

127
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.970
I mean there are certain ethics and certain standards,

128
00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:38.430
I guess this is the world that heart still thinks he's living in it.

129
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:42.300
As long as it doesn't burst into public view, it won't be a story.

130
00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:46.410
But Matt by says that world was actually changing because of a political

131
00:07:46.411 --> 00:07:50.400
earthquake that had happened just over a decade before talking about the

132
00:07:50.401 --> 00:07:51.234
Watergate,

133
00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.020
breaking burglarizing and bugging Democratic headquarters in Washington that

134
00:07:55.021 --> 00:07:58.020
isn't big first knocked out brick in that wall.

135
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.900
Five people have been arrested and charged with breaking into the headquarters

136
00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:02.820
of the Democratic National Committee. You know,

137
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:05.610
arguably the biggest scandal in White House history.

138
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:09.210
You had Nixon tapping phone lines, compiling enemy lists, stairwell,

139
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:12.570
and for the reporters covering Nixon, it really is an embarrassment.

140
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.833
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

141
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:16.920
<v 1>You had an entire White House press corps,</v>

142
00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:20.010
Political Press Corp Campaign Press Corps who had followed this man,

143
00:08:20.011 --> 00:08:25.011
Richard Nixon for decades and somehow either missed the fact or failed to report

144
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:30.881
the fact that he had some significant psychological issues and was paranoid,

145
00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.490
uh, and and could be corrupted.

146
00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:38.270
I think there was a sense that we let the public down,

147
00:08:40.670 --> 00:08:45.320
Leslie Stall Remembers it this way. The regular White House press reporters,

148
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.540
they should have been digging, chipping away, chipping away,

149
00:08:50.541 --> 00:08:53.570
chipping away. They should have been looking behind the curtain.

150
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.430
And so right after Watergate

151
00:08:56.550 --> 00:09:00.090
<v 4>reporters became tougher saying, okay,</v>

152
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.130
we have to be skeptical about everything. And in particular the character issue,

153
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.020
<v 6>meaning suddenly your makeup, your personal behavior,</v>

154
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:14.580
who you are in your private moments matters a whole hell of a lot for the kind

155
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:19.170
of president you can be and whether or not we can trust you as a public leader.

156
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.373
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

157
00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.840
<v 6>parts character is the subject tonight of our weekend journal. One,</v>

158
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:29.210
Americans choose precedents.

159
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.340
Personal character traits are important in this day and age. Candidates,

160
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:36.150
personal lives are getting a great deal of scrutiny. I remember

161
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.760
<v 4>there was a bit of a shift in the kinds of reporters who were covering national</v>

162
00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:41.594
politics.

163
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.510
They had a different orientation and they were really interested in the

164
00:09:44.511 --> 00:09:46.640
character question. That's Kevin Sweeney again.

165
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:49.880
He says he was initially frustrated by reporters,

166
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:53.930
strange obsession with things that were not really issues,

167
00:09:53.931 --> 00:09:56.630
important issues in the campaign like age.

168
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.670
There was some confusion about heart's age.

169
00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:02.000
The fact that he changed the family name, uh,

170
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.550
his signature changed at a certain point in his life.

171
00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.830
He says when those stories initially popped up,

172
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:11.390
I thought it was a false set of issues. I didn't really take it seriously.

173
00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.190
But then when it came to the rumors, yeah.

174
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.170
<v 2>Of quote womanizing or marital infidelity,</v>

175
00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.600
he felt like he needed to talk to Gary Hart.

176
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.790
<v 4>Yeah, I did say if anything is happening, it needs to stop. I mean, this can't,</v>

177
00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.700
whatever it is. I mean, I, I, and he said, you know, nothing is happening.

178
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.300
And he shot back and said they have no right to cover that. That's ridiculous.

179
00:10:30.301 --> 00:10:33.630
It's not an issue that, you know, why is that an issue? That's not their job.

180
00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.370
And I kept pushing back saying, I don't,

181
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:37.270
I don't actually care what their job is. I don't,

182
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.010
I don't care what you think their job is. This is the new context that exists.

183
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:43.620
Now. I don't know why or how, but the rules have changed.

184
00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.380
<v 2>The rules have changed.</v>

185
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:51.310
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

186
00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.750
<v 2>so, uh, uh, it, you know, it was, it,</v>

187
00:10:53.830 --> 00:10:56.530
this brings us back to Tom Fiedler at the Miami Herald.

188
00:10:56.531 --> 00:11:00.250
He was covering Gary Hart, going with him to all the stops in Iowa,

189
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.660
New Hampshire and so forth.

190
00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:05.620
And it seemed like at every stop along the way,

191
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:10.630
someone, some reporter would raise her his hand and would say,

192
00:11:10.631 --> 00:11:13.450
what about the rumors of his womanizing?

193
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.990
And Tom says that he would see reporters asking all these questions and he,

194
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.830
he was a little bit troubled. So on April 27th, 1987,

195
00:11:20.831 --> 00:11:23.440
he wrote a column asking the question,

196
00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:28.270
is it ethical for journalists to be even raising this kind of a,

197
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.350
of a question?

198
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.440
And I really came down to the conclusion that unless the a media,

199
00:11:34.991 --> 00:11:39.250
unless the reporters involved had actual proof that um,

200
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.120
this was a problem, that he was a womanizer. We just shouldn't be printing.

201
00:11:43.121 --> 00:11:45.250
That column runs on a Monday morning.

202
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:49.450
That night he gets the call of voice on the other side,

203
00:11:49.451 --> 00:11:54.451
says Gary Hart is having an affair with one of my best friends.

204
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:57.620
He was dumbstruck as we know. I told her that, uh,

205
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:01.630
my position had to be that I couldn't believe what she had to say unless there

206
00:12:01.631 --> 00:12:03.820
was proof. And um, finally she said,

207
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:08.821
my friend is going to fly up to Washington next weekend and she's going to spend

208
00:12:09.791 --> 00:12:12.040
the weekend with Senator Hart. She said,

209
00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:15.880
so all you have to do is buy a ticket on that plane.

210
00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:21.370
And I thought, well, would that be ethically okay?

211
00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.430
What is inbounds and what is out of it?

212
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.550
<v 7>Bounds. I mean, character was this new obsession of political journalism.</v>

213
00:12:26.551 --> 00:12:27.690
But according to Matt by,

214
00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:32.550
no one had taken that character question into a candidates bedroom.

215
00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:33.780
That was new.

216
00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.810
<v 2>But Feedly thought, well, no, no, no, no, this, this is inbound.</v>

217
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.840
Because Gary Hart was publicly denying that he had been carrying on affairs

218
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.410
with, with anyone in particular. It'd be clear,

219
00:12:46.411 --> 00:12:49.860
oftentimes when Gary Hart was asked about these rumors of an affair,

220
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.280
he's never asked directly just about the rumors. He'd say something like this,

221
00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.970
it's no one else's business. Now why is it not anyone else's business?

222
00:12:56.971 --> 00:12:58.490
Because it isn't no,

223
00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.380
but hasn't been the business of the American public for 200 years.

224
00:13:01.381 --> 00:13:03.240
And it isn't today. He'd say something like that.

225
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:05.550
But Fiedler says a couple of times when he's asked,

226
00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:08.610
he did say something that amounted to a no,

227
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.730
such as if there was any truth to these allegations,

228
00:13:11.731 --> 00:13:16.260
it would have come out long before the kinds of answers that were non denials,

229
00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.990
denials. Another phrase that came out of Watergate.

230
00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.710
So my view at that point was, um,

231
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:27.770
if in fact there was proof that he was carrying on an affair privately while

232
00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:34.080
publicly, um, insisting that there really was no base to this,

233
00:13:34.081 --> 00:13:37.420
then that was a relevant issue, relevant to his performance,

234
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.190
just pure future president. Yes. It was a question of integrity.

235
00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:42.773
So Oh,

236
00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.780
we thought the only way that we are going to find out if what the caller told us

237
00:13:48.121 --> 00:13:49.260
is true is we've

238
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:52.450
<v 7>got to catch him. That's coming up next.</v>

239
00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:01.060
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

240
00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:03.400
<v 8>this would be laser calling from Milwaukee.</v>

More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

244

<v 7>hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab.</v>

245
00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.160
Getting back to the story reporter,

246
00:14:28.161 --> 00:14:33.161
Tom Fiedler gets a tip saying that candidate Gary Hart is having an affair and

247
00:14:33.381 --> 00:14:38.360
he thinks to himself, this is inbounds. If it's true, therefore

248
00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.730
<v 2>we've got to catch him.</v>

249
00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:44.560
So it was editor tells a colleague of his Jim McGee to go to the airport telling

250
00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:45.940
him this is what you're going to do.

251
00:14:45.941 --> 00:14:48.730
You're going to look for a woman who looks like a model.

252
00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:50.570
That's how the woman on the phone described her friend.

253
00:14:50.571 --> 00:14:55.571
She's described as a model blonde in her mid twenties and call me back if you

254
00:14:55.941 --> 00:14:58.700
see it. So this Guy Jim races to the airport spots.

255
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:02.390
This attractive young woman fits the description. Of course,

256
00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:06.600
we later knew was don arise, so he boards the plane, they land in DC,

257
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:10.700
he follows her out of the airport, do a cab, he runs to another cab,

258
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.320
jumps in at end. He says, follow that cab. Just like in the movies take too.

259
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.790
He loses her for a while,

260
00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:21.080
but then eventually it gets to the house where he thinks Hart and this lady

261
00:15:21.081 --> 00:15:21.800
should be hand.

262
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.800
He's not there more than a few minutes when the front door opens and outcomes.

263
00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:30.680
The young woman on the arm of a very handsome man,

264
00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:34.820
one small problem. Jim had never met Gary Hart.

265
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.660
He had no idea what Gary heart looked like. He said later, he said,

266
00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:41.420
I really couldn't pick Gary Hart out of a lineup.

267
00:15:41.450 --> 00:15:46.370
That's when I really thought we have got to go to Washington and that's what

268
00:15:46.371 --> 00:15:49.910
they do to Harold. Matt by again, they send a team of reporters,

269
00:15:49.911 --> 00:15:53.510
investigative reporters and Fiedler and photographer to Washington.

270
00:15:53.511 --> 00:15:57.530
We arrived Saturday morning. They stake out his townhouse. You know,

271
00:15:57.531 --> 00:15:58.730
I'm thinking, my gosh,

272
00:15:58.731 --> 00:16:03.320
somebody will surely notice that there are four or five of us lurking is

273
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.910
probably the right word.

274
00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:09.020
It's May in one guy's in a Parka to disguise himself and Fiedler who the

275
00:16:09.021 --> 00:16:12.350
candidate knows is in a jogging suit and he's pretending to jog around the

276
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:15.200
street all day long. I would change clothes a little bit.

277
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.380
Occasionally I would run without the jacket.

278
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.080
Other Times I would just be wearing a tee shirt and shorts.

279
00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:24.330
He'd run around and around and around. It's not how the CIA would do it, uh,

280
00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.300
but it's about what you'd expect from a newspaper.

281
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:31.070
Our quote unquote stakeout went on all day into Saturday night and it got dark

282
00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:35.120
and then front door opens outcomes.

283
00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:37.160
This man and outcomes,

284
00:16:37.161 --> 00:16:42.080
the blonde woman heart walks out with Donna Rice, a sort of arm in arm key.

285
00:16:42.081 --> 00:16:45.260
Quickly realizes something is wrong.

286
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.920
You kind of makes the surveillance. They see him, he sees them,

287
00:16:48.921 --> 00:16:52.670
he turns her back around. They go inside and go back inside the townhouse.

288
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:56.720
He sends her away through the back door and then he comes back out of the

289
00:16:56.721 --> 00:16:59.720
townhouse, hops in his car and starts to drive off.

290
00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:07.320
So our photographer starts to chase Senator Hart's car.

291
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:10.620
He drives a couple blocks up, streets, down, streets, back and forth.

292
00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:13.260
He gets out of the car, walks through a park, face, continues on.

293
00:17:13.650 --> 00:17:15.030
Flipkey knows they're following him and they know,

294
00:17:15.031 --> 00:17:18.060
he knows they're following ducks around the corner. They lose him for a second,

295
00:17:18.061 --> 00:17:21.990
then they're running to catch up and then they turn a corner in an alley and

296
00:17:21.991 --> 00:17:26.980
there's heart. There is the presumed nominee of the Democratic Party,

297
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.710
the most important democratic politician in the country.

298
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.700
And they're confronting each other. And for a moment,

299
00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:36.100
standing in the alleyway behind hearts, townhouse,

300
00:17:36.101 --> 00:17:40.030
they just stare at each other because there is no script for this moment.

301
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:45.760
Ultimately, he, he, he, he asked, well, who are you? Well,

302
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.920
we're from the Miami Herald and, um, he didn't really say anything.

303
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:55.550
So, uh, so I told him that we wanted to know why he was, uh,

304
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:58.320
meeting with this woman in his townhouse,

305
00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.700
a woman who at that point we knew had spent the night with him.

306
00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.460
He says in myriad ways, myriad times,

307
00:18:05.461 --> 00:18:08.550
I'm not going to tell you who that woman was. This is private.

308
00:18:08.551 --> 00:18:10.770
This isn't public. But he says there's no affair,

309
00:18:10.771 --> 00:18:12.570
which he would maintain forever after.

310
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.370
And ultimately he said, I'm, I've said enough.

311
00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:22.680
And he turned and walked inside and uh, slammed the door.

312
00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.980
We did tell him though, he said, we're going to write this story. Uh,

313
00:18:27.981 --> 00:18:31.990
unless we a, you give us a reason as to, uh, that,

314
00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:36.560
that explains as to why what we are seeing and what we are concluding is wrong.

315
00:18:36.561 --> 00:18:40.640
And he never did that. So we kind of look at ourselves and said, well,

316
00:18:40.641 --> 00:18:41.680
now what do we do? Right?

317
00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:51.340
Ultimately the call was, we have the proof we feel we needed.

318
00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:52.990
We know that publicly.

319
00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.760
He was saying these things and we now know that privately he was engaged in

320
00:18:57.761 --> 00:19:00.310
this. So they ran back to the hotel room.

321
00:19:00.311 --> 00:19:04.840
Fiedler frantically typed out the story. Gary Hart, Comma,

322
00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:10.050
who's presidential campaign has been dogged by rumors of womanizing comma,

323
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:16.230
a spent Friday night and much of Saturday with a woman who came from Miami to

324
00:19:16.901 --> 00:19:17.734
meet him.

325
00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:23.540
I finally went back and I probably slept for three or four hours.

326
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.220
You're going to do the story.

327
00:19:25.221 --> 00:19:28.790
The only thing that gives me pause is if you under this standard,

328
00:19:28.791 --> 00:19:33.110
you'd lose Jack Kennedy. Certainly. Yeah. Lose a Woodrow Wilson.

329
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.640
I think so you'd lose a lot of people. Uh,

330
00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:39.710
you might not want to lose, but you know,

331
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:45.070
you leap to the conclusion that the public would banish a person for that.

332
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:49.640
And I don't, I don't go there. So are you worried about how it's going to land?

333
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.960
That's everybody. So Jamie York terrified. I was just, I was terrified.

334
00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:59.410
And the next morning, [inaudible] ABC news where the political world explodes.

335
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.680
Democratic presidential, hopeful. Gary Hart, Gary Hart, Gary Hart,

336
00:20:02.681 --> 00:20:07.570
them yet truly became a firestorm. The Miami Herald reports today.

337
00:20:07.571 --> 00:20:11.320
That heart quote spent Friday night and most of Saturday mind my hair old

338
00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:14.650
reports that heart and a Miami woman spent Friday night alone together and in

339
00:20:14.651 --> 00:20:17.050
his Washington townhouse with the young woman,

340
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:22.070
that story begins ricocheting around the country on the at m so by Sunday in

341
00:20:22.451 --> 00:20:25.620
front of by Harold reporters last night, art denied any impropriety.

342
00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.330
Hart denied any impropriety.

343
00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.100
It's very apparent that not only is heart in trouble,

344
00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:35.290
but the entire culture of media around politics has changed in some very

345
00:20:35.291 --> 00:20:36.124
dramatic way.

346
00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:40.890
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

347
00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.300
<v 2>and when you think about the mindset of the television people, the radio people,</v>

348
00:20:45.301 --> 00:20:47.830
the newspaper people, is there any

349
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.470
<v 1>self doubt there? Is there people saying, oh, should we,</v>

350
00:20:50.471 --> 00:20:54.670
is this really a question of his ability to conduct matters of state?

351
00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.360
Is that question being asked? There's a tremendous amount of self doubt.

352
00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:02.350
Not everyone agrees that such intense public scrutiny is necessary.

353
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.060
There was widespread feeling.

354
00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:08.320
The Miami Herald was put on the defensive feeler and his colleagues had done was

355
00:21:08.321 --> 00:21:12.370
wrong. You know, that's out of bounds. What business is it of the press?

356
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.920
You staked out a guy in his home, what are they up to?

357
00:21:14.921 --> 00:21:16.720
Sneaking around in the bushes and all that.

358
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:19.600
A lot of reporters don't think it's relevant. And one reason is this,

359
00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:23.620
nobody knows where this is going to lead this set of precedent.

360
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:27.400
Should reporters be sticking out? George Bushes House, Bruce Babbitt's house,

361
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:29.920
Joe Biden's house. But then in the same breath,

362
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.230
I mean there's generally this sense of, but you know,

363
00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.170
all he had to do basically what? Stay clean. What was he thinking?

364
00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:36.221
Heart is to blame.

365
00:21:36.221 --> 00:21:39.310
It's Gary Hartsville and didn't he understand that things had changed and

366
00:21:39.311 --> 00:21:41.050
doesn't the public maybe have a right to know?

367
00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.940
<v 2>And so the newspaper that began the controversy is not backing down.</v>

368
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:49.770
This was not character assassination. This was character suicide. He did it.

369
00:21:49.771 --> 00:21:54.771
We didn't even as the debate heats up over the ethics of its coverage of Gary

370
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.950
Hart,

371
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.720
<v 1>so there was, there was a real conflict.</v>

372
00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:01.310
All the various echelon of media respond to this differently.

373
00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.800
The New York Times refuses to touch it. Originally,

374
00:22:03.801 --> 00:22:05.690
The Washington Post is deeply conflicted.

375
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:09.910
And as for the public and an unscientific Harold telephone, Paul,

376
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:14.780
63% of the callers said they thought the paper was making too much of a fuss

377
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:15.650
over Gary Hart.

378
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.440
I mean the polling shows that people think the media overstepped.

379
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:21.890
He's still pulling very strongly. He's winning in the public mind.

380
00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.600
According to Leslie Stall, most people seem to be willing to compartmentalize.

381
00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:31.700
Most people can split off. How's he going to be as president and you know,

382
00:22:31.701 --> 00:22:32.900
is he cheating on his wife?

383
00:22:32.901 --> 00:22:36.670
It was not clear that the tide was going to take hard out at all. So harden,

384
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.300
his team tried to get ahead of this story.

385
00:22:38.301 --> 00:22:41.870
They schedule a press conference in New Hampshire and on the flight over,

386
00:22:41.871 --> 00:22:44.140
Kevin Sweeney, his press secretary please least him.

387
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:47.630
<v 4>I remember asking heart a question, something like,</v>

388
00:22:47.631 --> 00:22:51.860
have you ever been unfaithful to your wife? And he shot back at me with anger.

389
00:22:51.861 --> 00:22:54.200
He said, I don't have to answer that question. That's a question that,

390
00:22:54.201 --> 00:22:56.030
that I can answer to God, to my wife,

391
00:22:56.031 --> 00:22:58.280
but it's not a question that I need to answer in politics.

392
00:22:58.281 --> 00:23:01.190
That's a dangerous question to be asking. We don't want to go there.

393
00:23:01.850 --> 00:23:04.490
And I just said, that's a great answer. Just hold that anger. That's,

394
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.020
that's an appropriate response.

395
00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:11.860
<v 9>Senator [inaudible] your heart please. We get to the press conference,</v>

396
00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.640
heartland Sweeney walk into this colonial style room at Dartmouth College.

397
00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:21.160
[inaudible] a new poll. There are lights everywhere. The room is filled, sweaty,

398
00:23:21.161 --> 00:23:21.701
it's hot.

399
00:23:21.701 --> 00:23:25.090
There's more media than anyone's ever seen packed and it's a really intense

400
00:23:25.091 --> 00:23:28.750
environment. [inaudible] at her heart.

401
00:23:28.751 --> 00:23:31.570
Please send her to her heart has very little buffer and he's handling the

402
00:23:31.571 --> 00:23:32.404
questions.

403
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.170
How are you going to convince them that you're not going to make this kind of

404
00:23:35.171 --> 00:23:38.980
mistake and judgment about personal behavior? Again, really pretty brilliantly.

405
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.740
I won't tell them all, I'll demonstrate it as time goes on.

406
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.590
People are gonna want to know.

407
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:47.530
I want to give judgment your character on the issues that affect their lives and

408
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.630
their families, their nation. That's what this campaign is going to be about.

409
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:53.900
He's kind of firing on all cylinders and heart goes through, you know,

410
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:55.610
30 minutes, 40 minutes of questions.

411
00:23:55.611 --> 00:23:58.010
And then you read in your remarks yesterday,

412
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:01.600
you raised the issue of morality and you raised the issue of truthfulness.

413
00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:05.560
At some point he calls on a young reporter named Paul Taylor, very specific,

414
00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.040
and I have a series of questions about it,

415
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.540
and Paul Taylor walks him through a series of questions.

416
00:24:11.541 --> 00:24:12.950
You said you did nothing immoral.

417
00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.570
Did you mean that you had no sexual relationship with Donna Rice last weekend or

418
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:22.250
any other times you believe that adultery,

419
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.750
yes. You've ever committed at all. He used to senator,

420
00:24:26.751 --> 00:24:31.500
have you ever committed adultery? Senator Hart looked out

421
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:32.970
<v 1>at the Sea of reporters. No.</v>

422
00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:37.510
No politician had ever publicly been asked that broad direct question about his

423
00:24:37.511 --> 00:24:41.080
personal behavior. It really just, it shocked the room.

424
00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.600
We don't know what Gary Hart was thinking in that moment.

425
00:24:43.601 --> 00:24:45.250
He did not want to be interviewed on tape,

426
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:50.170
but it's clear that if he said yes or no to that broad of a question,

427
00:24:50.171 --> 00:24:52.510
then his entire married life,

428
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.140
because have you ever committed adultery, that word ever?

429
00:24:56.290 --> 00:25:01.270
His entire married life would suddenly be in plane. And as far as we know,

430
00:25:01.271 --> 00:25:06.100
no other person in his situation in history had ever been asked to drag that

431
00:25:06.101 --> 00:25:10.690
much of themselves into the limelight. And on his face,

432
00:25:10.691 --> 00:25:13.590
you can see that he knows that this is never going to end. I mean, he,

433
00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:15.580
he knew how many women he'd seen over the years.

434
00:25:15.581 --> 00:25:19.000
He could envision them all being paraded through the papers.

435
00:25:19.001 --> 00:25:22.720
He could tell already that there was all this new sort of cowboy press and that

436
00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:24.280
the political press was following along,

437
00:25:24.281 --> 00:25:27.250
that he was never going to be able to talk about his agenda and

438
00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.970
<v 9>hard stumbled around for a minute. And ultimately he says,</v>

439
00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.523
I doing nothing.

440
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.970
<v 4>I don't have to answer that question. Was it produced by you? That's right.</v>

441
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.950
This guy. That's right, Dan.

442
00:25:40.951 --> 00:25:45.370
And I think when I heard that response coming upon it, I felt it.

443
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:51.630
I F I felt it. The tone was such that it felt like defeat.

444
00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:59.230
It felt like he is exhausted and he can't take this. And I,

445
00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:02.980
I was offended. I, uh,

446
00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.870
I really in that moment thought this is just wrong.

447
00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.790
This has nothing to do with, with what, what is necessary to run this country.

448
00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:17.660
And I just thought, this is not this, this, this is not, we can,

449
00:26:17.690 --> 00:26:22.270
we're not going to survive. And that moment affectively,

450
00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.560
um, does him in [inaudible] I told you the facts. You don't believe me.

451
00:26:26.561 --> 00:26:29.200
There's nothing I can do about it for a second. What are you

452
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.193
[inaudible]

453
00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.670
<v 10>Gary Heart is finished as a presidential candidate.</v>

454
00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:38.310
Gary Hart's formal campaign is only three weeks old.

455
00:26:38.311 --> 00:26:40.800
There was simply no putting the genie back in the box.

456
00:26:40.801 --> 00:26:43.980
Appearances yesterday where mobs aren't, has been

457
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:48.480
<v 11>hammered to its knees asking the same questions again and again today after what</v>

458
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:52.440
may be remembered as the most disastrous week any presidential candidates

459
00:26:52.441 --> 00:26:56.100
endured in years. Heart told an aid, let's go home.

460
00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.950
<v 7>Couple of weeks later, that famous image,</v>

461
00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:06.270
if Gary Hart and Donna Rice comes out in the national enquirer. And uh,

462
00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:08.580
that was that for people my age like that,

463
00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.110
that image of Donna Rice sitting in his lap and he's got the shirt on that says

464
00:27:12.111 --> 00:27:15.680
monkey business. That's, that's the thing you remember. Yeah. Now,

465
00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.240
according to Matt, by,

466
00:27:17.241 --> 00:27:21.200
you can look at this whole story in particularly Tom Fiedler taking that call

467
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:26.230
and Paul Taylor asking that question as this moment when all of these forces way

468
00:27:26.481 --> 00:27:30.740
outside of Gary Hart's control come together, not just to sync his campaign,

469
00:27:30.741 --> 00:27:33.650
but to change political journalism profoundly.

470
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:38.420
But as with all cultural shifts, there's more than one way to look at this.

471
00:27:38.421 --> 00:27:41.450
So just for a gut check, we put the whole story.

472
00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.020
We're talking about Tom Fiedler. Yeah. Front of this lady.

473
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:48.950
Can we have you introduce yourself? I'm Cokie Roberts would know who you are.

474
00:27:48.951 --> 00:27:50.030
Like part two.

475
00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:56.300
I have six grandchildren. No, no, no, no, no, no.

476
00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:01.820
I'm a political commentator and author. Okay. Cokie Roberts believes that, yeah,

477
00:28:01.821 --> 00:28:04.940
reporters were interested in character more after Watergate,

478
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:06.590
but it wasn't just that.

479
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.970
The thing that's important to keep in mind here is that there were many more

480
00:28:10.971 --> 00:28:14.990
women covering candidates at that point than there had been before.

481
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:19.340
There were women on the bus, and in the case of Gary Hart,

482
00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:23.780
several of those women had had personal encounters with him.

483
00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.010
There were times when you'd be in a room where he had hit on every woman in the

484
00:28:28.011 --> 00:28:31.940
room. So this was not somebody that, um,

485
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.450
women who recovering campaigns were ignorant of.

486
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:38.450
And the other thing to keep in mind, Robert,

487
00:28:38.451 --> 00:28:43.451
is that they whole women's movement did talk quite a bit about the personal is

488
00:28:45.381 --> 00:28:47.430
political and uh,

489
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:52.450
because the way women were treated was something that we thought and I continue

490
00:28:52.581 --> 00:28:56.510
to think, um, is a good gauge of character.

491
00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:01.960
And there was something of a sense that he treated women like Kleenex.

492
00:29:02.450 --> 00:29:03.800
So, um,

493
00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:08.510
we were expanding the universe of what was a major character flaw.

494
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:12.260
So then are you kind of, are you kind of rooting Fiedler on? Oh, absolutely.

495
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.560
Finally somebody who's written about it and [inaudible] and thank God it's a

496
00:29:15.561 --> 00:29:18.680
guy, but as much as you were cheering them on,

497
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:23.180
was there any concern that that was changing the rules of journalism? No.

498
00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:24.643
Why?

499
00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:29.360
Because the rules of journalism were constantly changing as,

500
00:29:29.361 --> 00:29:31.490
as they should. And according to Cokie Roberts,

501
00:29:31.520 --> 00:29:35.540
this was less about journalism changing then about journalism,

502
00:29:35.541 --> 00:29:38.420
catching up with the ethics of the time. Look,

503
00:29:38.421 --> 00:29:43.421
we elect our presidents based who they are and not on what policies they stand

504
00:29:44.651 --> 00:29:47.470
for. It's different from any other office.

505
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:52.920
The voters need to know as much as they can humanly know about that person.

506
00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:55.110
<v 6>So is there a line for you?</v>

507
00:29:55.111 --> 00:29:59.190
Is there a place you won't go in taking the full measure of a candidate?

508
00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.380
<v 7>I am not for president that I can think of. Hmm.</v>

509
00:30:03.210 --> 00:30:06.450
There's nothing you wouldn't touch? No.

510
00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:11.790
I mean I'd have to know that it was true. Sure. But no, no,

511
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.460
<v 1>I love that. Oh, Leslie stall had a slightly different take.</v>

512
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.840
She's fabulous. Cokie Roberts. Um, I didn't go there.

513
00:30:21.841 --> 00:30:26.550
That's interesting. I just didn't want it. I just didn't want to ask about it.

514
00:30:26.551 --> 00:30:30.510
I didn't want to go there. [inaudible] excuse me. I'm telling you this,

515
00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:35.810
even though I covered Watergate and would have asked any number of questions

516
00:30:36.271 --> 00:30:39.870
about character, you know, it's open season fellows.

517
00:30:39.871 --> 00:30:42.060
The public needs to know this, but you know,

518
00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:46.980
sex is really a hard place for me to pry.

519
00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:50.640
So I agree with it.

520
00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:56.210
But I also have my own opinion that there's propriety and I'm old fashioned.

521
00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:00.750
I guess am I, I don't know.

522
00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:08.500
<v 9>I've intended quite frankly to come down here this morning and read a short,</v>

523
00:31:08.931 --> 00:31:12.230
carefully worded political statement. This is Gary Hart statement.

524
00:31:12.231 --> 00:31:14.960
A few days after that press conference saying that, uh,

525
00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:20.060
I was withdrawing from the race and then quietly disappear from date

526
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:25.970
and then nothing were frankly tossing and turning all night. I said to myself,

527
00:31:26.390 --> 00:31:27.223
hell no.

528
00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.130
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

529
00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:34.530
<v 9>I'm not going to do that because it's not my style.</v>

530
00:31:34.531 --> 00:31:39.531
And because I'm a proud man and I'm proud of what I've accomplished in public

531
00:31:39.541 --> 00:31:42.120
life. Some things may be interesting,

532
00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:44.940
but that doesn't necessarily mean they're important.

533
00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:48.960
We're all going to have to seriously question the system for selecting our

534
00:31:48.961 --> 00:31:51.820
national leaders. That reduces the press,

535
00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:56.860
this nation to hunters and presidential candidates to being hunted politics in

536
00:31:57.001 --> 00:31:58.470
this country. Take it from me.

537
00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:02.910
It's on the Burj becoming another form of athletic competition or sporting

538
00:32:02.911 --> 00:32:07.830
match. We all better do something to make this system work.

539
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.220
We're all going to be soon rephrasing Jefferson to say,

540
00:32:11.221 --> 00:32:16.221
I tremble for my country when I think we may in fact get the kind of leaders we

541
00:32:16.861 --> 00:32:17.694
deserve.

542
00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.830
<v 6>Now we did reach out to Mr Hartford comment explaining to him the story we were</v>

543
00:32:32.831 --> 00:32:34.840
doing and he wrote back this response.

544
00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.530
Thank you for your letter and the invitation to participate in your current

545
00:32:38.531 --> 00:32:40.910
story. Though I did not become president,

546
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.330
my life continues to be extraordinarily rich.

547
00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.760
Perhaps someday someone will tell that story,

548
00:32:46.761 --> 00:32:51.761
but for now I have no interest in revisiting what many consider a turning point

549
00:32:52.431 --> 00:32:57.380
for the nation and a few an injustice. I do believe that the full,

550
00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:01.460
an accurate story of that event remains to be told.

551
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.400
Signed Gary Hart.

552
