also seems to me that and this is one of
the reasons I like the existential

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300
the reasons I like the existential
 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.320
the reasons I like the existential
philosophy was that you know the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330
philosophy was that you know the
 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.300

existentialist believed it's sort of an
 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.980
existentialist believed it's sort of an
original sin idea they believe that we

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990
original sin idea they believe that we
 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.300
original sin idea they believe that we
came into the world with an ethical

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310
came into the world with an ethical
 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.910
came into the world with an ethical
burden already laden upon us something

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:32.920
burden already laden upon us something
 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.200
burden already laden upon us something
like something like that and that we had

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210
like something like that and that we had
 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.330
like something like that and that we had
a felt sense that it was necessary for

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340
a felt sense that it was necessary for
 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.730
a felt sense that it was necessary for
us to justify our being and then if we

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:38.740
us to justify our being and then if we
 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.680
us to justify our being and then if we
didn't do that then we weren't authentic

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690
didn't do that then we weren't authentic
 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.540
didn't do that then we weren't authentic

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550
to ourselves we weren't moving towards
 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.380
to ourselves we weren't moving towards
individuality

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390
individuality
 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.600
individuality
we weren't sustaining the community we

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610
we weren't sustaining the community we
 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:47.340
we weren't sustaining the community we
weren't living properly and that and

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350
weren't living properly and that and
 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.890
weren't living properly and that and
that that idea was deeply embedded in

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900
that that idea was deeply embedded in
 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.930
that that idea was deeply embedded in
people as part of their ordinary

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940
people as part of their ordinary
 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.420
