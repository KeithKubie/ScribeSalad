00:00:00.035 --> 00:00:04.687
The answer rounded to two
decimal places is 0.14.

00:00:04.687 --> 00:00:06.600
Let's take a look at the division.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.550
Seven goes into one zero times and
it goes into ten and one time.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.850
We do our subtraction and we get three.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.740
Let's bring that zero down.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.790
Seven goes into thirty four times,
seven times four is 28.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.930
Do our subtraction, we get 2,
carry that next 0 down,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.760
7 goes into 20 2 times, 7 times 2 is 14.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.509
Do our subtraction,
bring down another 0.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:39.750
7 goes into 60 8 times, 7 times 8 is 56,
and again we do our subtraction.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.600
It's starting to look like we could
keep doing this for a really long time.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.604
Fortunately, we just had to round
to two decimal places, just 0.14.
