00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.720
Have you heard of the legend of question six? It's the question that actually stumped a Fields medalist.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.480
This is one of the hardest problems

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.620
ever!

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.140
Well, it's something legendary.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.180
I myself, when I tried to attempt this problem, it took me a year to solve this problem.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:32.250
And when I finally solved it, I'm not, I'm not ashamed to say, I cried. To put question six into context, alright,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.250
I'm talking about an international

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.610
mathematical Olympiad

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.200
problem. The international mathematical Olympiads is the premier event

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.640
for young people who are really good at math, they haven't gone to Uni yet,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.059
they're under twenty, and it's for young people to go and compete on the international stage, right? And they're fighting for

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.960
ultimate mathematical glory.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.880
Announcer: "A team consists of six kids from each country.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.316
"These 'mathletes' are required to answer six questions worth seven points each."

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.240
So just like the Olympics,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.720
they're held in a different country every year. They don't do it every four years, we need the competition. And we're talking about somewhere between

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.339
220 to 260 students come from all different countries. And so when you think about it,

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.909
this is the best of the best. It's about being able to solve

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.890
awesomely hard problems.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.199
But there's one epic problem.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.379
Which means a lot to me, because it's from the maths Olympics in my home country of Australia.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.199
So we held the math Olympics in 1988. And at that time, there was one particular problem.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.070
It was the last problem of the whole event. Over two days,

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.779
there's three problems each, and on the second day the last problem was problem six.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.369
And this one went down as one of the hardest ever. For a long time it wasn't surpassed.

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.078
Now, there's actually been harder problems that have come up recently. But for a long time, this one was just

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.159
amazingly difficult. And not only that, it was like, people who did solve it were, like, revered.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.399
So for the 260 odd people that competed at this maths Olympics,

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.580
only eleven people solved it perfectly. And only one person solved it awesomely.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.680
And, I have to say,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.040
Terence Tao was competing there, and he only got one out of seven.

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.649
One mark out of a total of seven for this problem, which means he didn't get it right. And Terence Tao

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.259
went on to win the Fields Medal in 2006.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.120
He's awesome, and he's Australian! Can I just say that please?

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.580
Brady: "And he's from Adelaide."

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.660
And he's from Adelaide, where I'm from as well, yeah.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:41.960
Brady: "And me!"

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.000
And you, Brady.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.960
I didn't know whether we could mention that.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.020
Let's actually, let's actually cut, cut Terence Tao some slack.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.139
The Fields medalist, the guy who's, like, coming close to solving the twin prime conjecture.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.020
He's actually pretty awesome, because he was only thirteen years old.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.640
Brady: "And that's young, is it?"

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.680
Well, he holds the record as the youngest person to ever have won a gold medal at an international math Olympics. So, it's pretty good.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.940
But he still didn't at the last one right.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.400
Announcer: "Terry Tao was a toddler when his parents noticed he had a gift.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.009
"At a family gathering, they found their two-year-old giving older children a maths lesson."

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.530
I mean, these are problems that you don't find in a maths book.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.169
There's no, you don't look in the back of the book for the answer for these problems.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.860
These are really hard problems. And, and in a way, they're actually designed

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:30.839
to kind of throw you off if you know high school maths too well. So say, if you really know how to solve quadratic equations,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.160
and you see something that looks like a quadratic equation, it almost like throws you down the wrong path.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.399
It's almost like, nuh-uh, you're at the international maths Olympics.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.239
Question six

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.509
was pretty special. It was come up by this

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.159
crazy hardcore West German guy, at a time when there was a West Germany.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:54.749
And he submitted his question to the mathematicians who are in charge of selection.

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:57.700
They're given six hours to solve question six.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.140
Brady: "These are like the experts, like test, test driving it. They're test driving."

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're test driving it.

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.600
They're gonna see whether it's gonna make the cut, you know? Because, like, if it's too easy,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:07.940
turf that, right?

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.980
Well guess what?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.540
They couldn't solve it. After six hours.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.179
Question six, after six hours,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.790
still stood, yeah?

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.099
So you'd think, hey, this is too hard.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.620
But what do they do?

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.560
They had the courage to submit it.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.960
Brady: "They put it on the test."

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.440
They put it on the test. And in the original copy, they actually put a double asterisk next to it. Just to make sure

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.660
everyone knew this was hard.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.080
Brady: "So don't waste your time on it."

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.400
Well, not necessarily don't waste your time,

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.700
just don't beat yourself up if you can't get it. And so here, I've actually got a copy, July 16, 1988.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.969
So it's held over two days. This was the second day, and it was the third question on the second day,

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:50.400
so therefore, it's question six.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.240
Now if you have a look here, the time to answer all three questions: four and a half hours.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.740
So that means, on average, you had

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.780
ninety minutes to solve this problem.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.060
And if you can't work out that it was ninety minutes,

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.100
I think you're gonna struggle with the whole exam.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.340
Given the fact some of the best mathematicians in the world were given six hours, and they couldn't solve it, so

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.080
they gave students ninety minutes on average.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.840
Maybe it could be more. Maybe you can finish these ones really quickly,

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.020
and then you just sit there sweating. And if you have a look at it,

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.730
it's the shortest one on the page. Look how tiny it is. It says, let a and b be

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.460
positive integers such that a times b plus 1

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:43.219
divides a squared plus b squared, show that a squared plus b squared

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:49.279
divided by a times b plus 1 is the square of an integer.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.060
It's not even simple to explain. I mean they have actually covered up

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.410
part of what, what you need to understand. Okay, let me just write it out for you.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:02.929
Okay, so. So what this says is that first of all, a and b

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.220
can be

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:12.380
elements, they can be 0 1 2 3, blah-blah-blah, they can be any whole number, including 0. Let's stick them into this equation:

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.640
a squared plus b squared

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:22.220
divided by a times b plus 1. Okay, so let's actually do a little bit of a chart for this.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.869
So, possibly, it could equal a fraction. So if it does equal a fraction, the question says, no one cares.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.599
Really, question six doesn't care.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.330
But, if it just so happens that once you divide

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.049
a b plus 1 into that, and you get

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:50.209
a whole number, it then says, oh, that whole number will also be a square. It means that it will be

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.520
something to the power two.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.560
Brady: "Like 25, or-"

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.680
Yeah. 25, 36, 49, 121.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.680
It'll be some whole number multiplied by itself.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.269
So only if it's a whole number, it actually will also be a square number.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.060
So I suppose, I suppose one way of saying it is that

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.180
the only solutions to this

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.349
given whole numbers, when you stick in whole numbers, are fractions

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.140
and squares.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.800
And the thing is, is like, why squares?

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:25.120
Perhaps we should find out.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.860
So there's the history of the problem explained. And by now,

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.230
I hope you've cracked out your pencil and paper to try it. For those wanting the solution a bit sooner,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:38.409
the next video will be posted on our second channel,
