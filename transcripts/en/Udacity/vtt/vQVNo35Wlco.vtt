00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Our goal is to show that a one-time pad is a perfect cipher,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and now that we have the definition of a perfect cipher,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we should be able to argue that formally.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
This was our definition.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Since our definition uses the conditional probability,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we should also remember the definition of conditional probability,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is the probability of some event A conditioned on event B happening

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is equal to the probability of A intersect B divided by the probability of B.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
To show that the one-time pad is a perfect cipher,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we just need to calculate this where A will be this event and B will be this event.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We need to know the probability of B,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which is the probability that some message with some key encrypts to C.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Let's compute that first. Then we'll need to compute the probability of A intersect B.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We'll have a little quiz.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Given any message and any cipher text C, and we're using a one-time pad,

00:00:56.000 --> 99:59:59.000
how many different keys are there that encrypt that message to that cipher text?
