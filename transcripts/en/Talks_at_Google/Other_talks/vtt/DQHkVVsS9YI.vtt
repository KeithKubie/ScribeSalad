00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; Hi, everybody.
Thank you for coming to our Authors at talk

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.070
today.
We have Garrett Peck. He's an analyst at a

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.549
large telecom company and freelance journalist
for the alcoholic beverage industry.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:13.190
He lives in Washington, D.C., where he leads
temperance tours of Prohibition related sites

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.799
in our nation's capital.
This Prohibition Hangover is his very first

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:22.600
book.
It was six years in the making and is a compilation

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:30.850
of over one hundred interviews.
So now, welcome Garrett Peck.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:40.110
&gt;&gt; Garrett Peck: Hi, everyone.
I'm Garrett Peck and like Tasha said here,

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.019
the book is The Prohibition Hangover, which
came out September first.

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.429
So just almost two months ago.
Like she said, it was about a six-year process

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.199
of getting the book to market.
So I wanted to kind of talk about what it

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.829
was like being a first-time author and getting
the book out, because it was sort of like

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.420
I learned the whole process completely backwards
and yet somehow it didn't kill me.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.280
And it's kind of a humorous process.
And then, talked about where the idea for

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.860
the book actually came and I'll talk about
some of the historic things that led to where

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.190
we are today with alcohol.
So again, the book is The Prohibition Hangover:

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.010
Alcohol in America from Demon Rum to Cult
Cabernet.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.590
So it's kind of signifying that there's been
a process, right?

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.700
From how we went to demonized alcohol to where
we are today where most of us drink.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.360
And we'll talk about that here throughout
this afternoon.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.301
I should say here the last book that covered
Americans and alcohol -- like a really significant

00:01:33.301 --> 00:01:39.310
social book about how Americans drink -- was
written 30 years ago and that was by an author

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:49.380
named William Rorabaugh.
He's a professor at the University of Washington.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:02:08.119
And the book was called The Alcoholic Republic.
And in that book, he laid out where the temperance

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:22.610
movement came from.
You all remember we had Prohibition in this

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.570
country for nearly 14 years -- from 1920 to
1933.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:34.800
Prohibition itself was a century-long movement
beforehand that led up to Prohibition.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:51.170
And this was a social reform movement.
And just to kind of kick things off here,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:59.180
I'd like to have a little interaction with
the audience -- mostly pretty young people

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.860
here today, so.
I wanted to ask how many of you here can define

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.379
what temperance was?
One person, cool.

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:25.340
&gt;&gt; It was a movement that drinking was evil.
That's all

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.080
I know about it.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:35.200
&gt;&gt; Garrett Peck: Exactly, yeah.
They stigmatized alcohol drinking.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:47.209
You kind of think the word 'temperance' means
'to be temperate' or 'to moderate', right?

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.880
But, they took it to another extreme.
They took it to "Everyone needs to abstain

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.200
altogether from alcohol."
This started off actually with a huge whiskey

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.030
binge that was going on in the early, early
American republic.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:16.359
And, as a result, the church had said, "You
know what?

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:27.220
We've got a big social problem here.
We've got to deal with this."

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:35.070
So initially, temperance meant to get people
to moderate their drinking, but pretty quickly

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.510
more radical people took over the movement
and they decided that people had to refrain

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.630
from drinking altogether.
So, temperance therefore became synonymous

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:52.360
with abstinence from alcohol.
And we still see that in some places here

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:59.481
in America.
So in kind of building my platform for the

00:04:59.481 --> 00:05:10.780
book itself, one of the things I did, like
Tasha said, I became a freelance journalist.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:23.630
I wrote the book first, and then I was like,
"Okay, I want to go out there and sell it"

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:32.010
 -- which is not generally how you write nonfiction.
You generally write a proposal.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:38.050
Then you get an agent.
Then you sell it.

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:45.220
And then they give you an advance and then
you go write the rest.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:58.460
And so, I did the whole process kind of backwards.
I wrote it first and then tried to go out

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:07.030
there and sell it.
And the answer I kept getting back was, "Well,

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:11.640
dude.
You don't have a platform.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:18.639
You know, you work in telecom.
So you haven't written in the industry at

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:25.060
all -- in the alcohol industry."
So at that point then I started doing freelance

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:30.240
journalism.
So I do about an article a month or so.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.370
And I started doing this temperance tour,
this walking tour of Prohibition-related sites

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.630
in Washington, D.C.
So if you guys are ever out there, it's a

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:47.030
really fun tour.
We see some really unusual sites.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.600
The one I put up here on the screen is the
Cogswell Temperance Fountain.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:07:01.120
Anybody ever hear of Henry Cogswell?
He was a San Francisco dentist, who made his

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.729
money during the Gold Rush and part of the
temperance movement.

00:07:05.729 --> 00:07:14.080
And he financed about 50 of these statues.
There's only a handful of them left around

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:26.970
the country, one in Washington, D.C. -- this
is the one here from D.C. -- and then one

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:33.400
in New York City, in Tompkins Square Park
in Alphabet City, East Village.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:44.650
There's only a handful that most of them have
been torn down since then.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:52.040
But they were put in very strategic spots
around the country to basically signify to

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:57.979
the population, "Drink water, instead of whiskey."
Like the one in New York City, it was put

00:07:57.979 --> 00:08:01.190
in Little Germany -- little neighborhood full
of Germans.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:05.210
So the message was, "Drink water, instead
of beer."

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:13.100
So really the point -- it was part of the
abstinence only movement at that time.

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.740
So again, temperance was this faith-based
initiative.

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:24.831
This was the evangelical -- other than abolitionism.
You know, the fight to ban slavery in the

00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:31.940
country?
This was the other, big, social reform movement

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:36.580
of the 19th century.
So the evangelical Protestant churches banded

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:41.709
together and decided they needed to do something
about the heavy drinking that was going on

00:08:41.709 --> 00:08:51.070
and ultimately decided people had to stop
drinking altogether.

00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:57.130
And that ultimately, of course, led up to
Prohibition.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:09:05.210
One of the things they questioned was, "What
would Jesus drink?" And they went through

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:10.410
the Bible and reinterpreted the Bible.
We call this revisionism.

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:18.300
But they decided that, because they were teetotalers,
therefore Jesus had to be one as well.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:24.120
And actually, I grew up hearing this in my
own church whereby they would say, "Okay,

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.170
in Jesus' time, he drank unfermented wine."
They had no scientific basis for that -- nor

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.940
archaeological or biblical basis for it.
But it was simply just taken on faith that

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:38.339
Jesus didn't drink, even though wine is written
in every single chapter of the Bible other

00:09:38.339 --> 00:09:43.210
than the book of Jonah.
And certainly there was a lot of evidence

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:51.200
around Jesus that, in fact, he did drink.
He turned water into wine at the party at

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.959
Cana and a few other cases, Last Supper and
so on.

00:09:56.959 --> 00:10:06.310
Those people who are Catholics scratch their
heads and go, "What is up with you Protestants?"

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:10.820
But this was a Protestant movement.
And they were the ones who gave us temperance,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:15.650
abstinence, and therefore they had to have
a theological or ideological basis really

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.670
behind it.
And ultimately, of course, that's where they

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:26.700
gave us the phrase, "Demon Rum," which is
part of the subtitle of my book.

00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:34.800
They demonized drinking, not just to the point
of saying, "Gee, we don't want you to drink,"

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:43.529
or "You should drink less or moderate."
They heavily stigmatized anybody who did drink.

00:10:43.529 --> 00:10:55.940
And you still see that across the country
in a couple of places, especially in the Deep

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:06.430
South where they tend to have still conservative
churches -- predominantly Southern Baptist

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:09.510
Convention.
And they still preach against the evils of

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:14.180
alcohol.
I put up this as well here.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.910
Anybody hear of the Women's Christian Temperance
Union -- or WCTU?

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:26.890
One person.
The WCTU was once a super-powerful lobby in

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:34.450
this country.
It once numbered 600,000 people in the country

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:39.140
 -- all women.
And they were headquartered in Illinois, and

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.990
they put these fountains around.
The particular one here you see on the screen

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.589
was in Roseworth Beach, Delaware, but there
was one in Santa Rosa.

00:11:46.589 --> 00:11:53.620
There's one in Petaluma -- still exists -- and
a few other places.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:59.180
Again, kind of the message, "Drink water,
instead of whiskey, beer, wine."

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:03.990
Whatever your alcoholic beverage choice is,
don't drink it.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:08.810
Drink water instead.
This was a really powerful lobby.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:19.350
Women didn't have the vote yet at the time.
And so, one of the things they could do was

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:25.010
educate people.
And hence, they got into the classrooms and

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:29.050
they educated people on the evils of alcohol
drinking.

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:37.279
One of the interesting things that came up
about -- in the 1870's the WCTU rose and they

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:44.640
ended up having alliance together with the
suffragettes -- so, Elizabeth Cady Stanton

00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:50.779
and Susan B Anthony.
The suffragettes was actually a much smaller

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:59.170
organization, a much smaller movement.
But the movement to get women the vote realized

00:12:59.170 --> 00:13:14.839
that if they ever wanted to get the vote,
they would need to ally together with the

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:24.269
temperance people.
And so, those two forces then got together.

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:34.990
And therefore, it was not a coincidence at
all that women got the vote and we banned

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:40.960
alcohol in the same year -- 1920.
That's not a coincidence whatsoever, right?

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:48.029
And then, of course, once the 1920's came,
that alliance then split apart.

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:57.630
Women decided that, in fact, they had a right
in the speakeasy at the bar, and women started

00:13:57.630 --> 00:13:59.740
drinking.
Kind of unusual.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:07.760
But we'll look into that in a few minutes.
All right, so we got Prohibition -- 1920 to

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.940
1933.
It lasted almost 14 years long, and it was

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:18.801
a horrible failure.
13 awful years as H.L. Mencken called it.

00:14:18.801 --> 00:14:26.700
He was the Bard of Baltimore.
So a vast amount of civil disobedience that

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:32.839
took place during this time.
You know, how we got into Prohibition in the

00:14:32.839 --> 00:14:39.399
first place?
There was a group called the Anti-Saloon League,

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:48.000
and they used the occasion of World War I
to change the Constitution.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.620
We had declared war against who in 1917?
Germany, exactly.

00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:59.620
And who were most of the brewers in the country
at the time?

00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.089
German Americans, indeed.
They were the biggest ethnic group at the

00:15:04.089 --> 00:15:08.970
time in the country.
So today's it's Latinos; but, back then, it

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:12.930
was the Germans.
So once that whole lobby was basically pushed

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:17.560
aside, the ASL decided, "Okay.
We're going to go for the gusto.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.360
We're going to change the Constitution." I'm
still kind of flabbergasted by that fact.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.959
We changed the Constitution not once, but
twice, to deal with alcohol -- once to ban

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:31.880
it, and then once to make it legal again.
I mean, crazy.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:38.800
And in just less than 14 years, the country
realized what a huge unintended consequence

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:44.670
Prohibition had released, that there was just
endemic law breaking around the country.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:53.500
There was so much money being made, organized
crime was making a fortune, and the violence

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:57.230
was really, really getting bad around the
country.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:05.940
So after less than 14 years, the country decided,
"Okay, let's go back the way it was before

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:14.600
and let's regulate it now this time."
So anybody here that has ever seen this.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:21.510
This is one of the most famous photos here
from Prohibition itself.

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:30.760
And if there's any beer drinkers in the room,
you'd probably want to cry.

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:39.440
This is in 1921, and yes, they're pouring
beer into the sewer.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:50.970
So kind of a publicity stunt, but one of the
more famous photos from Prohibition.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:59.889
The Dry Cause itself had really thought -- I
think, naively -- that the country would simply

00:16:59.889 --> 00:17:06.220
just dry up.
If we ban the manufacture, sale, and transportation

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:13.409
of alcohol, the country will simply just obey
the law and people will stop drinking.

00:17:13.409 --> 00:17:21.289
And I think they were really naive to believe
that, because it's really been fundamentally

00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:38.549
a part of American culture since the beginning.
And for example, you saw -- I talked about

00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:47.200
the movement of women splitting apart in the
1920's.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.450
You got this younger generation of women who
came up.

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:59.269
They now had the vote.
They decided they had a right at the speakeasy;

00:17:59.269 --> 00:18:07.720
they had a right to drink.
You know, back then, drinking was a man sport.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:13.749
And come the 1920's, "Okay, it's illegal for
everybody to drink.

00:18:13.749 --> 00:18:21.389
So therefore, we can all drink, right?" So
women started going out to the speakeasies

00:18:21.389 --> 00:18:23.200
as well.
They start bootlegging.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.059
They do some really unusual things in the
1920's.

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:29.090
Remember this is the era of Sigmund Freud,
so people start doing psychoanalysis, see

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:33.320
your shrink, and so on.
Women start to smoke in the 1920's.

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.749
They hadn't done that before.
They start to drink in the 1920's.

00:18:39.749 --> 00:18:45.649
And you see, for example, this woman right
here.

00:18:45.649 --> 00:18:50.859
She has her garter and her hip flask.
You know, breaking the law suddenly looks

00:18:50.859 --> 00:18:53.970
pretty glamorous, right?
So this law-breaking became endemic to American

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.970
society.
Okay.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:19:04.340
We had the law of the land that says you can't
manufacture, sell, or transport alcohol, and

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.940
yet everyone's doing it regardless.
So really, the country became very cynical

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:14.299
towards Prohibition itself.
But actually, changing the law back is pretty

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:17.929
difficult.
Getting a Constitutional Amendment isn't easy

00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:24.289
in this country, right?
You got to get two-thirds of Congress to vote

00:19:24.289 --> 00:19:35.080
for it, and then you got to get three-quarters
of the states to vote for it.

00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:39.529
But that said, of course, we changed the Constitution
twice.

00:19:39.529 --> 00:19:49.220
So first time, we used the occasion of World
War I to change the Constitution -- the crisis.

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:54.779
And then, we had a second crisis.
So what was that?

00:19:54.779 --> 00:19:56.580
Anyone?
Great Depression, exactly.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:03.499
The economy fell off a cliff in October, 1929.
And with that, came a huge political change

00:20:03.499 --> 00:20:11.149
in the country, very similar to what happened
in 2006 and 2008 actually.

00:20:11.149 --> 00:20:17.549
The 1920's belonged to the Republican party
 -- all three presidencies and both houses

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:23.019
of Congress.
And then 1930, 1932, the whole country just

00:20:23.019 --> 00:20:30.279
shifted over completely.
And the Democrats ran on a platform of repeal.

00:20:30.279 --> 00:20:36.940
In other words, "Let's get this problem under
control.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:46.000
We'll have law and order again to control
the endemic law breaking that's going on."

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.909
And so, Franklin Delano Roosevelt runs on
a platform of repeal.

00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:56.769
So not that we're happy about legalizing alcohol
again, but rather, we can get the beast under

00:20:56.769 --> 00:21:04.580
control, and now we can regulate it.
So, the 21st Amendment gets passed through

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:11.889
Congress in January of 1933 -- so before FDR
is even in office.

00:21:11.889 --> 00:21:19.429
The first state votes for it in March of 1933.
Anybody from Michigan?

00:21:19.429 --> 00:21:22.720
Your state voted first.
[Woohoo!] Congratulations, Tasha.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:33.570
And then, the 36th state -- the one that pushed
it over the top -- was nine months later,

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:42.720
which shows you how much the country wanted
an end to the noble experiment.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:49.499
And that was December 5th, 1933.
What state was that?

00:21:49.499 --> 00:21:59.809
What state in this country would you think
people would least likely to drink in?

00:21:59.809 --> 00:22:03.269
Utah.
[laughter] Utah was the 36th state.

00:22:03.269 --> 00:22:13.929
Yeah, it sort of became a badge of honor that
they would be the ones here to push the measure

00:22:13.929 --> 00:22:21.289
over the top.
And so, yeah, that became then the end of

00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:25.879
Prohibition itself.
The 21st Amendment, of course, promised the

00:22:25.879 --> 00:22:29.960
country regulation of alcohol and control
of alcohol.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:35.149
And so, we'll talk about that a little bit
here this afternoon.

00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:47.859
What I want to talk about here with my book
 -- This is kind of a precursor of how we

00:22:47.859 --> 00:22:53.330
got into the mess and then out of Prohibition
itself.

00:22:53.330 --> 00:22:59.940
With my book here, if I can really quick here
just give you a quick read.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.559
Two paragraphs?
If you'll let me indulge to really look at

00:23:04.559 --> 00:23:08.350
what happened after Prohibition.
And that's really my thesis of what happened

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:12.370
over these last 76 years since we changed
the law back.

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:18.649
So just quick two paragraphs here.
[reading] The United States has had a tense

00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:25.669
relationship with alcohol since colonial times
and, even after Prohibition failed, Americans

00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:35.029
are still unsure how to deal with it.
Our social attitudes and laws on alcohol are

00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:39.119
disjointed.
Is it a normal consumer product?

00:23:39.119 --> 00:23:45.559
Is it a controlled substance?
Is it a gift from God?

00:23:45.559 --> 00:23:51.700
Or is it Demon Rum?
Now, maybe it's all of these things.

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:57.609
As Americans drink more, there's a great strain
between the many different points of view

00:23:57.609 --> 00:24:00.039
about alcohol -- between freedom and reform,
tipplers and teetotalers, evangelicals and

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:02.489
secularists.
But at least, this is not a political issue

00:24:02.489 --> 00:24:03.489
anymore.
Republicans are just as likely to drink as

00:24:03.489 --> 00:24:05.880
Democrats.
[talking] Now, the other paragraph I'm going

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:13.000
to read here is kind of the epiphany moment
when I had the eureka, "Oh, my gosh.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.899
I got a book here I need to go write."
Everybody asks the question, "Where did you

00:24:18.899 --> 00:24:27.509
come up with this idea?" So here it is.
[reading] This book came about from an insight

00:24:27.509 --> 00:24:30.179
over Christmas dinner in 2003.
My mom, grandmother, and I were gathered around

00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:37.259
the table for roast beast, which is what we
call it since the Grinch stole Christmas.

00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:43.769
I opened up a nice 1977 Burgundy.
Three generations sat at the table.

00:24:43.769 --> 00:24:50.919
My grandmother -- who grew up during Prohibition
and had an alcoholic husband -- and my mom

00:24:50.919 --> 00:24:57.879
and me, both social drinkers.
What explains the shift between abstinence

00:24:57.879 --> 00:25:06.940
and social drinking within a single family?
Why do people abstain in the first place?

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:11.269
And why weren't these generational values
passed on?

00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:16.039
That was sort of a eureka moment.
I thought, "Wow, what happened here?

00:25:16.039 --> 00:25:24.869
I need to go explore this question here."
And once I got into my research, then I kind

00:25:24.869 --> 00:25:33.909
of discovered, "Wow, no one's written a book
at all about what happened to Americans after

00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:39.460
Prohibition."
You know, how did we get to a country again

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:50.090
where most of us drink?
So in a single slide here -- this always gets

00:25:50.090 --> 00:26:01.259
a couple of laughs here.
I really wanted to lay out, you know, how

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:12.179
we went from a country that once heavily stigmatized
alcohol -- and these are women here from the

00:26:12.179 --> 00:26:20.349
Women's Christian Temperance Union -- to one
where we are today where two-thirds of us

00:26:20.349 --> 00:26:26.190
drink alcohol and alcohol is really kind of
glamorized now.

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:32.609
I mean, people here, you can ask around the
room here.

00:26:32.609 --> 00:26:40.690
This is mostly a young audience, so most people
probably do drink.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:49.830
How many of you are like into single malt
scotchs, or into pinot noirs that are grown

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:54.940
in these tiny, little vineyards, but like
Miles and Sideways that are fanatics about

00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:58.419
that.
Where I call it the Cult Cabernet phenomenon.

00:26:58.419 --> 00:27:04.860
[phone ringing] Or people are into 90 minute
IPAs and so on.

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.690
People are really knowledgeable now about
what they drink.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:28.299
And we kind of glorify it now and people get
kind of nerdy about, you know, you get in

00:27:28.299 --> 00:27:41.539
a room of scratch beer drinkers together and
people just have so much to discuss about

00:27:41.539 --> 00:27:49.879
what their favorite beers are -- do they like
it rather with hops or rather with malt and

00:27:49.879 --> 00:27:54.899
so on.
So yeah, we've really made a huge transition

00:27:54.899 --> 00:28:04.039
over these last 76 years to we're at the point
now where the stigma is largely gone in American

00:28:04.039 --> 00:28:09.950
society.
And I think we are in fact a drinking nation

00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:23.960
once again.
So this is one of the few academic slides

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:33.789
I'll put here in today's presentation.
This is really interesting here.

00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:44.519
This is the Gallup survey.
They've done this survey almost every year

00:28:44.519 --> 00:28:56.559
since 1939.
There's a couple gaps during World War II

00:28:56.559 --> 00:29:04.009
and so on.
But yeah, it really shows the case of two-thirds

00:29:04.009 --> 00:29:11.700
of American adults 18 and older drink alcohol.
That's pretty significant.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:24.619
In the survey they took here in 2009, it was
64 percent, versus the other 36 percent who

00:29:24.619 --> 00:29:32.259
abstain.
So clearly not every American drinks, nor

00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:41.840
should every single American drink.
There's lots of good reasons not to drink

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:45.620
alcohol.
But most of us do, right?

00:29:45.620 --> 00:30:00.340
And that's a significant shift right there
as most of us, I think, recognize, "Yeah,

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:18.070
it's just a part of our lives and our lifestyles
here now." That said, of course, the temperance

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:31.899
movement kind of lingered on, even in the
1950's or even later.

00:30:31.899 --> 00:30:50.559
Like I said, you still see it in some parts
of the country, especially in the Deep South

00:30:50.559 --> 00:31:03.499
and a few other places where you still have
dry towns.

00:31:03.499 --> 00:31:19.459
Any of you heard of dry counties?
Well, they still exist in a few places, especially

00:31:19.459 --> 00:31:27.989
the Deep South and the Midwest.
And a few places in Massachusetts still are

00:31:27.989 --> 00:31:35.259
dry towns, amazingly.
But yeah, there was this lingering social

00:31:35.259 --> 00:31:43.989
stigma against alcohol, especially as the
WCTU -- which still exists actually -- they've

00:31:43.989 --> 00:31:59.440
really waned in power.
The stigma here really existed at least into

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:09.960
the 1950's.
And a lot of people were still concerned that

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:20.609
they might come back and try to have another
round with Prohibition.

00:32:20.609 --> 00:32:28.799
And I think simply the World War II generation
that went out.

00:32:28.799 --> 00:32:35.529
They fought the war.
They all mostly became drinkers.

00:32:35.529 --> 00:32:47.909
They drank beer, that generation.
And they moved on at that point.

00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:59.059
They grew up during Prohibition.
They were like, "You know, let's not fight

00:32:59.059 --> 00:33:03.869
this issue again.
It's a losing issue."

00:33:03.869 --> 00:33:11.609
And so, by the 1960's, you all see Madmen,
right?

00:33:11.609 --> 00:33:25.190
Most people watch Madmen?
So, get on Netflix if you have it.

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:36.509
So wow, heavy amount of drinking in the office
 -- especially Scotch, and smoking.

00:33:36.509 --> 00:33:42.809
Yeah, so that generation just became a generation
of drinkers.

00:33:42.809 --> 00:33:53.389
And just decided, "Okay, we're going to drink."
And there's really no more stigma around alcohol

00:33:53.389 --> 00:34:01.709
anymore for them.
There's still, of course, a legacy within

00:34:01.709 --> 00:34:07.399
the country of alcohol.
Part of the promise of the 21st Amendment

00:34:07.399 --> 00:34:19.790
was that it was going to give states control
over alcohol -- the ability to regulate alcohol.

00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:30.109
Now, are all of you here Californians?
Or you come from different places?

00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:34.879
You're from Oregon?
New York, Massachusetts.

00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:42.819
So yeah.
So you've seen dry counties and dry laws?

00:34:42.819 --> 00:34:54.389
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was living there in the 70's, 80's,
where they still had -- you couldn't sell

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:56.260
alcohol on Sundays.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:03.410
&gt;&gt; Garrett Peck: Yeah.
And you still see them in some weird places

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:07.349
around the country.
Still bull laws.

00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:19.029
Still a few Sunday closing laws and so on.
So it's kind of, again, a legacy of Prohibition

00:35:19.029 --> 00:35:24.930
itself.
The slide you see here is My Liquor Store,

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:28.319
right down the street from me.
ABC is Alcoholic Beverage Control.

00:35:28.319 --> 00:35:34.589
I live in Virginia -- so right across the
border from Washington, D.C.

00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:43.710
In Arlington county, we have six liquor stores
for the entire county of 200,000 people, whereas

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:49.740
you go across the border into Washington,
D.C. and 500,000 people and they have over

00:35:49.740 --> 00:36:01.690
500 liquor stores.
So one for every thousand people.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:16.769
Just this huge discrepancy.
The whole state of Virginia is ____ liquor

00:36:16.769 --> 00:36:28.539
stores for the entire state.
So but it's what's called a control state.

00:36:28.539 --> 00:36:36.630
California is one of the more liberalized
states, because you can actually go to a grocery

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:44.000
store and buy distilled spirits, but most
states you can't, you know.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:53.220
Louisiana is another key one.
So New Orleans you can get a to go cup with

00:36:53.220 --> 00:37:00.500
the order.
Go to a drive-thru liquor stores, you know?

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:15.960
Which was always kind of funny.
So and yeah like you mention here blue laws

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:28.990
still exist in some places.
They're kind of fading out of the way.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:45.819
There's still dry counties around this country,
but with every recession, they start to kind

00:37:45.819 --> 00:37:58.490
of get knocked off one by one.
It's harder and harder to justify having a

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:06.750
dry county.
Dry counties, by the way, came from the run

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:18.609
up to Prohibition back when the Anti-Saloon
League was trying to force the country to

00:38:18.609 --> 00:38:25.200
go dry.
They established Local Option Laws allowing

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:33.430
counties to go dry.
And therefore, they could pressure -- and

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:44.950
this is where their evangelical allies were,
especially out of rural areas -- they could

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:55.869
then push the state to go dry.
For example, Davis -- little Davis up the

00:38:55.869 --> 00:39:06.769
road here, an hour and a half -- was once
a dry town.

00:39:06.769 --> 00:39:14.839
And now, it's got the Department of Viticulture
and Enology, but that was once a dry town.

00:39:14.839 --> 00:39:26.140
There's micro-breweries there now and stuff,
but 30 years ago, it was dry, you know?

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.170
I think the University there really changed
the culture of the city itself.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:35.670
You've got people who are in the Cult Cabernet
phenomenon.

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:48.130
But yeah, right there, you see how even one
little town here shifted over time to become

00:39:48.130 --> 00:40:01.740
a drinking town again which when it once had
a culture of, "uh-uh, alcohol's wrong and

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:09.750
don't do it," right?
So gradually here, especially like you see

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:21.900
this here during recessions, such as now,
dry counties really have a hard time justifying

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:29.519
themselves anymore.
For example, if you look at how restaurants

00:40:29.519 --> 00:40:36.730
make their money.
No restaurant in this world practically can

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:43.109
exist, other than McDonalds, without selling
alcohol.

00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:57.579
It's just a fundamental part of how they stay
open is they have to be able to sell beer

00:40:57.579 --> 00:41:05.200
or wine.
And if they don't do it, then you won't have

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:14.660
a restaurant in the town.
And if you don't have restaurants, well then,

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:25.700
you're not going to get the tourists, right?
Because tourists are going to go places where

00:41:25.700 --> 00:41:32.170
they can eat.
And if you don't get the tourists, then you

00:41:32.170 --> 00:41:37.630
don't get the hotels.
So there's this whole spillover effect from

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:43.609
allowing alcohol that generates tourist dollars,
and that's a huge issue for a lot of places

00:41:43.609 --> 00:41:49.859
now.
For example, we talked about Utah here a couple

00:41:49.859 --> 00:41:55.039
of minutes ago.
Utah, just this last year.

00:41:55.039 --> 00:42:00.230
Anybody hear of the Zion's Curtain Law?
Yeah.

00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:07.470
Zion's Curtain was established in 1933 or
1934, right after Prohibition ended, and they

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:13.150
literally put up a curtain -- a barrier -- between
the bar and the customer.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:19.910
So you couldn't actually interact with the
bartender and you couldn't watch them make

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:23.109
your drink, right?
And that existed all the way until last year.

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:34.119
And you know, most people in Utah are Mormon.
But even the Utah legislature finally realized

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:41.210
they get a huge proportion of the revenue
from tourism.

00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:49.630
They finally realized, "Okay, this makes us
a little backwards putting up a curtain around

00:42:49.630 --> 00:43:03.160
the bar like 'Ooh', it's so wrong to see the
bartender make your drink, you know?" So they

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:14.849
actually repealed the Zion's Curtain Law last
year and just to kind of catch up with where

00:43:14.849 --> 00:43:21.940
the times are.
Kind of recognizing, "Okay, let's get to where

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:28.619
people actually are on alcohol now."
This is really interesting.

00:43:28.619 --> 00:43:41.310
This is the American drinking pattern on alcohol.
I don't think this is necessarily a healthy

00:43:41.310 --> 00:43:52.630
model, but this is how we drink.
The average age most kids had their first

00:43:52.630 --> 00:44:04.329
drink in America -- between 12 and 13.
And a few people here nodding their heads

00:44:04.329 --> 00:44:16.230
saying, "Oh, yeah."
Sixteen for me, but maybe I had a sip of beer

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:25.400
at some point when I was really young, but
I don't remember it.

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:35.940
But then, there's this huge spike.
By the time kids leave high school, they're

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:43.430
already binge drinking.
So in a matter of a couple short years, they

00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:57.039
adopt alcohol, and then they overuse it.
And then, they go off to college, it gets

00:44:57.039 --> 00:45:06.160
even worse.
And so, we have this huge binge drinking culture,

00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:12.130
especially in colleges and universities and
college campuses.

00:45:12.130 --> 00:45:29.010
And colleges are really trying to drive the
problem off the campus through heavy enforcement,

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:36.630
so -- similar to Prohibition.
And largely what they're doing is just pushing

00:45:36.630 --> 00:45:50.300
the drinking off campus where it becomes an
even bigger problem, because it's now not

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:57.740
monitored anymore, right?
So the problem just gets worse and worse and

00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:07.900
more students are dying because of binge drinking.
And then, gradually over the years, then Americans

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:16.500
learn, "Okay, you can't live your life binge
drinking.

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:31.720
This is crazy, you know." And so, we all learn
kind of how to moderate our drinking over

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:37.180
time.
You learn, when you're young -- when you're

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:48.559
in college -- getting drunk might be the thing
that you want to do, and then you get to -- I

00:46:48.559 --> 00:47:00.940
don't know some point in your mid to late
20's or something -- you realize, you know,

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:07.880
Okay, I'm 41 years old.
You know, I don't drink anymore to get drunk.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:15.069
It's not, you know, that's not why I drink.
I drink more for the experience of how it

00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:22.059
goes with food, for the conviviality of being
with your friends and socializing, and how

00:47:22.059 --> 00:47:31.799
it sort of gets people to talk a little bit
better, but you can do that with one or two

00:47:31.799 --> 00:47:38.910
drinks, right?
You don't necessarily have to like, get smashed,

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:44.109
you know.
So it becomes much more about the experience

00:47:44.109 --> 00:47:54.940
and about the taste.
Kind of what we drink, kind of changes over

00:47:54.940 --> 00:48:08.789
time here based on what your personal preferences
are or how you use alcohol in your own personal

00:48:08.789 --> 00:48:18.990
life over time.
So again, we kind of moderate our habits over

00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:26.990
our lifetimes.
This is a vastly different model from how

00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:37.210
most European countries raise their kids or
how -- within this country -- how Jewish families

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:48.880
raise their kids, whereby it's just -- they
learn how to drink at the dinner table, right?

00:48:48.880 --> 00:49:04.880
As a little kids, if you come from a Jewish
family, every Friday night, you have the Shabbat

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:15.819
dinner and even little kids get a small glass
of wine.

00:49:15.819 --> 00:49:25.160
And it's just part of the experience, so it's
normalized.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:36.480
And as a result, you don't see the same binge
drinking behavior in most European countries

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:42.170
or most Jewish families within the United
States.

00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:57.480
So there are a couple exceptions to that.
In Europe, U.K. has a big binge drinking problem.

00:49:57.480 --> 00:50:04.369
It's worse than the United States itself.
But you know, other than that, it's Germany,

00:50:04.369 --> 00:50:11.099
France, Italy, Spain.
You have the big countries, where they all

00:50:11.099 --> 00:50:23.069
have big alcohol cultures, and yet, they drink
more than we do, and yet, vastly lower rates

00:50:23.069 --> 00:50:31.170
of binge drinking.
It's much more to do with socializing and

00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:37.080
with food, right?
That's why in Italy, everybody has a glass

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:43.269
of wine with every meal.
That's how they drink.

00:50:43.269 --> 00:50:53.549
So it's a vastly different culture altogether
than Americans are.

00:50:53.549 --> 00:51:04.259
And we sort of had to learn moderation after
we made all of our mistakes.

00:51:04.259 --> 00:51:16.920
And then, gradually, we learn how to control
our drinking and how to enjoy the drink for

00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:26.630
more the experience.
And then, talking here as well about the always

00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:41.980
contentious issue of the drinking age itself.
Remember 25 years ago we shifted up the drinking

00:51:41.980 --> 00:52:00.799
age from 18 up to 21, and that was largely
thanks to Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

00:52:00.799 --> 00:52:12.150
They did that, of course, to save lives of
young adults who were being killed on car

00:52:12.150 --> 00:52:26.019
accidents through drinking and driving.
And, in some ways, I think we simply just

00:52:26.019 --> 00:52:43.950
kicked the can down the road.
We see the biggest group that both binge drinks

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:55.240
and also has the most prevalence of drunk
driving accidents are the 21 to 25-year-olds.

00:52:55.240 --> 00:53:04.519
And then gradually then that significantly
comes down over time.

00:53:04.519 --> 00:53:23.289
But yeah, we've kind of created this forbidden
fruit thing with our young adults by telling

00:53:23.289 --> 00:53:32.000
them that they can't drink until they're 21.
And of course, they do, right?

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:44.190
I mean, anything that you've kind of created
a social taboo around -- just like during

00:53:44.190 --> 00:54:02.230
Prohibition -- well, they're going to say,
"We want to go do it anyways, because it's

00:54:02.230 --> 00:54:12.309
kind of glamorous now to break the law."
And so on.

00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:20.950
So I think our attitude that young people
shouldn't drink at all in this country until

00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:27.849
they're of age -- until they're 21 -- has
helped create this binge-drinking problem.

00:54:27.849 --> 00:54:34.119
And, by the way, this kind of shocked me when
I learned of this fact.

00:54:34.119 --> 00:54:44.519
Mothers Against Drunk Driving claims that
they've saved about 1,000 lives a year by

00:54:44.519 --> 00:54:51.640
raising the drinking age up to 21.
The federal government came back and said,

00:54:51.640 --> 00:55:05.280
"Nah, it's more like about 900 lives a year."
Kind of the unintended consequence though

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:19.950
of raising the drinking age up to 21 is, the
last number that we have is from 2005 was

00:55:19.950 --> 00:55:27.160
that 1,825 students died of binge-drinking-related
causes on campuses and universities.

00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:37.140
That floored me when I saw that.
That's double the number of lives we're actually

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:48.309
saving from raising the drinking age.
And it's largely because of the unintended

00:55:48.309 --> 00:55:53.609
consequence of creating the social taboo around
alcohol.

00:55:53.609 --> 00:56:02.470
When I grew up -- when I was in high school
 -- we drank wine coolers.

00:56:02.470 --> 00:56:08.599
Shouldn't admit that, but we did.
And beer.

00:56:08.599 --> 00:56:21.339
Yeah, I think we're the same generation, 80's?
But it's what we drank and, of course.

00:56:21.339 --> 00:56:31.369
But you shift over to today's young generation
 -- where the drinking is so heavily pushed

00:56:31.369 --> 00:56:39.140
underground -- and the students are really
shifted over towards distilled spirits, which

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:46.900
are much more concentrated.
And especially since they can't go to any

00:56:46.900 --> 00:57:02.130
events where they can drink alcohol, so one
of the things they do, for example, anybody

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:10.869
hear of the term 'pregaming'?
Yeah 'pre-partying'?

00:57:10.869 --> 00:57:18.450
You basically take your hip flask with you
in your stomach.

00:57:18.450 --> 00:57:39.000
You take a bunch of shots of vodka, and then
you head out for the night and the buzz sets

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:48.140
in while you're out, right?
So it's very dangerous.

00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:52.999
You can really harm yourself with a small
amount of alcohol.

00:57:52.999 --> 00:57:58.420
And really realize how powerful this stuff
is.

00:57:58.420 --> 00:58:02.989
We've also created this rite of passage at
21.

00:58:02.989 --> 00:58:11.540
And anybody hear this or experience this with,
you reach 21, you take 21 shots?

00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:22.190
That's almost an entire fifth.
That can kill you, depending on your size

00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:35.579
and your tolerance for alcohol.
But, I mean, that can definitely send you

00:58:35.579 --> 00:58:45.579
to the hospital.
21 shots of beer okay, but 21 shots of vodka

00:58:45.579 --> 00:58:57.400
is something else, right?
And that's a rite of passage when you hit

00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:08.089
21, you got to go do this and, you know, that's
crazy like, "You know, why would you go kill

00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:16.220
yourself like that or potentially harm yourself?"
But again, that's part of the whole taboo

00:59:16.220 --> 00:59:20.089
we've created around alcohol, especially among
young adults.

00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:26.549
Other key contentious issues -- I think the
drinking age is probably the most contentious

00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:33.150
issue right now and it's been going on kind
of for 25 years.

00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:38.299
There's a big discussion around, Should we
drop it down to 18?

00:59:38.299 --> 00:59:47.010
And I argue that in the book actually.
We should take another look at it.

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:51.589
21 has created this unintended consequence
and you know maybe 18 should be the right

00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:56.030
age.
And really push the emphasis back on parents.

00:59:56.030 --> 01:00:00.440
Have them raise their kids with, you know,
how to drink at the dinner table and learn

01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:07.599
how to drink responsibly.
Because once the kids are 18, go off to college,

01:00:07.599 --> 01:00:12.079
personally I think it's too late.
Because the alcohol is everywhere.

01:00:12.079 --> 01:00:19.849
I mean, the colleges can try to enforce the
drinking age and try to keep the kids from

01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:25.630
drinking, but it's just too easy for them
to get.

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:30.319
It's everywhere.
They all have friends with fake ID's or friends

01:00:30.319 --> 01:00:35.210
who want to buy it for them.
And it's just endemic now.

01:00:35.210 --> 01:00:42.990
So the problems get worse.
Another key issue -- I think this one here

01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:49.770
goes all the way back really to 1933, 1934.
It's the question of advertising.

01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:59.220
There are those people who want to stop alcohol
advertising altogether just like they've managed

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:06.849
largely to stop tobacco advertising -- especially
on TV and billboards, that kind of stuff.

01:01:06.849 --> 01:01:14.029
We'll see where this goes.
I think this is largely -- especially as a

01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:18.049
journalist -- this is for me, a First Amendment
issue, right?

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:23.680
Companies need to advertise.
And I think, ultimately, they do have a right

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:28.299
to.
And certainly, pornography is considered to

01:01:28.299 --> 01:01:37.069
be protected free speech.
So why wouldn't alcohol advertising also be

01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:46.359
considered to be protected free speech, right?
You know, it's commercial.

01:01:46.359 --> 01:01:47.690
You may have noticed here if you ever go to
Candlestick Park.

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:51.380
Sorry, I guess people don't go to baseball
games anymore to Candlestick Park.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.220
I'm showing my age, since I used to go there.
You know.

01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.220
It's PacBell Park now or AT&amp;T Park now.
Is that what they renamed it?

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.220
AT&amp;T Park.

01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:56.220
&gt;&gt; Candlestick is still the one where the
49ers live.

01:01:56.220 --> 01:01:57.220
&gt;&gt; Garrett Peck: Okay.
You might have noticed how much beer advertising

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:58.390
is there.
Like any stadium you go around the country

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:59.619
there's so much beer advertising, right?
There's a key reason for that.

01:01:59.619 --> 01:02:06.160
Eighty percent of the beer drunk in this country
is drunk by men, and men like sports.

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:10.489
It's a really simple formula and that's why
they advertise in these venues and that's

01:02:10.489 --> 01:02:13.930
why there's such a heavy predominance of beer
advertising.

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:17.109
And also why you see it -- if you watch football
at home -- since the World Series is going

01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:19.920
on right now, but you always see beer commercials
going on on TV during that time, right?

01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:20.960
It's simple fact.
It's what men drink.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.089
At least what men of a certain age.
But yeah, it goes together with kind of with

01:02:24.089 --> 01:02:27.999
the sports.
And they know what their niche market is.

01:02:27.999 --> 01:02:34.510
They have a fairly large niche market.
So yeah, it kind of goes hand in hand together.

01:02:34.510 --> 01:02:35.640
We all kind of think when we go to a ballgame
or hockey game, or whatever, "Let me get a

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.640
hot dog and have a beer with it."
I think we're almost all socially programmed

01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:37.640
towards that now in American society.
There's also this key question here.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:38.640
It's really popped up -- at least since the
early 1990's -- which is, Can alcohol actually

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.230
be healthy?
And anybody remember here the 60 Minutes broadcast

01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:41.720
about the French Paradox?
It was in 1991.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.680
A few people remember that.
And they really lay out the case that, in

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:47.619
fact, you know, the French have a high fat
diet and yet they drink and they have an astonishingly

01:02:47.619 --> 01:02:51.210
low rate of heart disease even though a lot
of them smoke.

01:02:51.210 --> 01:02:52.269
And so, that was the French Paradox.
They realized, "Okay.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:54.450
It must be the wine."
Because they drink so much red wine that it

01:02:54.450 --> 01:02:57.809
gives them cardiovascular protection.
And, as a result then, especially the baby

01:02:57.809 --> 01:03:00.933
boom generation just wholesale jumped over
to drinking red wine.

01:03:00.933 --> 01:03:01.933
And you still see that today.
People who are 50 and older, drink wine.

01:03:01.933 --> 01:03:02.933
Because they view it as being healthy, and
they can also afford it.

01:03:02.933 --> 01:03:06.990
It tends to be the most expensive of the three
types of alcohol -- so, beer and distilled

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:09.140
spirits being the other two.
Yeah, so there's been this whole debate over,

01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.580
"Gosh.
Can we drink?

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:16.090
Is it healthy for us?" And yes, it's a kind
of a two-sided question really, or maybe multi-faceted

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:17.090
question.
Certainly alcohol can cause harm.

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:18.090
Absolutely.
If any of you drink too much, there is alcoholism.

01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.090
Most people don't become alcoholics, that's
the thing.

01:03:19.090 --> 01:03:20.090
Most people learn how to moderate their drinking.
But yeah, you can have liver damage from drinking

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:21.090
too much alcohol.
Women are at heightened risk for breast cancer.

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:22.090
And there's a bunch of other things that go
along with it.

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.090
There's also, of course, on the flip side,
health benefits from alcohol predominantly

01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:24.090
to the cardiovascular system.
Alcohol raises your HDL cholesterol, that's

01:03:24.090 --> 01:03:25.090
good cholesterol, by five to ten percent.
This is, by the way, for moderate amount of

01:03:25.090 --> 01:03:26.090
alcohol.
If you drink a lot of alcohol, it can actually

01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:27.090
damage your heart.
But a moderate amount actually can give you

01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:28.090
significant heart protection.
It also thins your blood, which gives you

01:03:28.090 --> 01:03:29.090
big protection against strokes.
And they're also noticing that for elderly

01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:30.090
people who drink regularly and moderately,
it gives them protection against Alzheimer's,

01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:31.090
like somehow it prevents the plaque buildup
in old people's brains.

01:03:31.090 --> 01:03:32.090
So yeah, there are some benefits from a moderate
amount of drinking every single day.

01:03:32.090 --> 01:03:33.090
The public health community is generally against
any kind of mention at all of any kind of

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:35.019
health benefit whatsoever, because they're
really heavily cautioning against that, particularly

01:03:35.019 --> 01:03:37.410
like the American Medical Association.
I've gotten some interesting e-mails and some

01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:39.910
interesting exchanges here over the last couple
of months since the book came out.

01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:43.309
One -- I think this kind of ties so much together
with the stigma of alcohol and so on together

01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:44.549
with the health issue.
I got an e-mail last month from an Assemblies

01:03:44.549 --> 01:03:45.549
of God minister in Georgetown, Texas -- so
a small, evangelical, Protestant town in Texas.

01:03:45.549 --> 01:03:46.549
And this guy here said -- and he had preached
his whole life long, the evils of alcohol

01:03:46.549 --> 01:03:50.200
 -- Demon Rum, all the way, right?
Don't drink it; it's bad for you, and so on.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.200
However, he had the talk with his doctor,
who said, "Your cholesterol is way too high.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.200
Your numbers are off the chart.
So you need to start drinking a glass of wine

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:53.200
every single day."
So he started doing that.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.200
Every night with his wife, he would sort of
have a glass of wine, and they discovered

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.200
they enjoyed it.
So they had one glass a day.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.200
That's all they allowed themselves.
And they found like, "Wow, this is really

01:03:56.200 --> 01:03:57.200
 -- we kind of catch the day much nicer now.
We have a nice little discussion at the end

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.200
of the day.
We're having fun testing these different wines

01:03:58.200 --> 01:03:59.200
and so on."
And then, he went and told his congregation,

01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.200
and which was just like, Wow.
He was heavily stigmatized within his own

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.200
church for telling them -- after preaching
for years the evils of alcohol -- and now,

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.200
he was saying, "Okay.
You could have a little bit and actually it's

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.200
a God-given benefit" right?
So among his friends and his congregation,

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.200
he found there was really a backlash against
him for doing that.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.200
I also -- last week, I gave a talk up at Davis
and there was a Methodist minister.

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.200
I'm a Methodist today.
And I think he kind of mis-approached my book.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.200
I think he thought my book was going to be
about kind of how evil alcohol is.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200
And he talked my ear off for about ten minutes
before my talk began.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.200
I was like, "Ooh boy."
We're reading the same data, and yet, we're

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.200
interpreting it completely different.
So I'm looking at it realizing, "Most of us

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200
drink.
Here's kind of a synthesis of where we are

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.200
in America." He's reading the same data and
seeing, "Oh, no.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.200
Harm, damage, wrecked lives, destruction,
cancer.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:14.200
People shouldn't drink, right?
Raise the drinking age to 25 for all I care,

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:15.200
right?" And at one point during the talk,
he kind of sat in the back row and he kept

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:20.289
quiet most of the time.
He asked a couple of questions, but it was

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:21.289
largely -- it was a litany of angry faces
he made at me just sort of like, you know

01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:22.289
when I was talking about the benefits for
alcohol.

01:04:22.289 --> 01:04:23.289
And I got to the one point where I talked
about this minister in Georgetown, Texas,

01:04:23.289 --> 01:04:24.289
and talked about how many of my friends who
are in their 50's to 70's who have had the

01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:25.289
talk with their doctor and the doctors told
them, "Have a glass of wine every single day.

01:04:25.289 --> 01:04:26.289
It'll be good for you."
Right?

01:04:26.289 --> 01:04:27.289
And at that point, the guy in the back shouted
out, "Oh, no, they don't."

01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:28.289
And I said, "Yes, they do."
Yeah, I think the guy's kind of out of touch

01:04:28.289 --> 01:04:29.289
with really where Americans are.
Or maybe he only has friends who know that,

01:04:29.289 --> 01:04:30.289
in fact, that he's so staunchly anti-alcohol
that none of them really confess to him that,

01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:31.289
in fact, their doctor told them it's okay
to have a glass of wine once in awhile.

01:04:31.289 --> 01:04:32.289
It's actually good for you to have a moderate
amount, you know?

01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:33.289
So again, that's kind of the whole public
debate that's going on right now about the

01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:34.289
health benefits of alcohol itself.
You know, when we look at this cycle of drinking,

01:04:34.289 --> 01:04:35.289
this is really an interesting thing that's
happened since Prohibition over these last

01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:36.289
76 years is to kind of realize there's all
these big cycles of drinking itself of times

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:37.289
of when we drink more, then there's always
reform.

01:04:37.289 --> 01:04:38.289
So Mothers Against Drunk Driving formed in
1980 kind of as an outcome of probably -- the

01:04:38.289 --> 01:04:39.289
peak of binge drinking was in the 1970's and
that was largely the last, big, distilled

01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:40.289
spirits culture in this country.
That's back when the men were drinking rye

01:04:40.289 --> 01:04:41.289
or bourbon with the names like, you know,
Old Grand Dad, Old Forester.

01:04:41.289 --> 01:04:42.289
The baby boom generation came along and said,
"Uh-uh, we're not going to drink anything

01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:43.289
with the word 'Old' in it, right?" So bourbon
like collapsed at that point.

01:04:43.289 --> 01:04:44.289
And it has resurrected over the last decade
or so.

01:04:44.289 --> 01:04:45.289
And they dropped all the words old.
Now, you got new products like Liquor Reserve

01:04:45.289 --> 01:04:46.289
and Tipping Blackby, and so on.
Yeah so, there's always been a cycle.

01:04:46.289 --> 01:04:47.289
Each generation picks a drink that they like
to drink.

01:04:47.289 --> 01:04:48.289
And even within a generation, it changes over
time.

01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:49.289
You know, for example, you see the Baby Boom
Generation.

01:04:49.289 --> 01:04:50.289
They started off as being beer drinkers.
They looked at their parents who were bourbon

01:04:50.289 --> 01:04:51.289
drinkers and they said, "Uh-uh, we're not
doing that."

01:04:51.289 --> 01:04:52.289
They drank beer throughout the 80's and then
of course, the French Paradox hit on 60 Minutes,

01:04:52.289 --> 01:04:53.289
1991, and they shifted right over to wine.
And that's where they're at.

01:04:53.289 --> 01:04:54.289
You get to our generation.
We're Generation Xers, and there's probably

01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:55.289
a few other Gen-Xers and probably a few millennials
here in the room as well.

01:04:55.289 --> 01:04:56.289
We kind of drink everything.
I think beer is our predominant beverage throughout

01:04:56.289 --> 01:04:57.289
our generation.
There's always difference by each person.

01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:58.289
And yeah, we also largely drink wine.
We like cocktails.

01:04:58.289 --> 01:04:59.289
So we're kind of like a blended generation.
And you get to the millennials, and they're

01:04:59.289 --> 01:05:00.289
drinking cocktails.
That's what they like.

01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:01.289
They like vodka.
They like tequila.

01:05:01.289 --> 01:05:02.289
The big drink is Red Bull vodka.
That way they can go out after the club and

01:05:02.289 --> 01:05:03.289
drink a lot and still stay awake, you know?
It's the fruit cocktail.

01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:04.289
You have the benefits of caffeine even with
alcohol -- great, right?

01:05:04.289 --> 01:05:05.289
So yeah, our preferences for alcohol change
over time.

01:05:05.289 --> 01:05:06.289
Like I said, we kind of learn how to moderate
our drinking.

01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:07.289
No one really sticks with the same beverage
all of their entire lives.

01:05:07.289 --> 01:05:08.289
And most of you, if you look at your own history,
you've probably already kind of seen a shift

01:05:08.289 --> 01:05:09.289
in your own lives, haven't you? -- if you're
a drinker.

01:05:09.289 --> 01:05:10.289
That you kind of shift.
And a lot of times, it's even seasonal, based

01:05:10.289 --> 01:05:11.289
on -- there's probably some people in the
room who are foodies.

01:05:11.289 --> 01:05:12.289
And kind of -- you like going to the farmer's
market and you wait for whatever's fresh.

01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:13.289
Then you kind of pair whatever wine or beer
goes with it.

01:05:13.289 --> 01:05:14.289
Then that's different in the summertime than
wintertime, right?

01:05:14.289 --> 01:05:15.289
Where you might open up big hearty reds to
got with you're meat loaf or vegan meatloaf

01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:16.289
or whatever you like to eat.
[laughter] So there's always kind of a seasonality,

01:05:16.289 --> 01:05:17.289
I think, largely where Americans are -- of
kind of pairing our food together with whatever

01:05:17.289 --> 01:05:18.289
we like to drink.
And I think that's actually fairly healthy

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:19.289
 -- the fact we've learned how to make that
part of the dining experience.

01:05:19.289 --> 01:05:20.289
Because ultimately then, people tend to drink
more moderately when it's actually part of

01:05:20.289 --> 01:05:21.289
our meal versus "Let's go out to the bar and
get drunk together."

01:05:21.289 --> 01:05:22.289
You know?
That's a different experience altogether.

01:05:22.289 --> 01:05:23.289
So talking a little bit about the history,
especially since we're here in California.

01:05:23.289 --> 01:05:24.289
California, by the way, makes 90 percent of
the wine in this country.

01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:25.289
All 50 states have wineries, including Alaska
and Hawaii.

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:26.289
California, though, makes 90 percent of the
wine in this country.

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.289
So it's the 800-pound gorilla on the block,
right?

01:05:27.289 --> 01:05:28.289
So most is made right here.
California, of course, became -- the wine

01:05:28.289 --> 01:05:29.289
industry was really decimated by Prohibition
itself and it didn't start to recover into

01:05:29.289 --> 01:05:30.289
the 1960s.
And I kind of chart that's really where the

01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:31.289
craft movement really began, which coincided
together with Julia Child.

01:05:31.289 --> 01:05:32.289
Remember -- if you ever watch any of her shows
 -- she would always hold up a glass of wine

01:05:32.289 --> 01:05:33.289
at the end and say, "Bon appetit."
You know, really showed Americans how you

01:05:33.289 --> 01:05:34.289
can -- not only make good food, but you can
pair it with good wine.

01:05:34.289 --> 01:05:35.289
So people started doing that, you know.
People started flying transAtlantic flights

01:05:35.289 --> 01:05:36.289
over to Europe and realizing, "Wow, look at
the Europeans.

01:05:36.289 --> 01:05:37.289
They have wine with every meal.
Let's do the same, you know?" So there was

01:05:37.289 --> 01:05:38.289
a rising interest in wine in the 1960s, and
that's when Napa really started to flourish.

01:05:38.289 --> 01:05:39.289
And you know, here we are today with the whole
baby boom generation that's really embraced

01:05:39.289 --> 01:05:40.289
wine itself.
So that was the 1960's.

01:05:40.289 --> 01:05:41.289
We kind of fast forward to the end of the
1970's, and Jimmy Carter signed a law allowing

01:05:41.289 --> 01:05:42.289
home brewing to become legal in 1979.
And that really charts the beginning of the

01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:43.289
craft beer phenomenon.
And one of the big leaders, a lot of the phenomenon

01:05:43.289 --> 01:05:44.289
really started here in California itself with
like, New Albion Brewing Company which has

01:05:44.289 --> 01:05:45.289
long since gone defunct.
But you've had Anchor Steam up in San Francisco.

01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:46.289
And, of course, Sierra Nevada -- it's been
a huge leader here in the craft beer movement.

01:05:46.289 --> 01:05:47.289
The biggest single craft brewer though, in
the country is Jim Cook who is the brewer

01:05:47.289 --> 01:05:48.289
behind the Boston Beer Company, Sam Adams.
He's actually the single, largest American

01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:49.289
brewer now, since the big three are all foreign
owned.

01:05:49.289 --> 01:05:50.289
So Coors, Anheuser Busch, and Miller are all
owned by foreign companies now.

01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:51.289
And he has less than one percent market share
of the entire brewing market.

01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:52.289
Jim actually, by the way, was the last person
I interviewed for the book.

01:05:52.289 --> 01:05:53.289
The manuscript was due in one week.
So September 29th of last year 2008, I interviewed

01:05:53.289 --> 01:05:54.289
him -- got that last interview in.
My editor said, "Let's beef up the beer chapter

01:05:54.289 --> 01:05:55.289
just a little bit."
So I got him, got his whole story about where

01:05:55.289 --> 01:05:56.289
he came from, and how he became so big.
Then, a week later, the manuscript was due.

01:05:56.289 --> 01:05:57.289
So, I was very thrilled to be able to introduce
him.

01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:58.289
It was actually -- he was just about to jump
on an airplane to fly to Germany to go pick

01:05:58.289 --> 01:05:59.289
up the hops for that year.
So that was the very end of September of last

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:00.289
year.
One of the other things here -- if anybody

01:06:00.289 --> 01:06:01.289
here is from the mid-Atlantic -- Rolling Rock.
I'm sure that you've seen it here on the West

01:06:01.289 --> 01:06:02.289
Coast as well.
But I look at that as sort of a impact -- within

01:06:02.289 --> 01:06:03.289
the book -- of globalization upon a small
brewer.

01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:04.289
And sort of what happens when you can't compete
anymore when the market disappears, or you

01:06:04.289 --> 01:06:05.289
just can't stomach nationwide advertising.
In this case here, with Rolling Rock -- the

01:06:05.289 --> 01:06:06.289
brand itself got butt out by Anheuser Busch
who didn't want the brewery.

01:06:06.289 --> 01:06:07.289
So it actually isn't made anymore in La Trove,
Pennsylvania but now in Newark, right by the

01:06:07.289 --> 01:06:08.289
airport.
Yeah, it's kind of interesting to look at

01:06:08.289 --> 01:06:09.289
small brewers -- if they can't compete and
particularly either have a local niche market

01:06:09.289 --> 01:06:10.289
for like microbrewers, or they can't go national
they get bought out sometimes and you have

01:06:10.289 --> 01:06:11.289
unintended consequences that come about from
that -- from globalization itself.

01:06:11.289 --> 01:06:12.289
And then, finally, we get to the liquor market.
Distilled spirits, of course, like I said,

01:06:12.289 --> 01:06:13.289
they hit the wall back in the 1970s.
And just in the last decade, they've been

01:06:13.289 --> 01:06:14.289
resurrected, and I kind of chart the beginning
of distilled spirits -- of the phenomenon

01:06:14.289 --> 01:06:15.289
 -- to Sex in the City.
So any fans here of the show?

01:06:15.289 --> 01:06:16.289
The girls on the show really made the cosmopolitan
popular, like really glamorous.

01:06:16.289 --> 01:06:17.289
They always used to change their outfits all
the time and they always have this little

01:06:17.289 --> 01:06:18.289
pink fruity martini that they drink when they
would go out.

01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:19.289
And Americans kind of caught on to that like,
"Wow, spirits -- like really cool, right?"

01:06:19.289 --> 01:06:20.289
So I kind of chart that as the beginning of
the resurrection here for distilled spirits.

01:06:20.289 --> 01:06:21.289
And you get to today, there's this huge craft
cocktail phenomenon going on.

01:06:21.289 --> 01:06:22.289
So if you go into San Francisco, or local
bars, where you have these -- I call them

01:06:22.289 --> 01:06:23.289
'culinary bartenders' who take their inspiration
from the kitchen, right?

01:06:23.289 --> 01:06:24.289
So they're not just mixing drinks anymore,
but now, they have to use kitchen skills to

01:06:24.289 --> 01:06:25.289
separate eggs and to use, you know, fresh
juices and so on; they start putting herbs

01:06:25.289 --> 01:06:26.289
and spices and stuff like that into cocktails.
So there's been this really huge shift.

01:06:26.289 --> 01:06:27.289
And cocktails, of course, you can do an infinite
variety of types of drinks here that you can

01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:28.289
make.
So really a significant shift here that's

01:06:28.289 --> 01:06:29.289
happened just within the last decade.
So it's kind of interesting here to look.

01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:30.289
You also, of course, have the craft phenomenon
going on within distilled spirits itself.

01:06:30.289 --> 01:06:31.289
They're kind of the last ones that have got
there.

01:06:31.289 --> 01:06:32.289
And it's just happened just in the last couple
of years.

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:33.289
This particular photo right here is Winford
Reserve.

01:06:33.289 --> 01:06:34.289
I was just out there just last month here
giving a talk.

01:06:34.289 --> 01:06:35.289
But yeah, you think the word Winford Reserve.
It sounds like a wine, doesn't it?

01:06:35.289 --> 01:06:36.289
It's a brand that was great in 1996, and yet
they used this old distillery from the early

01:06:36.289 --> 01:06:37.289
1800s and they restored it Brown Foreman alcohol
companies out there.

01:06:37.289 --> 01:06:38.289
And then, just in the last couple of years,
you start to see kind of small craft distillers

01:06:38.289 --> 01:06:39.289
that have kind of popped up.
There's one for example in Alameda that makes

01:06:39.289 --> 01:06:40.289
acid.
By and large most of the companies are making

01:06:40.289 --> 01:06:41.289
gin or vodka, because you don't need to age
those.

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:42.289
You can make it in a bottle on the same day
and off to market you go, whereas like whiskey,

01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:43.289
you got to age it.
That takes years; that's a lot of capital

01:06:43.289 --> 01:06:44.289
and places to store it and so on.
Yeah, liquor has been kind of the latecomer

01:06:44.289 --> 01:06:45.289
here to the craft movement, but yeah here
it is.

01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:46.289
It's kind of just popping up.
So kind of wrapping up my talk here today.

01:06:46.289 --> 01:06:47.289
We've looked at a lot of different things
here.

01:06:47.289 --> 01:06:48.289
A lot of the key issues that have gone on
here in American society, kind of tracing

01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:49.289
how Americans have shifted over these last
76 years from a country where alcohol was

01:06:49.289 --> 01:06:50.289
once heavily stigmatized to one where we are
today where yeah, most of us drink and a lot

01:06:50.289 --> 01:06:51.289
of people are kind of fanatics about what
they drink.

01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:52.289
And so, especially people who pair food together
with whatever they like to drink.

01:06:52.289 --> 01:06:53.289
So it's a pretty significant social shift
in American society.

01:06:53.289 --> 01:06:54.289
And I think in a lot of ways, alcohol is in
fact fundamental to American society.

01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:55.289
It was really naive of the temperance movement,
especially in hindsight, to think that, "Wow,

01:06:55.289 --> 01:06:56.289
they actually wanted to ban alcohol?" And
would Americans actually not drink?

01:06:56.289 --> 01:06:57.289
I mean, alcohol's been there from the beginning.
I mean, literally, from Jamestown -- the first

01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:58.289
settlers that came to Jamestown, they didn't
want to grow tobacco.

01:06:58.289 --> 01:06:59.289
They ended up with tobacco.
They went there to grow grapes so they could

01:06:59.289 --> 01:07:00.289
challenge the French in Bordeaux.
So they were trying to basically break the

01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:01.289
French monopoly on red wine.
And it didn't work out that way and Williamsburg

01:07:01.289 --> 01:07:02.289
and that area is a terrible climate to grow
grapes; it's very humid.

01:07:02.289 --> 01:07:03.289
So they ended up with tobacco instead.
Or in 1620, when the pilgrims came here, they

01:07:03.289 --> 01:07:04.289
ended up in Plymouth.
But the first place they actually landed was

01:07:04.289 --> 01:07:05.289
what's now Provincetown, up at the very tip
of Cape Cod.

01:07:05.289 --> 01:07:06.289
And when they came ashore, the very first
thing that they did?

01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:07.289
They dug a well so they could get water so
they could brew beer.

01:07:07.289 --> 01:07:08.289
That's how you preserved your water back then.
I mean, it was low alcohol beer, three to

01:07:08.289 --> 01:07:09.289
four percent alcohol.
But you know, these people by the way, were

01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:10.289
Puritans.
People blame Prohibition on the Puritans.

01:07:10.289 --> 01:07:11.289
In fact, the Puritans drink.
It wasn't their fault that Prohibition came

01:07:11.289 --> 01:07:12.289
about, but rather from a movement that came
out centuries later. So yeah.

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:13.289
I mean, alcohol in fact really is a fundamental
part of American society, and I think the

01:07:13.289 --> 01:07:14.289
sooner we can recognize that and the fact
that we can sooner recognize that there are

01:07:14.289 --> 01:07:15.289
in fact benefits from moderate drinking and
from socialization that ultimately leads to

01:07:15.289 --> 01:07:16.289
a better outcome for Americans overall.
I always like to end here with my favorite

01:07:16.289 --> 01:07:17.289
quote here from Homer Simpson, which is, "To
alcohol, the cause of and solution to all

01:07:17.289 --> 01:07:18.289
of life's problems."
All righty. I'll be glad to hear -- to take

01:07:18.289 --> 01:07:19.289
any questions and to answer any questions
you guys have.

01:07:19.289 --> 01:07:20.289
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

01:07:20.289 --> 01:07:21.289
Q I grew up in Oklahoma and they still have
like the 3.2 beer I think it is.

01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:22.289
I've heard at the time that 3.2 during Prohibition
was actually nonalcoholic.

01:07:22.289 --> 01:07:23.289
Tell me if this is a big crack but I was told
that when Prohibition kicked in, a lot of

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:24.289
burglars just walked away said they're out
of business, but Oklahoma lowered it to 3.2

01:07:24.289 --> 01:07:25.289
which is technically nonbeer.
Maintained it through Prohibition and then

01:07:25.289 --> 01:07:26.289
when Prohibition was lifted, Oklahoma just
maintained 3.2, and now it's more than just

01:07:26.289 --> 01:07:27.289
a couple of states that have that low percent.

01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:28.289
Garrett Peck: Repeat the question, just so
they can all hear in case they didn't record

01:07:28.289 --> 01:07:29.289
it.
He asked about Oklahoma and also 3.2 percent

01:07:29.289 --> 01:07:30.289
beer.
The Oklahoma question is actually interesting.

01:07:30.289 --> 01:07:31.289
Not that it actually ever was dry, but constitutionally,
it was a dry state.

01:07:31.289 --> 01:07:32.289
And by the way, it went wet in 1959.
That wasn't the last state to go wet though.

01:07:32.289 --> 01:07:33.289
That was Mississippi in 1966.
So just a generation ago, really, the last

01:07:33.289 --> 01:07:34.289
state went wet.
The 3.2 question is actually interesting.

01:07:34.289 --> 01:07:35.289
This was the waning days of how this came
about was in the waning days of Prohibition

01:07:35.289 --> 01:07:36.289
Franklin Delano Roosevelt who was sworn in
only two weeks and a law got passed called

01:07:36.289 --> 01:07:37.289
the Cullen Act.
And that passed Congress and Roosevelt signed

01:07:37.289 --> 01:07:38.289
it on April 6th, 1933.
He was in office two weeks at that point,

01:07:38.289 --> 01:07:39.289
because presidents are sworn in March.
That law declared that 3.2 percent beer was

01:07:39.289 --> 01:07:40.289
non-intoxicating.
Roosevelt signed that law and it went into

01:07:40.289 --> 01:07:41.289
effect at midnight.
And I think that's really when Americans realized,

01:07:41.289 --> 01:07:42.289
"Okay, Prohibition's over."
The first states, including Michigan, have

01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:43.289
already voted for repeal.
At that night at midnight, the country took

01:07:43.289 --> 01:07:44.289
to the streets and everybody went out and
got a beer.

01:07:44.289 --> 01:07:45.289
Because it was 3.2 percent alcohol beer supposedly
non-intoxicating, therefore, it didn't violate

01:07:45.289 --> 01:07:46.289
the Holstead act which was the Prohibition
enforcement act.

01:07:46.289 --> 01:07:47.289
So simply Congress declared 3.2 percent beer
is non-intoxicating.

01:07:47.289 --> 01:07:48.289
So. Yeah, so largely we look at April 7th
as being sort of the beginning of the end

01:07:48.289 --> 01:07:49.289
of Prohibition.
People went out to the streets that night

01:07:49.289 --> 01:07:50.289
and celebrated at midnight when you could
actually go get a beer.

01:07:50.289 --> 01:07:51.289
It cost a nickel by then, by the way, and
nowadays, you go out to a bar, get a pint

01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:52.289
of beer; it's five bucks.
Other questions?

01:07:52.289 --> 01:07:53.289
Q I was always curious about _________ and
how U.S. beverage rules against ________for

01:07:53.289 --> 01:07:54.289
a lot longer than any other type of alcohol.
Why the special treatment for __________ ?

01:07:54.289 --> 01:07:55.289
Is there anything you learned about that?

01:07:55.289 --> 01:07:56.289
Garrett Peck: Yeah _______ actually was made
illegal I think in 1912.

01:07:56.289 --> 01:07:57.289
Q Okay.

01:07:57.289 --> 01:07:58.289
Garrett Peck: And then one of the first types
of alcohol that was outlawed altogether.

01:07:58.289 --> 01:07:59.289
People used to believe.
Everybody here seen Rulan Rouge?

01:07:59.289 --> 01:08:00.289
Everybody's nodding so you know about the
green fairy.

01:08:00.289 --> 01:08:01.289
It was once a belief that ______ was hallucinogenic.
And ultimately, they finally proved that it

01:08:01.289 --> 01:08:02.289
is not.
And now, ________ became illegal again about

01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:03.289
two years ago -- 2007 -- and so, you see it
pop up in a lot more places now.

01:08:03.289 --> 01:08:04.289
In fact, it's actually just very, very high
in alcohol.

01:08:04.289 --> 01:08:05.289
Frequently it's 55 to 60 percent alcohol.
So it's very, very high.

01:08:05.289 --> 01:08:06.289
So yeah, that's if you want to get drunk it's
an interesting way to get drunk, because it's

01:08:06.289 --> 01:08:07.289
so strong.
Yeah, people once thought it would cause brain

01:08:07.289 --> 01:08:08.289
damage or cause all kinds of bad effects and
be hallucinogenic.

01:08:08.289 --> 01:08:09.289
So therefore, they outlawed it.
France actually outlawed it as well during

01:08:09.289 --> 01:08:10.289
World War I, 1915.
That was more because so many people were

01:08:10.289 --> 01:08:11.289
shifting over to ________ and the wine merchants
were getting upset because they were losing

01:08:11.289 --> 01:08:12.289
a lot of market share.
So they made it illegal there as well.

01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:13.289
And since then, the European Union, just like
the United States has also said, Okay, it's

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.289
now illegal again.
So you can get ________ imported again into

01:08:14.289 --> 01:08:15.289
this country and you have a lot of actually
micro-distillers who are making it again now.

01:08:15.289 --> 01:08:16.289
So yeah.

01:08:16.289 --> 01:08:17.289
Q Didn't they just only recently allow distilled
spirits advertising back on TV?

01:08:17.289 --> 01:08:18.289
I was trying to figure out where that coincided.
Like five or six years ago?

01:08:18.289 --> 01:08:19.289
Garrett Peck: Sorry. Repeat the last question.
This question here was, "Didn't they just

01:08:19.289 --> 01:08:20.289
re-allow distilled spirits advertising on
TV?" Distilled spirits advertising has actually

01:08:20.289 --> 01:08:21.289
always been allowed for TV.
The debate over advertising has gone on since

01:08:21.289 --> 01:08:22.289
the 1930's when the WCTU and other organizations
that were heavily involved in temperance wanted

01:08:22.289 --> 01:08:23.289
to stop all advertising altogether.
Back in the 30's, it was all about radio advertising.

01:08:23.289 --> 01:08:24.289
And during Prohibition itself, the distillers
really got in trouble because they were the

01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:25.289
ones -- that's when the bootleggers were breaking
in, right?

01:08:25.289 --> 01:08:26.289
You got so much more profit margin by bringing
in a barrel of distilled spirits vs. wine

01:08:26.289 --> 01:08:27.289
or beer.
You make a lot more cocktails with it, right?

01:08:27.289 --> 01:08:28.289
So the biggest stigma against alcohol was
largely against spirits.

01:08:28.289 --> 01:08:29.289
And hence, the distillers -- once it became
legal again to distill -- they had kind of

01:08:29.289 --> 01:08:30.289
the toughest row to hoe.
So they agreed in the 1930's that they wouldn't

01:08:30.289 --> 01:08:31.289
advertise on television or radio.
And that held all the way until 1996, and

01:08:31.289 --> 01:08:32.289
that's when the spirits really hit a low point.
And at that point, the first company that

01:08:32.289 --> 01:08:33.289
was Seagrams said, "Okay, we have to advertise.
We're losing too much market share to wine

01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:34.289
and craft beer."
And so, they broke the code and decided, "We're

01:08:34.289 --> 01:08:35.289
going to start advertising on TV."
Largely you'll only see it on cable stations.

01:08:35.289 --> 01:08:36.289
It was actually, I think, on the Grammies
this year.

01:08:36.289 --> 01:08:37.289
There were a couple stations that were willing
to host commercials with the recession going

01:08:37.289 --> 01:08:38.289
on right now, right?
A lot of stations are starving for advertising.

01:08:38.289 --> 01:08:39.289
And so, more and more stations are willing
to take distilled spirits on advertising.

01:08:39.289 --> 01:08:40.289
But yeah, it was always just a gentleman's
agreement.

01:08:40.289 --> 01:08:41.289
It was never illegal.
And that certainly would never pass Constitutional

01:08:41.289 --> 01:08:42.289
muster ever to actually put a ban on alcohol
advertising altogether.

01:08:42.289 --> 01:08:43.289
Q There are some ______ since the 70's, 80's
you're not allowed to show people drinking

01:08:43.289 --> 01:08:44.289
alcohol in the commercials.

01:08:44.289 --> 01:08:45.289
Garrett Peck: There was actually more -- the
question was, Could they actually ban alcohol

01:08:45.289 --> 01:08:46.289
drinking or should not show?
That was more of a code of practice.

01:08:46.289 --> 01:08:47.289
Over the years, the different brewers -- it
was largely brewers who advertised on TV until

01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:48.289
the last decade or so.
That was their code of conduct that they couldn't

01:08:48.289 --> 01:08:49.289
show people drinking.
So it was just a standard of practice.

01:08:49.289 --> 01:08:50.289
Now they show it all the time certainly, right?
And certainly also shows like Madmen show

01:08:50.289 --> 01:08:51.289
lots of drinking going on.
So there's been kind of a cultural shift over

01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:52.289
time.
And again, I think partly, they held on to

01:08:52.289 --> 01:08:53.289
the, "Okay, let's not show beer drinking.
Because that would be irresponsible to show

01:08:53.289 --> 01:08:54.289
drinking."
And once, I think, the distillers got into

01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:55.289
the game of showing advertising on TV, then
the brewers decided, "Okay, we're going to

01:08:55.289 --> 01:08:56.289
one-up them. We're going to start showing
people drinking and enjoying it." Right?

01:08:56.289 --> 01:08:57.289
So the economy goes along with it.
Yeah, a lot of people think there's laws against

01:08:57.289 --> 01:08:58.289
showing different things, or can't show different
things on TV.

01:08:58.289 --> 01:08:59.289
But in fact, it was always just best practices.
So they were kind of a code of conduct that

01:08:59.289 --> 01:09:00.289
different industries organizations had and
they changed them over the last couple of

01:09:00.289 --> 01:09:01.289
years.
They've really shored up quite a bit over

01:09:01.289 --> 01:09:02.289
just in the last three or four years starting
with the distillers.

01:09:02.289 --> 01:09:03.289
They started putting some very heavy regulations
in place -- self-regulations in place -- really

01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:04.289
to prevent any kind of advertising that kids
might like.

01:09:04.289 --> 01:09:05.289
So, you know, no Budweiser frogs.
Any cartoon-based, you can't do it.

01:09:05.289 --> 01:09:06.289
No Santa Claus. No partial nudity.
No mud wrestling, anything like that.

01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:07.289
And then the brewers then followed that and
said, "Okay, we're going to raise the bar

01:09:07.289 --> 01:09:08.289
as well."
Otherwise, it was sort of a not-so-innocuous

01:09:08.289 --> 01:09:09.289
advertising they were using, especially the
brewers for the longest time.

01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:10.289
Q What about, How did you become interested
in the history of alcohol?

01:09:10.289 --> 01:09:11.289
Garrett Peck: Again, it was kind of that lightbulb
moment at my grandmother's place when she

01:09:11.289 --> 01:09:12.289
 -- how she responded so negatively.
Kind of she got a little bit snooty about

01:09:12.289 --> 01:09:13.289
the fact that I had brought that bottle of
wine to Christmas dinner.

01:09:13.289 --> 01:09:14.289
Like, "What are you thinking bringing a bottle
of wine to Christmas dinner? You know I don't

01:09:14.289 --> 01:09:15.289
drink." kind of thing.
And that's kind of when the lightbulb went

01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:16.289
on.
"Oh, what happened here? Why didn't this value

01:09:16.289 --> 01:09:17.289
get passed on to my mom or to me?" And that's
when I started doing my research into this

01:09:17.289 --> 01:09:18.289
and discovered, "Wow, this is really uncharted
water.

01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:19.289
Nobody's discovered this question.
No one has explained the question or written

01:09:19.289 --> 01:09:20.289
a book about this."
You know how we went from this country that

01:09:20.289 --> 01:09:21.289
stigmatized alcohol to where we are now.
So, in a nutshell, that's kind of it.

01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:22.289
Six years ago.
Next book won't take as long.

01:09:22.289 --> 01:09:23.289
But first time author, you got to figure out
what the process is and there's no one to

01:09:23.289 --> 01:09:24.289
coach you.
You got to kind of make your own mistakes.

01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:25.289
So I'm thinking about calling the next book,
"Throwing spaghetti at a wall."

01:09:25.289 --> 01:09:26.289
That's what it feels like. You just trial
and error.

01:09:26.289 --> 01:09:27.289
Some things work and some things don't.
You just get up and try something else different.

01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:28.289
So I know, within Google, I've heard a lot
of people say that there's a big culture of,

01:09:28.289 --> 01:09:29.289
you know, "if you're not failing, well you're
not trying hard enough."

01:09:29.289 --> 01:09:30.289
And I think the same thing is true for being
an author, especially a first time author.

01:09:30.289 --> 01:09:31.289
You've got to be willing to fail. It's okay.
You know, you'll pick yourself back up and

01:09:31.289 --> 01:09:32.289
you'll try something else.
You know, like they're trying to find -- to

01:09:32.289 --> 01:09:33.289
sell -- a book to an agent or to a publisher
or even doing auto commercial events like

01:09:33.289 --> 01:09:34.289
I'm doing right now.
Some events are blockbuster.

01:09:34.289 --> 01:09:35.289
Sometimes you get four people show up.
And a lot of events are kind of in between.

01:09:35.289 --> 01:09:36.289
So I think every event has a little bit of
a sacrifice or RBI element to it.

01:09:36.289 --> 01:09:37.289
As long as you're selling books, it's okay,
you know?

01:09:37.289 --> 01:09:38.289
It's okay to not have a huge audience or anything.
You had a question.

01:09:38.289 --> 01:09:39.289
Q Yeah, I was going to ask what your thoughts
are on the parallel between alcohol prohibition

01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:40.289
and marijuana prohibition currently?

01:09:40.289 --> 01:09:41.289
Garrett Peck: Good question. Everyone asks
this question here.

01:09:41.289 --> 01:09:42.289
He had asked here about the prohibition against
alcohol vs. the drug wars.

01:09:42.289 --> 01:09:43.289
And I do actually cut that at all in the book
itself, but it's a very timely question.

01:09:43.289 --> 01:09:44.289
I think it's fascinating to point out the
parallel or nonparallel between Prohibition

01:09:44.289 --> 01:09:45.289
and the drug wars of today.
Even during Prohibition, and by the way I

01:09:45.289 --> 01:09:46.289
think largely Prohibition and the drug wars
are largely about enforcement, right?

01:09:46.289 --> 01:09:47.289
It's about trying to keep people from getting
a hold of products.

01:09:47.289 --> 01:09:48.289
But never deals with the ultimate question
of market size -- the demand side of the equation,

01:09:48.289 --> 01:09:49.289
"Why do people want to drink? Why do people
want to get high?"

01:09:49.289 --> 01:09:50.289
And ultimately I think, if people want to
do it, they're going to do it.

01:09:50.289 --> 01:09:51.289
That's my fundamental conclusion.
Even during Prohibition itself -- this is

01:09:51.289 --> 01:09:52.289
really kind of shocking -- personal possession
of alcohol was never illegal.

01:09:52.289 --> 01:09:53.289
You could always have it in your home.
You can make your own wine back during Prohibition,

01:09:53.289 --> 01:09:54.289
and many people did.
All the 18th Amendment did was outlaw the

01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:55.289
manufacture, sale, and transportation of alcohol,
but the temperance movement -- at least give

01:09:55.289 --> 01:09:56.289
them some credit -- they realized, "Okay,
people still want a certain amount of freedom

01:09:56.289 --> 01:09:57.289
still to drink in their own homes.
Therefore it's not illegal to actually possess

01:09:57.289 --> 01:09:58.289
this stuff."
You look at kind of the non-parallels to the

01:09:58.289 --> 01:09:59.289
drug wars today where we've criminalized even
the possession.

01:09:59.289 --> 01:10:00.289
So hence, we've filled our prisons full of
people who are largely low-level drug offenders.

01:10:00.289 --> 01:10:01.289
You know?
Most of these people are not druglords and

01:10:01.289 --> 01:10:02.289
stuff.
They're simply people who got caught a couple

01:10:02.289 --> 01:10:03.289
of times smoking marijuana or whatever.
And is that the best policy, because incarcerating

01:10:03.289 --> 01:10:04.289
people is horribly expensive?
And does it ever actually deal with the demand

01:10:04.289 --> 01:10:05.289
side of the equation?
When you can deal with it through education,

01:10:05.289 --> 01:10:06.289
with treatment, or ultimately with licensing
it, you know?

01:10:06.289 --> 01:10:07.289
A lot of people I know are getting more and
more towards that point, especially, I think

01:10:07.289 --> 01:10:08.289
my generation.
Generation X -- we're kind of libertarians.

01:10:08.289 --> 01:10:09.289
And people are sort of like, "Hmm. Shouldn't
gay marriage be legal?

01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:10.289
Shouldn't alcohol be legal? Shouldn't marijuana
be legal?"

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:11.289
People have really changed their mindsets
significantly.

01:10:11.289 --> 01:10:12.289
A lot of these social questions now in American
society.

01:10:12.289 --> 01:10:13.289
So. Yeah, it's definitely a relevant question
here.

01:10:13.289 --> 01:10:14.289
And I think we'll see where that goes over
the next few years.

01:10:14.289 --> 01:10:15.289
Especially as more and more states adopt medical
marijuana for use and more and more people

01:10:15.289 --> 01:10:16.289
are finding -- kind of coming out as occasional
tokers, you know?

01:10:16.289 --> 01:10:17.289
Q Just one more quick question.
Have you ever -- going off that -- maybe drawn

01:10:17.289 --> 01:10:18.289
the parallel to the movement of staying a
little more strong to restrict soda and other

01:10:18.289 --> 01:10:19.289
sugary beverages?
If you think about that new advertising campaign

01:10:19.289 --> 01:10:20.289
in university where it shows them pouring
soda and just how much fat and to not drink

01:10:20.289 --> 01:10:21.289
soda?
Do you kind of have the same opinion about

01:10:21.289 --> 01:10:22.289
the demand side of something like that?

01:10:22.289 --> 01:10:23.289
Garrett Peck: I don't really examine that
question myself.

01:10:23.289 --> 01:10:24.289
I think certainly soda is probably one of
the reasons -- among other reasons -- why

01:10:24.289 --> 01:10:25.289
Americans are facing the obesity epidemic
in the country.

01:10:25.289 --> 01:10:26.289
And I think obesity is in fact our biggest
by far -- no pun intended -- public health

01:10:26.289 --> 01:10:27.289
issue now.
You know Americans -- our portion sizes are

01:10:27.289 --> 01:10:28.289
out of control.
Americans drive everywhere now.

01:10:28.289 --> 01:10:29.289
We don't exercise when we go to and from work.
And we also have desks now.

01:10:29.289 --> 01:10:30.289
So just it's a huge lifestyle question I think
ultimately, but soda is certainly a part of

01:10:30.289 --> 01:10:31.289
it.
I haven't really myself examined the question

01:10:31.289 --> 01:10:32.289
of whether or not we should ban sodas in school
or not.

01:10:32.289 --> 01:10:33.289
Actually, I personally stopped drinking sodas
over a decade ago.

01:10:33.289 --> 01:10:34.289
But just more because I would get a big sugar
rush and then I would just collapse.

01:10:34.289 --> 01:10:35.289
So I decided, "Okay, I'm not going to drink
that anymore. I'll just drink good whiskey."

01:10:35.289 --> 01:10:36.289
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

01:10:36.289 --> 01:10:37.289
Q I have one more question.
You mentioned that women didn't really start

01:10:37.289 --> 01:10:38.289
drinking until the 20's.
I guess if you look back at the century preceeding

01:10:38.289 --> 01:10:39.289
that -- the 1800s -- was it still predominantly
men that drank?

01:10:39.289 --> 01:10:40.289
I mean the rank and file -- did women really
not drink first couple hundred years of this

01:10:40.289 --> 01:10:41.289
country, or?

01:10:41.289 --> 01:10:42.289
Garrett Peck: Yeah, the question was about
women and drinking and women didn't really

01:10:42.289 --> 01:10:43.289
start drinking until the 1920's in American
society.

01:10:43.289 --> 01:10:44.289
But what was the role of women before then.
Did women in fact drink?

01:10:44.289 --> 01:10:45.289
I think some women certainly did drink.
But largely, drinking was the purview of men,

01:10:45.289 --> 01:10:46.289
because men, at that point, went to the saloon
or the tavern.

01:10:46.289 --> 01:10:47.289
So they'd go outside of the house.
And you know, where the temperance movement

01:10:47.289 --> 01:10:48.289
came from was this church-based response to
the binge drinking that was going on.

01:10:48.289 --> 01:10:49.289
And if you look at it per capita, at the peak
of the binge -- which was about 1820, 1830

01:10:49.289 --> 01:10:50.289
 -- when there was no tax on whiskey at all
and it was everywhere, the actual per capita

01:10:50.289 --> 01:10:51.289
amount of alcohol -- if you looked at just
the men who were drinking at the time -- it

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:52.289
was about eight times what we are drinking
per capita today.

01:10:52.289 --> 01:10:53.289
I mean, a huge social issue; men were drinking
themselves to death.

01:10:53.289 --> 01:10:54.289
And yes, it was largely men, because they
were the ones who would go out to the saloons

01:10:54.289 --> 01:10:55.289
and taverns and women weren't welcome in taverns.
You might have even seen at some places like,

01:10:55.289 --> 01:10:56.289
if you ever go to San Francisco, go to Elixir;
it's in the Mission District.

01:10:56.289 --> 01:10:57.289
I gave a talk there last week.
And they had a separate entrance for women

01:10:57.289 --> 01:10:58.289
only.
I think it's the second oldest saloon in the

01:10:58.289 --> 01:10:59.289
city, 1850's sometime.
Because wives were allowed to go in there

01:10:59.289 --> 01:11:00.289
with a growler.
Today there's a bottle called the growler.

01:11:00.289 --> 01:11:01.289
It's a big four pints.
But back then a growler was a bucket.

01:11:01.289 --> 01:11:02.289
And the wives or kids would be sent to basically
the service entrance of the bar and if you

01:11:02.289 --> 01:11:03.289
go use this one entrance -- because women
weren't allowed inside the bar -- they would

01:11:03.289 --> 01:11:04.289
fill up the growler and that was for home
consumption.

01:11:04.289 --> 01:11:05.289
They would take it home for their husbands.
So that was the only way women could in fact

01:11:05.289 --> 01:11:06.289
go inside of a bar, you know?
Including at that bar Elixir.

01:11:06.289 --> 01:11:07.289
New York City there was a very famous bar
out there called McSorley's, in the 1850's

01:11:07.289 --> 01:11:08.289
Irish bar.
And women weren't allowed in there until around

01:11:08.289 --> 01:11:09.289
1970 or so.
So yeah. Need to cut off?

01:11:09.289 --> 01:11:10.289
So thanks so much for your time here today.
I really appreciate your time here everybody,

01:11:10.289 --> 01:11:11.289
and hope that that talk was worthwhile and
hopefully it was fun.

01:11:11.289 --> 01:11:11.290
&gt;&gt; [clapping]
