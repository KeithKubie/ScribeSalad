00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.410
Since we've been coding for

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.040
a while now, I wanted to pause to
check back in with Roman Nurik at our

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.064
Design Center in New York City
to talk a bit more about design.

00:00:08.064 --> 00:00:13.109
[SOUND] Roman, once again,
thanks for your time.

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.099
Do you think that every mobile app
developer should strive to become

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.679
a designer?

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.400
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't think it's
necessarily important for

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.330
every developer to become a designer,
and stop doing their engineering work.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.030
I do think, though,
that every developer,

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.070
every front end developer,
should have some sense of design.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.210
And I also think that, really,
as a mobile developer,

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.110
you're already doing design work, right?

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.780
Whether you like it or
not, you are creating,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.430
you're crafting the experience for
the end-user.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.900
And so what I think is important is
just knowing that this is something that

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.260
you're participating in.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.330
This is not something that
is being handed to you, and

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.330
you're just executing on.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.170
Knowing that this is something you're
participating in, I think it's super

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.030
important for developers to
really kind of study up on it.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.950
To get as good as possible at
observing the differences,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.660
observing the little details and really
kind of caring about every little,

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.430
I hate saying every little pixel, but
every little decision here and there.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.610
And so I think rather than saying every
developer should become a designer,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.150
I think every developer should
really understand design.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.650
Always understanding also that you're
going to be working in a team, and

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.955
kind of understanding what your
designers are good at and so forth.

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:31.200
So, yes.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.170
[LAUGH]
In short.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.150
&gt;&gt; For me, that's super interesting.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.940
And you can definitely see how we're
using material in our cross platform

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.350
experiences here at Google.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.110
While being true, in many ways,
to the unique element of each platform.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.320
Design has become so much more important
in building applications of all sorts.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.080
And I think it's really important for
every engineer to at least be familiar

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.370
with the palliative options available
to them and to their designers.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.300
To that end, Roman Nurik,
Nick Butcher, and James Williams,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.860
are developing a terrific
course in material design,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.650
that any front end engineer
should experience.
