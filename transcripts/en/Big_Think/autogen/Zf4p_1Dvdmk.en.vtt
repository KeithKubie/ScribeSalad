particular there's something that
 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.150

it could be as simple as a tool that

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529
it could be as simple as a tool that
 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.339
it could be as simple as a tool that
doesn't work very well and you modify it

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
doesn't work very well and you modify it
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.240
doesn't work very well and you modify it
so it works better there is a sort of a

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
so it works better there is a sort of a
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.780
so it works better there is a sort of a
drive to make incremental improvements

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
drive to make incremental improvements
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.510
drive to make incremental improvements
and it could be you know you really hate

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
and it could be you know you really hate
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.580
and it could be you know you really hate
the way your parents behave toward you

so when you have kids you're going to do

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
so when you have kids you're going to do
 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.240
so when you have kids you're going to do
it a different way and maybe it's better

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
it a different way and maybe it's better
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.549
it a different way and maybe it's better
maybe it's worse and your kids then do

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
maybe it's worse and your kids then do
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.850
maybe it's worse and your kids then do
it a different way and and it can be as

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
it a different way and and it can be as

oh well this is how we'd like to improve

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899
oh well this is how we'd like to improve
 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.810
oh well this is how we'd like to improve
it and I think that's a process that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
it and I think that's a process that
 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.749
it and I think that's a process that
does far beyond artifacts it is how we

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759
does far beyond artifacts it is how we
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.580
does far beyond artifacts it is how we
get technological improvements but it's

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
get technological improvements but it's
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.910
get technological improvements but it's
not the only way um so that's that that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
not the only way um so that's that that
 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440
not the only way um so that's that that

everything of you know how we built all
 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.459
everything of you know how we built all
these but that's a lot of it I think

had this notion that that's where a lot

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170
had this notion that that's where a lot
 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.020
had this notion that that's where a lot
of creativity takes place and I think

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030
of creativity takes place and I think
 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.539
of creativity takes place and I think
that a lot of the creative power of
