TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:04.083
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:04.083 --> 00:00:06.150
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.700
Actions on Google has a
new directory, more device

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.790
availability, and more control
of your home with Smart Home

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.930
control.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.990
Details and links are on the
post linked in the description

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.220
below.

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.440
PageSpeed Insights
provides information

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.010
about how well a page adheres
to a set of best practices.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.640
And now, it uses data from the
Chrome User Experience Report

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.770
to make better
recommendations for you,

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.159
and the optimization score has
been tuned to be more aligned

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.810
with the real world data.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.600
There are three new
tools to help further

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.350
improve your workflows and
manage Apps Script projects--

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.090
the Apps Script dashboard, Apps
Script API, and Apps Script

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.890
command line interface.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.540
Screenshots and more
are on the post.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.210
The Google Brain
Team works to advance

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.700
the state of the art in
artificial intelligence

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.580
with research and
systems engineering

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.660
as one part of the
overall Google AI effort.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.640
Check out these two
posts for some highlights

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.120
of their work in 2017, including
some of the basic research

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.660
work, updates on
open source software,

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.220
data sets, new hardware for
machine learning, health care,

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.160
robotics, and more.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.080
The container structure
test framework

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.910
provides a convenient
and powerful way

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.840
to verify the contents and
structure of your containers.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.700
We've been using this
framework at Google

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.010
to test all of our teams'
released containers

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.010
for over a year now, and we're
excited to finally share it

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.060
with you.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.880
