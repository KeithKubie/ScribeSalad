NAZMUL IDRIS: Welcome
to this episode of UXD,

00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:11.460
where we will show
you three steps

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.532
to make your mobile
applications awesome.

00:00:13.532 --> 00:00:15.990
In this episode, we're going
to be covering the first step.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.220
I'm your host, Nazmul
Idris, a developer advocate

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.130
on the Android team.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.354
And I have a very special
guest with me today.

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.770
PATRICK LARVIE:
Thank you, Nazmul.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.897
My name is Patrick Larvie.

00:00:23.897 --> 00:00:25.230
I'm a researcher here at Google.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.600
And I have a lot to
say about mobile.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.590
NAZMUL IDRIS: Ha.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.120
You've come to the right show.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.832
The first thing as
a developer that you

00:00:31.832 --> 00:00:33.790
need to understand about
delivering a good user

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.080
experience, that it's
always about the user

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.270
and never about
your application.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.560
So how many times have
you seen applications

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.630
demand to be updated?

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.010
Demand to be rated?

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.700
Demand new forms of payment?

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.420
And demand your attention
for a variety of reasons?

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.610
Now if you have a valid business
need to push out a new feature

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.234
or collect feedback from
users, you especially

00:00:53.234 --> 00:00:54.900
need to be mindful
of the demands you're

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.810
making on your user's attention.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.700
So Patrick, what
is the right way

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.800
to demand attention
from the user?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.910
PATRICK LARVIE: Well, this
is a really good question.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.010
And nothing substitutes
for a good subtle knowledge

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.614
about how users are
interacting with your apps.

00:01:11.614 --> 00:01:13.530
So if you haven't done
a little user research,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.090
I would suggest
that you go do some

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060
before you tackle the step.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.260
But I think, first
of all there's

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.130
a distinction that we
really need to make.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.880
There are times
when you absolutely

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.779
need your user's attention.

00:01:25.779 --> 00:01:26.820
Maybe you have an update.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.528
Maybe there's something
that's absolutely

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:30.310
critical about continued
use of the app.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.812
You need their attention.

00:01:31.812 --> 00:01:33.270
There are other
times when you just

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.820
want your user's attention.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.960
It's really important to
distinguish these two.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.270
Because you don't want
to wear out your welcome.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.120
You don't want to be that
app that's constantly

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.330
making demands on your user,
whether you need it or you just

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.010
want it.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.301
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.340
PATRICK LARVIE: Think about it.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.430
If your app-- it's
just like the story

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.860
of the boy who cried wolf.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.810
If you have an app
and you're constantly

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.610
alerting your user
about things like,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.370
were you aware of
this new feature?

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.610
Are you aware that we
have a new payment option?

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.317
Are you aware that we have
some new colors for your fonts?

00:02:12.317 --> 00:02:13.150
NAZMUL IDRIS: Right.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.510
PATRICK LARVIE: The time when
you need that user's attention

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.343
because there's an
update, there's a mission

00:02:17.343 --> 00:02:19.630
critical update, that user
is going to ignore you.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.940
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.006
So what are some
things that developers

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:24.380
need to keep in
mind when they're

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.900
asking their users
to pay attention?

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.600
PATRICK LARVIE:
Well, first of all,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.070
let's share some examples
about wanting versus needing.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.520
And I think the first thing
is it's really important

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.904
to imagine that your
app doesn't just

00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:39.070
rely on the phone's battery.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.739
It doesn't just rely on
the network connection.

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.280
It doesn't just rely
on the computing

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.090
capacity of that device.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.420
It also relies on
another finite resource,

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.840
which is your user's attention.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.870
Let's say that the app has
just gone through an update.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.160
And that update is
available to be released.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.950
Let's say, in fact, that you
the most awesome pizza ordering

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.420
app in the world.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.560
I am a big fan of
that pizza app,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.860
because that delivers the
best pizza every time.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.940
Think about this.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.140
If you have an update,
it's something critical.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.820
Let's say that you're going
to release a new feature that

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.640
allows the use of text message
to communicate between driver

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.075
and the person ordering
the pizza in order

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:22.320
to make sure that
delivery occurs on time.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.390
But this requires a new
consent from the user

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.490
because the user has to say
yes, I give you consent.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.500
I consent to the use of
the text messaging app.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.750
Think about this.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.450
When is the best time to direct
that user to the Play Store

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.530
to update that app and
to provide a new consent?

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.100
Is it when they're
ordering pizza?

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.460
NAZMUL IDRIS: Probably not.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.110
PATRICK LARVIE: Probably not.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.690
The goal here is to turn a
demand-- I must have consent

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.742
in order to roll out this new
feature-- into an invitation.

00:03:52.742 --> 00:03:54.200
NAZMUL IDRIS: No,
that makes sense.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.800
That makes sense.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.280
So you might want
to provide users

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.220
that have older versions
of your application

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.404
with a message inside
of the application that

00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:05.320
tells them there's a new
version that's coming

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.880
and what benefits they're
going to get when they upgrade.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.110
Like in this case,
the SMS feature.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.980
So another thing you might do
is that if you have their email

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.180
address, you might
consider sending them

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.779
a short targeted message.

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:18.160
And again, only
to folks that are

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.225
using the old versions
of your application.

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:22.600
Again, to give them a reason
for why they need to upgrade

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.975
and the benefits they're going
to have when they actually

00:04:24.975 --> 00:04:26.110
perform the upgrade.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.400
PATRICK LARVIE: That's right.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.090
You want to avoid the situation
where the person discovers

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.241
a need for a critical update
at the moment when I'm really,

00:04:33.241 --> 00:04:34.740
really hungry and
I want that pizza.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.560
That's not the moment.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.460
Another limited resource
to take into consideration.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.380
As we all know, mobile devices
can only operate for so long

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.990
before they need
to be recharged.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.600
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.933
PATRICK LARVIE: Again, we
think of this as a constraint.

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:49.610
But I think app
developers should

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.006
think of this as an opportunity.

00:04:51.006 --> 00:04:52.880
Because this provides
you with an opportunity

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.990
to delight your user.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.300
And it's an opportunity
to think about how

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.480
awareness of the
phone's limitations

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.806
can be a way that you
can work with your user,

00:05:03.806 --> 00:05:05.430
rather than against
your user's device.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:06.721
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:05:06.721 --> 00:05:08.414
And again, speaking
of finite resources,

00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:09.830
battery power is
not the only one.

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.288
But there's also
network bandwidth.

00:05:11.288 --> 00:05:12.840
There's network availability.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.340
The amount of memory in the
machine, CPU utilization.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.870
And also outside of the
machine, the user's attention.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:21.480
PATRICK LARVIE: That's right.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.420
I think it's really important to
be aware of the device's state

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.570
at moments when this is
critical to your app.

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:31.100
For example, let's say you are
an app developer with the most

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.140
awesome cat video app ever.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.280
You know that your user is
queuing up some awesome cat

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.280
apps to watch.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.010
But you're also aware that
user's battery is down

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.877
to about 20%.

00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:44.210
This is actually an opportunity.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.930
It sounds like this is going
to be a disaster for your app,

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:46.780
right?

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.630
No.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.140
This is a moment when you
might engage your user in say,

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.840
you know, at the current
rate you're going,

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.390
this is only going to go
on for about five minutes.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:00.190
Might we switch to
a lower resolution?

00:06:00.190 --> 00:06:02.140
Might we queue this for later?

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:04.500
There are lots of ways
that the app developer can

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.170
say, all right, I'm aware of
the limitation of this device.

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.420
I'm going to turn this into
an opportunity for my user

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.190
to reengage rather than
being the app that's

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.190
on when the device crashes.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.660
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.700
And as we know, the
internet was invented

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.657
to share cat
pictures and videos.

00:06:20.657 --> 00:06:21.490
PATRICK LARVIE: Yes.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:24.547
NAZMUL IDRIS: So now in addition
to battery, another thing--

00:06:24.547 --> 00:06:26.380
actually, while we're
talking about battery.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.940
One of the biggest drains
on batteries is GPS.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.270
And I think it's important
for developers to keep in mind

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.270
when they should ask for
high resolution readings that

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.520
consume a lot of battery
life versus when they can do

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.520
with coarse readings that don't
require a lot of battery life.

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.870
So for example, in that
pizza ordering application

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.120
you mentioned, it
might be appropriate

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.780
at different moments in
time in the user interaction

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.920
for that pizza
ordering application

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.560
to ask for really
high resolution,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.130
location information
from the GPS.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.630
Which might drain
battery, but it'll

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:00.970
be for a short period of time.

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.570
But for 90% of the
time or even longer

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.370
when the application
is just sitting,

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:07.720
and you haven't ordered a pizza.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.720
There is absolutely no
reason for that thing

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.940
to constantly ask for
high resolution location

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.590
updates, which will
actually drain battery.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.050
PATRICK LARVIE: That's
absolutely right.

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.760
Again, you don't want to be
the app that users remember

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.010
as the one that crashed
their device, as the one that

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:27.710
drained their memory.

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:30.882
And what Nazmul is saying
makes absolute sense.

00:07:30.882 --> 00:07:32.340
Nothing irritates
me more than when

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.905
I see my GPS turn on for
absolutely no reason when

00:07:34.905 --> 00:07:36.592
I have 5% battery left.

00:07:36.592 --> 00:07:37.870
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:39.292
PATRICK LARVIE:
Remember, you want

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:41.250
to look for opportunities
to delight your user.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.170
You also want to look
for opportunities

00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:46.890
to avoid the situation where
your app is involved in a crash

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:48.850
or in a critical incident.

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.450
Because it doesn't matter if the
user was only watching your cat

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.896
video app for five minutes
before their device

00:07:54.896 --> 00:07:57.020
turned off because it didn't
have any more battery.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:57.370
NAZMUL IDRIS: Right.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.046
PATRICK LARVIE:
The user is going

00:07:58.046 --> 00:08:00.190
to remember that app
forever as the one that

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.090
drained my battery.

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:01.660
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:03.820
And even if it was, let's say,
that pizza ordering application

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:04.710
that was at fault.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.880
But because the user perceived
that the cat video application

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.450
was the one that was running
when the battery went down,

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.060
that's all they're
going to associate

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:14.260
with that negative event.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.860
And negative events
stick with us

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.520
much more than positive events.

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.680
PATRICK LARVIE: That's right.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.110
Here's a slightly different
take on this topic.

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.860
There are times--
and this is a want.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.470
There are times when you want
to get feedback from your users

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:30.803
on how they like your app,
or how the app is performing,

00:08:30.803 --> 00:08:35.070
or things that they think your
app could do to be better.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.669
Resist the temptation to
ask your user to rate,

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:41.270
share, like, or
otherwise comment

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.190
on the app at critical moments.

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:45.430
Let's go back to the
pizza app for a moment.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.120
Let's say that you know
that that user habitually

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.780
selects pizzas, orders pizzas,
chooses favorite pizzas,

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.510
and has them delivered.

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.880
What's the right time,
what's the seducible moment

00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.221
in the usage life cycle
to reach out to that user?

00:09:01.221 --> 00:09:02.720
Is it while he's
ordering the pizza?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.530
Is it while he's waiting for
that pizza to be delivered?

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:07.160
Is it while he's
eating the pizza?

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.420
No.

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.110
This is, again, an
opportunity to turn

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.640
a demand-- you
need good ratings.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.630
You need feedback.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.790
But you want to turn that
demand into an invitation.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:20.400
You know when that
pizza was delivered.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:24.920
I would say starting about 60
minutes post-delivery, that

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.170
might be a decent time to ask.

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.290
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.790
So in addition to the three
issues we talked about, here

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.870
are some more best practices
for developers to think about

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.610
when they're actually
building their applications.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:37.940
So coming back to
this issue of updates.

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.050
Let's say that you have
updated your application,

00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.620
like that pizza ordering app,
and you more permissions.

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:46.020
But also as you've
updated the new version,

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:48.310
there's some changes you've
made to the back end.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:52.120
And you need to basically move
users off of the old back end

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.390
into the new back end.

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.030
So it's critical
in this situation

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.280
to actually make sure
everybody has migrated first

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.540
before you turn off the old web
services that you have running.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:05.124
And that is actually something
developers, or some application

00:10:05.124 --> 00:10:06.623
developers, don't
take into account,

00:10:06.623 --> 00:10:08.630
which leads to a pretty
bad user experience.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:11.580
So when users of the
older applications

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:13.070
go to actually run
them, they just

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:15.580
stop working, which
is pretty awful.

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:19.040
And so you have to keep in mind
that it takes time for updates

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.210
to reach all the users
of your application.

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:23.250
So make sure that
you're checking

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:26.840
to see how many times your old
web services are being used,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.749
and so on, before you actually
decided to turn them off.

00:10:30.749 --> 00:10:32.290
So another thing
you might want to do

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.000
if it's a really
critical upgrade

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.630
and you can't really
wait, consider actually

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:39.000
giving them an
explicit notification.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.510
And this way, at the very
least, when they need it,

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.749
they won't be surprised that
it's not working anymore,

00:10:45.749 --> 00:10:47.290
because you've
actually done the work

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:50.070
and you've actually
notified them ahead of time

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.050
that they do need to
perform this update.

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.710
PATRICK LARVIE: And this
is also an important topic

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:59.330
for developers to remember,
because notifications

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:00.420
can be super helpful.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.270
There are lots of opportunities
to inform and to engage

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.950
your users through
notifications.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.600
But it's equally
important that you

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.130
don't have to turn everything
into a notification.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:13.061
So let's say you've
done your research.

00:11:13.061 --> 00:11:14.560
You know how your
users are engaging

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.100
with your pizza delivery app.

00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:19.680
And you know how to time that.

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.840
There are good ways
and less good ways

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:27.380
to reach out for the rating
or for some feedback.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.320
You know that you've done it.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.390
The users had the pizza, and
the pizza's been delivered.

00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:33.790
It's about 60 minutes.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.270
That's the right time
to reach out to them.

00:11:36.270 --> 00:11:38.690
That may also be the
right time to give them

00:11:38.690 --> 00:11:41.430
other notifications
related to, for example,

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.620
changes in payment.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.510
It might be an opportunity
for other kinds

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:48.350
of noncritical-- changes
in payment options, changes

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.484
in selection of pizzas.

00:11:50.484 --> 00:11:51.900
Other kinds of
noncritical things,

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:54.310
you might consider batching
these intelligently

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:57.200
and delivering them at a time
you know that the user is

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.810
in a state of mind to
pay attention to them.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.160
NAZMUL IDRIS: That
makes a lot of sense.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.670
So I guess the most
important thing

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.762
is that the timing is critical
and that understanding

00:12:07.762 --> 00:12:09.470
the difference between
what is engagement

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:11.350
and what is an interruption.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:16.670
So like in this situation,
if for example, I

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:21.240
need to rate my pizza,
like how the delivery was.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.280
It's not that the
feature is a bad thing.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:24.590
I do need that feedback.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.830
But the presentation
and the timing

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.540
of when that feature is
surfaced in the user experience

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.620
determines whether the user
actually is delighted by it

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.474
or is actually is
somewhat annoyed by it.

00:12:35.474 --> 00:12:36.390
PATRICK LARVIE: Right.

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.000
We can take an example
of a notification that

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.310
can be either an interruption
or an opportunity

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.830
to engage depending
on its timing.

00:12:44.830 --> 00:12:45.824
Pizza app.

00:12:45.824 --> 00:12:47.240
Let's say something
fundamental is

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.448
changing with that pizza app.

00:12:48.448 --> 00:12:50.950
It's going to use text messages
to help locate where I am

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:52.490
and to communicate
with the driver.

00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:54.190
This is a fundamental
feature change.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:55.850
It requires the consent.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:58.090
If I receive an
email about that,

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.550
and I know that before I
go to order my next pizza,

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:03.810
that's an opportunity to
engage your user and say,

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.930
hey, I know why you're
asking for consent.

00:13:06.930 --> 00:13:08.621
I know that this benefits me.

00:13:08.621 --> 00:13:09.120
Awesome.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.820
I can't wait to
order another pizza.

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.020
If I find out that I
have to update the app

00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:16.180
and provide consent as
I'm ordering a pizza,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.847
that's now an interruption.

00:13:17.847 --> 00:13:18.805
Very same notification.

00:13:21.336 --> 00:13:22.710
Context determines
whether that's

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.750
an interruption or an
invitation to engage.

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.375
NAZMUL IDRIS: That
makes perfect sense.

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:29.120
So again, as a developer
then, it's critical for us

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.020
to stop blowing fog
horns in the user's face

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.082
for every single event
that might happen.

00:13:35.082 --> 00:13:36.540
I've seen this in
some applications

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.102
where notifications are used
as a way to debug things.

00:13:40.102 --> 00:13:41.810
Which is obviously a
very negative thing.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.280
And I've also seen persistent
notifications, for example

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.990
in Android, used
to basically notify

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.870
the user that an
application is running

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.070
or something is connected.

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:51.960
Those are really bad and
they need to go away, right?

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.168
PATRICK LARVIE: That's right.

00:13:53.168 --> 00:13:56.170
So back to the story about
the little boy who cried wolf.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:58.760
Or Chicken Little who's telling
you that the sky is falling.

00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.360
If I see that I have a
persistent notification

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.599
from your app, I'm going to
think this app is telling me

00:14:04.599 --> 00:14:05.390
the sky is falling.

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.390
I'll fall for it once.

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:07.950
Maybe I fall for it twice.

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:09.840
I will not ever
attend to that again.

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.240
And the time when you
have something really,

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.700
really critical that
you need to tell me,

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.991
I'm not going to pay attention.

00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:15.750
NAZMUL IDRIS: That makes sense.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.840
PATRICK LARVIE: So batching
them intelligently.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.470
Finding the right moment in
the cycle of product usage

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.770
to reach your user when that
user is likely open and able

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:25.840
to react.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.120
These are critical aspects
of mobile user experience.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:28.911
NAZMUL IDRIS: Yeah.

00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:30.360
I think the batching
notifications

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.150
is kind of like a
subtle distinction

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:34.990
where let's say that you have
determined there is a good case

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.175
to notify user.

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:37.050
For example in Gmail.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:37.630
I have an email.

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:38.980
I need to know that
I have an email.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.790
But let's say I've
received five emails.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.164
It would get really
annoying if I

00:14:42.164 --> 00:14:46.480
would get five individual
notifications for five

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.214
different emails from Gmail.

00:14:48.214 --> 00:14:49.630
So what Gmail does
is really nice,

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:52.450
which is it actually
consolidates those five

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.700
emails into one notification.

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:56.803
And it says, hey you
have five emails waiting.

00:14:56.803 --> 00:14:58.386
And it does so for
different accounts.

00:14:58.386 --> 00:14:59.261
PATRICK LARVIE: Yeah.

00:14:59.261 --> 00:15:02.080
I know that the people watching
this have had this experience.

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:05.360
I order from a service that
offers two-day delivery.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.420
And that service,
which a lot of you use,

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:12.020
tells me at every step of the
way about each of the items.

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:14.110
I don't really want to
know unless, A, there's

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:16.670
a problem, or B, it's
about to arrive at my door.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:19.480
This is a great
opportunity to batch.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.480
You want to be the
notification-- your app wants

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.760
to be the notification that
I receive just before I'm

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.150
delighted because
I've opened my package

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.150
and I got what I wanted.

00:15:26.150 --> 00:15:27.516
NAZMUL IDRIS: Exactly.

00:15:27.516 --> 00:15:29.890
PATRICK LARVIE: I think there's
another opportunity here,

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.550
thinking about
batching and timing.

00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:35.760
And I like to think of this
as think before you sync.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.270
There's nothing more irritating
to make than when I'm-- again,

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.020
I'm on the bus.

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.145
I'm usually on my way home.

00:15:41.145 --> 00:15:43.070
I've got about 20%
battery on my phone.

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.260
And all of a sudden, all
of my apps starts syncing.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:47.594
I can see the battery declining.

00:15:47.594 --> 00:15:49.968
I know that I'm not going to
be able to send another text

00:15:49.968 --> 00:15:50.510
message.

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.510
Don't be that app.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:58.010
The opportunity here is to use
the available data, the data

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:00.970
that's available to your app,
to know a little bit about what

00:16:00.970 --> 00:16:04.230
your user's patterns
of activity are.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:07.230
By using what we think of
as attention profiling,

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:09.380
you can change how your
notifications occur

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:12.140
and how certain
kinds of activities

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.752
are batched and carried out.

00:16:14.752 --> 00:16:16.210
NAZMUL IDRIS: No,
that makes sense.

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:19.350
So now this data, this
attention profiling data,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:21.060
it can be collected
in a variety of ways.

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:25.620
Like we could actually have
analytics running or actually

00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:28.800
pieces of code that are
basically generating

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.860
analytics data, that are running
on the device that then send

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:35.330
all this information to the
server where it's stored,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:37.060
deeper analytics can be run.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:39.280
And then patterns
can be predicted

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.040
that actually notify the
application about how

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.000
a user actually
interacts with it.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.820
Now, this data can then
be used to determine

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:48.780
when scheduling
operations should happen

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.060
between the application
running on the device

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.980
and whatever back end
it's connecting to, right?

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.100
Now alternatively,
if developers don't

00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:59.060
have such sophisticated
ways to make this happen,

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.960
there's a simpler solution.

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.480
Which is let's say you have
an RSS reader application.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.460
And you have like hundreds of
feeds that you subscribe to.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.859
It would be appropriate for
that application to ask you

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:12.829
when you first run it, how
often do you want it to update?

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:14.839
Do you want it to happen
for every single change

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:15.520
in your feeds?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.849
Do you want it to happen once a
day, twice a day, once a week,

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:18.348
and so on.

00:17:18.348 --> 00:17:21.480
So there's high tech solutions
to this and low tech solutions.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.004
But the important thing is to
set the appropriate expectation

00:17:25.004 --> 00:17:27.520
and also determine
like, for example,

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.750
what the user's expecting so
that you don't disappoint them.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:34.200
Even with these constrained
resources that we have.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.960
So now, let's say
that you do collect

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:40.180
a lot of really high quality
attention profiling data.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:44.760
You can also consider
providing this information

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:49.120
to all the connected
devices that the user has.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.510
So that means that if you
have a signed-in experience,

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.630
you can actually take
advantage of the fact

00:17:53.630 --> 00:17:57.390
that you know something
about how your user is using

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:00.180
their particular devices or
applications on their device.

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:03.760
And then you can use that
data to drive the experience

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.520
on all the devices
they're signed into.

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.969
So for example with
signing in with Google,

00:18:09.969 --> 00:18:11.760
you can create a pizza
ordering application

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.430
that you run on your
phone and on your tablet.

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.990
And then depending on how you
use your tablet and your phone,

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:19.850
both those apps get smarter.

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:21.750
So that's something
which is, I think,

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:25.140
a really big opportunity that
developers can take advantage

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:25.640
of.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.350
And these analytics,
the analytics data

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:34.290
that can give you ideas of how
the user uses the device, when

00:18:34.290 --> 00:18:37.030
they use it, where they
are when they're using it,

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:38.740
can give you strong
signals about when

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.187
you need to sync information.

00:18:40.187 --> 00:18:41.770
When you need to
prefetch information.

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:43.990
When you think that you
should queue notifications.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:47.861
Let's say you are asleep
and if the device knew that,

00:18:47.861 --> 00:18:49.860
then perhaps it would not
send you notifications

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:50.885
while you're asleep, right?

00:18:50.885 --> 00:18:51.150
PATRICK LARVIE: I'd
appreciate that.

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:52.130
NAZMUL IDRIS: As
soon as you wake up.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.910
Yeah, exactly.

00:18:52.910 --> 00:18:56.470
So these kinds of things will
allow you to deliver delight

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:58.160
to users of your application.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.540
So that's all we have time
for in today's episode.

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:02.694
Stay tuned for the
next two, where

00:19:02.694 --> 00:19:04.110
we'll give you the
other two steps

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.785
in making your
applications awesome.

00:19:05.785 --> 00:19:07.280
And thank you so much, Patrick.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.070
PATRICK LARVIE: Thank you, and
thank you for your attention.
