years make a lot of money pay off their
 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040
years make a lot of money pay off their
debt and then find something that they

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050
debt and then find something that they

actually really hard to go from making

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330
actually really hard to go from making
 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.849
actually really hard to go from making
$200,000 a year to making $100,000 a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859
$200,000 a year to making $100,000 a
 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.470
$200,000 a year to making $100,000 a
year so they don't make the move out

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480
year so they don't make the move out
 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.549
year so they don't make the move out
once they've been in it for a couple

once they've been in it for a couple
years and suddenly they're locked in a

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:35.970
years and suddenly they're locked in a
 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.399

career that isn't really satisfying to

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:37.409
career that isn't really satisfying to
 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.700

them a big part of that is our fault the
 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.469
them a big part of that is our fault the
law schools fault because as I say we've

we've always done much too little to
 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.450
we've always done much too little to
really help them think about their

really help them think about their
 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.710
really help them think about their
choices while they're in school and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:48.720
choices while they're in school and
 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.090
choices while they're in school and
we've made it easy for them to just

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100
we've made it easy for them to just
 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.439
we've made it easy for them to just
follow this path so you know so we need

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449
follow this path so you know so we need
 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.930
follow this path so you know so we need
to reduce that I think we need to help

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940
to reduce that I think we need to help

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.509
school you know find their way to a
career within the law that will be

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519
career within the law that will be
 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.009
career within the law that will be
fulfilling and says it's not the

people in a big way so it's just a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280
people in a big way so it's just a
 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.010
people in a big way so it's just a
question of helping people find that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020

part of the legal profession that does

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400
part of the legal profession that does
 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.460
part of the legal profession that does
that for them and we haven't done enough

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
that for them and we haven't done enough
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.010
that for them and we haven't done enough
of that and I think too many people have

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
of that and I think too many people have
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.480
of that and I think too many people have
done too little now there's there's two

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490
done too little now there's there's two
 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.150
done too little now there's there's two
other aspects to this the one is for

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160
other aspects to this the one is for
 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.650
other aspects to this the one is for
what it's worth I think the reports are

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660
what it's worth I think the reports are
 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.380
what it's worth I think the reports are
somewhat exaggerated we've been doing

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390
somewhat exaggerated we've been doing
 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.000
somewhat exaggerated we've been doing
our own research on this and and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010
our own research on this and and
 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.620
our own research on this and and
actually there's a study that's just

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
actually there's a study that's just
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480
actually there's a study that's just
come out called after the JD and after

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490
come out called after the JD and after
 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.610
come out called after the JD and after
the JD - and the levels of satisfaction

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620
the JD - and the levels of satisfaction
 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.620
the JD - and the levels of satisfaction
among legal professionals are much

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630
among legal professionals are much
 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.899
among legal professionals are much
higher than a lot of the other studies

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909
higher than a lot of the other studies
 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.370
higher than a lot of the other studies
are anecdotal reports would have you

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380
are anecdotal reports would have you
 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.020
are anecdotal reports would have you
think they're still not as high as they

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030
think they're still not as high as they
 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.610
think they're still not as high as they
ought to be but it's I think not quite

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620
ought to be but it's I think not quite
 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.360
ought to be but it's I think not quite
as bad as conventional wisdom now holds

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370
as bad as conventional wisdom now holds
 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.730
as bad as conventional wisdom now holds
and then the second thing is you know

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
and then the second thing is you know
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.200
and then the second thing is you know
there's also a large amount of evidence

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210
there's also a large amount of evidence
 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.030
there's also a large amount of evidence
that suggests that if you can find a way

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
that suggests that if you can find a way
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.280
that suggests that if you can find a way
to make public service a part of your

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
