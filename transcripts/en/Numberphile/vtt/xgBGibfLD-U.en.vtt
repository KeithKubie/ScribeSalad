00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
[James]: Yeah this is really nice.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.040
We've talked before in a video about

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.149
Pandigital numbers. And a Pandigital number was

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.080
a number that used all the digits one

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.300
to nine. and we... [Brady]: What about zero?

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.309
[James]: It didn't always use zero, I think sometimes

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.880
we excluded 0 and sometimes we included 0

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.100
and you get different numbers with

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.689
different properties and we had

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.620
a nice time looking at Pandigital numbers

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.100
That was a bit of fun

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.720
[Brady]: Yeah, it is there. People can click on it.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.160
[James]: There?

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.400
[Brady]: Uh... Yeah! About there. Alright.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.860
[James]: Now I want to show you a Pandigital Formula

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.320
So it's gonna be a formula, that uses all the digits

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.809
1 to 9. And it's really nice actually

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:40.980
Let me right down the formula.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.730
(1+9 to the power, so I'm gonna use -4

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.399
the power 6 times 7 is all in the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.170
bracket ), and then I take that to a power

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.190
which is going to be 3 to the power 2 which

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.510
is to the power of 85. So this is the formula,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.739
So let's just check if it's a pandigital formula

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.539
let's check all the digits are there

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:10.590
We've got 123456789

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.140
Yes. I've used all the digits from 1 to 9.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.460
But what's so special about that formula?

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.540
It's really cute.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:28.619
This formula is equal to 2.718281828

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.460
459...

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.900
This formula is actually... e

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.630
It's approximately e. How approximately though?

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.220
How good is it?

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.810
This is correct to 18 trillion trillion (18 times 10^24)

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.720
digits, decimal places. [Brady]: NO! Go away!

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.750
[James]: Yeah, I know it's great. This lovely

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.220
little formula is incredibly accurate for e

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.920
[Brady]: How did that happen?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.940
[James]: It's beautiful! I was telling you how that happened.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.840
So this formula, it's not

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.070
not a very old one. It was found in 2004

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.649
by a guy called Richard Sabey, and he

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.989
did something very clever to get this

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.200
formula because the definition of e,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.620
It's the limit as n tends to infinity of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.280
1+ (1 over n), to the power n. Now,

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.319
he did something clever. He found a

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.629
number which I'm gonna capital N.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.249
And it's gonna be a big number. Actually I'm gonna let it

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:29.240
be this thing we've got here.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.510
This power. so he had a number 3 to the power

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.010
2 to the power 85 and he did this clever thing

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.560
I'm just going to mess around with this

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.629
a little bit, and I hope you're happy with

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:44.580
how powers work because I'm going to use

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.160
some properties of how powers work, and

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.750
this is what I'm going to do. I'm going

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.660
to take one of these- 85 here- and i'm

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.790
going to use it to square the 3. So it

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.690
becomes 9 now to the power 2 to power 84

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.630
and now i'm going to another clever

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.780
thing if you have you have powers work

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.420
this is also equal to 9. I'm going to

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.959
double the 2 there so it becomes a 4. And 84

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.019
gets halfed, so it becomes a 42 this is all

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.989
properties of powers and i'm going to

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.269
split up the 42. This becomes 9 to the power

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:23.100
4 to the power 6 times 7, 'cause that's 42.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.290
If I stick a minus sign in there, it will

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.190
become 1 over N. So, what it's got now is

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:35.130
a formula in this shape- 1 plus (1 over N)

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:40.109
to the power n- but this N is massive

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.260
this is a massive number, and it's so big

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.049
that makes it an incredibly accurate

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.459
approximation of e. It's not infinity, it's not

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.350
tending off to infinity and being e

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.989
exactly. It's big enough to make

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.130
something that is correct to 18 trillion

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.560
trillion digits. There was a challenge- it

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.000
some sort of challenge on the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.099
Internet- as a challenge you

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.480
think about this for the same

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.099
competition he actually came up with a

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.980
few formulas and he was going through

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.709
the classic mathematical constants so he

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.320
did e and e's the best one and I love e

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.340
so much. But he also did pi (π), and others.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.430
The π one, i'll show you- I don't like it

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.680
as much I don't think it's good but it's

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.790
clever that he's

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.590
done it with a pandigital formula, but

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.420
I'll show you why it's not so good

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.060
So he's got a formula for pi (π), and it's

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.490
going to be approximately equal to, and

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.910
this is it, it's going to be: 2 to the power 5 to the power .4

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:53.360
- .6, - and in brackets here, we got (.3 to the power 9

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.780
/ 7). And then take that bracket

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.340
we're going to take it to the power

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.580
.8, to the power .1

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.260
[Brady]: Yeah, lot's of points.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:10.020
[James]: Lot's of points, and instead of stepping 0.6

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.080
and 0.1 he's used . He's cheating

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.640
maybe I don't know by not using the

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.770
zeros, I'm not as satisfied with it.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.170
This is accurate to pi(π) up to 10 decimal

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:22.500
places. It's a lot less impressive

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.660
so you've got a pandigital formula for

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.020
pi(π), for 10 decimal places with a bit of a cheat

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.720
I don't know depends on how you feel

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:33.500
about that- using points instead of zero point something

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.960
I don't like that formula as much.

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:36.540
[OUTRO]

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.510
[James from "Pandigital Numbers"]: And then there's a number that can be

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.210
divided by 10 as well and that's also

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.130
unique so that would be a unique

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:51.680
pandigital number including 0
