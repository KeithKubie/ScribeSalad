00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.190
Two and a half years ago scientists used the
most complicated machine ever to solve one

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.710
of the greatest puzzles to vex the human race.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.519
And then they went, “Yeah but what if we
kicked it up a notch?”

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.600
Greetings atom smashers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.490
The Large Hardon Collider made headlines years
ago when it confirmed the existence of the

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.550
Higgs Boson.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.610
This was huge news in the world of particle
physics because the discovery solved a few

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.610
quarks....

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.610
I mean quirks.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.230
As we understand it, there are subatomic particles
that carry the fundamental forces (except

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.210
gravity, as far as we know) called bosons.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.180
In order for the math to work, these bosons
should be massless.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.410
And yet we actually observed some of them
and found that certain kinds of bosons did

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.870
indeed have mass.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.770
To solve the problem it was proposed by Peter
Higgs and other researchers in the 60’s

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.750
that a field existed everywhere all the time,
and moving through this field gave bosons

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.430
and other particles their mass.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.500
The math predicted that if the field was excited
by high energy collisions, you could jiggle

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.250
the field in just the right way to briefly
spring another particle together, and that

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.030
particle is what we call the Higgs Boson.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.350
But scientists weren’t content to dust off
their hands on their lab coats and call it

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.350
a day.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.060
No, they decided to build a 27 kilometer underground
loop of supercooled magnets and tubes and

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.280
cameras 5 stories high so they could take
pictures of protons smashing together at nearly

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.549
the speed of light, and they did it with no
guarantee that the Higgs Boson could be found

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.190
or even existed at all.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.270
And you thought asking out your crush was
risky.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.490
But when they first flipped the switch in
2008, there was a problem.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.659
One measly connecting wire in the over 10,000
used for the superconducting magnets failed

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.659
and damaged the LHC.

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.350
When it was brought back online, it could
only run at half of its intended power.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.490
And then they found the Higgs Boson anyway.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.760
This machine answered one of the greatest
questions ever asked with one hand tied behind

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760
it’s back.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.920
But there’s more work to do.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.670
You see the math doesn’t predict an exact
value for the Higgs, and if the Higgs boson

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.110
has certain masses it implies vastly different
things.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.460
One possible mass equation suggests the Higgs
is 115 gigaelectronvolts over the speed of

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.530
light squared (GeV/c^2), which supports the
idea of supersymmetry, or more particles to

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.150
add to the standard model that we haven’t
found yet.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.450
But the Higgs could also have a mass around
140 GeV, and that suggests a favorite theory

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.590
of sci fi, the multiverse.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.920
A mass that high could lend credibility to
the idea that there are many universes with

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.420
Higgs bosons of different masses and ours
just happens to be a universe that has a higgs

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.410
field just right to keep everything stable.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.290
So what is the actual mass of the Higgs boson?

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.819
About 125 GeV/c squaredSweet@.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.810
So supersymmetry or multiverse?

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.110
Both?

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.110
We have no idea.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.230
That’s why in March the LHC is coming back.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.129
It’s here to kick butt and chew bubblegum,
and it’s all out of bubblegum.

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.610
It’s going to be twice as powerful with
tougher wiring.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.489
It’ll have better cooling to keep it’s
superconducting magnets at 1.9 degrees above

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:50.980
absolute zero.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.920
And it’s been had its cameras upgraded for
more precise measurement.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.030
And when it spools up, no one knows what we’ll
find.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.220
Supersymmetric particles?

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.069
Candidates for Dark Matter?

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.069
Nothing at all?

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.239
We’re just going to have to wait and see.

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.200
If bosons and fermions and quarks is all just
a bunch of gibberish to you, we have a video

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:40.900
on what all those mean - check this out:
