00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.140
Hey there. I'm Mike Rugnetta,
this is Crash Course Theater,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:06.980
and today we'll be looking at
the surviving literature of Roman drama

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.320
because Roman life wasn't all naval battles,
naked miming prostitutes

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.260
and Christians being eaten by lions.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.140
Sometimes, you had to take a break
and go watch a play.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:26.440
Much like Roman deities,

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.700
the most popular form of Roman drama were comedies that borrow heavily from Greek originals,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.860
especially the comedies of Menander with a little bit of Atellan Farce thrown into the mix.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.400
These comedies are called fabulae palliatae.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.960
They have outdoor urban settings
and are filled with stock characters.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.680
The hero of the play is typically
a type known as the adulescens.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.660
A young man who is in love with the girl next door,
the Virgo whom he can't marry

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.780
because she's of dubious parentage 
or he's in love with a prostitute, the Meretrix.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.480
Then, there's the Senex, usually the father or the old man, who's either a strict miser or a louche skirt-chaser,

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.800
other characters are the Servus,
the wily slave; the Leno, the pimp;

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.420
the Miles Gloriosus, the bragging soldier;

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.400
and the parasite, a slave character
who sponges off of his master.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.260
Sometimes wives and maid servants appear too.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.960
These stock characters get themselves
 involved in stock plots, often a couple plots per play,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.320
typical ones involved thwarted lovers, disagreement between parent and child and mistaken identity,

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.880
which is way easier to pull off
when everyone is wearing masks.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.500
Sometimes, there's a direct address
to the audience, too, kind of like a parabasis

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.980
and almost always there's a happy ending,
at least for the lovers.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.520
Comedies with happy endings are Yorick's faves.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.540
He is a man of Infinite Jest after all.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.680
Oh, sorry, was a man of Infinite Jest.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.440
In the Roman plays, most of the people 
and settings have Greek names,

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.440
which is either a hat tip to the original source or a real failure of imagination on the part of these writers.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.733
But even though the setting is ostensibly Greek,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.840
the situations and jokes about current events
and even the street names are definitely Roman,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.340
especially in the works of Plautus.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.100
Plautus and Terence are the two guys
we're gonna be talking the most about.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.640
Why them? Well, partially because they were the greatest practitioners of Roman comedy

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.940
but also because you guessed it their plays survived.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.920
Titus Maccius Plautus was born in 254 BCE in Umbria,
a landlocked region with a lot of truffles.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.260
Legend has it that he worked
as a stagehand in his hometown

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.600
and then failed as a merchant
before moving to Rome to write plays

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.960
130 plays are attributed to him

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:42.960
but take that with a grain of Roman salt,
a lot of writers tried to pass their plays off as his.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:51.080
A first century BCE scholar determined that 20 plays
are definitely his, and get this: all 20 survived.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.040
More or less, that's fine, I'll take it.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.040
Plautus' plays are rambunctious comedies
about middle class people and their slaves.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.140
You could even call them musicals

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.960
because from the meter they're written in 
we know that at least half of each play was sung.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.700
He was a big influence
on Medieval and Renaissance writers.

00:03:08.702 --> 00:03:14.260
Moliere was a fan, and we'll see that Shakespeare borrowed most of the comedy of errors from him.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.020
People love Plautus because his plays are energetic
and uproarious with puns galore

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.740
and tip-top alliterations that are tricky to translate.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:29.420
Plautus' works are a lot like real life
with more prostitutes and twins and songs,

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.720
which is to say I guess that they're not like real life at all. But they are a hoot.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.420
When he died in 184 BCE,
he apparently wrote his own epitaph.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.960
After Plautus died, comedy mourns,
the stage is deserted;

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.220
and then laughter,
mirth and jest all wept in company.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.100
Okay, now tell us how you really feel about yourself.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.160
Yeesh, the other major comic playwright
was Publius Terentius Afer aka. Terence,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.340
who's possibly the first playwright of color.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.900
Terence was born around the late 180s
or early 190s BCE in Africa at Carthage,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.340
in a spot, that's now a Tunisian suburb.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.160
He was a slave owned by a Roman senator,
who educated him and then freed him.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.060
He came to Rome to try to break into the theater
by surprising a famous poet at his house.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.640
The poet was not thrilled, but then Terence began to read his play, and suddenly the poet was totally into it.

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.460
Don't take too many lessons from this, though,

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.880
I didn't get this job by showing up on Stan's doorstep with a stack of things to explain.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.580
It's not a great plan.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.300
Terence wrote six plays,
which borrowed heavily from Menander.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.700
Cicero even called him a pint-sized Menander.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:43.320
After the sixth, he decided that he needed 
to travel more to write better plays.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.520
So, at the age of 25, he left Athens and died at sea.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.800
His style is more sophisticated than Plautus's.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.600
The comedy is a little less rowdy;
but the ironies are deeper,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.140
the characters are saner, the meter is more regular,
and the constructions are sturdier.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.120
Fewer plot holes, fewer dirty jokes, 
some really elegant Latin,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.780
and the women aren't treated that badly. So, that's nice.

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.680
These are classier plays.
But they're maybe not as funny,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.680
and hey, one more difference: In Plautus and Menander,  the prologue basically tells you what's gonna happen.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.500
Terence doesn't do that. He creates suspense.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.900
To take a closer look at Roman comedy,
we're gonna check out one of  Plautus's plays:

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.380
The Menaechmi, or The Menaechmus Twins,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.380
which we selected because Shakespeare borrowed most of it for the comedy of errors.

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.780
The Menaechmi begins with a prologue 
addressed directly to the audience.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.391
An actor comes out and tells everyone: Hey listen up. This is Plautus. You love Plautus.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.480
Give it up! Give it up for our man, Plautus.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.220
The prologue tells us that once there was a merchant from Syracuse who had identical twin sons.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.580
He took one of those sons to Epidamnus where the son was kidnapped and the merchant died of a broken heart.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:01.000
Both boys eventually end up being called Menaechmus, which is a little weird, but hey you do you for simplicity?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.300
We're gonna call them "M" in the Thought Bubble.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.580
Years after, their poorly fated trip,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.120
Syracuse M comes to Epidamnus 
searching for his brother: Epidamnus M.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:17.620
Epidamnus M is infatuated with a prostitute: Erotium,
a name that basically means Sexy.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.640
He keeps giving her all of his wife's stuff,
which understandably makes his wife mad.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.274
Epidamnus M and his parasite servant 
go to visit Erotium,

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:33.200
he gives her one of his wife's dresses and tells her
to prepare a feast, and then he goes away.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:40.940
Syracuse M comes in, gets mistaken for Epidamnus M and gets to eat Erotium's feast,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:43.780
and he's all this place is rad.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.357
But somehow it never occurs to him

00:06:45.357 --> 00:06:49.820
that maybe he's been mistaken for the identical twin brother he's been searching for for six years.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.660
Yeah, there are some plot holes.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:58.260
After the feast, Erotium gives Syracuse M the dress 
and tells him to take it to the tailor.

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:05.160
Meanwhile, Epidamnus M's wife is like "Why do you keep giving all of my dresses to your prostitute."

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.520
So he tries to get it back from Erotium.
And she's like "Dude. I just gave it to you."

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.400
Then his wife sees Syracuse M
and mistakes him for her husband.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.140
He doesn't recognize her, so she tries to have him arrested for craziness and maybe dress stealing,

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:27.167
just then, Epidamnus M enters, 
and the two identical brothers see each other,

00:07:27.167 --> 00:07:32.840
but it still doesn't occur to Syracuse M 
that this is the brother he's been looking for.

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.060
Luckily, the smart servant figures it out.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:41.480
The brothers are reunited, and Epidamnus M decides to auction off all of his stuff, including his wife.

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.980
So he can return with his brother to Syracuse.

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.640
Thanks Thought Bubble, so yeah, it's absurd sexist heavily reliant on stock characters and stock situations.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:58.640
But still funny, not all of Roman drama is quite so hilarious though. Take the work of Seneca the Younger.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.480
Please, haha! Just a little comedy, comedy for you there.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.060
Seneca Jr. is born Lucius Annaeus, Seneca in what is modern-day Cordoba Spain in 4 BCE.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.940
That's just a little while
after Horace publishes the Ars Poetica.

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:17.580
The first major work since Aristotle's Poetics
to tell people what plays should be.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.640
Seneca's dad was a big deal rhetorician,

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:23.820
and when he was young he was moved to Rome
to study stoic philosophy

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.260
because there's nothing the kids like
more than stoicism.

00:08:27.260 --> 00:08:30.820
He came to adulthood during
a pretty volatile time in Roman history.

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:37.280
Little Seneca who grew up to be another big deal rhetoric guy, kept running afoul of Emperors,

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.640
which was easy to do, because a lot of them were dangerous psychopaths.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.980
Caligula almost executed Seneca, then Claudius banished Seneca on the grounds of adultery.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:52.280
Claudius's wife called him back and installed him as a tutor for Nero who became Emperor,

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.520
and kept Seneca on as a councillor.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.680
But then Nero went a little crazy,
and even though Seneca was retired,

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.380
Nero blamed him for taking part in a conspiracy
and ordered him to kill himself.

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.460
So Seneca did.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.720
Man! Stoics you.

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:14.000
When Seneca wasn't being threatened by Emperors,
he sometimes wrote plays,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.260
which are mostly revisions of classic Greek works 
and they're all tragedies.

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:24.340
One possible exception is his Apocalocyntosis, 
a satire about the emperor Claudius.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:28.000
That no one really likes,
which maybe he didn't even write.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.500
In general, Roman tragedies based on Greek subjects are known as "fabulae crepidatae",

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.960
and there were lots - 300 years worth.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.200
But, basically, Senecas are the only ones that survived.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.740
Senecas' tragedies are notable

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:44.340
because they're the first to favor the V act structure
that Shakespeare would adopt.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.760
They have a different relationship
to the divine with a lot less confidence

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:50.860
that the gods are going to help everything work out

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:53.040
Which is to say? They're pretty dark?

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:56.900
It makes sense when you remember all of the scary violent Emperor's

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.420
who were ruling Rome during Senecas time.

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:03.840
Nero was as merciless and arbitrary 
as even the most capricious God.

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:07.620
Remember all that stuff the Greeks 
liked to keep off stage,

00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:12.200
like say, really extreme and incredibly gory violence.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.360
That's just the kind of thing Seneca wants to show

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:22.740
because atrocities especially those perpetrated on the weak by the powerful were facts of life in his society.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.720
Also a regular feature in violent 
entertainments like gladiator fights,

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.995
so if you've ever thought "hey, I'd really like
to see Oedipus blind himself,

00:10:30.995 --> 00:10:37.359
and maybe he could actually tear out both of his eyeballs, man I have got a play for you, but not you.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.940
You don't have eyes.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.780
Because of scenes like that one, and the fact
that Seneca was a high-class kind of person.

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.560
There's been a lot of debate about whether his plays were actually performed

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.720
or whether they were closet dramas 
meant to be read rather than produced.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.640
Certainly some of the scenes like the cannibal meal in Thyestes would have required special effects

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.360
But let's not put some creepy props or even extreme violence beyond the limits of the Roman stage.

00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:12.560
Remember these are the people who thought that a group of dwarves beating a woman with spiked clubs

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.920
was just normal entertainment.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.580
Check us out next time
for a survey of ancient Sanskrit theater,

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:23.260
and then, theater is gonna disappear for a while,
at least in the West.

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.180
Until then, Curtain!

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.320
