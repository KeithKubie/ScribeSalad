work in deep learning yeah absolutely so
 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
work in deep learning yeah absolutely so
I<00:00:21.699><c> think</c><00:00:21.820><c> my</c><00:00:22.390><c> first</c><00:00:22.749><c> exposure</c><00:00:23.050><c> to</c><00:00:23.199><c> deep</c>

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 align:start position:0%
I think my first exposure to deep
 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.689 align:start position:0%
I think my first exposure to deep
learning<00:00:23.529><c> was</c><00:00:23.800><c> when</c><00:00:23.980><c> I</c><00:00:24.009><c> was</c><00:00:24.189><c> an</c><00:00:24.310><c> undergraduate</c>

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.259 align:start position:0%
class on be performing and at the time
it<00:00:30.099><c> was</c><00:00:30.189><c> a</c><00:00:30.220><c> restricted</c><00:00:30.730><c> Boltzmann</c><00:00:30.999><c> machines</c>

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 align:start position:0%
it was a restricted Boltzmann machines
 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.780 align:start position:0%
it was a restricted Boltzmann machines
trained<00:00:31.599><c> on</c><00:00:31.720><c> amnesty</c><00:00:31.989><c> Jets</c><00:00:32.410><c> and</c><00:00:32.980><c> I</c><00:00:33.520><c> just</c>

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 align:start position:0%
trained on amnesty Jets and I just
 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.790 align:start position:0%
trained on amnesty Jets and I just
really<00:00:34.239><c> like</c><00:00:34.390><c> the</c><00:00:34.510><c> way</c><00:00:34.630><c> I'm</c><00:00:34.900><c> kind</c><00:00:35.320><c> of</c><00:00:35.350><c> Jeff</c><00:00:35.590><c> I</c>

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
really like the way I'm kind of Jeff I
 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.230 align:start position:0%
really like the way I'm kind of Jeff I
talked<00:00:36.040><c> about</c><00:00:36.130><c> training</c><00:00:36.640><c> the</c><00:00:36.790><c> network</c><00:00:36.910><c> like</c>

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
talked about training the network like
 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
talked about training the network like
the<00:00:37.360><c> mind</c><00:00:37.570><c> of</c><00:00:37.690><c> the</c><00:00:37.780><c> network</c><00:00:38.050><c> and</c><00:00:38.320><c> he</c><00:00:38.470><c> was</c><00:00:38.710><c> using</c>

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 align:start position:0%
the mind of the network and he was using
 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.890 align:start position:0%
the mind of the network and he was using
these<00:00:39.040><c> terms</c><00:00:39.280><c> and</c><00:00:39.700><c> I</c><00:00:40.480><c> just</c><00:00:40.630><c> thought</c><00:00:40.750><c> it</c><00:00:40.840><c> would</c>

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 align:start position:0%
these terms and I just thought it would
 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.590 align:start position:0%
these terms and I just thought it would
there<00:00:41.050><c> was</c><00:00:41.140><c> a</c><00:00:41.170><c> kind</c><00:00:41.500><c> of</c><00:00:41.530><c> a</c><00:00:41.680><c> flavor</c><00:00:42.220><c> of</c>

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
there was a kind of a flavor of
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.060 align:start position:0%
there was a kind of a flavor of
something<00:00:43.600><c> magical</c><00:00:44.050><c> happening</c><00:00:44.410><c> when</c><00:00:44.710><c> when</c>

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 align:start position:0%
something magical happening when when
 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
something magical happening when when
this<00:00:45.220><c> was</c><00:00:45.370><c> training</c><00:00:45.700><c> on</c><00:00:45.730><c> those</c><00:00:45.880><c> digits</c><00:00:46.240><c> and</c>

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 align:start position:0%
this was training on those digits and
 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.110 align:start position:0%
this was training on those digits and
and<00:00:48.010><c> so</c><00:00:48.430><c> that's</c><00:00:48.520><c> kind</c><00:00:48.700><c> of</c><00:00:48.730><c> like</c><00:00:48.850><c> my</c><00:00:48.940><c> first</c>

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of like my first
 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.580 align:start position:0%
and so that's kind of like my first
exposure<00:00:49.540><c> to</c><00:00:49.780><c> it</c><00:00:49.870><c> although</c><00:00:50.140><c> I</c><00:00:50.230><c> didn't</c><00:00:50.470><c> get</c>

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 align:start position:0%
exposure to it although I didn't get
 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.380 align:start position:0%
exposure to it although I didn't get
into<00:00:50.710><c> it</c><00:00:50.800><c> in</c><00:00:51.100><c> a</c><00:00:51.460><c> lot</c><00:00:51.550><c> of</c><00:00:51.670><c> detail</c><00:00:51.940><c> at</c><00:00:52.090><c> that</c><00:00:52.210><c> time</c>

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 align:start position:0%
into it in a lot of detail at that time
 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
into it in a lot of detail at that time
and<00:00:52.690><c> then</c><00:00:53.140><c> when</c><00:00:53.290><c> I</c><00:00:53.320><c> was</c><00:00:53.440><c> doing</c><00:00:53.530><c> my</c><00:00:53.710><c> master's</c>

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 align:start position:0%
and then when I was doing my master's
 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then when I was doing my master's
degree<00:00:54.040><c> at</c><00:00:54.400><c> University</c><00:00:54.850><c> of</c><00:00:54.880><c> British</c><00:00:55.060><c> Columbia</c>

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
degree at University of British Columbia
I<00:00:56.290><c> took</c><00:00:57.100><c> a</c><00:00:57.130><c> class</c><00:00:57.340><c> with</c><00:00:57.400><c> meta</c><00:00:57.700><c> decorators</c><00:00:58.150><c> and</c>

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 align:start position:0%
I took a class with meta decorators and
 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
I took a class with meta decorators and
that<00:00:58.420><c> was</c><00:00:58.510><c> again</c><00:00:58.780><c> on</c><00:00:59.200><c> machine</c><00:00:59.500><c> learning</c><00:00:59.560><c> and</c>

00:00:59.880 --> 00:00:59.890 align:start position:0%
that was again on machine learning and
 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.560 align:start position:0%
that was again on machine learning and
that's<00:01:00.040><c> the</c><00:01:00.280><c> first</c><00:01:00.460><c> time</c><00:01:00.580><c> I</c><00:01:00.640><c> kind</c><00:01:00.760><c> of</c><00:01:00.850><c> dealt</c>

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 align:start position:0%
that's the first time I kind of dealt
 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
that's the first time I kind of dealt
kind<00:01:02.020><c> of</c><00:01:02.080><c> deeper</c><00:01:02.380><c> into</c><00:01:02.620><c> these</c><00:01:02.710><c> networks</c><00:01:03.070><c> and</c>

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 align:start position:0%
kind of deeper into these networks and
 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.660 align:start position:0%
kind of deeper into these networks and
so<00:01:03.400><c> on</c>

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 align:start position:0%
so on
 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.910 align:start position:0%
so on
and<00:01:04.199><c> kind</c><00:01:05.199><c> of</c><00:01:05.229><c> what</c><00:01:05.350><c> was</c><00:01:05.439><c> interesting</c><00:01:05.590><c> is</c><00:01:05.890><c> that</c>

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 align:start position:0%

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.919 align:start position:0%
and kind of what was interesting is that
I<00:01:06.220><c> was</c><00:01:06.369><c> very</c><00:01:06.430><c> interested</c><00:01:06.670><c> in</c><00:01:06.939><c> artificial</c>

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 align:start position:0%
but here in this case we write the
 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.510 align:start position:0%
but here in this case we write the

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
optimization rights code and so you're
 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.340 align:start position:0%
optimization rights code and so you're
creating<00:01:54.789><c> input-output</c><00:01:55.569><c> specification</c><00:01:56.200><c> and</c>

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 align:start position:0%
creating input-output specification and
 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.719 align:start position:0%

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 align:start position:0%
then you have lots of examples of it and
 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
then you have lots of examples of it and
then<00:01:58.060><c> the</c><00:01:58.149><c> optimization</c><00:01:58.450><c> rights</c><00:01:58.869><c> code</c><00:01:59.049><c> and</c>

00:01:59.279 --> 00:01:59.289 align:start position:0%
then the optimization rights code and
 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
then the optimization rights code and
sometimes<00:01:59.679><c> it</c><00:01:59.799><c> can</c><00:01:59.920><c> write</c><00:02:00.039><c> code</c><00:02:00.249><c> better</c><00:02:00.429><c> than</c>

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can write code better than

sometimes it can write code better than

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 align:start position:0%

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 align:start position:0%
simple to create an interface for it and
 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
simple to create an interface for it and
I<00:02:46.420><c> think</c><00:02:46.599><c> I</c><00:02:46.690><c> had</c><00:02:46.870><c> an</c><00:02:46.989><c> error</c><00:02:47.170><c> rate</c><00:02:47.319><c> of</c><00:02:47.379><c> about</c><00:02:47.590><c> 6</c>

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 align:start position:0%
I think I had an error rate of about 6

I think I had an error rate of about 6

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 align:start position:0%
percent on that and so that was and then
 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.229 align:start position:0%
percent on that and so that was and then
based<00:02:51.099><c> on</c><00:02:51.190><c> what</c><00:02:51.250><c> I</c><00:02:51.340><c> was</c><00:02:51.489><c> seeing</c><00:02:51.670><c> and</c><00:02:51.879><c> how</c><00:02:52.000><c> hard</c>

task<00:02:52.510><c> was</c><00:02:52.720><c> I</c><00:02:52.840><c> think</c><00:02:53.019><c> I</c><00:02:53.109><c> predicted</c><00:02:53.560><c> that</c><00:02:54.069><c> the</c>

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 align:start position:0%
task was I think I predicted that the
 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
task was I think I predicted that the

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 align:start position:0%
lowest error rate we've achieved would
 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.069 align:start position:0%
lowest error rate we've achieved would
be<00:02:56.170><c> like</c><00:02:57.150><c> okay</c><00:02:58.150><c> I</c><00:02:58.180><c> can't</c><00:02:58.390><c> exactly</c><00:02:58.750><c> merge</c><00:02:58.989><c> I</c>

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
be like okay I can't exactly merge I
 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.539 align:start position:0%
be like okay I can't exactly merge I
think<00:02:59.230><c> I</c><00:02:59.319><c> guess</c><00:02:59.500><c> like</c><00:02:59.650><c> 10%</c><00:03:00.129><c> and</c><00:03:00.280><c> we're</c><00:03:00.400><c> now</c>

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 align:start position:0%
think I guess like 10% and we're now
 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
think I guess like 10% and we're now
down<00:03:00.760><c> to</c><00:03:00.819><c> like</c><00:03:01.060><c> 3</c><00:03:01.239><c> or</c><00:03:01.480><c> 2%</c><00:03:01.959><c> or</c><00:03:02.109><c> something</c><00:03:02.379><c> crazy</c>

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 align:start position:0%
down to like 3 or 2% or something crazy
 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.610 align:start position:0%
down to like 3 or 2% or something crazy
so<00:03:03.609><c> that</c><00:03:03.640><c> was</c><00:03:03.879><c> my</c><00:03:04.060><c> first</c><00:03:04.299><c> kind</c><00:03:04.690><c> of</c><00:03:04.720><c> a</c><00:03:04.780><c> fun</c>

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 align:start position:0%

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 align:start position:0%

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.370 align:start position:0%
understanding even how humans are doing
on<00:03:30.579><c> this</c><00:03:30.700><c> benchmark</c><00:03:31.120><c> and</c><00:03:31.419><c> so</c><00:03:31.840><c> I</c><00:03:31.900><c> created</c><00:03:32.200><c> this</c>

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 align:start position:0%
on this benchmark and so I created this
 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.379 align:start position:0%
on this benchmark and so I created this
a<00:03:32.440><c> JavaScript</c><00:03:32.980><c> interface</c><00:03:33.190><c> and</c><00:03:33.639><c> I</c><00:03:34.060><c> was</c><00:03:34.209><c> showing</c>

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 align:start position:0%
a JavaScript interface and I was showing
 

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
a JavaScript interface and I was showing
myself<00:03:34.630><c> the</c><00:03:35.109><c> images</c><00:03:35.470><c> and</c><00:03:35.709><c> then</c><00:03:36.099><c> the</c><00:03:36.130><c> problem</c>

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 align:start position:0%
myself the images and then the problem
 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.559 align:start position:0%
myself the images and then the problem
with<00:03:36.519><c> image</c><00:03:36.700><c> net</c><00:03:36.880><c> is</c><00:03:37.000><c> you</c><00:03:37.120><c> don't</c><00:03:37.269><c> have</c><00:03:37.419><c> just</c>

00:03:37.559 --> 00:03:37.569 align:start position:0%
with image net is you don't have just
 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.089 align:start position:0%
with image net is you don't have just
ten<00:03:37.720><c> categories</c><00:03:37.900><c> you</c><00:03:38.290><c> have</c><00:03:38.440><c> a</c><00:03:38.470><c> thousand</c><00:03:38.919><c> and</c>

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 align:start position:0%
ten categories you have a thousand and
 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
ten categories you have a thousand and
so<00:03:39.609><c> it</c><00:03:39.700><c> was</c><00:03:39.819><c> call</c><00:03:39.940><c> most</c><00:03:40.060><c> like</c><00:03:40.180><c> a</c><00:03:40.209><c> UI</c><00:03:40.419><c> challenge</c>

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 align:start position:0%
so it was call most like a UI challenge
 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.809 align:start position:0%
so it was call most like a UI challenge
of<00:03:41.109><c> obviously</c><00:03:41.709><c> I</c><00:03:41.769><c> can't</c><00:03:42.010><c> remember</c><00:03:42.220><c> a</c><00:03:42.370><c> thousand</c>

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 align:start position:0%
of obviously I can't remember a thousand
 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
of obviously I can't remember a thousand
categories<00:03:43.269><c> so</c><00:03:43.510><c> how</c><00:03:43.630><c> do</c><00:03:43.690><c> I</c><00:03:43.810><c> make</c><00:03:44.530><c> it</c><00:03:44.650><c> so</c><00:03:44.799><c> that</c>

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 align:start position:0%
categories so how do I make it so that
 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.309 align:start position:0%
categories so how do I make it so that
it's<00:03:45.160><c> something</c><00:03:45.459><c> fair</c><00:03:45.880><c> and</c><00:03:46.569><c> so</c><00:03:46.780><c> I</c><00:03:46.810><c> listed</c><00:03:47.200><c> out</c>

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 align:start position:0%
it's something fair and so I listed out
 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:48.449 align:start position:0%
it's something fair and so I listed out
all<00:03:47.380><c> the</c><00:03:47.560><c> categories</c><00:03:47.799><c> and</c><00:03:48.040><c> I</c><00:03:48.160><c> gave</c><00:03:48.310><c> myself</c>

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 align:start position:0%
all the categories and I gave myself
 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
all the categories and I gave myself
examples<00:03:49.060><c> of</c><00:03:49.150><c> them</c><00:03:49.299><c> so</c><00:03:49.569><c> for</c><00:03:49.720><c> each</c><00:03:49.810><c> image</c><00:03:50.019><c> I</c><00:03:50.200><c> was</c>

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 align:start position:0%
examples of them so for each image I was
 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.690 align:start position:0%
examples of them so for each image I was
crawling<00:03:50.590><c> through</c><00:03:50.829><c> a</c><00:03:50.919><c> thousand</c><00:03:51.280><c> categories</c>

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 align:start position:0%
crawling through a thousand categories
 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.780 align:start position:0%

and<00:03:51.910><c> just</c><00:03:52.419><c> trying</c><00:03:52.599><c> to</c><00:03:52.720><c> kind</c><00:03:52.840><c> of</c><00:03:53.310><c> you</c><00:03:54.310><c> know</c><00:03:54.430><c> see</c>

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 align:start position:0%
and just trying to kind of you know see
 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.339 align:start position:0%
and just trying to kind of you know see

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 align:start position:0%
based on the examples I was seeing for
 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
based on the examples I was seeing for
each<00:03:56.500><c> category</c><00:03:56.680><c> what</c><00:03:57.069><c> this</c><00:03:57.310><c> image</c><00:03:57.609><c> might</c><00:03:57.790><c> be</c>

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 align:start position:0%
each category what this image might be
 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.259 align:start position:0%
each category what this image might be
and<00:03:58.629><c> I</c><00:03:58.720><c> thought</c><00:03:58.840><c> it</c><00:03:59.019><c> was</c><00:03:59.109><c> a</c><00:03:59.169><c> just</c><00:03:59.650><c> an</c><00:03:59.709><c> extremely</c>

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 align:start position:0%
and I thought it was a just an extremely
 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.879 align:start position:0%
and I thought it was a just an extremely
instructed<00:04:01.269><c> exercise</c><00:04:01.810><c> by</c><00:04:01.989><c> itself</c><00:04:02.230><c> I</c><00:04:02.440><c> mean</c><00:04:02.680><c> I</c>

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:02.889 align:start position:0%
instructed exercise by itself I mean I
 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:04.650 align:start position:0%
instructed exercise by itself I mean I
was<00:04:03.310><c> not</c><00:04:03.459><c> I</c><00:04:03.700><c> did</c><00:04:03.849><c> not</c><00:04:03.970><c> understand</c><00:04:04.359><c> that</c><00:04:04.480><c> like</c><00:04:04.629><c> a</c>

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 align:start position:0%
was not I did not understand that like a
 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.330 align:start position:0%
was not I did not understand that like a
third<00:04:04.930><c> of</c><00:04:05.139><c> omission</c><00:04:05.440><c> at</c><00:04:05.530><c> his</c><00:04:05.650><c> dogs</c><00:04:05.859><c> and</c><00:04:06.160><c> like</c>

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 align:start position:0%
third of omission at his dogs and like
 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.430 align:start position:0%
third of omission at his dogs and like
dog<00:04:06.549><c> species</c><00:04:06.940><c> and</c><00:04:07.180><c> so</c><00:04:07.989><c> that</c><00:04:08.169><c> was</c><00:04:08.260><c> kind</c><00:04:08.410><c> of</c>

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
dog species and so that was kind of
 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.229 align:start position:0%
dog species and so that was kind of
interesting<00:04:08.560><c> to</c><00:04:08.919><c> see</c><00:04:09.099><c> that</c><00:04:09.970><c> the</c><00:04:10.060><c> network</c>

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 align:start position:0%
interesting to see that the network
 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
interesting to see that the network
spends<00:04:10.780><c> a</c><00:04:10.900><c> huge</c><00:04:11.260><c> amount</c><00:04:11.440><c> of</c><00:04:11.470><c> time</c><00:04:11.620><c> caring</c>

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 align:start position:0%
spends a huge amount of time caring
 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:13.229 align:start position:0%
spends a huge amount of time caring
about<00:04:12.040><c> dogs</c><00:04:12.310><c> I</c><00:04:12.489><c> think</c><00:04:12.699><c> a</c><00:04:12.790><c> third</c><00:04:12.819><c> of</c><00:04:13.120><c> its</c>

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
about dogs I think a third of its
 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
about dogs I think a third of its
performance<00:04:13.690><c> comes</c><00:04:14.019><c> from</c><00:04:14.199><c> dogs</c><00:04:15.269><c> and</c><00:04:16.799><c> yeah</c><00:04:17.799><c> so</c>

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 align:start position:0%
performance comes from dogs and yeah so
 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.129 align:start position:0%
performance comes from dogs and yeah so
this<00:04:18.099><c> was</c><00:04:18.250><c> kind</c><00:04:18.370><c> of</c><00:04:18.519><c> something</c><00:04:18.910><c> that</c><00:04:19.060><c> I</c><00:04:19.479><c> did</c>

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 align:start position:0%
this was kind of something that I did
 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:21.509 align:start position:0%
this was kind of something that I did
for<00:04:20.169><c> maybe</c><00:04:20.590><c> a</c><00:04:20.680><c> week</c><00:04:20.889><c> or</c><00:04:20.979><c> two</c><00:04:21.130><c> I</c><00:04:21.160><c> put</c><00:04:21.310><c> everything</c>

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 align:start position:0%
for maybe a week or two I put everything
 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.710 align:start position:0%
for maybe a week or two I put everything

else on hold I thought it was kind of a
 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.899 align:start position:0%
else on hold I thought it was kind of a

very fun exercise I got a number in the
 

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:26.550 align:start position:0%
very fun exercise I got a number in the
end<00:04:25.030><c> and</c><00:04:25.270><c> then</c><00:04:25.719><c> I</c><00:04:25.810><c> thought</c><00:04:26.020><c> that</c><00:04:26.050><c> one</c><00:04:26.320><c> person</c>

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 align:start position:0%
end and then I thought that one person
 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.060 align:start position:0%
end and then I thought that one person
is<00:04:26.650><c> not</c><00:04:26.770><c> enough</c><00:04:26.979><c> I</c><00:04:27.099><c> wanted</c><00:04:27.340><c> to</c><00:04:27.430><c> have</c><00:04:27.550><c> multiple</c>

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 align:start position:0%
is not enough I wanted to have multiple
 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.470 align:start position:0%
is not enough I wanted to have multiple
people<00:04:28.460><c> and</c><00:04:28.670><c> so</c><00:04:29.060><c> I</c><00:04:29.090><c> was</c><00:04:29.210><c> trying</c><00:04:29.360><c> to</c><00:04:29.450><c> organize</c>

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
people and so I was trying to organize
 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.990 align:start position:0%
people and so I was trying to organize
within<00:04:30.410><c> a</c><00:04:30.500><c> lab</c><00:04:30.680><c> to</c><00:04:31.190><c> get</c><00:04:31.310><c> other</c><00:04:31.490><c> people</c><00:04:31.760><c> to</c><00:04:31.790><c> kind</c>

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
within a lab to get other people to kind
 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.580 align:start position:0%
within a lab to get other people to kind

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 align:start position:0%
of do the same thing and I think people
 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
of do the same thing and I think people
are<00:04:33.710><c> not</c><00:04:33.860><c> as</c><00:04:34.100><c> willing</c><00:04:34.280><c> to</c><00:04:35.090><c> contribute</c><00:04:35.650><c> say</c>

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 align:start position:0%

this is and so I was not able to get
 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.790 align:start position:0%
this is and so I was not able to get

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
like enough data in that respect but we
 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.590 align:start position:0%
like enough data in that respect but we

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.780 align:start position:0%
got at least like some approximate

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.270 align:start position:0%

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then this was kind of picked up and
 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.190 align:start position:0%
and then this was kind of picked up and
it's<00:04:55.400><c> uh</c><00:04:55.490><c> it</c><00:04:56.360><c> wasn't</c><00:04:56.480><c> obvious</c><00:04:56.840><c> to</c><00:04:56.870><c> me</c><00:04:57.020><c> at</c><00:04:57.110><c> the</c>

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 align:start position:0%
um I mean especially I mean sometimes
 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.590 align:start position:0%
um I mean especially I mean sometimes
it's<00:05:25.400><c> really</c><00:05:25.670><c> hard</c><00:05:25.790><c> to</c><00:05:26.000><c> see</c><00:05:26.210><c> in</c><00:05:26.270><c> the</c><00:05:26.390><c> image</c>

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to see in the image
 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.850 align:start position:0%
it's really hard to see in the image
where<00:05:26.750><c> it</c><00:05:26.840><c> is</c><00:05:26.960><c> is</c><00:05:27.050><c> just</c><00:05:27.230><c> like</c><00:05:27.320><c> a</c><00:05:27.350><c> tiny</c><00:05:27.560><c> blob</c><00:05:27.830><c> of</c>

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 align:start position:0%
where it is is just like a tiny blob of
 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
where it is is just like a tiny blob of
like<00:05:28.310><c> a</c><00:05:28.430><c> black</c><00:05:28.640><c> black</c><00:05:29.270><c> dog</c><00:05:29.480><c> is</c><00:05:29.600><c> obviously</c>

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 align:start position:0%
like a black black dog is obviously
 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.270 align:start position:0%
like a black black dog is obviously

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere there and I'm not seeing like
 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.430 align:start position:0%
somewhere there and I'm not seeing like
you<00:05:32.000><c> know</c><00:05:32.120><c> I'm</c><00:05:32.240><c> guessing</c><00:05:32.690><c> between</c><00:05:32.990><c> like</c><00:05:33.170><c> 20</c>

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know I'm guessing between like 20
 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know I'm guessing between like 20
categories<00:05:33.620><c> and</c><00:05:33.980><c> the</c><00:05:34.100><c> network</c><00:05:34.400><c> just</c><00:05:34.430><c> gets</c><00:05:34.790><c> it</c>

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970 align:start position:0%
categories and the network just gets it
 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:36.460 align:start position:0%
categories and the network just gets it
and<00:05:35.120><c> I</c><00:05:35.240><c> don't</c><00:05:35.690><c> understand</c><00:05:36.050><c> how</c><00:05:36.140><c> that</c><00:05:36.290><c> comes</c>

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 align:start position:0%
and I don't understand how that comes
 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.950 align:start position:0%
and I don't understand how that comes
about<00:05:36.850><c> so</c><00:05:37.850><c> there's</c><00:05:38.030><c> some</c><00:05:38.150><c> super</c><00:05:38.390><c> humanists</c><00:05:38.810><c> to</c>

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
about so there's some super humanists to
 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.590 align:start position:0%
about so there's some super humanists to
it<00:05:39.080><c> but</c><00:05:39.530><c> also</c><00:05:39.710><c> for</c><00:05:40.070><c> the</c><00:05:40.220><c> I</c><00:05:40.580><c> think</c><00:05:41.120><c> the</c><00:05:41.360><c> network</c>

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600 align:start position:0%
it but also for the I think the network
 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.940 align:start position:0%
it but also for the I think the network
is<00:05:41.690><c> extremely</c><00:05:42.200><c> good</c><00:05:42.350><c> at</c><00:05:42.500><c> these</c><00:05:42.590><c> kind</c><00:05:42.800><c> of</c><00:05:42.860><c> like</c>

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 align:start position:0%
is extremely good at these kind of like
 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.530 align:start position:0%
is extremely good at these kind of like

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.930 align:start position:0%

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 align:start position:0%

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.910 align:start position:0%
textures and just I think in that
respect<00:05:47.270><c> I</c><00:05:47.330><c> was</c><00:05:47.480><c> not</c><00:05:47.630><c> surprised</c><00:05:48.620><c> that</c><00:05:48.770><c> the</c>

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:48.920 align:start position:0%

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 align:start position:0%
network could better measure those fine
 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.490 align:start position:0%
network could better measure those fine

the images required you to read like

the images required you to read like

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 align:start position:0%
it's just a bottle and you can't see

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690 align:start position:0%
just seeing the students just the fact
 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:04.600 align:start position:0%
just seeing the students just the fact
that<00:07:02.720><c> they</c><00:07:02.840><c> were</c><00:07:02.930><c> really</c><00:07:03.110><c> excited</c><00:07:03.460><c> it</c><00:07:04.460><c> was</c><00:07:04.520><c> a</c>

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 align:start position:0%
that they were really excited it was a
 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.790 align:start position:0%
that they were really excited it was a
very<00:07:04.760><c> different</c><00:07:05.150><c> class</c><00:07:05.440><c> normally</c><00:07:06.440><c> you're</c>

00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
very different class normally you're
 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
very different class normally you're
being<00:07:07.040><c> taught</c><00:07:07.250><c> things</c><00:07:07.430><c> that</c><00:07:07.670><c> were</c><00:07:07.790><c> discovered</c>

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 align:start position:0%
being taught things that were discovered
 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.670 align:start position:0%
being taught things that were discovered
in<00:07:08.300><c> 1800</c><00:07:08.870><c> or</c><00:07:08.960><c> something</c><00:07:09.230><c> like</c><00:07:09.320><c> that</c>

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
in 1800 or something like that
 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.810 align:start position:0%
in 1800 or something like that
but<00:07:09.890><c> we</c><00:07:10.040><c> were</c><00:07:10.130><c> able</c><00:07:10.250><c> to</c><00:07:10.370><c> come</c><00:07:10.550><c> to</c><00:07:10.640><c> class</c><00:07:10.760><c> and</c>

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820 align:start position:0%
but we were able to come to class and
 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:12.250 align:start position:0%
but we were able to come to class and
say<00:07:11.090><c> look</c><00:07:11.270><c> there's</c><00:07:11.450><c> this</c><00:07:11.540><c> paper</c><00:07:11.780><c> from</c><00:07:12.050><c> like</c><00:07:12.230><c> a</c>

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:12.260 align:start position:0%
say look there's this paper from like a
 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:13.990 align:start position:0%
say look there's this paper from like a
week<00:07:12.500><c> ago</c><00:07:12.620><c> or</c><00:07:12.920><c> even</c><00:07:13.280><c> like</c><00:07:13.400><c> yesterday</c><00:07:13.790><c> and</c>

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
week ago or even like yesterday and
 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.490 align:start position:0%
week ago or even like yesterday and
there's<00:07:14.330><c> new</c><00:07:14.450><c> results</c><00:07:14.870><c> and</c><00:07:15.020><c> I</c><00:07:15.200><c> think</c><00:07:15.410><c> the</c>

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 align:start position:0%
there's new results and I think the
 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:16.810 align:start position:0%
there's new results and I think the
undergraduate<00:07:16.130><c> students</c><00:07:16.400><c> and</c><00:07:16.520><c> any</c><00:07:16.700><c> other</c>

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:16.820 align:start position:0%
undergraduate students and any other
 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:18.700 align:start position:0%
undergraduate students and any other
students<00:07:17.180><c> they</c><00:07:18.080><c> just</c><00:07:18.290><c> really</c><00:07:18.470><c> enjoyed</c><00:07:18.680><c> that</c>

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:18.710 align:start position:0%
students they just really enjoyed that
 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:20.110 align:start position:0%
students they just really enjoyed that
aspect<00:07:18.950><c> of</c><00:07:19.190><c> the</c><00:07:19.280><c> class</c><00:07:19.460><c> and</c><00:07:19.700><c> the</c><00:07:19.880><c> fact</c><00:07:20.060><c> that</c>

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.120 align:start position:0%
aspect of the class and the fact that
 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
aspect of the class and the fact that
they<00:07:20.270><c> actually</c><00:07:20.300><c> understood</c><00:07:21.020><c> so</c><00:07:21.650><c> there's</c><00:07:21.830><c> not</c>

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 align:start position:0%
they actually understood so there's not
 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
they actually understood so there's not
you<00:07:23.330><c> know</c><00:07:23.390><c> so</c><00:07:23.570><c> you</c><00:07:23.630><c> don't</c><00:07:23.780><c> have</c><00:07:23.840><c> to</c><00:07:23.990><c> this</c><00:07:24.260><c> is</c>

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 align:start position:0%
you know so you don't have to this is
 

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.260 align:start position:0%
you know so you don't have to this is
not<00:07:24.530><c> nuclear</c><00:07:24.890><c> physics</c><00:07:25.310><c> or</c><00:07:25.520><c> rocket</c><00:07:25.970><c> science</c>

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:26.270 align:start position:0%
not nuclear physics or rocket science
 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.430 align:start position:0%
not nuclear physics or rocket science
this<00:07:26.450><c> is</c><00:07:26.600><c> like</c><00:07:26.780><c> you</c><00:07:26.930><c> need</c><00:07:27.050><c> to</c><00:07:27.140><c> know</c><00:07:27.230><c> calculus</c>

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
this is like you need to know calculus
 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.690 align:start position:0%
this is like you need to know calculus
and<00:07:27.740><c> linear</c><00:07:27.830><c> algebra</c><00:07:28.040><c> and</c><00:07:28.400><c> you</c><00:07:28.460><c> can</c><00:07:28.580><c> actually</c>

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 align:start position:0%
and linear algebra and you can actually
 

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.490 align:start position:0%
and linear algebra and you can actually
kind<00:07:29.000><c> of</c><00:07:29.060><c> understand</c><00:07:29.510><c> everything</c><00:07:30.380><c> that</c>

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.500 align:start position:0%
kind of understand everything that
 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.020 align:start position:0%
kind of understand everything that
happens<00:07:30.830><c> under</c><00:07:30.950><c> the</c><00:07:31.130><c> hood</c><00:07:31.310><c> and</c><00:07:31.490><c> so</c><00:07:31.910><c> I</c><00:07:31.940><c> think</c>

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:32.030 align:start position:0%
happens under the hood and so I think
 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.150 align:start position:0%
happens under the hood and so I think
just<00:07:32.480><c> the</c><00:07:32.540><c> fact</c><00:07:32.630><c> that</c><00:07:32.870><c> it's</c><00:07:33.050><c> so</c><00:07:33.140><c> powerful</c><00:07:33.350><c> the</c>

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
just the fact that it's so powerful the
 

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.460 align:start position:0%
just the fact that it's so powerful the
fact<00:07:34.400><c> that</c><00:07:34.490><c> it's</c><00:07:34.780><c> that</c><00:07:35.780><c> it</c><00:07:35.870><c> keeps</c><00:07:35.990><c> changing</c><00:07:36.110><c> on</c>

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.470 align:start position:0%
fact that it's that it keeps changing on
 

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:37.960 align:start position:0%
fact that it's that it keeps changing on
a<00:07:36.500><c> daily</c><00:07:36.560><c> basis</c><00:07:37.100><c> if</c><00:07:37.280><c> people</c><00:07:37.610><c> kind</c><00:07:37.760><c> of</c><00:07:37.820><c> felt</c>

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:37.970 align:start position:0%
a daily basis if people kind of felt
 

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.830 align:start position:0%
a daily basis if people kind of felt
like<00:07:38.030><c> they're</c><00:07:38.210><c> on</c><00:07:38.300><c> the</c><00:07:38.360><c> forefront</c><00:07:38.660><c> of</c>

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
like they're on the forefront of
 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
like they're on the forefront of
something<00:07:39.110><c> big</c><00:07:39.260><c> and</c><00:07:39.500><c> I</c><00:07:39.770><c> think</c><00:07:39.800><c> that's</c><00:07:40.100><c> why</c>

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:40.250 align:start position:0%
something big and I think that's why
 

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.340 align:start position:0%
something big and I think that's why
people<00:07:41.000><c> like</c><00:07:41.540><c> really</c><00:07:41.810><c> enjoyed</c><00:07:41.990><c> that</c><00:07:42.140><c> class</c><00:07:42.320><c> a</c>

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.350 align:start position:0%

crazy here how is your own thinking how
 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.610 align:start position:0%
crazy here how is your own thinking how
is<00:07:59.450><c> your</c><00:07:59.600><c> understanding</c><00:07:59.870><c> of</c><00:08:00.290><c> deep</c><00:08:00.440><c> learning</c>

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:00.620 align:start position:0%
is your understanding of deep learning
 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.770 align:start position:0%
is your understanding of deep learning
change<00:08:01.130><c> over</c><00:08:01.520><c> these</c><00:08:01.669><c> you</c><00:08:02.300><c> know</c><00:08:02.419><c> many</c><00:08:02.690><c> years</c>

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:02.780 align:start position:0%

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.260 align:start position:0%
change over these you know many years
yeah<00:08:03.590><c> it's</c><00:08:03.979><c> basically</c><00:08:04.190><c> like</c><00:08:04.940><c> when</c><00:08:05.090><c> I</c><00:08:05.120><c> was</c>

00:08:05.260 --> 00:08:05.270 align:start position:0%
yeah it's basically like when I was
 

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.490 align:start position:0%
yeah it's basically like when I was
seeing<00:08:05.510><c> we're</c><00:08:05.780><c> circling</c><00:08:05.900><c> Boltzmann</c><00:08:06.260><c> machines</c>

for the first time on digits it wasn't
 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.270 align:start position:0%
for the first time on digits it wasn't
obvious<00:08:08.990><c> to</c><00:08:09.320><c> me</c><00:08:09.440><c> how</c><00:08:09.590><c> this</c><00:08:09.740><c> technology</c><00:08:10.010><c> was</c>

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
obvious to me how this technology was

00:08:38.829 --> 00:08:38.839 align:start position:0%
largest surprise I would say and it's
 

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.320 align:start position:0%
largest surprise I would say and it's
not<00:08:38.960><c> only</c><00:08:39.110><c> that</c><00:08:39.610><c> so</c><00:08:40.610><c> that's</c><00:08:40.820><c> one</c><00:08:41.030><c> thing</c><00:08:41.210><c> that</c>

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:41.330 align:start position:0%
not only that so that's one thing that
 

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
not only that so that's one thing that
it<00:08:41.419><c> worked</c><00:08:41.599><c> so</c><00:08:41.719><c> well</c><00:08:41.900><c> and</c><00:08:42.110><c> say</c><00:08:42.200><c> like</c><00:08:42.349><c> imagenet</c>

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:42.650 align:start position:0%
it worked so well and say like imagenet
 

00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:43.990 align:start position:0%
it worked so well and say like imagenet
but<00:08:42.830><c> the</c><00:08:42.919><c> other</c><00:08:43.070><c> thing</c><00:08:43.339><c> that</c><00:08:43.370><c> I</c><00:08:43.550><c> think</c><00:08:43.849><c> no</c><00:08:43.969><c> one</c>

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
but the other thing that I think no one
 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.430 align:start position:0%
but the other thing that I think no one
saw<00:08:44.270><c> coming</c><00:08:44.300><c> or</c><00:08:44.690><c> at</c><00:08:44.750><c> least</c><00:08:44.900><c> for</c><00:08:45.050><c> sure</c><00:08:45.170><c> I</c><00:08:45.200><c> did</c>

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:53.300 align:start position:0%

00:11:16.390 --> 00:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
to put them together and I think that
 

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.890 align:start position:0%
to put them together and I think that
was<00:11:16.520><c> kind</c><00:11:16.700><c> of</c><00:11:16.730><c> a</c><00:11:16.850><c> wrong</c><00:11:17.090><c> approach</c><00:11:17.390><c> and</c><00:11:17.750><c> we've</c>

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:17.900 align:start position:0%
was kind of a wrong approach and we've
 

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.540 align:start position:0%
was kind of a wrong approach and we've
seen<00:11:18.110><c> that</c><00:11:18.260><c> how</c><00:11:18.500><c> that</c><00:11:18.560><c> kind</c><00:11:19.190><c> of</c><00:11:19.250><c> played</c><00:11:19.430><c> out</c>

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:19.550 align:start position:0%
seen that how that kind of played out
 

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
seen that how that kind of played out
historically<00:11:20.240><c> and</c><00:11:20.660><c> so</c><00:11:21.200><c> I</c><00:11:21.230><c> think</c><00:11:21.320><c> there's</c>

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.250 align:start position:0%
historically and so I think there's
 

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.380 align:start position:0%
historically and so I think there's
something<00:11:22.550><c> similar</c><00:11:22.820><c> that's</c><00:11:23.060><c> going</c><00:11:23.270><c> on</c>

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:23.390 align:start position:0%
something similar that's going on
 

00:11:23.390 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
something similar that's going on
slightly<00:11:23.750><c> on</c><00:11:23.900><c> the</c><00:11:23.960><c> higher</c><00:11:24.080><c> level</c><00:11:24.380><c> of</c><00:11:24.440><c> with</c><00:11:24.620><c> AI</c>
