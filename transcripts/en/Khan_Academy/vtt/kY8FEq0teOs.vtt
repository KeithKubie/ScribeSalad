00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.340
We've already seen that when a
neuron is in its resting state

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.900
there's a voltage difference
across the membrane.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.529
And so in these diagrams right
over here, this right over here

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:09.195
is the membrane.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.840
This right over here is
the inside of the neuron,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.490
and this right over
here is the outside.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.500
That's the outside and of
course this is the outside.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.230
This is the outside as well.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.190
So if you had a
voltmeter measuring

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.070
the potential difference
across the membrane,

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.659
so if you took this voltage
minus this voltage right

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:35.450
over here, the voltage
between this and that,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.435
you would get negative-- let's
say for the sake of argument,

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:40.140
let's say it would
measure, it would

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.450
average about negative
70 millivolts.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.150
So this is in
millivolts, negative 70.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.400
And I'll do it actually
for both of these graphs.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.620
We're going to use both
of these to describe

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.817
slightly different, or actually
quite different, scenarios.

00:00:55.817 --> 00:00:58.150
And you could have another
voltmeter out here in yellow,

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.190
and that's a little further
out, but that's also

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.610
going to register
negative 70 millivolts.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.620
Now let's make something
interesting happen.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.950
Let's say that, for
some reason, let's

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.230
say that the membrane
becomes permeable to sodium.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.710
So sodium just starts
flooding through.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.220
It's going to flood
through for two reasons.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.820
One, it is a positive ion.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.270
It's more positive
on the outside

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.212
than the inside, so positive
charge will want to flood in.

00:01:29.212 --> 00:01:31.170
And the other reason why
it'll want to flood in

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.500
is because there's a higher
concentration of sodium

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.960
on the outside
than on the inside.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.274
So it'll just go down its
concentration gradient.

00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:40.690
And the reason why we have a
higher concentration gradient

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.680
on the sodium on the
outside than the inside,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.280
we've already seen, is because
of the sodium potassium pump.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.906
But anyway, so you're going
to have this increase.

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:51.280
You're going to really have
this spike in positive charge

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.780
flowing.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.470
And then what's going to be the
dynamic then inside the neuron?

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.146
Well, if you have all this
positive charge right over here

00:01:58.146 --> 00:01:59.770
the other positive
charge in the neuron

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.311
is going to want to
get away from it.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:10.460
And this is not just in
the rightward direction.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.210
It's really going to
be in all directions.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.797
In all directions
the positive charge,

00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:15.880
they're going to want to
get away from each other.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.430
So this one's going
to move that way,

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.390
and then that's going
to make that one

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.931
want to move that
way, which is going

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.680
to make that one want
to move that way.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.870
So if we let some
time pass, what's

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.590
the voltage going to look
like on this blue voltmeter?

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.574
Well after some time, because
more and more positive

00:02:30.574 --> 00:02:32.740
charges are trying to get
away from these other ones

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.450
right over here as
the concentration

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.482
of these positive
charges spread out,

00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:38.565
you're going to see the
voltage start to increase.

00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:43.600
And then as they fully
get spread out then

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.100
it might return to
something of an equilibrium.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.946
And then if we go a little
bit further down the neuron

00:02:52.946 --> 00:02:54.570
a little more time
will pass before you

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.450
see a voltage increase, but
because this thing is just

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.670
getting spread out across
more and more distance,

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.740
the effect is going
to be more limited.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.430
You're not going to
see as much of a bump

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.320
in the voltage over here
than you saw over here.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.880
And this type of spread of, I
guess you could say a signal,

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.790
is called electrotonic spread.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.275
Let me write that down.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.870
Or this is the spread of
an electrotonic potential.

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:33.900
So there's a couple of
characteristics here.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.144
One, it's passive.

00:03:35.144 --> 00:03:36.560
This part that we
drew right here,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.040
this isn't the
electrotonic spread.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.190
The electrotonic spread is
what happens after that.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.290
Once you have this high
concentration here,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.480
the fact that a few
moments later you're

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.980
going to have a
higher concentration

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.514
of positive charge here, and
a few moments later a higher

00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:50.680
positive concentration here.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.550
This is a passive phenomenon.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.200
So this thing right over
here, it is passive.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.640
And it also dissipates.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.015
The signal gets weaker and
weaker the further and further

00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:04.514
you get out because this stuff
just gets further and further

00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:05.160
spread out.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.240
So it's passive
and it dissipates.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.750
Now let's play out
this scenario again,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.380
but let's also throw in some
voltage-gated ion channels

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.265
right over here.

00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:22.390
So let's say this right
over here that I'm drawing,

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.455
let's say this is a
voltage-gated sodium channel.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:42.220
Let's say it opens at
negative 55 millivolts.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.910
So that would be
right around there.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.220
So that is when it opens
at negative 55 millivolts.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.480
Let me draw that
threshold there.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:02.280
And let's say it closes at
positive 40 millivolts, right

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.780
over there.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.530
I'm just trying to
show the threshold.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.140
And let's say we also have
a potassium channel too,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.910
right over here.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.980
So this is a potassium channel,
the infamous leaky potassium

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.190
channels, which are
the true reason why

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.590
we have this voltage
difference across the membrane.

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:25.120
But this potassium
channel, let's

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.200
say it opens when
this one closes.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.154
So it opens, just for
the sake of argument,

00:05:29.154 --> 00:05:31.570
these aren't going to be the
exact numbers but to give you

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.840
the idea, at positive
40 millivolts.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.710
And let's say it closes
at negative 80 millivolts.

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:50.080
So that one opens up here,
and then it closes down here.

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.500
Now what is going to happen?

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:58.320
Well just like we saw before--
Let's let our positive charge

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:05.040
flood in here at the
left side of this neuron,

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.815
I guess we could say, and then
because of electrotonic spread,

00:06:09.815 --> 00:06:11.440
a little bit later
you're going to have

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.420
the potential across the
membrane at this point

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.575
is going to start to
become less negative.

00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:18.950
The potential
difference is going

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.140
to become less negative, just
like we saw right over here.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.810
So it's going to
become less negative.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:25.810
But it's not just going
to be just a little bump

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.851
and then go back down,
because what happens right

00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:31.630
when the potential hits
negative 55 millivolts?

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.320
Well then it's going to trigger
the opening of this sodium

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.170
channel.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.580
So the sodium channel is going
to open because the voltage got

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:47.295
high enough, and so you're going
to have sodium flood in again.

00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:48.420
So what's that going to do?

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:54.050
Well that's going to
spike up the voltage.

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.000
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.530
It's going to keep flowing
in, keep flowing in.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.040
The voltage is going to
get more and more positive.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.040
Because remember, this
is going to be flowing in

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.290
for two reasons.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.945
One, there's just more charge.

00:07:04.945 --> 00:07:07.000
It's more positive
outside than the inside

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.990
so it's going to go
across a voltage gradient,

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:13.060
or go down the voltage gradient,
or the electro potential

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:16.590
gradient, but also there's a
higher concentration of sodium

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.310
out here than there is in here
because of the sodium potassium

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:22.100
pump, and so it'll also want
to go down its concentration

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.600
gradient.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.530
So it's just going to keep
flowing in even past the point

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:29.752
at which you have
no voltage gradient,

00:07:29.752 --> 00:07:31.460
but because of the
concentration gradient

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:32.610
it's going to keep going.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.430
But then, as you get to
positive 40 millivolts,

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.300
this channel is going to close.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:39.260
So that's going to
stop flooding in.

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.289
And you also have the
potassium channel opening.

00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:43.830
And the potassium
channel, now you're

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.690
more positive on the inside than
the outside, at least locally

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:47.750
right over here.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.770
And so now you're going to
have this positively-charged

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.340
potassium ions want
to get out, want

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.620
to get out from this
positive environment.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.730
And so the voltage is going
to get more and more negative,

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.340
and it's going to go beyond
neutral because potassium

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:05.829
is going to want to go down,
not just its voltage gradient,

00:08:05.829 --> 00:08:08.120
it's going to do that while
it's positive on the inside

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.410
and negative on the outside,
or more positive on the inside

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:14.030
than it is on the
outside, but it'll also

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:15.970
want to go down its
concentration gradient.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.359
There's a higher
concentration of potassium

00:08:18.359 --> 00:08:20.650
on the inside than on the
outside because of the sodium

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:21.910
potassium pump.

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:24.670
So the potassium will
just keep going out,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.410
and out, and out, and out,
and then at negative 80

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:31.690
millivolts the potassium
channel closes, and then we

00:08:31.690 --> 00:08:37.730
can get back to our
equilibrium state.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.169
Now why is this interesting?

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.245
Well we had the electrotonic
spread up to this point.

00:08:43.245 --> 00:08:45.370
But the signal would just
keep dissipating and keep

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.990
dissipating, and if
you get far enough

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:51.039
it would be very hard
to notice that signal.

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:52.580
And so what this
essentially just did

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.490
is it just boosted
the signal again.

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:58.420
It just boosted the signal,
and now, a few moments later,

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:03.022
if you were to measure
the potential difference--

00:09:03.022 --> 00:09:05.480
because these things are trying
to get away from each other

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.540
again, once again you have
electrotonic spread-- if you

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.400
were to measure the potential
difference across the membrane

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.390
where this yellow voltmeter
is, then you're going to have--

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.990
So where that yellow one is,
before it had just a little

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:22.630
dissipated bump
here, but now it's

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:27.210
going to have quite a nice bump.

00:09:27.210 --> 00:09:30.350
And if you actually had
another voltage-gated channel

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.590
right over here, then
that would boost it again.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:41.850
And so this kind of very
active boosting of the voltage,

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.705
this is called an
action potential.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.210
You could view this as the
boosting of the signal.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:53.700
The signal is spreading,
electrotonic spread, then you

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.770
trigger a channel, a
voltage-gated channel,

00:09:56.770 --> 00:09:59.740
then that boosts
the signal again.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:02.740
And as we'll see, the neuron
uses a combination, just

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.760
the way we described it here,
in order to spread a signal,

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.810
in order for it to have
the signal spread, in order

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:12.140
to obviously to spread
passively, but then

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:17.011
to boost it so that the signal
can cover over long distances.
