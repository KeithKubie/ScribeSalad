00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.656
- [Voiceover] In order for our
bodies to function properly,

00:00:02.717 --> 00:00:06.631
the pH of our blood has to be
within a fairly narrow range.

00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:10.318
Our pH, so the pH of blood

00:00:10.318 --> 00:00:11.898
needs to be between

00:00:11.898 --> 00:00:15.544
seven point three five
and seven point four five.

00:00:15.544 --> 00:00:19.614
If the pH falls below
seven point three five,

00:00:19.614 --> 00:00:21.274
you're going to be diagnosed,

00:00:21.274 --> 00:00:24.509
and you know this line is, there
is kind of a gray area here

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:26.302
but this is what's defined
by the medical community

00:00:26.302 --> 00:00:29.341
if your pH falls below
seven point three five,

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:32.721
you're actually diagnosed with acidosis.

00:00:32.721 --> 00:00:34.749
Your blood is becoming too acidic.

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:36.120
You have too high of a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.396
hydrogen ion concentration in your blood,

00:00:38.396 --> 00:00:40.673
or a hydronium
concentration in your blood.

00:00:40.673 --> 00:00:43.876
If your pH, if the pH
in your blood gets above

00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:48.266
seven point four five, you're
diagnosed with alkalosis.

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.470
Alkalosis.
Your blood is too alkaline.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.992
It's becoming too basic.
The hydrogen concentration,

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:57.003
hydrogen ion concentration in your blood

00:00:57.003 --> 00:00:59.162
is getting too low.

00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:01.487
And so you might say, "Wow,
you know this feels like

00:01:01.487 --> 00:01:04.391
a fairly narrow range. How
does blood, how does our body

00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:07.633
put up with acidic
things, acidic molecules

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:11.578
entering our blood, or basic
molecules entering our blood.

00:01:11.578 --> 00:01:14.078
How can it handle that without our pH,

00:01:14.078 --> 00:01:18.278
while keeping our pH in
this range right over here?"

00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:22.084
And the answer lies in
something that's also useful

00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:25.811
for the transportation of
carbon dioxide in our blood.

00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:29.573
And this right over here,
these equilibrium reactions,

00:01:29.573 --> 00:01:32.248
we see that carbon dioxide,
when you put it in the blood,

00:01:32.248 --> 00:01:34.139
which is primarily water,

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:37.988
so carbon dioxide in aqueous
solution, it will react.

00:01:37.988 --> 00:01:41.074
And we have some enzymes
that help this along,

00:01:41.074 --> 00:01:44.091
but it will react to form carbonic acid.

00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:48.070
Let me write this down. It will
react to form carbonic acid,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.970
which is a weak acid,
this is carbonic adic.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.013
And then that can dissociate
to form bicarbonate.

00:01:55.203 --> 00:01:56.198
Let me write that over here.

00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:59.369
Bicarbonate.
Bicarbonate.

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:02.815
And a hydrogen ion, or when
we know that that would

00:02:02.815 --> 00:02:06.838
just attach to a water molecule
and become a hydronium ion.

00:02:06.838 --> 00:02:08.723
And so, why is this useful?

00:02:08.723 --> 00:02:10.134
Well, I said, it's actually part of

00:02:10.134 --> 00:02:13.765
the carbon dioxide transportation
in the blood because,

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:15.331
based on the sources I've looked at,

00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:18.050
about five to 10 percent
of your carbon dioxide

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.701
can just dissolve in the blood

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:22.793
and then also another,
roughly, five or 10 percent

00:02:22.793 --> 00:02:26.733
can actually be bound to hemoglobin

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:28.184
and be transported that way.

00:02:28.184 --> 00:02:30.919
But the bulk of it actually
needs to go through,

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.793
needs to actually be
transformed, needs to react

00:02:34.793 --> 00:02:36.787
to become carbonic acid and bicarbonate

00:02:36.787 --> 00:02:38.597
in order to be transported.

00:02:38.597 --> 00:02:41.346
In fact, in your blood,
most of the carbon dioxide

00:02:41.346 --> 00:02:44.205
in your blood is actually in
this form right over here.

00:02:44.205 --> 00:02:46.179
And in particular, bicarbonate.

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.829
In the sources that I look at,

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.078
80 to 90 percent of the
carbon dioxide in your blood

00:02:50.078 --> 00:02:51.879
is being transported in these forms,

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.556
and primarily as bicarbonate.

00:02:55.556 --> 00:02:57.838
So this isn't the topic of this video,

00:02:57.838 --> 00:03:01.681
what's a useful way to transfer,
to transport carbon dioxide

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:05.149
in your blood, but this is how we do it.

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:07.034
But the topic of this video is why this is

00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:11.510
also useful for maintaining
our blood pH in this range.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.686
Because these equilibrium
reactions between

00:03:13.686 --> 00:03:17.168
carbon dioxide, carbonic
acid, and bicarbonate

00:03:17.168 --> 00:03:19.486
this is a buffer system.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:24.673
This is a buffer, this is a buffer system.

00:03:24.673 --> 00:03:27.370
And the word "buffer,"
in our everyday language,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.243
it refers to something
that kind of smooths

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:31.632
the impact of something,

00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:33.914
or it reduces the shock of something.

00:03:33.914 --> 00:03:35.977
And that's exactly what's happening here.

00:03:35.977 --> 00:03:37.376
Let's think about, remember,

00:03:37.376 --> 00:03:38.906
these are all equilibrium reactions,

00:03:38.906 --> 00:03:42.207
this is a weak acid, and you
can even look at the different

00:03:42.207 --> 00:03:44.981
constituents of these
molecules and account for them.

00:03:44.981 --> 00:03:46.302
You have one carbon here,

00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:47.288
one carbon here,

00:03:47.288 --> 00:03:48.335
one carbon there.

00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:50.368
You have one, two, three oxygens there.

00:03:50.368 --> 00:03:52.030
You have one, two, three oxygens there.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.554
One, two, three oxygens there.

00:03:53.554 --> 00:03:56.301
You have two hydrogens, two
hydrogens, two hydrogens.

00:03:56.301 --> 00:03:58.313
But let's just think about what if you

00:03:58.313 --> 00:04:00.749
started dumping hydrogen
ions in the blood.

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:05.524
So, what if you were
to dump hydrogen ions,

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:09.453
what's going to happen?

00:04:09.453 --> 00:04:11.245
Well, if you dump more hydrogen ions,

00:04:11.245 --> 00:04:14.396
if this right over here increases.

00:04:14.396 --> 00:04:16.539
Actually, let me put it this way,

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:17.974
if you were to just dump hydrogen ions

00:04:17.974 --> 00:04:19.848
and if you didn't have this buffer system,

00:04:19.848 --> 00:04:22.285
then your pH would decrease.

00:04:22.285 --> 00:04:24.534
Your pH would go down,
and if you do it enough,

00:04:24.534 --> 00:04:27.264
your pH, you would end up with acidosis.

00:04:27.264 --> 00:04:29.584
But lucky for us, we
have this buffer system.

00:04:29.584 --> 00:04:34.017
And so if you increase your
hydrogen ion concentrations,

00:04:34.017 --> 00:04:36.786
Le Chatelier's principle tells us,

00:04:36.786 --> 00:04:38.770
"Hey, these equilibrium reactions

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.040
are going to move to the left."

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.901
So the more hydrogen ions you
have sitting in the blood,

00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:46.372
the more likely they're gonna bump

00:04:46.372 --> 00:04:48.487
into the bicarbonate in just the right way

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:51.135
to form carbonic acid.

00:04:51.135 --> 00:04:54.017
And the more carbonic acid
that you have in the blood,

00:04:54.017 --> 00:04:56.043
well, it's the less likely
that you're going to have

00:04:56.043 --> 00:04:58.036
the carbon dioxide reacting with the water

00:04:58.036 --> 00:05:00.736
to form more carbonic acid.

00:05:00.736 --> 00:05:02.901
So, as you add more hydrogen ions,

00:05:02.901 --> 00:05:05.240
they're just going to be sopped up

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.806
by the bicarbonate.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.198
So this equilibrium, this
set of equilibrium reactions

00:05:09.198 --> 00:05:11.333
is going to move to the left.

00:05:11.333 --> 00:05:14.425
So you're not going to
have as big effect on pH.

00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:18.830
And similarly, if you dumped some base,

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.860
let's say, you dumped some base

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.194
in your blood right over here,

00:05:25.194 --> 00:05:29.071
well, instead of it just
making your pH go up,

00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:31.014
and possibly give you alkalosis,

00:05:31.014 --> 00:05:33.961
well now, the base is going
to sop up the hydrogen ions,

00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:36.555
and typically that would
just make your pH go up,

00:05:36.555 --> 00:05:39.972
but if you have these things going down,

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:42.538
well then, you have
fewer of these to react

00:05:42.538 --> 00:05:44.641
and have the equilibrium
reaction go to the left

00:05:44.641 --> 00:05:45.951
and so the reaction is going to move

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:48.066
more and more to the right.

00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:49.599
And so this reaction,
you're just gonna have more

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.933
carbon dioxide being
converted to carbonic acid

00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:53.567
being converted to bicarbonate.

00:05:53.567 --> 00:05:56.235
This whole thing is going
to move to the right.

00:05:56.235 --> 00:05:58.029
And so it's going to be
able, to some degree,

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.854
replace the lost hydrogen ions.

00:06:00.854 --> 00:06:03.172
So this right over here's a buffer system.

00:06:03.172 --> 00:06:06.558
It helps dampen the
impact, as if you have more

00:06:06.558 --> 00:06:08.532
hydrogen ions enter the system,

00:06:08.532 --> 00:06:09.811
or as if you have something

00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:12.149
sopping up all of the hydrogen ions.

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:14.049
And it's super important for us,

00:06:14.049 --> 00:06:15.510
well, just being able to live.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.093
And frankly, all mammalian systems.
