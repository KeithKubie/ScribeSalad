"The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning"

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.200
Well, okay. This could kinda be interesting.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.680
I mean, the animation looks pretty good, and maybe we could see the backstory of some of these characters.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:31.060
Maybe we can see Ursula and how she got where she was, and the interaction with the sisters, and the father, and the mother...

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.260
Okay, this could be interesting.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.140
It starts off showing Ariel and her sisters with her mother and father, and suddenly this...

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.860
pirate ship comes outta nowhere! Okay...

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.020
And apparently kills the mother in a very awkwardly done edit.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.060
Seriously, you couldn't just cut to black? This is really weirdly done, but okay, let's keep going.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.640
So! The father is so discouraged by the death of his wife and the fact that she loved music so much

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.920
that he decides to outlaw music throughout the kingdom.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.420
Oh! It's this stupid thing!

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.280
Yeah. The story that you've heard a million times that probably started with "Footloose"

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.040
and, yeah, wasn't even really good when they did it then.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.600
And like that, you know every single damn thing that's gonna happen.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.900
Everybody's sad. They all want to sing. But they can't sing!

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.620
So, Ariel goes and tries to find out where she can sing, but that conflicts with the father,

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.760
and they get angry at each other, and he's not really bad, he just doesn't see what's really important,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.880
and they're gonna butt heads, and then some stupid, last-minute villain is gonna come in and try to screw everything up.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.100
Oh, God!

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.700
No surprises, nothing new, even half the songs you've heard before!

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.800
They're just sorta reworked versions of famous conga songs.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.420
In fact, how do they know the song "Shake SeÃ±ora" if they live underwater?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.420
THAT-- THAT SONG WOULDN'T EVEN BE RECORDED YET!

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.320
Okay, I'm probably thinking too hard about that, but, nevertheless, this is not a very good movie.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.480
It's not... *awful*, per se. I mean, it definitely has awful moments in it, but,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.080
again, you can definitely get an idea that they're trying to put something decent together.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.120
I mean, the pacing's not that bad; it will take moments to be quiet and sort of let the emotion sink in.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:15.960
They do try to give the sisters personalities, but there are six of 'em, so it's kinda hard to remember which one's which.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.600
And, like I said before, the animation is damn impressive!

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.200
I mean, okay, we're not gonna see any grand landscapes in this or anything,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.580
but just look at the line work! Look at the expressions!

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.340
Look at how flowing and elegant it is!

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.940
For a direct-to-DVD movie-- hell, just for an animated Disney movie in general,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.720
it's really, really nicely drawn!

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.320
It's also interesting to see a movie where not only the main characters are good-looking.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.460
I mean, you know how this works. It's usually the male and the female, and they look really pretty or handsome,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.180
and everyone else is supposed to look cartoon-y and over-the-top.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.320
Here, the sisters are in a lot of the film, and they're all drawn beautiful.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.020
So it's kind of interesting just seeing these really good-looking characters throughout the entire thing.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.640
It isn't just the main lead.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.360
They allow for some nice expressions and flowing movements, and it's like I said: Really, really nicely drawn.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.620
But that doesn't excuse the fact this is just a dumb story with dumb writing.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.280
There's this villain played by Sally Field who's kinda the servant of the king,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.380
looks after the girls, and sorta wants to be the second-in-command.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.700
Once in a while, she'll get a laugh, I mean Sally Field can be very funny.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.580
But to answer the question that *everybody* is thinking, including myself...

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.660
No. It's not Ursula.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.260
Well, wait a minute! In the first film, she describes herself that she used to be in the palace,

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.820
and then she did these evil things, and she was thrown out.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.500
That's exactly what this character does! And it even kinda looks like a younger, skinnier version.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.880
I mean, why-- Why wasn't this Ursula?!

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:47.120
She even has killer eels that go after the heroes. It was so obviously meant to be Ursula!

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.220
I was waiting the whole time to see some sort of magic zapped her, or she was transformed,

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.440
or something, or they give her a new name like "Ursula" is actually a demeaning name,

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.240
and "That's what you'll be called, now," or something, but... no.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.520
It's just a completely different character that has Ursula's backstory!

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.800
Come one! You coulda had Sally Field play a young Ursula! We wouldn't have minded.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.860
So, yeah. The movie's pretty stupid and makes no sense.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.460
I guess if you just have little kids that want to see it just to see nice music

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.020
and Ariel swimming around looking pretty, it's... fine for that.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:25.000
It's not like "Beauty and the Beast 3" or "Mulan 2" where there's arguably bad stuff for kids in it.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.280
I mean, it's... harmless... but it's also mindless. Nothing in it is original. Every line, every plot thread...

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.560
You can point to a million other movies that have not only done it but have done it better.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.080
I guess it's fine if you just want to distract your kids for an hour and a half...

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.280
but anyone looking for the magic of the original, this one's dead in the water.
