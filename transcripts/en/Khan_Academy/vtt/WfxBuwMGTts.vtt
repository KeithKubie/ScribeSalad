00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.970
- [Instructor] What we
see here are two maps

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.170
of congressional districts.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.190
On the left we see some
congressional districts

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.030
in and around Austin, Texas.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.140
This black line shows us Travis County

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.780
where Austin, Texas is.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.980
And on this right map we see
the congressional districts

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.780
in and around Chicago, Illinois.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.830
What I'd like you to
do is pause this video

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.430
and see if you see anything interesting

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.670
about the shapes of these
congressional districts.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.400
Well some things might
immediately jump out at you.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.980
Here in Chicago, Illinois,
this fourth district

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.780
in particular seems kind of fishy.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.690
It's often known as the earmuff district.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.610
It has this northern part
and this southern part,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.280
and then it's actually
connected just by an interstate,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.590
not by the things on either
side of that interstate.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.480
So that doesn't seem like a natural shape

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.120
for a congressional district.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.450
And then here in Austin, Texas,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.130
you see that the votes in Travis County

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.300
are split amongst many
congressional districts.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.680
And so the question
that should be surfacing

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.890
in your brain is,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.220
why are these districts shaped that way?

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.237
And the answer that many
people will give you

00:01:03.237 --> 00:01:06.232
is it's because of a gerrymandering.

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:07.590
Gerrymandering,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.160
which is the idea of shaping districts

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.330
to benefit one political party or another.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.850
Every 10 years there's a U.S. Census,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.254
and based on that census,
different states will

00:01:22.254 --> 00:01:24.330
might get a few more representatives

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.040
or a few less representatives,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.570
and so state legislatures
will often have to redistrict.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.262
And so that's when this occurs.

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:35.240
And so the first question
you might ask is,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.480
well that's a very strange word,

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.200
where does it come from?

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.710
And that goes all the way back to 1812

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.370
when the then governor of Massachusetts,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.380
Elbridge Gerry, Gerry was
how you pronounced his name

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.570
although now it's gerrymandering.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.800
He decided to sign the
bill that would reapportion

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.450
the state senate districts.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.290
And you have this one really
strangely shaped district

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.010
right over here that
people said hey that looks

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.390
like a salamander.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.240
And so they created a
portmanteau which is really

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.500
just a combination of
words around Elbridge Gerry

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.580
and the back half of salamander.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.590
So you have gerrymander,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.060
which is creating these
districts to advantage

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.310
one party or the other.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.090
Elbridge Gerry did it for the
Democratic Republican party

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.160
against the Federalist,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.180
but now it's Republicans versus Democrats.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.690
So now let's go back to the two districts

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.740
that we looked at and think about what are

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.770
the implications of it?

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.650
Who will, who does the
gerrymandering benefit?

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.750
So in the case of Austin, Texas,

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.950
Austin, Texas is an urban area.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.290
Urban areas tend to lean more left.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.980
And it does lean more Democratic.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.980
It's actually more liberal
than most urban areas in Texas.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.500
But it's surrounded by more rural areas

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.120
that lean right.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.860
And so it would be advantageous
and it is advantageous

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.210
for Republicans to split
those Democratic votes

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.330
amongst these Republican districts.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.840
In the case of Chicago, it's
a little bit less obvious.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.240
This type of gerrymandering was done

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.760
by a Democratic legislature,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.780
but it's a little bit less
obvious what's going on

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:10.900
here with the fourth district

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.290
because it is actually
surrounded by districts

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.350
represented by Democrats.

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.510
What you need to appreciate
is when this gerrymandering

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.410
is done it's often done by
sophisticated computer algorithms

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:22.860
and there's all sorts of implications

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.770
of stretching one district or another.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:26.810
This is just one tactic that you see here

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.040
is taking a bunch of Democratic votes

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.020
and diluting them amongst a
bunch of Republican districts.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.660
You might see it the other way.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.780
You could have situations
where you redistrict

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.690
so that an incumbent no
longer lives in their district

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.810
and so they wouldn't be
the incumbent anymore.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.820
You might see redistricting
to force two incumbents

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.460
to go against each other.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.780
You might see redistricting
where you're collecting

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.500
pockets from certain
constituencies so that

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.100
you can make a district so that they would

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.620
have representation and that's the one

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.420
that's often cited for the
district four right over here.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.900
Because these are heavily Hispanic areas

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.760
around or in Chicago.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.360
Now I'll leave you with
a newspaper article

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.150
from the Salem Gazette in 1813

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.310
that talks about at least
how the Federalists felt

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:11.910
about that first official gerrymandering.

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.280
This is in response to Elbridge
Gerry's signing of the bill

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.970
to allow for that
salamander shaped district

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.278
that advantaged the Democratic Republicans

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:25.120
against the Federalists.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.040
Federalists, followers of Washington.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.650
Again behold and shudder at the exhibition

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.630
of this terrific dragon,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.800
brought forth to swallow
and devour your liberties

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.880
and equal rights.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.180
You can see in the
picture it actually does

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.950
look like a dragon, they put wings on it.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.860
Unholy party spirit and
inordinate love of power

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.300
gave it birth.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.890
Your patriotism and hatred of tyranny

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.240
must by one vigorous struggle strangle it

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.020
in its infancy.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.270
The iniquitous law
which cut up and severed

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.170
this Commonwealth into
districts is kindred

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.850
to the arbitrary deeds of Napoleon

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.584
when he partitioned the
territories of innocent nations

00:05:05.584 --> 00:05:07.700
to suit his sovereign will.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.870
You gotta remember this
is right around the time

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.470
of Napoleon conquering much of Europe.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.880
This law inflicted a grievous
wound on the Constitution.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.280
It in fact subverts and
changes our form of government,

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.480
which ceases to be Republican
as long as an aristocratic

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.400
House of Lords under the form of a Senate

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.500
tyrannizes over the people
and silences and stifles

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.340
the voice of the majority.

00:05:35.235 --> 00:05:36.710
And then it goes on to say,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.550
will you then permit a party
to disfranchise the people,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.000
to convert the Senate
chamber into a fortress

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.750
in which ambitious office-seekers
may entrench themselves

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.240
and set at defiance the
frowns of the people?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.230
No, this usurping
faction must be dislodged

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.540
from its stronghold.
