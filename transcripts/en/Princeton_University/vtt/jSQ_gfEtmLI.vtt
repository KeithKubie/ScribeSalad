[BIRDS CHIRPING]

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.993
[UPBEAT MUSIC]

00:00:19.684 --> 00:00:20.884
BEN SORKIN: My name is 
Ben Sorkin,

00:00:20.884 --> 00:00:22.244
and I'm a senior studying

00:00:22.244 --> 00:00:23.622
mechanical and 
aerospace engineering.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.007
This is kind of 
my home to tinker

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.340
and create and 
build things.

00:00:32.082 --> 00:00:35.508
150 to 420 million gallons
of unburned gasoline

00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:37.807
are released into U.S. waters every year

00:00:37.807 --> 00:00:41.380
by just the pleasure-craft 
industry alone.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.023
The U.S. switching 
to electric outboards

00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:45.823
would work on completely
eliminating this number.

00:00:45.823 --> 00:00:47.663
I want to be at the forefront
of this technology,

00:00:47.663 --> 00:00:49.202
at the forefront 
of innovation

00:00:49.202 --> 00:00:52.202
concerning sustainable 
technologies.

00:00:55.885 --> 00:00:56.926
VIVIAN CHANG: Hi, 
I'm Vivian Chang,

00:00:56.926 --> 00:00:58.740
a second-year master's
student at Woodrow Wilson,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.265
and we're about to 
start our second

00:01:00.265 --> 00:01:04.432
volunteer training workshop
for the Day of Action.

00:01:07.785 --> 00:01:10.729
I think individually a lot of
people are kind of waking up.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.686
A lot of my friends who have
never participated in protests

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:15.049
or don't necessarily
keep up with news about,

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.926
you know, the government 
or civil rights,

00:01:17.926 --> 00:01:20.969
are now like reading, talking,
organizing themselves,

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.065
and that's really important.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:25.782
ZIA MIAN: So, my task 
is say a few words about

00:01:25.782 --> 00:01:30.248
how and why so many members
of the Princeton faculty

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:32.998
are here and being part of today,

00:01:34.843 --> 00:01:39.384
and we'll also be here
tomorrow and the day after

00:01:39.384 --> 00:01:42.249
and four years from now when
many of the students here

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:45.545
are gone and a new generation
of students are here.

00:01:45.545 --> 00:01:47.445
Intellectuals, especially academics,

00:01:47.445 --> 00:01:49.806
have the power that comes
from political liberty,

00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:53.973
from access to information,
and freedom of expression.

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:58.867
We take them for granted
here, but we shouldn't.

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:01.587
It is the responsibility 
of intellectuals

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:04.754
to speak the truth 
and to expose lies,

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:08.463
and what we're trying to do here,

00:02:08.463 --> 00:02:10.145
all the faculty 
that's participating,

00:02:10.145 --> 00:02:13.062
is to practice that responsibility.

00:02:15.827 --> 00:02:19.410
HENRY HORN: The books here are
all about butterflies,

00:02:21.443 --> 00:02:23.483
which is what I'm writing
about at the moment.

00:02:23.483 --> 00:02:27.806
There are tree books
together, bird books together.

00:02:27.806 --> 00:02:29.427
Over around behind you,

00:02:29.427 --> 00:02:32.594
these are all individual 
project boxes

00:02:33.566 --> 00:02:37.733
for research projects or
teaching projects done or undone.

00:02:40.866 --> 00:02:42.367
Hi, I'm Henry Horn.

00:02:42.367 --> 00:02:45.470
I'm an emeritus, 
but not so you'd notice,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.637
professor of ecology and
evolutionary biology at Princeton,

00:02:50.523 --> 00:02:55.347
and I've actually been
teaching here for 52 years now.

00:02:55.347 --> 00:02:58.307
Of course, I've seen waves
of environmental concerns,

00:02:58.307 --> 00:03:02.474
the first in the '70s
and the first Earth Day.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:06.707
There was a great deal
of activity at that time,

00:03:06.707 --> 00:03:09.827
and then it just 
waned for quite a while.

00:03:09.827 --> 00:03:13.702
I think the thing that is
missing is the long view,

00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:17.363
the long view of history,
the long view of the future,

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:19.987
and notion of what 
real sustainability

00:03:19.987 --> 00:03:23.570
with humans as part of
nature is all about.
