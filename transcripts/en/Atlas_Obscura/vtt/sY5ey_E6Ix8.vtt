(shoveling dirt)

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.120
- I become interested in
wanting to dig a grave

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.410
because it's such an important part of

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.430
kind of being human and
how we care for the dead,

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.400
and what we do for our loved ones,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.150
for other people in the community.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.180
But the way that modern funeral practices

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.310
happen in the United States,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.590
a lot of times we're so divorced from

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.200
participating actively in this process.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.920
It's just something that I wanted to have

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.440
learn physical experience with.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.273
I'm Chris Naka.

00:00:37.273 --> 00:00:39.270
I'm the Director of
video at Atlas Obscura,

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.290
and I'm gonna to try to dig a grave.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.110
I'm a little nervous
about digging this grave

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.340
just because of the
amount of labor involved.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.140
I don't really know what to expect.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.330
I know the further down I go,
the harder it's going to be,

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.350
so I'm worried I'm gonna run out of gas.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.460
It's like a reckoning
of my lifestyle choices

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.880
where I think I should've been working out

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.320
and exercising more to prepare
myself to dig this grave,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.653
but I will pay for those
choices in the coming days.

00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:23.440
- The Steelmantown Cemetery
is a family cemetery of mine.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.300
My family came here in 1680

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.470
and created a bunch of little villages

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.240
that surrounded the industry of the time.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.510
It's pretty ancient by American standards.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.910
We are adjacent to the
Bell Plains State Forest,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.923
which is 25,000 acres.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.900
The Steelmantown Natural Burial Grounds,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.544
it really revolves around the
use of non-toxic chemicals,

00:01:42.544 --> 00:01:46.820
to not embalm bodies,
biodegradable burial containers

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.340
like shrouds or pine boxes,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.220
no concrete vaults.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.140
Anything that doesn't really require

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.000
a lot of natural resources

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.270
or things like that

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.020
to really steward to the next generation

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.170
and to take care of
the environment itself.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.420
- And any pointers for a first-timer,

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.503
as far as like,

00:02:10.448 --> 00:02:14.260
my operative assumption was to

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.710
start slow

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.640
so I don't run out of gas soon.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.650
If I can continuously dig that
would be better than like--

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:22.640
- Yeah, slow and steady.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.490
- Yeah. (laughs)
- Yeah, slow and Steady.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.490
And don't think about it too much.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.890
Because if you start thinking about it,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.849
like, oh, my gosh, I'm only a foot deep,

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:30.960
(both laugh)

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.223
you're gonna get into trouble,
so just slow and steady.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.240
The way I try to look at it
is usually you can get about

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.923
six inches deep for every shovel full.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.260
Every row you're six inches
closer to being done.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.620
So all you got to do is
grab a hold of this here and

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.283
you and I can start walking her down.

00:02:53.248 --> 00:02:55.210
[Ed] Well, essentially
the hand dig a grave,

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:56.900
it doesn't have to be perfect.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.190
Essentially, a grave
typically is 32 inches wide

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.170
by about seven foot long.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.380
It can be anywhere from
three to six foot deep

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.770
depending on the facility
or the person digging it

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.220
and if they're in a shroud
or if they're in a casket.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.790
Really you just have to have a lot of

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.240
inner strength to get it done.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.620
After you mark your corners,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.340
you would then take a straight shovel,

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.614
and you would outline it
and basically start to dig.

00:03:19.614 --> 00:03:23.114
(shovel breaking up dirt)

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.250
- Okay, now toss all this?

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.500
- Yep, and there you go.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.509
So you got your outline.

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.270
(laughs)

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.140
Okay, you did a good job. It looks great.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.740
- It's tough. I'm not going to lie

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.070
but the ground is really
soft here, which is great

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.860
and I'm just trying to pace myself

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:51.800
so I keep moving and
I don't get tired out.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.370
There's a lot of muscles
in my body that I don't use

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.010
on a regular basis

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.060
so it's gonna feel great tomorrow

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.130
but, like Ed said, don't
think about it too much,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.250
just go at a slow and steady pace

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.310
and every pass is six inches.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.550
So we'll get there.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.597
Does anyone come out here
and they request to dig

00:04:13.597 --> 00:04:17.930
the grave themselves
for the family member?

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.140
- I've had people request
but we don't allow it

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.840
only because its so arduous,

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.673
- [Chris] Yeah.

00:04:22.673 --> 00:04:25.320
but we allow them to participate
in all the other aspects.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.330
It goes in a lot easier that it comes out.

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.163
- [Chris] Okay.

00:04:28.163 --> 00:04:30.630
- So, when they want to fill it in,

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.723
it's much easier for
the family to do that.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.190
- Well, I'm real appreciative

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.720
of you giving me a chance
to see how far I go.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.690
- [Ed] Oh, absolutely.

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.670
I have no doubt you'll make it.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:42.770
- I have doubts, Ed.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.568
(laughs)

00:05:03.703 --> 00:05:05.953
(grunting)

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:13.973
- [Chris] Like Ed said the
soil is super sandy here,

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.740
which makes it easy, but
it looks like a grave.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.260
I mean, I feel like I'm digging a grave

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.480
as hard as that is to do

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.660
and however much I have to
go, I can definitely tell why

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.790
people who commit murder or
need to dispose of bodies

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.890
in a clandestine fashion

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.050
only go about this far because

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.820
it's hard.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.770
- [Ed] Well, a lot of people
would've given up by now.

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.603
- [Chris] Yeah.
- That's what I mean.

00:05:39.603 --> 00:05:41.780
It really has to do with endurance.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.870
It's all about slow,
steady, and endurance.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.670
- I mean it's one of the best
pieces of advice that Ed, Sr.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.750
has been giving me is do half
shovels and just go quickly

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.583
(Ed laughs)

00:05:53.583 --> 00:05:54.900
instead of trying to do big shovels

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.961
and yeah you'll tire yourself out.

00:05:56.961 --> 00:05:58.400
- True, true.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.150
- [Chris] Now I think
I'm getting down into

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.800
a little bit more rocky territory.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.400
- [Ed] Yeah, getting into the gravel

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.870
but that also means you're
getting close to being done.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.442
It's the right way to
think about it. (laughs)

00:06:11.442 --> 00:06:13.500
You know it's a good lesson
for anyone to learn though

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.830
to come out and do something like this.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.663
- Yeah.

00:06:19.195 --> 00:06:21.612
(raking mud)

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.160
- [Chris] We hit water.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.213
It's time to come out of the hole.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.163
Ed says four feet is acceptable. (laughs)

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.170
But it feels good because I actually

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.140
can't believe I dug this hole.

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:52.970
I didn't think I would do
this well and it's crazy

00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:55.024
that

00:06:55.943 --> 00:06:57.830
30,000 years ago

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.810
people were doing this

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:02.030
to take care of the
dead and it's beautiful.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.863
I think.

00:07:02.863 --> 00:07:04.080
I mean it's so much work

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:13.250
and I have a giant appreciation
for that now. (laughs)

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.250
It's weird to feel like
an activity like digging

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.090
a grave can make you feel closer to people

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:21.200
but I definitely feel like it was great

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.370
spending time with Ed and Ed today.

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.880
I mean, it would've been a very lonely

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.643
enterprise to do this
by yourself. (laughs)

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.703
- [Ed] I will tell you this,

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:34.850
I would hire you.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:35.890
You did a good job.

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:38.473
(Chris laughs)

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:49.250
- Okay, so when people would walk up

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:50.790
you'd hand them a shovel
and they'd get busy.

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:53.120
So whoever would like to join us

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.020
in this joyous event. (laughs)

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.260
Well, I got to let Chris
take the first shovel.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.103
He's gotta throw the first shovel in.

00:08:04.096 --> 00:08:06.020
(shoveling dirt)

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:07.515
Alright, here we go.

00:08:07.515 --> 00:08:10.265
(shoveling dirt)
