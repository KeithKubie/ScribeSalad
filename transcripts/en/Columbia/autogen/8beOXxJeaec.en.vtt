by this is that the modern economic era

there was a pretty deep process of

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790
there was a pretty deep process of
 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.229
there was a pretty deep process of
divergence between the industrialized

happened is that the mechanisms that

happened is that the mechanisms that
 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:52.669

also experience the rapid economic
 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.820
also experience the rapid economic

catching up which is the crucial idea
that it's economics is a lot about

that it's economics is a lot about
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.300
that it's economics is a lot about
technology and economic develop

is a lot about adopting technologies

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209
is a lot about adopting technologies
 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.770
is a lot about adopting technologies
that are already available from

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780
that are already available from
 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.420
that are already available from
technology leaders but have not yet

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430
technology leaders but have not yet
 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.979
technology leaders but have not yet
diffused to technology followers thus

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
diffused to technology followers thus
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.589
diffused to technology followers thus
giving the opportunity for a very quick

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599
giving the opportunity for a very quick

catching up by virtue of that catching
up process the gap between the rich and

up process the gap between the rich and
 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.100
up process the gap between the rich and
the poor will narrow and the most

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110
the poor will narrow and the most
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.490
the poor will narrow and the most
dramatic aspect of that is the rise of

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500
dramatic aspect of that is the rise of
 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.699
dramatic aspect of that is the rise of
China because that's 1.3 billion people

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709
China because that's 1.3 billion people
 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.250
China because that's 1.3 billion people
because the per capita income though

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260
because the per capita income though
 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.729
because the per capita income though
hard to measure with precision is rising

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739
hard to measure with precision is rising
 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.979
hard to measure with precision is rising
probably at 8 to 10 percent per year

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989
probably at 8 to 10 percent per year
 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.039
probably at 8 to 10 percent per year
because by the rule of 70 that means

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049
because by the rule of 70 that means
 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.240
because by the rule of 70 that means
that the doubling time is 70 divided by

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250
that the doubling time is 70 divided by
 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.199
that the doubling time is 70 divided by
8 which is a little bit less than 9

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209
8 which is a little bit less than 9
 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.800
8 which is a little bit less than 9
years or 70 divided by 10 which means a

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810
years or 70 divided by 10 which means a
 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.620
years or 70 divided by 10 which means a
7 year doubling time which means we've

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630
7 year doubling time which means we've
 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.979
7 year doubling time which means we've
got an extraordinary process of catching

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989
got an extraordinary process of catching
 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.770
got an extraordinary process of catching
up underway compared to the growth rates

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780
up underway compared to the growth rates
 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.470
up underway compared to the growth rates
of the US economy in per capita terms

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480
of the US economy in per capita terms
 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.890
of the US economy in per capita terms
which are about 2% per year a doubling

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900
which are about 2% per year a doubling
 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.210
which are about 2% per year a doubling
time of 35 years so I believe that we've

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220
time of 35 years so I believe that we've
 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.530

changed from a period of divergence to a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540
changed from a period of divergence to a
 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.340
changed from a period of divergence to a
period of convergence I'll say a little

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350
period of convergence I'll say a little
 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.789
period of convergence I'll say a little
bit more why in just a few minutes the

second fundamental driver is the
 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.809
second fundamental driver is the
continuing explosion of the number of us

that explosion has slowed considerably
 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.810
that explosion has slowed considerably
but the absolute increases of the human

which I think is quite interesting is

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:00.310
which I think is quite interesting is
 

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:04.830
which I think is quite interesting is

the idea that while in general I'm a

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.449

the fact that technology's good ideas

and again I think our politics are very

and again I think our politics are very
poorly considered for all of this so

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:29.670
poorly considered for all of this so
 

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:31.970
poorly considered for all of this so
these are the four drivers that I think

these are the four drivers that I think
 

00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:35.800
these are the four drivers that I think
are critical the four drivers being

obviously this is all hunch but if it's

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:27.460
obviously this is all hunch but if it's
 

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:31.110
obviously this is all hunch but if it's
true it's pretty significant because it

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:31.120
true it's pretty significant because it
 

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.279

developing world and of the relative
 

00:29:46.929 --> 00:29:50.159

power of the United States which i think

00:29:50.159 --> 00:29:50.169
power of the United States which i think
 

00:29:50.169 --> 00:29:53.279

and so that's the relative concept and I

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240
and so that's the relative concept and I
 

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.889
and so that's the relative concept and I
think that it's a pretty much a likely

00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899
think that it's a pretty much a likely
 

00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:09.930
think that it's a pretty much a likely
phenomenon and as far as I'm concerned

00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:09.940
phenomenon and as far as I'm concerned
 

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.169
phenomenon and as far as I'm concerned
fine because it basically means the

00:30:13.169 --> 00:30:13.179
fine because it basically means the
 

00:30:13.179 --> 00:30:15.629
fine because it basically means the
spread of prosperity to more parts of

00:30:15.629 --> 00:30:15.639
spread of prosperity to more parts of
 

00:30:15.639 --> 00:30:19.350
spread of prosperity to more parts of
the world so one way to think about this

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360
the world so one way to think about this
 

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:23.580
the world so one way to think about this
is in terms of GNP shares and this is an

00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:23.590

pork grow faster than the rich but as
they get richer they slow down so they

00:30:58.919 --> 00:30:58.929
they get richer they slow down so they
 

00:30:58.929 --> 00:31:00.690
they get richer they slow down so they
don't overtake the rich they just

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:00.700
don't overtake the rich they just
 

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.730
don't overtake the rich they just
converge with the rich that's the way

00:31:02.730 --> 00:31:02.740
converge with the rich that's the way

poor before 1800 so the share of the
 

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:48.090
poor before 1800 so the share of the
world's population was just the share of

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:48.100
world's population was just the share of
 

00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:50.610
world's population was just the share of
the world's GNP in a region was roughly

the world's GNP in a region was roughly
its share of population there weren't

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:53.230
its share of population there weren't

its share of population there weren't
big discrepancies of who was rich and

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120
big discrepancies of who was rich and
 

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.060
big discrepancies of who was rich and
who was poor then came the Industrial

00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:57.070
who was poor then came the Industrial
 

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.460

population could have a big share of
 

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:03.930
population could have a big share of
income and so what happened was the West

00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:03.940
income and so what happened was the West
 

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:08.130

became dominant and that's these bars

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:08.140
became dominant and that's these bars
 

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.250
became dominant and that's these bars
here obviously the the red bars and the

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:11.260
here obviously the the red bars and the
 

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.890
here obviously the the red bars and the
share of Asia in the world economy fell

00:32:13.890 --> 00:32:13.900
share of Asia in the world economy fell
 

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:19.230

from 60% to 20% and the share of Asia
 

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:23.430
from 60% to 20% and the share of Asia
and geopolitics fell from 60% to 20% if

I could put it that way in naive terms
 

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:31.260
I could put it that way in naive terms
and now this process is reversing as we

00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:31.270
and now this process is reversing as we
 

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.780

see every day like the African leaders

00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:33.790
see every day like the African leaders

telling the European leaders at the

with China now they didn't quite put it

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:43.270
with China now they didn't quite put it
 

00:32:43.270 --> 00:32:45.360
with China now they didn't quite put it
that way they said still give us aid but

00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:45.370
that way they said still give us aid but
 

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:48.780
that way they said still give us aid but
we are also dealing with China now but

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:48.790
we are also dealing with China now but
 

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:51.960
we are also dealing with China now but
you could tell the whole flavor of the

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:51.970
you could tell the whole flavor of the
 

00:32:51.970 --> 00:32:54.570
you could tell the whole flavor of the
relationship of Africa and Europe has

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:54.580
relationship of Africa and Europe has
 

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.660
relationship of Africa and Europe has
changed because there's another another

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:57.670
changed because there's another another
 

00:32:57.670 --> 00:33:02.670
changed because there's another another
party in the negotiations now and so the

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:02.680
party in the negotiations now and so the
 

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:06.000
party in the negotiations now and so the
idea that Europe can just dictate the

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:06.010
idea that Europe can just dictate the
 

00:33:06.010 --> 00:33:09.030
idea that Europe can just dictate the
following terms is passe and that's what

00:33:09.030 --> 00:33:09.040
following terms is passe and that's what
 

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.500
following terms is passe and that's what
Europe is finding because they're

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:10.510
Europe is finding because they're
 

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:12.750
Europe is finding because they're
interested in having geopolitical

00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760
interested in having geopolitical
 

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:16.140

influence in Europe in Africa they used

00:33:16.140 --> 00:33:16.150
influence in Europe in Africa they used
 

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:18.810
influence in Europe in Africa they used
to just be able to demand it but now

00:33:18.810 --> 00:33:18.820
to just be able to demand it but now
 

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:20.400
to just be able to demand it but now
they can't demand it because there's

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:20.410
they can't demand it because there's
 

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:23.100
they can't demand it because there's
competition from China and increasingly

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:23.110
competition from China and increasingly
 

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:27.090
competition from China and increasingly
from India as well so the African

it's interesting change of politics and

it's interesting change of politics and
if you project Asia becomes again more

what's very interesting demographically

00:34:04.889 --> 00:34:04.899
what's very interesting demographically
 

00:34:04.899 --> 00:34:07.889
what's very interesting demographically
is that Africa will be more than 20% of

is that Africa will be more than 20% of

geopolitically as well

actually I think quite likely so these

actually I think quite likely so these
 

00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:37.740
actually I think quite likely so these
are the change of GNP and this is just

00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:37.750
are the change of GNP and this is just
 

00:34:37.750 --> 00:34:41.159

of the Chinese economy right now a
little bit more than twice the size

00:35:06.059 --> 00:35:06.069
little bit more than twice the size
 

00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:09.299
little bit more than twice the size
actually so the u.s. is about a 14

00:35:09.299 --> 00:35:09.309
actually so the u.s. is about a 14
 

00:35:09.309 --> 00:35:11.640
actually so the u.s. is about a 14
trillion dollar economy China's about a

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:11.650
trillion dollar economy China's about a
 

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:17.130
trillion dollar economy China's about a
6 trillion dollar economy that's in per

00:35:17.130 --> 00:35:17.140
6 trillion dollar economy that's in per
 

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.230
6 trillion dollar economy that's in per
capita terms the gaps much wider because

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240
capita terms the gaps much wider because
 

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.670
capita terms the gaps much wider because
China is also four times the population

00:35:22.670 --> 00:35:22.680
China is also four times the population
 

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.490
China is also four times the population
so that means about 1/8 the per capita

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:26.500
so that means about 1/8 the per capita
 

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.720
so that means about 1/8 the per capita
income level but with China's rapid

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:30.730
income level but with China's rapid
 

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.319
income level but with China's rapid
growth by 2025 China will probably be a

00:35:34.319 --> 00:35:34.329
growth by 2025 China will probably be a
 

00:35:34.329 --> 00:35:36.450
growth by 2025 China will probably be a
larger economy than the United States

00:35:36.450 --> 00:35:36.460
larger economy than the United States
 

00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:41.519
larger economy than the United States
and by 2050 India will be a larger

00:35:41.519 --> 00:35:41.529
and by 2050 India will be a larger
 

00:35:41.529 --> 00:35:43.319
and by 2050 India will be a larger
economy than the United States not in

economy than the United States not in
 

00:35:43.329 --> 00:35:46.950

rates above six that's kind of a mess

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:44.850

from an economic development point of

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:46.770
from an economic development point of
 

00:38:46.770 --> 00:38:51.710
from an economic development point of
view having six children maybe two of

00:38:51.710 --> 00:38:51.720

view having six children maybe two of
them do not survive so a woman will have

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:55.230
them do not survive so a woman will have
 

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.060
them do not survive so a woman will have
four children surviving to adulthood and

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:58.070
four children surviving to adulthood and
 

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.010
four children surviving to adulthood and
two of those on average will be girls

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:01.020
two of those on average will be girls
 

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:03.710
two of those on average will be girls
so each mother will be raising two

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720
so each mother will be raising two
 

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.550
so each mother will be raising two
mothers to adulthood and that's the easy

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560
mothers to adulthood and that's the easy
 

00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:09.980
mothers to adulthood and that's the easy
way to realize that a fertility rate of

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:09.990
way to realize that a fertility rate of
 

00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:11.510
way to realize that a fertility rate of
around six means that the population

00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520
around six means that the population
 

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:16.160
around six means that the population
doubles every generation so on average

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:16.170
doubles every generation so on average
 

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:18.290
doubles every generation so on average
you have a doubling of the population

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:18.300
you have a doubling of the population
 

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:25.340
you have a doubling of the population
every 25 years that's a lot that's

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:25.350

what's a pathway for Africa out of

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:35.730
poverty and then oh by the way there
 

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.670

superior military power but what's quite

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:40.500
superior military power but what's quite

superior military power but what's quite
interesting is how the Ottoman Empire

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:42.900
interesting is how the Ottoman Empire
 

00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.340
interesting is how the Ottoman Empire
was a really a long time serious rival

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:46.350
was a really a long time serious rival
 

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:50.210
was a really a long time serious rival

00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:56.150

century certainly the end of the 17th

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160
century certainly the end of the 17th
 

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.980
century certainly the end of the 17th
century and then the 18th century it

00:44:57.980 --> 00:44:57.990
century and then the 18th century it
 

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:02.630
century and then the 18th century it
lost but a huge difference a huge change

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:05.330
lost but a huge difference a huge change
was simply demographic which is that

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:05.340
was simply demographic which is that
 

00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:08.150
was simply demographic which is that
Europe experienced the tremendous growth

00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160
Europe experienced the tremendous growth
 

00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:13.970
Europe experienced the tremendous growth
of population starting around 1500 the

00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980
of population starting around 1500 the
 

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.730
of population starting around 1500 the
food supply increased tremendously

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:15.740
food supply increased tremendously
 

00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.230
food supply increased tremendously
settlement of northern Europe multiplied

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240
settlement of northern Europe multiplied
 

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.940
settlement of northern Europe multiplied
and the end the Islamic population

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:21.950
and the end the Islamic population
 

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:24.910
and the end the Islamic population
pretty much stuck in the drylands of

00:45:24.910 --> 00:45:24.920
pretty much stuck in the drylands of
 

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:29.030
pretty much stuck in the drylands of
North Africa in the Middle East had very

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040
North Africa in the Middle East had very
 

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.940
North Africa in the Middle East had very
little population increase and so the

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:31.950
little population increase and so the
 

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:34.340
little population increase and so the
gap of the European population and the

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:34.350
gap of the European population and the
 

00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:36.890
gap of the European population and the
Islamic population widened tremendously

00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:36.900
Islamic population widened tremendously
 

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:40.880
Islamic population widened tremendously
and I think that this was probably the

00:45:40.880 --> 00:45:40.890
and I think that this was probably the
 

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:44.120
and I think that this was probably the
fundamental underpinning of the shifting

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:44.130
fundamental underpinning of the shifting
 

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:48.710
fundamental underpinning of the shifting
power between the West as it were and

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:48.720
power between the West as it were and
 

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.290
power between the West as it were and
the Islamic countries which had a lot of

00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300
the Islamic countries which had a lot of
 

00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.050
the Islamic countries which had a lot of
other advantages but finally lost out in

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:54.060
other advantages but finally lost out in
 

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:57.020
other advantages but finally lost out in
sheer numbers now what I find

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:57.030
sheer numbers now what I find
 

00:45:57.030 --> 00:46:00.080
sheer numbers now what I find
interesting is that with the rise of

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:00.090
interesting is that with the rise of
 

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.140
interesting is that with the rise of
modern technology ability to import food

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:03.150
modern technology ability to import food
 

00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:07.120

the right the Islamic population has

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:10.410
the right the Islamic population has
 

00:46:10.410 --> 00:46:14.750
the right the Islamic population has
absolutely soared out of sight and it is

00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760
absolutely soared out of sight and it is
 

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:18.320
absolutely soared out of sight and it is
just now reaching parity with the

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:18.330
just now reaching parity with the
 

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:24.200
just now reaching parity with the
European population and by 2050 will

00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:24.210
European population and by 2050 will
 

00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:27.380
European population and by 2050 will
outnumber Europe and I believe that this

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:27.390
outnumber Europe and I believe that this
 

00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:29.510
outnumber Europe and I believe that this
is part of the geopolitical change

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520
is part of the geopolitical change
 

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.060
is part of the geopolitical change
underway in the relative balance of

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:32.070
underway in the relative balance of
 

00:46:32.070 --> 00:46:36.400
underway in the relative balance of
power between Europe and its Islamic

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:36.410
power between Europe and its Islamic
 

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:39.230
power between Europe and its Islamic
neighbourhood and I think this is being

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:39.240
neighbourhood and I think this is being
 

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:43.550
neighbourhood and I think this is being
severely felt in Europe right now and I

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:43.560
severely felt in Europe right now and I
 

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:46.109
severely felt in Europe right now and I
think it's a real trend and change

00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119
think it's a real trend and change
 

00:46:46.119 --> 00:46:48.870
think it's a real trend and change
that is a reflection of this deeper

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.160
that is a reflection of this deeper
underlying demographic shift here's the

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:53.170
underlying demographic shift here's the
 

00:46:53.170 --> 00:46:57.269

have been able to measure it from
 

00:46:58.990 --> 00:47:02.549
have been able to measure it from
various atlases of global population the

population started out about one at the

00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:08.710
population started out about one at the
 

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:12.089
population started out about one at the
beginning of the Islamic Age and then it

00:47:12.089 --> 00:47:12.099
beginning of the Islamic Age and then it
 

00:47:12.099 --> 00:47:19.799
beginning of the Islamic Age and then it
fell to 20% by 1800 and got taken over

00:47:19.799 --> 00:47:19.809
fell to 20% by 1800 and got taken over
 

00:47:19.809 --> 00:47:21.480
fell to 20% by 1800 and got taken over
by the West the whole region was

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:21.490
by the West the whole region was
 

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:25.170
by the West the whole region was
colonized by the West and it led to a

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:25.180
colonized by the West and it led to a
 

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:26.910
colonized by the West and it led to a
certain amount of unhappiness I would

00:47:26.910 --> 00:47:26.920
certain amount of unhappiness I would
 

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.870
certain amount of unhappiness I would
say manifested in a kind of no thank you

00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880

somehow the word didn't get to the White

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920
somehow the word didn't get to the White
 

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:38.789
somehow the word didn't get to the White
House in time but it was really a very

00:47:38.789 --> 00:47:38.799
House in time but it was really a very
 

00:47:38.799 --> 00:47:41.670
House in time but it was really a very
bad adventure to think that Baghdad

00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:41.680
bad adventure to think that Baghdad
 

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.599
bad adventure to think that Baghdad
would welcome us as conquerors and now

00:47:45.599 --> 00:47:45.609
would welcome us as conquerors and now
 

00:47:45.609 --> 00:47:47.370
would welcome us as conquerors and now
it's gone back up and it's going to

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:47.380
it's gone back up and it's going to
 

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:51.720
it's gone back up and it's going to
exceed parity and so this is almost

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:51.730
exceed parity and so this is almost
 

00:47:51.730 --> 00:47:55.499

never remarked it needs more serious
study than I'm giving it but I do think

00:47:58.559 --> 00:47:58.569
study than I'm giving it but I do think
 

00:47:58.569 --> 00:48:01.499
study than I'm giving it but I do think
that the demography is really a deep

00:48:01.499 --> 00:48:01.509
that the demography is really a deep
 

00:48:01.509 --> 00:48:04.700
that the demography is really a deep

shaper of the changing power right now

between the two regions and this is just
counting males 15 to 29 you can guess

00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920
counting males 15 to 29 you can guess
 

00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:15.359
counting males 15 to 29 you can guess
why it might do that because that who's

why it might do that because that who's

why it might do that because that who's
fighting and the interestingly in 1950

00:48:21.509 --> 00:48:21.519
fighting and the interestingly in 1950
 

00:48:21.519 --> 00:48:24.569
fighting and the interestingly in 1950
when we toppled 53 when we toppled the

00:48:24.569 --> 00:48:24.579
when we toppled 53 when we toppled the
 

00:48:24.579 --> 00:48:27.450
when we toppled 53 when we toppled the
government in Iran for example there

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:27.460
government in Iran for example there
 

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.460
government in Iran for example there
just weren't that many young males in

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:29.470
just weren't that many young males in
 

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:32.700
just weren't that many young males in
the Middle East compared to the number

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:32.710
the Middle East compared to the number
 

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:37.019
the Middle East compared to the number
of young males in Europe but now there

00:48:37.019 --> 00:48:37.029
of young males in Europe but now there
 

00:48:37.029 --> 00:48:39.029
of young males in Europe but now there
are more young males in the Middle East

00:48:39.029 --> 00:48:39.039
are more young males in the Middle East
 

00:48:39.039 --> 00:48:41.789
are more young males in the Middle East
than there are in Europe and the young

00:48:41.789 --> 00:48:41.799
than there are in Europe and the young
 

00:48:41.799 --> 00:48:43.410
than there are in Europe and the young
males in Europe actually don't want to

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:43.420
males in Europe actually don't want to
 

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.539
males in Europe actually don't want to
go fight in the Middle East also so

00:48:45.539 --> 00:48:45.549
go fight in the Middle East also so
 

00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:48.180
go fight in the Middle East also so
that's an amplifying effect and the

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:48.190
that's an amplifying effect and the
 

00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:49.979
that's an amplifying effect and the
young males in the Middle East are

00:48:49.979 --> 00:48:49.989
young males in the Middle East are
 

00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:51.420
young males in the Middle East are
better at fighting than they were before

00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:51.430
better at fighting than they were before
 

00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:54.509
better at fighting than they were before
also and so this is why I think the age

00:48:54.509 --> 00:48:54.519
also and so this is why I think the age
 

00:48:54.519 --> 00:48:57.269
also and so this is why I think the age
of empire is definitively over as well

00:48:57.269 --> 00:48:57.279
of empire is definitively over as well
 

00:48:57.279 --> 00:48:59.760
of empire is definitively over as well
and all these fantasy

00:48:59.760 --> 00:48:59.770
and all these fantasy

and all these fantasy
the US as the sole superpower and

00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240
the US as the sole superpower and
 

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.570
the US as the sole superpower and

striding the world like Rome and the
 

00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:09.000
striding the world like Rome and the
last Empire and all of this I think is

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:09.010
last Empire and all of this I think is
 

00:49:09.010 --> 00:49:12.150
last Empire and all of this I think is
just pure mythology and I don't know

00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160
just pure mythology and I don't know
 

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.370
just pure mythology and I don't know

were drunk on power and other things
probably one other point that I think is

00:49:34.010 --> 00:49:34.020
probably one other point that I think is
 

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:37.620
probably one other point that I think is
worth very much bearing in mind is that

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:37.630
worth very much bearing in mind is that
 

00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:42.290
worth very much bearing in mind is that
in a global society our internal

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300
in a global society our internal
 

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.850
in a global society our internal
population structures change also to

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:44.860
population structures change also to
 

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.820
population structures change also to
reflect more of the world and this of

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:47.830
reflect more of the world and this of
 

00:49:47.830 --> 00:49:51.090
reflect more of the world and this of
course is the profound angst of the

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:51.100
course is the profound angst of the
 

00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:53.210

maybe the saving grace of our age they
can't tell whether they want to win

00:49:58.560 --> 00:49:58.570
can't tell whether they want to win

this is of course look at the profound

non-hispanic by 2050 and interestingly
 

00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:29.670
non-hispanic by 2050 and interestingly
of course the Hispanic proportion is the

00:51:29.670 --> 00:51:29.680
of course the Hispanic proportion is the
 

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:32.760
of course the Hispanic proportion is the
largest proportion these are projections

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:32.770

00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:13.880
obviously is war so everything I've said
is forecasting a continuation of peace

00:54:13.880 --> 00:54:13.890
is forecasting a continuation of peace
 

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:18.150
is forecasting a continuation of peace
but we're not so good at avoiding global

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160
but we're not so good at avoiding global
 

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.260
but we're not so good at avoiding global
war I think we better as Tom as the

00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:22.270
war I think we better as Tom as the
 

00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:24.150
war I think we better as Tom as the
songwriter Tom Lehrer once said if we're

00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160
songwriter Tom Lehrer once said if we're
 

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.980
songwriter Tom Lehrer once said if we're
going to study World War three we better

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:25.990
going to study World War three we better
 

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:28.410
going to study World War three we better
study it now because we won't have the

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:28.420
study it now because we won't have the
 

00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:32.970
study it now because we won't have the
chance to study it afterwards so one

00:54:32.970 --> 00:54:32.980
chance to study it afterwards so one
 

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:35.370
chance to study it afterwards so one
thing that could go wrong is global war

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:35.380
thing that could go wrong is global war
 

00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:39.450
thing that could go wrong is global war
a second thing is deep economic collapse

00:54:39.450 --> 00:54:39.460
a second thing is deep economic collapse
 

00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:47.700
a second thing is deep economic collapse
globally we've had one Great Depression

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:47.710
globally we've had one Great Depression
 

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:53.970
globally we've had one Great Depression
in two hundred years and it came because

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:53.980
in two hundred years and it came because
 

00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:56.460
in two hundred years and it came because
of World War only because of World War

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:56.470
of World War only because of World War
 

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:59.040
of World War only because of World War
so I don't think it's in the cards but

00:54:59.040 --> 00:54:59.050
so I don't think it's in the cards but
 

00:54:59.050 --> 00:55:01.950
so I don't think it's in the cards but
it's not impossible and the third thing

00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960
it's not impossible and the third thing
 

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:06.600
it's not impossible and the third thing
that could go wrong is ecological damage

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:06.610
that could go wrong is ecological damage
 

00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:10.290
that could go wrong is ecological damage
so severe that it undermines the very

00:55:10.290 --> 00:55:10.300
so severe that it undermines the very
 

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:13.350
so severe that it undermines the very
ability of the world to continue to

00:55:13.350 --> 00:55:13.360
ability of the world to continue to
 

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:15.680
ability of the world to continue to
achieve this kind of economic

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:15.690
achieve this kind of economic
 

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:19.890
achieve this kind of economic
development that it aspires to and here

00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:19.900
development that it aspires to and here
 

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:23.810
development that it aspires to and here
the basic point is that the number of

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:23.820
the basic point is that the number of
 

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:27.240
the basic point is that the number of
areas dimensions in which we're really

00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:27.250
areas dimensions in which we're really
 

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:29.310
areas dimensions in which we're really
messing with the Earth's physical

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:29.320
messing with the Earth's physical
 

00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.950
messing with the Earth's physical
systems is significant right now it's

00:55:31.950 --> 00:55:31.960
systems is significant right now it's
 

00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:35.130
systems is significant right now it's
not just climate it's land

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:35.140
not just climate it's land
 

00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:39.780
not just climate it's land
it's the nitrogen cycle it's a invasive

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:39.790
it's the nitrogen cycle it's a invasive
 

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:42.450
it's the nitrogen cycle it's a invasive
species it's a diversion of water

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:42.460
species it's a diversion of water
 

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:47.040
species it's a diversion of water
supplies it's the depletion of ocean

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:47.050
supplies it's the depletion of ocean
 

00:55:47.050 --> 00:55:50.910
supplies it's the depletion of ocean
fisheries and so we've got very very

00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:50.920
fisheries and so we've got very very
 

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:55.350
fisheries and so we've got very very
serious stressors in the world and all

00:55:55.350 --> 00:55:55.360
serious stressors in the world and all
 

00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:59.760
serious stressors in the world and all
of them relate to the global Commons all

00:55:59.760 --> 00:55:59.770
of them relate to the global Commons all
 

00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:02.790
of them relate to the global Commons all
of them relate to the parts not easily

00:56:02.790 --> 00:56:02.800
of them relate to the parts not easily
 

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:05.280
of them relate to the parts not easily
governed by localities or generally by

governed by localities or generally by
 

00:56:05.290 --> 00:56:07.590
governed by localities or generally by
the parts even even that can be governed

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:07.600
the parts even even that can be governed
 

00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:13.160
the parts even even that can be governed
by nations and that means global

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:13.170
by nations and that means global
 

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:18.150

cooperation needed to solve them and so

00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:18.160
cooperation needed to solve them and so
 

00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.990
cooperation needed to solve them and so
far very low levels of it I'm not going

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000
far very low levels of it I'm not going
 

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:24.540
far very low levels of it I'm not going
to talk about climate change more except

00:56:24.540 --> 00:56:24.550
to talk about climate change more except
 

00:56:24.550 --> 00:56:28.500
to talk about climate change more except
I'll say one one more thing about it if

00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:28.510
I'll say one one more thing about it if
 

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:31.290
I'll say one one more thing about it if
you look deeply at the issues of climate

00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:31.300
you look deeply at the issues of climate
 

00:56:31.300 --> 00:56:36.330
you look deeply at the issues of climate
change or water scarcity or biodiversity

00:56:36.330 --> 00:56:36.340

loss here's what I find in a nutshell I

00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040
loss here's what I find in a nutshell I
 

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:44.540
loss here's what I find in a nutshell I
find first that the current trends are

00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:44.550
find first that the current trends are
 

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:52.500
find first that the current trends are
just terribly dangerous terrible second

00:56:52.500 --> 00:56:52.510
just terribly dangerous terrible second
 

00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:55.680
just terribly dangerous terrible second
that diverting from those current trends

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:55.690
that diverting from those current trends
 

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:59.040
that diverting from those current trends
would not cost a lot so I find the

00:56:59.040 --> 00:56:59.050
would not cost a lot so I find the
 

00:56:59.050 --> 00:57:02.450
would not cost a lot so I find the
paradox that the current trajectory is

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460
paradox that the current trajectory is
 

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:05.610
paradox that the current trajectory is
worse than you think more dangerous than

00:57:05.610 --> 00:57:05.620
worse than you think more dangerous than
 

00:57:05.620 --> 00:57:09.690
worse than you think more dangerous than
you think and at the same time solving

00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:09.700
you think and at the same time solving
 

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:13.830
you think and at the same time solving
it is less costly than you fear and that

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:13.840
it is less costly than you fear and that
 

00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:17.940
it is less costly than you fear and that
I think is a great paradox which is that

00:57:17.940 --> 00:57:17.950
I think is a great paradox which is that
 

00:57:17.950 --> 00:57:20.400
I think is a great paradox which is that
those who say don't worry about it are

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:20.410
those who say don't worry about it are
 

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:21.720
those who say don't worry about it are
absolutely wrong

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:21.730
absolutely wrong
 

00:57:21.730 --> 00:57:24.030
absolutely wrong
those who say worry about it because

those who say worry about it because

it's going to destroy our society as we

it's going to destroy our society as we
know it are also wrong the truth I

know it are also wrong the truth I

know it are also wrong the truth I
believe is actually both inconvenient

00:57:32.970 --> 00:57:32.980
believe is actually both inconvenient
 

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.660
believe is actually both inconvenient
and convenient if we look at it

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:35.670
and convenient if we look at it
 

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:38.310
and convenient if we look at it
inconvenient in that it's really bad

00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:38.320
inconvenient in that it's really bad
 

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.460
inconvenient in that it's really bad
what's happening but convenient in the

00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:41.470
what's happening but convenient in the
 

00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:45.870
what's happening but convenient in the
sense that we are not without ways to

00:57:45.870 --> 00:57:45.880
sense that we are not without ways to
 

00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:49.740
sense that we are not without ways to
address it and the reason is that we're

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:49.750
address it and the reason is that we're
 

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.620
address it and the reason is that we're
in a were in the predicament we are

00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:52.630
in a were in the predicament we are
 

00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:53.609
in a were in the predicament we are
because of our Sapir

00:57:53.609 --> 00:57:53.619
because of our Sapir

your technology and because of our
 

00:57:56.170 --> 00:57:57.960
your technology and because of our
superior technology we also have

superior technology we also have
 

00:57:57.970 --> 00:58:00.559
superior technology we also have
powerful tools to address the problems

00:58:00.559 --> 00:58:00.569
powerful tools to address the problems
 

00:58:00.569 --> 00:58:03.150
powerful tools to address the problems
so we've gotten into it because of our

00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:03.160
so we've gotten into it because of our
 

00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:05.730
so we've gotten into it because of our
carelessness and because market

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:05.740
carelessness and because market
 

00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:07.739

institutions can't solve these problems

00:58:07.739 --> 00:58:07.749
institutions can't solve these problems
 

00:58:07.749 --> 00:58:10.170
institutions can't solve these problems
on their own because the signals are all

00:58:10.170 --> 00:58:10.180
on their own because the signals are all
 

00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:13.499
on their own because the signals are all
wrong yet the very technology that has

00:58:13.499 --> 00:58:13.509
wrong yet the very technology that has
 

00:58:13.509 --> 00:58:17.539
wrong yet the very technology that has
led us down this dangerous path suggests

00:58:17.539 --> 00:58:17.549
led us down this dangerous path suggests
 

00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:20.430
led us down this dangerous path suggests
closed kinds of technologies that are

00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440
closed kinds of technologies that are
 

00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:22.799
closed kinds of technologies that are
much much better so I don't think

00:58:22.799 --> 00:58:22.809
much much better so I don't think
 

00:58:22.809 --> 00:58:24.930
much much better so I don't think
there's anything hopeless in it but it

00:58:24.930 --> 00:58:24.940
there's anything hopeless in it but it
 

00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.210
there's anything hopeless in it but it
comes back to where I said I was going

00:58:27.210 --> 00:58:27.220
comes back to where I said I was going
 

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:31.349
comes back to where I said I was going
to end and that is politics it comes

00:58:31.349 --> 00:58:31.359
to end and that is politics it comes
 

00:58:31.359 --> 00:58:33.059
to end and that is politics it comes
back to politics because it's not

00:58:33.059 --> 00:58:33.069
back to politics because it's not
 

00:58:33.069 --> 00:58:35.069
back to politics because it's not
impossible to find a solution to those

00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079
impossible to find a solution to those
 

00:58:35.079 --> 00:58:38.130
impossible to find a solution to those
problems it's just that we have to agree

00:58:38.130 --> 00:58:38.140
problems it's just that we have to agree
 

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:40.799
problems it's just that we have to agree
to do it it's not something like a a

to do it it's not something like a a
 

00:58:40.809 --> 00:58:44.160
to do it it's not something like a a
good film where you make it because you

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:44.170
good film where you make it because you
 

00:58:44.170 --> 00:58:46.440
good film where you make it because you
think you're going to be able to succeed

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:46.450
think you're going to be able to succeed
 

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:48.930
think you're going to be able to succeed

in the market takes over it's something
we actually have to agree on to try to

we actually have to agree on to try to
 

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.849
we actually have to agree on to try to

yet final thing I want to say is about

00:58:59.999 --> 00:59:00.009
yet final thing I want to say is about
 

00:59:00.009 --> 00:59:03.960
yet final thing I want to say is about
war and peace and actually I've said a

00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:03.970
war and peace and actually I've said a
 

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:05.640
war and peace and actually I've said a
lot about war and peace there are two

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:05.650
lot about war and peace there are two
 

00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:08.069

kinds of problems of war and peace that
 

00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:11.460
kinds of problems of war and peace that
I think are quite distinct one kind is

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:11.470
I think are quite distinct one kind is
 

00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:15.299
I think are quite distinct one kind is
war between the great powers because

00:59:15.299 --> 00:59:15.309
war between the great powers because
 

00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:17.239
war between the great powers because
they drive each other crazy

00:59:17.239 --> 00:59:17.249
they drive each other crazy
 

00:59:17.249 --> 00:59:20.970
they drive each other crazy
competing for preeminence and that's the

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:20.980
competing for preeminence and that's the
 

00:59:20.980 --> 00:59:25.049
competing for preeminence and that's the
world war one kind of war where Germany

00:59:25.049 --> 00:59:25.059
world war one kind of war where Germany
 

00:59:25.059 --> 00:59:26.880
world war one kind of war where Germany
triggered a war because was sure that

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:26.890
triggered a war because was sure that
 

00:59:26.890 --> 00:59:30.150

Russia and Britain would never allow for

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160
Russia and Britain would never allow for
 

00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.239
Russia and Britain would never allow for
German technological dominance and so

00:59:33.239 --> 00:59:33.249
German technological dominance and so
 

00:59:33.249 --> 00:59:35.460
German technological dominance and so
they launched a preemptive strike before

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:35.470
they launched a preemptive strike before
 

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:39.120
they launched a preemptive strike before
they would be encircled so that's the

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:39.130
they would be encircled so that's the
 

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:41.549
they would be encircled so that's the
kind of war that one could imagine one

00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559
kind of war that one could imagine one
 

00:59:41.559 --> 00:59:45.269
kind of war that one could imagine one
true cross-border war and that's the one

00:59:45.269 --> 00:59:45.279
true cross-border war and that's the one
 

00:59:45.279 --> 00:59:53.810
true cross-border war and that's the one
we started Iraq

00:59:53.810 --> 00:59:53.820
 

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:59.640
so this is a map I kept data kept by

00:59:59.640 --> 00:59:59.650
so this is a map I kept data kept by
 

00:59:59.650 --> 01:00:02.100
so this is a map I kept data kept by

point that I'm making most of the war we

01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:08.950
point that I'm making most of the war we
 

01:00:08.950 --> 01:00:11.700
point that I'm making most of the war we
face is the top kind of course we we

biggest problem now one thing that I
 

01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.460
biggest problem now one thing that I
believe to be the case is that these

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:29.470
believe to be the case is that these
 

01:00:29.470 --> 01:00:34.700

poverty and conflict are all

poverty and conflict are all
 

01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:45.960
poverty and conflict are all
interconnected in crucial ways and that

most of these civil conflicts have a big

most of these civil conflicts have a big

worst humanitarian crisis I view that as

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:09.850
worst humanitarian crisis I view that as
 

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:12.060
worst humanitarian crisis I view that as
an ecological crisis because it takes

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:12.070
an ecological crisis because it takes
 

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:15.840
an ecological crisis because it takes

our most basic common link is that we

01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:37.480
our most basic common link is that we

our most basic common link is that we
all inhabit this small planet we all

thank you very much

01:14:25.930 --> 01:14:25.940
 

01:14:25.940 --> 01:14:44.649
yeah I know but what have we done lately

01:14:44.649 --> 01:14:44.659
 

01:14:44.659 --> 01:15:05.689
yep yep so the the idea of the

01:15:05.689 --> 01:15:05.699
yep yep so the the idea of the
 

01:15:05.699 --> 01:15:09.069
yep yep so the the idea of the
millennium villages is to go to a region

01:15:09.069 --> 01:15:09.079
millennium villages is to go to a region
 

01:15:09.079 --> 01:15:12.649
millennium villages is to go to a region
utterly impoverished and believe me

01:15:12.649 --> 01:15:12.659
utterly impoverished and believe me
 

01:15:12.659 --> 01:15:14.390
utterly impoverished and believe me
think about the poorest place you know

01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:14.400
think about the poorest place you know
 

01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.540
think about the poorest place you know
and then divide by ten think about a

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:17.550
and then divide by ten think about a
 

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:21.800
and then divide by ten think about a
place that has one physical brick

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:21.810
place that has one physical brick
 

01:15:21.810 --> 01:15:25.399
place that has one physical brick

our villages salary is not absolutely as

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679
our villages salary is not absolutely as
 

01:15:40.679 --> 01:15:42.229
our villages salary is not absolutely as
extreme but is extraordinarily

01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239
extreme but is extraordinarily
 

01:15:42.239 --> 01:15:46.189
extreme but is extraordinarily
impoverished and then ask what's the

01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199
impoverished and then ask what's the
 

01:15:46.199 --> 01:15:50.629
impoverished and then ask what's the
difference of this and viability so the

01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639
difference of this and viability so the
 

01:15:50.639 --> 01:15:53.350
difference of this and viability so the
idea is basically that these are

01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360
idea is basically that these are
 

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:56.180
idea is basically that these are
impoverished subsistence or what we call

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:56.190
impoverished subsistence or what we call
 

01:15:56.190 --> 01:15:59.240
impoverished subsistence or what we call
sub subsistence communities that can't

01:15:59.240 --> 01:15:59.250
sub subsistence communities that can't
 

01:15:59.250 --> 01:16:02.660
sub subsistence communities that can't
even generate sufficient productivity to

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:02.670
even generate sufficient productivity to
 

01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:05.450
even generate sufficient productivity to

theory is the theory of the poverty

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:14.000
theory is the theory of the poverty
 

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.480
theory is the theory of the poverty
trap which is that if you're so poor

01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:16.490
trap which is that if you're so poor
 

01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:19.870
trap which is that if you're so poor
that you can't generate your basic needs

01:16:19.870 --> 01:16:19.880
that you can't generate your basic needs
 

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:23.080
that you can't generate your basic needs
you also can't save if you can't save

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:23.090
you also can't save if you can't save
 

01:16:23.090 --> 01:16:25.960
you also can't save if you can't save
you can't get out of your trap and in

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:25.970
you can't get out of your trap and in
 

01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:28.150
you can't get out of your trap and in
fact you can't even hold your current

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:28.160
fact you can't even hold your current
 

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:30.880

environmental resources maybe cutting

01:16:33.100 --> 01:16:33.110
environmental resources maybe cutting
 

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:35.940
environmental resources maybe cutting
the trees or depleting the soils and

typically as is true in all our village

01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:38.450
typically as is true in all our village
 

01:16:38.450 --> 01:16:40.900
typically as is true in all our village
sites the number of children is rising

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:40.910
sites the number of children is rising
 

01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:43.120

very fast also there's no contraception

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:43.130
very fast also there's no contraception
 

01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:45.580
very fast also there's no contraception
there's no family planning and because

01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:45.590
there's no family planning and because
 

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:48.850
there's no family planning and because
the poor choose a lot of children also

01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:48.860
the poor choose a lot of children also
 

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:51.700
the poor choose a lot of children also
when they see such high levels of death

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:51.710
when they see such high levels of death
 

01:16:51.710 --> 01:16:55.260
when they see such high levels of death
of the children so all of this is truly

01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:55.270
of the children so all of this is truly
 

01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:58.300

trap is that you can convert from an

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:00.290
trap is that you can convert from an
 

01:17:00.290 --> 01:17:04.120
trap is that you can convert from an
unsustainable downward spiral to a

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:04.130
unsustainable downward spiral to a
 

01:17:04.130 --> 01:17:07.060
unsustainable downward spiral to a
sustainable upward spiral if you can

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:07.070
sustainable upward spiral if you can
 

01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:09.700

raise the productivity above the
 

01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:13.000
raise the productivity above the
subsistence level because if you can do

that then there's a margin for saving

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:15.050
that then there's a margin for saving
 

01:17:15.050 --> 01:17:17.860
that then there's a margin for saving
then all the good things that can happen

01:17:17.860 --> 01:17:17.870
then all the good things that can happen
 

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:20.260

oh then they invested in microfinance

01:17:20.260 --> 01:17:20.270
oh then they invested in microfinance
 

01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:22.450
oh then they invested in microfinance
then they added to cows then they built

01:17:22.450 --> 01:17:22.460
then they added to cows then they built
 

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:25.150
then they added to cows then they built
a road then they added a roof then they

01:17:25.150 --> 01:17:25.160
a road then they added a roof then they
 

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:27.550
a road then they added a roof then they
brought electricity and all those normal

01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560
brought electricity and all those normal
 

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.650

hold so there's a dividing point in this

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:33.110
hold so there's a dividing point in this
 

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.800
hold so there's a dividing point in this
logic which is on one side of the divide

01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:35.810

you go down and on the other side you go

01:17:38.140 --> 01:17:38.150
you go down and on the other side you go
 

01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:40.930
you go down and on the other side you go
up and mathematically there's a dividing

01:17:40.930 --> 01:17:40.940
up and mathematically there's a dividing
 

01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:43.420
up and mathematically there's a dividing
point where and that's the nature of a

01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:43.430
point where and that's the nature of a
 

01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:45.070

poverty trap if this is right that

01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080
poverty trap if this is right that
 

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.650
poverty trap if this is right that
there's a threshold if you can invest

01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:47.660
there's a threshold if you can invest
 

01:17:47.660 --> 01:17:50.770
there's a threshold if you can invest
beyond the threshold then it's not a

01:17:50.770 --> 01:17:50.780
beyond the threshold then it's not a
 

01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:53.350
beyond the threshold then it's not a
matter of continuing the investment then

01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360
matter of continuing the investment then
 

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:56.710

the normal processes can take hold so

01:17:56.710 --> 01:17:56.720
the normal processes can take hold so
