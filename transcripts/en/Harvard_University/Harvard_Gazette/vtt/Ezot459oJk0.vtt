00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.389
Young prince Thutmose took a nap in the
shadow of the Sphinx's head which

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.630
seems to indicate that only the head was
sticking up out of the ground

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.040
the Sphinx appears to him right at the
zenith when the Sun is at its highest

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.869
point and basically the Sphinx says hey I am
drowning in sand here if you can dig me

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.760
out I will make you king of Egypt, so the
King awakes, he excavated the Sphinx and

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.379
became King. How do we know all this?
Because he then took a block of granite

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.980
brought it down to the Sphinx, carved
this story on it.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.350
The Stela process involves first
doing restoration of the original

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.800
plaster cast; this was joining fragments,
correcting any earlier casting

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.720
errors and then creating a silicon mold
of that plaster cast; we could then pour

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.100
into the back of it casting resin,
I'm using a urethane resin and building

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.720
it up through multiple layers to create
depth of color that replicates a faux

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.869
stone. What we're working on right now is
mimicking pink granite which is what the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.800
original Stela is made of but over time
parts of it have been worn away and

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.210
actually the cast we're working on right
now has more preserved of the Stela

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.640
than the existing actual Stela

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.890
the top part of the cast and the bottom
part of the cast are gonna stand about

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:11.629
eight feet tall and seven feet wide so
it's definitely pretty impressive.

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.440
This is a brand new form of casting for us so
it's been really fun to learn a new

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.100
process

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.340
we're hoping to bring the physical
object into the gallery, an augmented

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.900
reality aspect to have an educational
feature as well and this will be useful

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.840
for students, the visiting public, and try
to bring it all back
