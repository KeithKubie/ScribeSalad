00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.810
The human brain is complex and people's brains are different based on a whole bunch of different things.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.750
But as America enters yet another election season

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.590
I gotta know, does our physiology shape our politics or vice versa?

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.779
This ought to get that comment section jumping jumping like it's 1999. Theme song time!

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.729
I'm gonna put this brain down and do the words.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.369
Do our brains modulate our behavior or does our environment modulate our behavior, which then modulates our brain activation?

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.540
Well, this is classic nature/nurture debate. But research suggests it could be both.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.340
Before we get politically picante, let's talk about research.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.520
People have built whole frameworks based on similarities and differences in behavioral expression and their correlates in the brain.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.620
Research usually falls within the lanes of the whole brain size, specific brain structure size,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.360
and activation of different brain regions.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.900
Even genetics have been called into question to explain why we believe what we believe and politics are the perfect example.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.260
Alright, hold up.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.710
We can't go anywhere without some important definitions. The word liberalism as I'll be using it is the belief that government should be

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.859
active in supporting social and political change and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.970
conservatism a political philosophy based on tradition and social stability

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.899
stressing established institutions and preferring gradual development to abrupt change. Now I got check with my producers, how's the comments section looking so far?

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.100
Well, it will. Throw a meter up there so we can see how hot it gets. Throw a bing on there. Bing! All right.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700
Let's start with growing up. We all grow up right that's not controversial, right? Okay, comment section is looking cool.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.080
But we all have ideas programed into us by the media we're exposed to,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.180
by our friends and family and by our general environment.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.560
But research suggests that it may be in our genetics. How? We got CNN Town Hall debates raised in our DNA?

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.840
Like adenine and guanine like...

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.700
No.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.560
A 2014 study surveying 12,000 twins identical

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.979
and fraternal from all over the world proposes that up to 60% of our political beliefs come from our environment,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.989
leaving up to 40% who come from our genetics, Peter Hatemi, the lead researcher on the study

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:01.799
suggests that we inherit some of how we process information from our parents and that manifests in society today as political attitudes.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.360
Further evidence from a 2015 study suggests that genes with receptors for the neurotransmitter dopamine

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.369
are associated how liberal or conservative we are. That study found that among women who were liberal,

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.309
62% were carriers for a certain was receptor genotype that had been previously associated with traits like extraversion and

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:25.620
seeking new impulsive adventures. Meanwhile among highly conservative women those receptive genotypes fell to around 37.5%.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.940
How we doing? How's that meter looking?

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.860
Low. Alright, let's heat this bad boy up. Throw a picture Colin Firth. Yeah that one. Yep. Same one. That dude. Yep.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.780
Yeah that dude. You can be devilishly handsome and do science at the same time. I mean look at him not me.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.440
He coauthored a paper in 2011, which get a man who can do both,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.570
but it suggests that there are anatomical differences in the brains of younger adults on the liberal conservative axis.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.380
His team discovered that liberalism is associated with higher gray matter volume of the anterior cingulate cortex aka the ACC.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.740
And conservatism is associated with increased right amygdala size.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.549
The activity of the anterior cingulate cortex has been related to decision making,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.510
socially-driven interactions, and empathy. And the amygdala plays a key role in processing emotions and forms part of the limbic system,

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.770
Their research suggests that the liberal brains may be more conflict resolution driven while conservative brains are more

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.760
emotion driven. Further research finds that people with bigger amygdalas are also less likely to participate in protest movements.

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.779
Of course, all this research is correlational and not causal.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.720
However, it does lead to interesting conversations about nature and nurture when it comes to biology and politics.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.690
Okay, I can hear it. I can see it. Don't blame me. Blame Colin Firth. Still love you Colin.

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.940
Can't wait for Kingsman Three and Bridget Jones's Tumblr Account.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.529
So let's talk about the elephant or donkey in the room: age. As our beliefs and behaviors shift so do our brains and it's likely

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.890
that our brains to change as our political views, a set of beliefs and behaviors change.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:04:00.359
British research from 1964 to 2010 suggests that generational differences do affect vote choice between liberal or conservative candidates,

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.350
but it also proposes that people tend to vote more conservative as they get older.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.219
So either die a liberal or live long enough to become a conservative? More research is needed,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.980
but all this research taken together suggests that there are biological and environmental factors that can influence, may influence,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.140
or be influenced by our politics.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.810
Okay, so I can see that meter is just straight-up broken.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.460
But I just reported facts y'all.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.720
Lots of differences in genetics and neurological structures are reported for a bunch of different things.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.980
Gender, race, athleticism, etc, etc.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:35.020
The brain isn't necessarily partisan, but when we move to political extremes, it will affect our physiology and psychology, changing implicit attitudes we have,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:41.550
memories and even our perceptual judgments. As we enter a super-polarized political arena, while our ideals and morals should definitely be upheld

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.490
it's important to bridge the partisan divide by investing in facts and a shared reality rather than creating our own.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.999
Now it's a lot of information about your brain to put in your brain

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:56.819
so right now you probably need a little break just you know, grab some tea, crash in front of the TV and watch nothing in particular.

00:04:56.819 --> 00:05:01.378
But did you know they've even apolitical entertainment television can influence your political opinion?

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:06.539
