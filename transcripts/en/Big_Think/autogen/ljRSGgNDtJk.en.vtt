nation-states traditionally we think of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
nation-states traditionally we think of
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.330
nation-states traditionally we think of
a nation-state as a country where 85 or

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340
a nation-state as a country where 85 or
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.520
a nation-state as a country where 85 or
90 percent of the population belongs to

the same ethnic group the number of
 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.440
the same ethnic group the number of
nation-states is declining because more

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450
nation-states is declining because more
 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.910
nation-states is declining because more
and more countries are becoming more

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920
and more countries are becoming more
 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.580
and more countries are becoming more
ethnically diverse even in Europe where

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590
ethnically diverse even in Europe where
 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.590
ethnically diverse even in Europe where
the idea of the nation-state really

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600
the idea of the nation-state really
 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.560
the idea of the nation-state really
began in the Middle Ages and into the

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570
began in the Middle Ages and into the
 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:05.930
began in the Middle Ages and into the
modern nation-states of Western Europe

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940
modern nation-states of Western Europe
 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.600
modern nation-states of Western Europe
today there you see a growing percentage

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610
today there you see a growing percentage
 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.490
today there you see a growing percentage
of migrants and therefore those

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500
of migrants and therefore those
 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.260
of migrants and therefore those
countries are no longer even

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270
countries are no longer even
 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.830
countries are no longer even
nation-states so in fact we have this

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840
nation-states so in fact we have this
 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.500
nation-states so in fact we have this
genetic intermingling and we see this

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510
genetic intermingling and we see this
 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.870
genetic intermingling and we see this
particularly in global cities that are

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880
particularly in global cities that are
 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.050
particularly in global cities that are
melting pots places like Singapore or

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060
melting pots places like Singapore or
 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.580
melting pots places like Singapore or
Hong Kong or Dubai or Toronto or London

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590
Hong Kong or Dubai or Toronto or London
 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.220
Hong Kong or Dubai or Toronto or London
places where the foreign-born percentage

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230
places where the foreign-born percentage
 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.830
places where the foreign-born percentage
of the population may be 40 percent 50

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840
of the population may be 40 percent 50
 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.890
of the population may be 40 percent 50
percent in the case of Dubai even 85 or

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900
percent in the case of Dubai even 85 or
 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.560
percent in the case of Dubai even 85 or
90 percent of the residents actually

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570
90 percent of the residents actually
 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.990
90 percent of the residents actually
don't come from that place and so we see

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
don't come from that place and so we see
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.170
don't come from that place and so we see
literally mingling of ethnicities mixed

birth children and this mingling of
 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.660

populations that has never taken place
 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.270
populations that has never taken place
before at this rapid rate so yes

there is a backlash against immigration
 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.860
there is a backlash against immigration
to some degree in quite a few places but

to some degree in quite a few places but
 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.610
