00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:29.350
I was living in Russia twice both during
 

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:33.329
I was living in Russia twice both during
the first war between 1992 or actually

00:08:33.329 --> 00:08:33.339
the first war between 1992 or actually
 

00:08:33.339 --> 00:08:37.260
the first war between 1992 or actually
sorry 1994 and 1996 and then I was there

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:37.270
sorry 1994 and 1996 and then I was there
 

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:40.740
sorry 1994 and 1996 and then I was there
again from 1994 to 2002 so I seem to be

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:40.750
again from 1994 to 2002 so I seem to be
 

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:44.010
again from 1994 to 2002 so I seem to be
living inside the country at to very

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:44.020
living inside the country at to very
 

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:46.590
living inside the country at to very
extreme moments and I think that part of

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:46.600
extreme moments and I think that part of
 

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.930
extreme moments and I think that part of
the motivation was seeing the difference

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:48.940
the motivation was seeing the difference
 

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.610
the motivation was seeing the difference
within the reaction of the Russian

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:50.620
within the reaction of the Russian
 

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:54.270
within the reaction of the Russian
public to the second war as opposed to

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:54.280
public to the second war as opposed to
 

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.250
public to the second war as opposed to
the first war and this struck me as

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.260
the first war and this struck me as
 

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.060
the first war and this struck me as
quite extreme and I was curious to try

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:00.070
quite extreme and I was curious to try
 

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.820
quite extreme and I was curious to try
and understand some of the motivations

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:02.830
and understand some of the motivations
 

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:08.699
and understand some of the motivations
behind that change so essentially I

00:09:08.699 --> 00:09:08.709
behind that change so essentially I
 

00:09:08.709 --> 00:09:10.949
behind that change so essentially I
wanted to put everything together so

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959
wanted to put everything together so
 

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:13.430
wanted to put everything together so
people had access to try and understand

00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440
people had access to try and understand
 

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.520
people had access to try and understand
exactly what we know about the crisis I

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:17.530
exactly what we know about the crisis I
 

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.860
exactly what we know about the crisis I
wanted to make very clear that as

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:19.870
wanted to make very clear that as
 

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.199
wanted to make very clear that as
Diedrich well knows that with access to

00:09:22.199 --> 00:09:22.209
Diedrich well knows that with access to
 

00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:24.390
Diedrich well knows that with access to
only 30 percent of the territory there's

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:24.400
only 30 percent of the territory there's
 

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.420
only 30 percent of the territory there's
so much that we don't know and so I

00:09:27.420 --> 00:09:27.430
so much that we don't know and so I
 

00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.410
so much that we don't know and so I
wanted to make a couple of proposals or

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:31.420
wanted to make a couple of proposals or
 

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.329
wanted to make a couple of proposals or
things that I wanted people to talk

00:09:33.329 --> 00:09:33.339
things that I wanted people to talk
 

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:37.100
things that I wanted people to talk
about this was what do we do

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:37.110
about this was what do we do
 

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.750
about this was what do we do
asymmetrical Wars when you actually

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760
asymmetrical Wars when you actually
 

00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.170
asymmetrical Wars when you actually
don't have access to information so my

00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:43.180
don't have access to information so my
 

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.430
don't have access to information so my
plea initially when I was at the

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440
plea initially when I was at the
 

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.850
plea initially when I was at the
University of Chicago was for a large

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:46.860
University of Chicago was for a large
 

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.870
University of Chicago was for a large
documentation project and I know

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880
documentation project and I know
 

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.840
documentation project and I know
obviously that memorial and the Russian

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:51.850
obviously that memorial and the Russian
 

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:53.910
obviously that memorial and the Russian
Chechen Friendship Society have also

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920
Chechen Friendship Society have also
 

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.530
Chechen Friendship Society have also
been working on that but I think that

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:55.540
been working on that but I think that
 

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.230
been working on that but I think that
there is a need to to actually promote

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240
there is a need to to actually promote
 

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.900
there is a need to to actually promote
that further so I wanted to open up that

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:00.910
that further so I wanted to open up that
 

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:04.350
that further so I wanted to open up that
discussion about the fact that has that

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360
discussion about the fact that has that
 

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.720
discussion about the fact that has that
victims really are always at a

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:06.730
victims really are always at a
 

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:09.180
victims really are always at a
historical disadvantage right so how do

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:09.190
historical disadvantage right so how do
 

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.460
historical disadvantage right so how do
we regenerate a discussion of the

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:11.470
we regenerate a discussion of the
 

00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.139
we regenerate a discussion of the
victims and to me the only way to do

00:10:13.139 --> 00:10:13.149
victims and to me the only way to do
 

00:10:13.149 --> 00:10:15.680
victims and to me the only way to do
that is actually to as much as possible

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:15.690
that is actually to as much as possible
 

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:22.440
that is actually to as much as possible

in their 16000 Chechen refugees living
 

00:10:31.209 --> 00:10:34.199
in their 16000 Chechen refugees living
in Austria so we're starting a pilot

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:34.209
in Austria so we're starting a pilot

in Austria so we're starting a pilot
project there to try and gather people

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:37.660
project there to try and gather people
 

00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.590
project there to try and gather people
to talk about their experiences and

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:40.600
to talk about their experiences and

to talk about their experiences and
we're also hoping to start up a website

00:10:43.079 --> 00:10:43.089
we're also hoping to start up a website
 

00:10:43.089 --> 00:10:45.449
we're also hoping to start up a website
where people can actually also put their

00:10:45.449 --> 00:10:45.459
where people can actually also put their
 

00:10:45.459 --> 00:10:47.759
where people can actually also put their
experiences online this is very

00:10:47.759 --> 00:10:47.769
experiences online this is very
 

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:51.509
experiences online this is very
experimental it's problematic on a

experimental it's problematic on a
 

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.160
experimental it's problematic on a
number of levels that we're all very

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:53.170
number of levels that we're all very
 

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.340
number of levels that we're all very
aware of but it's a way for us to I

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:56.350
aware of but it's a way for us to I
 

00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.590
aware of but it's a way for us to I
guess try and generate more information

00:10:58.590 --> 00:10:58.600
guess try and generate more information
 

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.860
guess try and generate more information
for for our purposes as much as for the

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:01.870
for for our purposes as much as for the
 

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:04.139
for for our purposes as much as for the
purposes of enlightening people as to

00:11:04.139 --> 00:11:04.149
purposes of enlightening people as to
 

00:11:04.149 --> 00:11:08.329
purposes of enlightening people as to
what has taken place so I think that's

00:11:08.329 --> 00:11:08.339
what has taken place so I think that's
 

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:10.500
what has taken place so I think that's
essentially what all I wanted to say I

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:10.510
essentially what all I wanted to say I
 

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:12.810
essentially what all I wanted to say I
just wanted to outline what what my aims

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:12.820
just wanted to outline what what my aims
 

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.630
just wanted to outline what what my aims
were and I think that bringing forth the

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:15.640
were and I think that bringing forth the
 

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.730
were and I think that bringing forth the
discussion about documentation bringing

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:17.740
discussion about documentation bringing
 

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:21.269
discussion about documentation bringing
forth a discussion about okay how do we

00:11:21.269 --> 00:11:21.279
forth a discussion about okay how do we
 

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.040
forth a discussion about okay how do we
categorize exactly what's taking place

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:23.050
categorize exactly what's taking place
 

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:27.180
categorize exactly what's taking place
in Russia and can we do that without

00:11:27.180 --> 00:11:27.190
in Russia and can we do that without
 

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:29.100
in Russia and can we do that without
having all the documentation that we

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:29.110
having all the documentation that we
 

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.439
having all the documentation that we
need at hand to make claims about how we

00:11:31.439 --> 00:11:31.449
need at hand to make claims about how we
 

00:11:31.449 --> 00:11:34.170
need at hand to make claims about how we
categorize this by the concern by

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:34.180
categorize this by the concern by
 

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.210
categorize this by the concern by
international law for example so I did

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:36.220
international law for example so I did
 

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.439
international law for example so I did
want to also open up that discussion the

00:11:39.439 --> 00:11:39.449
want to also open up that discussion the
 

00:11:39.449 --> 00:11:42.060
want to also open up that discussion the
last and final thing that I want to say

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:42.070
last and final thing that I want to say
 

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:46.110
last and final thing that I want to say
is that I was very interested in the

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120
is that I was very interested in the
 

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:48.620
is that I was very interested in the
idea of public hearings or the

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:48.630
idea of public hearings or the
 

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.280
idea of public hearings or the
idea of non government tribunals

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:51.290
idea of non government tribunals
 

00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:53.540
idea of non government tribunals
particularly in cases like this where

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:53.550
particularly in cases like this where
 

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:55.730
particularly in cases like this where
there is no international funding where

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:55.740
there is no international funding where
 

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.130
there is no international funding where
there are no Truth and Reconciliation

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:57.140
there are no Truth and Reconciliation
 

00:11:57.140 --> 00:12:00.890
there are no Truth and Reconciliation
commissions and so there isn't the

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:00.900
commissions and so there isn't the
 

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.560
commissions and so there isn't the
support there for people to come out and

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:03.570
support there for people to come out and
 

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.510
support there for people to come out and
be able to testify about things that

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:05.520
be able to testify about things that
 

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:09.440
be able to testify about things that
have happened to them so they were may

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:09.450
have happened to them so they were may
 

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:10.130
have happened to them so they were may

in Chechnya and I think it's a

people we're responsible for this but

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280
people we're responsible for this but
 

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.290
people we're responsible for this but
there's pretty good evidence that

00:17:24.290 --> 00:17:24.300
there's pretty good evidence that
 

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:26.720
there's pretty good evidence that
probably it was indeed a result of the

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:26.730
probably it was indeed a result of the
 

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:29.750
probably it was indeed a result of the

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760
rivalries so one thing to keep in mind
 

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.840
rivalries so one thing to keep in mind
is that this is often reported as blood

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:32.850
is that this is often reported as blood
 

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:35.030
is that this is often reported as blood
feuds and certainly there are blood

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:35.040
feuds and certainly there are blood
 

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:36.620
feuds and certainly there are blood
feuds that are a part of the Chechen

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:36.630
feuds that are a part of the Chechen
 

00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:38.600
feuds that are a part of the Chechen
culture but calling everything a blood

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:38.610
culture but calling everything a blood
 

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:41.450
culture but calling everything a blood
feud is also a way for Ramzan Kadyrov

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.460
feud is also a way for Ramzan Kadyrov
 

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.790
feud is also a way for Ramzan Kadyrov
not to take responsibility for his own

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:43.800
not to take responsibility for his own
 

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.150
not to take responsibility for his own
role in violence that occurs and so I

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:47.160
role in violence that occurs and so I
 

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.680
role in violence that occurs and so I
think we need to take the claims of

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:48.690
think we need to take the claims of
 

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:51.919
think we need to take the claims of
blood feuds with a grain of salt so just

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:51.929
blood feuds with a grain of salt so just
 

00:17:51.929 --> 00:17:53.660
blood feuds with a grain of salt so just
because the Chechen ships civilians are

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:53.670
because the Chechen ships civilians are
 

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.370
because the Chechen ships civilians are
victims which I think I'm a Gilligan

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:55.380
victims which I think I'm a Gilligan
 

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.650
victims which I think I'm a Gilligan

we're not also perpetrators so the label

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080
we're not also perpetrators so the label
 

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.260
we're not also perpetrators so the label
of civilian does not necessarily connote

00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:06.270
of civilian does not necessarily connote
 

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.640
of civilian does not necessarily connote
innocence and I think that's an

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:07.650
innocence and I think that's an
 

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:09.590
innocence and I think that's an
important thing to keep in mind when

00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600
important thing to keep in mind when
 

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.440
important thing to keep in mind when

reading Emma Gilligan's book the second
problem that I have with the book is

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:14.370
problem that I have with the book is
 

00:18:14.370 --> 00:18:16.280
problem that I have with the book is
that I think that the book overreaches

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:16.290
that I think that the book overreaches
 

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.900
that I think that the book overreaches
when it claims that the Russian state

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:17.910
when it claims that the Russian state
 

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.140

put the pieces together for me what I
 

00:25:33.159 --> 00:25:34.320
put the pieces together for me what I
wanted to hear was actually your

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:34.330
wanted to hear was actually your
 

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:36.720
wanted to hear was actually your

argument about what was going on and in
 

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:38.279
argument about what was going on and in
some ways you you step back and let the

00:25:38.279 --> 00:25:38.289
some ways you you step back and let the
 

00:25:38.289 --> 00:25:40.080
some ways you you step back and let the
facts speak for themselves and as much

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:40.090
facts speak for themselves and as much
 

00:25:40.090 --> 00:25:41.639

as we know anyway and you're right 20 30

kept trying to figure out what is your
 

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.840
kept trying to figure out what is your
argument for explaining not only the

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:48.850
argument for explaining not only the
 

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:50.310

which it was fun so why is it this
brutal like what was the reason behind

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:54.370
brutal like what was the reason behind
 

00:25:54.370 --> 00:25:55.680
brutal like what was the reason behind
this it didn't have to be necessarily

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:55.690
this it didn't have to be necessarily
 

00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:58.080
this it didn't have to be necessarily
right so so why did it unfold in a way

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.090
right so so why did it unfold in a way
 

00:25:58.090 --> 00:25:59.909
right so so why did it unfold in a way
that it did and the my best gifts on

your answer actually comes to where you

00:26:02.009 --> 00:26:02.019
your answer actually comes to where you
 

00:26:02.019 --> 00:26:04.680
your answer actually comes to where you
believe that nationalism and anat racism

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:04.690
believe that nationalism and anat racism

the Russian side really drove the
dynamics of the conflict and I think I

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:11.049
dynamics of the conflict and I think I
 

00:26:11.049 --> 00:26:12.299
dynamics of the conflict and I think I
think I take that as your thesis and

think I take that as your thesis and
dattara what worries me about that is

00:26:14.159 --> 00:26:14.169
dattara what worries me about that is
 

00:26:14.169 --> 00:26:16.019
dattara what worries me about that is
that the racism and the nationalism is

00:26:16.019 --> 00:26:16.029
that the racism and the nationalism is
 

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:17.460
that the racism and the nationalism is
not a cause of the conflict as a

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:17.470
not a cause of the conflict as a
 

00:26:17.470 --> 00:26:19.830
not a cause of the conflict as a
consequence of it so it is actually

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840
consequence of it so it is actually
 

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.389
consequence of it so it is actually
being driven right to getting this

00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399
being driven right to getting this
 

00:26:21.399 --> 00:26:23.430
being driven right to getting this
progressive nationalist rhetoric is

00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440
progressive nationalist rhetoric is
 

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.440
progressive nationalist rhetoric is
progressively brutalizing activities on

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:25.450
progressively brutalizing activities on
 

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.039
progressively brutalizing activities on
the ground

00:26:26.039 --> 00:26:26.049
the ground
 

00:26:26.049 --> 00:26:28.289
the ground
not because of some freestanding Russian

00:26:28.289 --> 00:26:28.299
not because of some freestanding Russian
 

00:26:28.299 --> 00:26:30.299
not because of some freestanding Russian
hatred of Chechens ethnically or maybe

00:26:30.299 --> 00:26:30.309
hatred of Chechens ethnically or maybe
 

00:26:30.309 --> 00:26:32.940
hatred of Chechens ethnically or maybe
their yeah historically right there's a

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:32.950
their yeah historically right there's a
 

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.460
their yeah historically right there's a
two hundred year legacy but it also is

00:26:35.460 --> 00:26:35.470
two hundred year legacy but it also is
 

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:37.230
two hundred year legacy but it also is
being fueled by the conflict itself in

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240
being fueled by the conflict itself in
 

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.700
being fueled by the conflict itself in
some ways I think you have this easy

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:38.710
some ways I think you have this easy
 

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:40.139
some ways I think you have this easy
case to make where you sort of say well

00:26:40.139 --> 00:26:40.149
case to make where you sort of say well
 

00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:41.310
case to make where you sort of say well
there's a 200 year of history and this

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:41.320
there's a 200 year of history and this
 

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.500
there's a 200 year of history and this
is just round six or seven or eight or

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:43.510
is just round six or seven or eight or
 

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:44.879
is just round six or seven or eight or
nine of 200 you're counting on the right

00:26:44.879 --> 00:26:44.889
nine of 200 you're counting on the right
 

00:26:44.889 --> 00:26:46.590
nine of 200 you're counting on the right
I'm actually not but I think that's too

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:46.600
I'm actually not but I think that's too
 

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.240
I'm actually not but I think that's too
easy right because I think what you need

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:48.250
easy right because I think what you need
 

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.820
easy right because I think what you need
to be able to do is demonstrate where

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:50.830
to be able to do is demonstrate where
 

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.220
to be able to do is demonstrate where
the racism is playing a role relative

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:53.230
the racism is playing a role relative
 

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:54.810
the racism is playing a role relative
the areas in which it's not and so I

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:54.820
the areas in which it's not and so I
 

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:56.220
the areas in which it's not and so I
started looking around and saying there

00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:56.230
started looking around and saying there
 

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:57.810
started looking around and saying there
are some odd puzzles in here if your

00:26:57.810 --> 00:26:57.820
are some odd puzzles in here if your
 

00:26:57.820 --> 00:26:59.039
are some odd puzzles in here if your
story about nationalism

00:26:59.039 --> 00:26:59.049
story about nationalism
 

00:26:59.049 --> 00:27:00.720
story about nationalism
racism art is correct there are some

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:00.730
racism art is correct there are some
 

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:02.279
racism art is correct there are some
things I think we shouldn't see in the

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:02.289
things I think we shouldn't see in the
 

00:27:02.289 --> 00:27:04.379
things I think we shouldn't see in the
conflict that we actually do so let me

00:27:04.379 --> 00:27:04.389
conflict that we actually do so let me
 

00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:07.259
conflict that we actually do so let me
raise to two points here one is it

00:27:07.259 --> 00:27:07.269
raise to two points here one is it
 

00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:09.810
raise to two points here one is it
strikes me as odd to see the variation

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:09.820
strikes me as odd to see the variation
 

00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.669
strikes me as odd to see the variation
in the location and the intensity the

00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679
in the location and the intensity the
 

00:27:11.679 --> 00:27:13.560
in the location and the intensity the
route allottee inflicted on the people

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:13.570
route allottee inflicted on the people
 

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:16.289
route allottee inflicted on the people
if this is a story about Russian racism

00:27:16.289 --> 00:27:16.299
if this is a story about Russian racism
 

00:27:16.299 --> 00:27:18.060
if this is a story about Russian racism
or Russian nationalism why is there

00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.070
or Russian nationalism why is there
 

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:19.649
or Russian nationalism why is there
variation in how the people are being

00:27:19.649 --> 00:27:19.659
variation in how the people are being
 

00:27:19.659 --> 00:27:21.869
variation in how the people are being
treated and let me just show you this is

00:27:21.869 --> 00:27:21.879
treated and let me just show you this is
 

00:27:21.879 --> 00:27:23.369
treated and let me just show you this is
something from what I'm partly from my

00:27:23.369 --> 00:27:23.379
something from what I'm partly from my
 

00:27:23.379 --> 00:27:28.049
something from what I'm partly from my
own work here of course it's Windows is

00:27:28.049 --> 00:27:28.059
own work here of course it's Windows is
 

00:27:28.059 --> 00:27:29.549
own work here of course it's Windows is
updating itself well if you please see

00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559
updating itself well if you please see
 

00:27:29.559 --> 00:27:37.249
updating itself well if you please see
it thanks let me try that one more time

00:27:37.249 --> 00:27:37.259
 
 

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:40.019
 
so just very simply this this is some of

00:27:40.019 --> 00:27:40.029
so just very simply this this is some of
 

00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:41.700
so just very simply this this is some of
the same data that you're using in your

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:41.710
the same data that you're using in your
 

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.430
the same data that you're using in your
book followed by memorials internal

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440
book followed by memorials internal
 

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.139
book followed by memorials internal
record some of the human rights activist

00:27:46.139 --> 00:27:46.149
record some of the human rights activist
 

00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:47.190
record some of the human rights activist
things who are people who are keeping

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200
things who are people who are keeping
 

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.470
things who are people who are keeping
documentary record of the activities of

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:49.480
documentary record of the activities of
 

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.879
documentary record of the activities of
the Russians and these are these are the

00:27:50.879 --> 00:27:50.889
the Russians and these are these are the
 

00:27:50.889 --> 00:27:52.769
the Russians and these are these are the
locations of the sweep operations in

00:27:52.769 --> 00:27:52.779
locations of the sweep operations in
 

00:27:52.779 --> 00:27:55.229
locations of the sweep operations in
that middle third of Chechnya or over

00:27:55.229 --> 00:27:55.239
that middle third of Chechnya or over
 

00:27:55.239 --> 00:27:58.639
that middle third of Chechnya or over
2000 of 2005 there was a 680 of them

00:27:58.639 --> 00:27:58.649
2000 of 2005 there was a 680 of them
 

00:27:58.649 --> 00:28:00.840
2000 of 2005 there was a 680 of them
well the one thing to note is actually

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:00.850
well the one thing to note is actually
 

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:03.299
well the one thing to note is actually
the spatial variation in some places are

00:28:03.299 --> 00:28:03.309
the spatial variation in some places are
 

00:28:03.309 --> 00:28:05.759
the spatial variation in some places are
absolutely ransacked forty times thirty

00:28:05.759 --> 00:28:05.769
absolutely ransacked forty times thirty
 

00:28:05.769 --> 00:28:08.129
absolutely ransacked forty times thirty
times right some places get swept once

00:28:08.129 --> 00:28:08.139
times right some places get swept once
 

00:28:08.139 --> 00:28:09.810
times right some places get swept once
and that's about it twice three times

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:09.820
and that's about it twice three times
 

00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:12.479
and that's about it twice three times
that's the smaller dots in here right

00:28:12.479 --> 00:28:12.489
that's the smaller dots in here right
 

00:28:12.489 --> 00:28:15.269
that's the smaller dots in here right
some places never are swept at all in

00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279
some places never are swept at all in
 

00:28:15.279 --> 00:28:17.789
some places never are swept at all in
this conflict and so for somebody to say

00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799
this conflict and so for somebody to say
 

00:28:17.799 --> 00:28:20.009
this conflict and so for somebody to say
well it's racism it's nationalism that

00:28:20.009 --> 00:28:20.019
well it's racism it's nationalism that
 

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:21.899
well it's racism it's nationalism that
to me says why am I seeing this why

00:28:21.899 --> 00:28:21.909
to me says why am I seeing this why
 

00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:24.119
to me says why am I seeing this why
isn't all of Chechnya sacked why do I

00:28:24.119 --> 00:28:24.129
isn't all of Chechnya sacked why do I
 

00:28:24.129 --> 00:28:25.769
isn't all of Chechnya sacked why do I
observe this variation on the behavior

00:28:25.769 --> 00:28:25.779
observe this variation on the behavior
 

00:28:25.779 --> 00:28:27.629
observe this variation on the behavior
of the Russians soldiers themselves and

00:28:27.629 --> 00:28:27.639
of the Russians soldiers themselves and
 

00:28:27.639 --> 00:28:29.489
of the Russians soldiers themselves and
you actually in the conclusion point out

00:28:29.489 --> 00:28:29.499
you actually in the conclusion point out
 

00:28:29.499 --> 00:28:32.009
you actually in the conclusion point out
that the contract soldiers behaved

00:28:32.009 --> 00:28:32.019
that the contract soldiers behaved
 

00:28:32.019 --> 00:28:33.359
that the contract soldiers behaved
differently than the conscript soldiers

00:28:33.359 --> 00:28:33.369
differently than the conscript soldiers
 

00:28:33.369 --> 00:28:35.369
differently than the conscript soldiers
did and so now there's a little bit of

00:28:35.369 --> 00:28:35.379
did and so now there's a little bit of
 

00:28:35.379 --> 00:28:37.409
did and so now there's a little bit of
nuance in the story about what is this

00:28:37.409 --> 00:28:37.419
nuance in the story about what is this
 

00:28:37.419 --> 00:28:39.239
nuance in the story about what is this
rush and racism but but I don't know

00:28:39.239 --> 00:28:39.249
rush and racism but but I don't know
 

00:28:39.249 --> 00:28:41.159
rush and racism but but I don't know
where that I mean we can imagine where

00:28:41.159 --> 00:28:41.169
where that I mean we can imagine where
 

00:28:41.169 --> 00:28:41.700
where that I mean we can imagine where
that comes from

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:41.710
that comes from
 

00:28:41.710 --> 00:28:43.379
that comes from
but why is it operative in some places

00:28:43.379 --> 00:28:43.389
but why is it operative in some places
 

00:28:43.389 --> 00:28:44.849
but why is it operative in some places
not others wait why does it seem to

00:28:44.849 --> 00:28:44.859
not others wait why does it seem to
 

00:28:44.859 --> 00:28:46.889
not others wait why does it seem to
drive the conflict in some places but

00:28:46.889 --> 00:28:46.899
drive the conflict in some places but
 

00:28:46.899 --> 00:28:48.659
drive the conflict in some places but
again and not in others and so I think

00:28:48.659 --> 00:28:48.669
again and not in others and so I think
 

00:28:48.669 --> 00:28:50.190
again and not in others and so I think
I'm just for me I'm skeptical of these

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:50.200
I'm just for me I'm skeptical of these
 

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.259
I'm just for me I'm skeptical of these
really big cultural factors that don't

00:28:52.259 --> 00:28:52.269
really big cultural factors that don't
 

00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:54.239
really big cultural factors that don't
really move right there's just Russian

00:28:54.239 --> 00:28:54.249
really move right there's just Russian
 

00:28:54.249 --> 00:28:57.330
really move right there's just Russian
racism and perhaps Chechen racism in

00:28:57.330 --> 00:28:57.340
racism and perhaps Chechen racism in
 

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:59.369
racism and perhaps Chechen racism in
return but there's all this kind of

00:28:59.369 --> 00:28:59.379
return but there's all this kind of
 

00:28:59.379 --> 00:29:00.590
return but there's all this kind of
variation in the location

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:00.600
variation in the location
 

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.810
variation in the location
the intensity of the violence to me then

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:02.820
the intensity of the violence to me then
 

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:06.050
the intensity of the violence to me then
the racism is not really driving this it

00:29:06.050 --> 00:29:06.060
the racism is not really driving this it
 

00:29:06.060 --> 00:29:07.400
the racism is not really driving this it
might actually be coming back out of the

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:07.410
might actually be coming back out of the
 

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:09.200
might actually be coming back out of the
conflict but it seems to me that the

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:09.210
conflict but it seems to me that the
 

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.400
conflict but it seems to me that the
burden of proof if you're going to make

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:10.410
burden of proof if you're going to make
 

00:29:10.410 --> 00:29:12.320
burden of proof if you're going to make
that claim is actually on you to tell us

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:12.330
that claim is actually on you to tell us
 

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:13.670
that claim is actually on you to tell us
how is it that it can simultaneously

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:13.680
how is it that it can simultaneously
 

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.530
how is it that it can simultaneously
explain the conflict explain the

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:15.540
explain the conflict explain the
 

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.880
explain the conflict explain the
patterns explain the variation in the

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:16.890
patterns explain the variation in the
 

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.710
patterns explain the variation in the
observed violence and so to me that's

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720
observed violence and so to me that's
 

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.200
observed violence and so to me that's
just too far of a reach I think for the

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:21.210
just too far of a reach I think for the
 

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:22.640
just too far of a reach I think for the
racism the nationalism car but maybe

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:22.650
racism the nationalism car but maybe
 

00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:24.740
racism the nationalism car but maybe
you've got you know a nuanced

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:24.750
you've got you know a nuanced
 

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.090
you've got you know a nuanced
explanation you can get back and that's

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100
explanation you can get back and that's
 

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:27.800
explanation you can get back and that's
maybe in your five minutes but on the

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:27.810
maybe in your five minutes but on the
 

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:29.090
maybe in your five minutes but on the
Russian side there's a lot of variation

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:29.100
Russian side there's a lot of variation
 

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.640
Russian side there's a lot of variation
that I think's not really explained the

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:31.650
that I think's not really explained the
 

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:33.800
that I think's not really explained the
other thing is is from that point of

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:33.810
other thing is is from that point of
 

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.810
other thing is is from that point of
view it strikes me as incredibly odd

00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:35.820
view it strikes me as incredibly odd
 

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:38.300
view it strikes me as incredibly odd
that Chechens would leave the rebellion

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:38.310
that Chechens would leave the rebellion
 

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:39.980
that Chechens would leave the rebellion
or the various insurgent groups and join

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:39.990
or the various insurgent groups and join
 

00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:42.350
or the various insurgent groups and join
the Russian side if this is a conflict

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:42.360
the Russian side if this is a conflict
 

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.750
the Russian side if this is a conflict
about race and ethnicity and nationalism

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760
about race and ethnicity and nationalism
 

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.260
about race and ethnicity and nationalism
why is it that there are so many rebels

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:47.270
why is it that there are so many rebels
 

00:29:47.270 --> 00:29:49.880
why is it that there are so many rebels
breaking ranks and joining the Russian

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:49.890
breaking ranks and joining the Russian
 

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:52.130
breaking ranks and joining the Russian
side in fact really 2003-2004 when these

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140
side in fact really 2003-2004 when these
 

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.500
side in fact really 2003-2004 when these
units are stood up at east-west and then

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:54.510
units are stood up at east-west and then
 

00:29:54.510 --> 00:29:56.120
units are stood up at east-west and then
you finally at north and south these

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:56.130
you finally at north and south these
 

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.060
you finally at north and south these
battalions and as well as Ramzan Zone

00:29:59.060 --> 00:29:59.070
battalions and as well as Ramzan Zone
 

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.310
battalions and as well as Ramzan Zone
forces as well why are you getting this

00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320
forces as well why are you getting this
 

00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.740
forces as well why are you getting this
massive defection of the insurgency why

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:03.750
massive defection of the insurgency why
 

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:05.360
massive defection of the insurgency why
are they defecting to what you would

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:05.370
are they defecting to what you would
 

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:07.700
are they defecting to what you would
imagine as there are racial enemies and

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:07.710
imagine as there are racial enemies and
 

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.400
imagine as there are racial enemies and
in fact to the point where in 2004-2005

00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:10.410
in fact to the point where in 2004-2005
 

00:30:10.410 --> 00:30:12.380
in fact to the point where in 2004-2005
right the number of Chechens who were

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:12.390
right the number of Chechens who were
 

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.000
right the number of Chechens who were
actually fighting against Chechen rebels

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.010
actually fighting against Chechen rebels
 

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:16.580
actually fighting against Chechen rebels
vastly outnumbers in the world of rebels

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:16.590
vastly outnumbers in the world of rebels
 

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:20.060
vastly outnumbers in the world of rebels
by 2005 the numbers I mean these you

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:20.070
by 2005 the numbers I mean these you
 

00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:21.230
by 2005 the numbers I mean these you
know the estimates are soft but the

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:21.240
know the estimates are soft but the
 

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.030
know the estimates are soft but the
numbers are about a thousand five

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:23.040
numbers are about a thousand five
 

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.430
numbers are about a thousand five
hundred fighters still left right at

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440
hundred fighters still left right at
 

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.930
hundred fighters still left right at
some points in the height and the

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940
some points in the height and the
 

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:28.610
some points in the height and the
pro-russian Chechen militias up to

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620
pro-russian Chechen militias up to
 

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.310
pro-russian Chechen militias up to
20,000 soldiers and so this strikes me

00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320
20,000 soldiers and so this strikes me
 

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:32.450
20,000 soldiers and so this strikes me
as that he had just bleed out of the

00:30:32.450 --> 00:30:32.460
as that he had just bleed out of the
 

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.120
as that he had just bleed out of the
insurgency what is it is it really about

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:35.130
insurgency what is it is it really about
 

00:30:35.130 --> 00:30:36.590
insurgency what is it is it really about
race is it really but nationalist why

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600
race is it really but nationalist why
 

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:38.120
race is it really but nationalist why
aren't the rebels basically looking at

00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:38.130
aren't the rebels basically looking at
 

00:30:38.130 --> 00:30:39.110
aren't the rebels basically looking at
the check of the Russians are saying

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120
the check of the Russians are saying
 

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.370
the check of the Russians are saying
they're giving us no mercy they're

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:40.380
they're giving us no mercy they're
 

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:42.050
they're giving us no mercy they're
giving us no Porter there are racial

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:42.060
giving us no Porter there are racial
 

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.880
giving us no Porter there are racial
enemies we've been doing this for 200

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:43.890
enemies we've been doing this for 200
 

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:44.120
enemies we've been doing this for 200
years

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:44.130
years
 

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.010
years
there is no quarter we can't go across

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.020
there is no quarter we can't go across
 

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.840
there is no quarter we can't go across
we can't cross lines but they do and

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:47.850
we can't cross lines but they do and
 

00:30:47.850 --> 00:30:48.710
we can't cross lines but they do and
they do it in droves

00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720
they do it in droves
 

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.380
they do it in droves
sometimes they surrender on Moss so that

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:51.390
sometimes they surrender on Moss so that
 

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:52.850
sometimes they surrender on Moss so that
strikes me is there something else going

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:52.860
strikes me is there something else going
 

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.010
strikes me is there something else going
on in the conflict that's not really

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020
on in the conflict that's not really
 

00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.120
on in the conflict that's not really
about the race card it's really not

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:56.130
about the race card it's really not
 

00:30:56.130 --> 00:30:57.590
about the race card it's really not
about the nationalism car and I think

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600
about the nationalism car and I think
 

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.880
about the nationalism car and I think
actually does work in picked up on the

00:30:58.880 --> 00:30:58.890
actually does work in picked up on the
 

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.650
actually does work in picked up on the
genocide so I picked up on that too and

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:00.660
genocide so I picked up on that too and
 

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.060
genocide so I picked up on that too and
I didn't think that you were necessarily

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:02.070
I didn't think that you were necessarily
 

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:03.680
I didn't think that you were necessarily
claiming that it was a genocide but I

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:03.690
claiming that it was a genocide but I
 

00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.080
claiming that it was a genocide but I
think you were you were definitely

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:05.090
think you were you were definitely
 

00:31:05.090 --> 00:31:08.380
think you were you were definitely
making the argument that the tomorrow

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:08.390
making the argument that the tomorrow
 

00:31:08.390 --> 00:31:13.000
making the argument that the tomorrow
was ethnic in nature we okay we couldn't

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:13.010
was ethnic in nature we okay we couldn't
 

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:14.500
was ethnic in nature we okay we couldn't
prove that but there's a lot of examples

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:14.510
prove that but there's a lot of examples
 

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.640
prove that but there's a lot of examples
in here where you're trying to I think

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:15.650
in here where you're trying to I think
 

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:16.810
in here where you're trying to I think
you see this I think you're walking I

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:16.820
you see this I think you're walking I
 

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:17.830
you see this I think you're walking I
think you're walking right up to that

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840
think you're walking right up to that
 

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:20.440
think you're walking right up to that
line and looking over it and saying well

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:20.450
line and looking over it and saying well
 

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:22.780
line and looking over it and saying well
I'm not gonna call there's a lot of

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:22.790
I'm not gonna call there's a lot of
 

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:49.540
I'm not gonna call there's a lot of
things that are so you do need to be

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:49.550
things that are so you do need to be
 

00:31:49.550 --> 00:32:10.480
things that are so you do need to be
able to prove that intent right does but

00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:10.490
able to prove that intent right does but
 

00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:12.220
able to prove that intent right does but
I but I think I'm with Kim on this one

00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:12.230
I but I think I'm with Kim on this one
 

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.350
I but I think I'm with Kim on this one
you there are suggestive pieces of

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:14.360
you there are suggestive pieces of
 

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:17.740
you there are suggestive pieces of
evidence yeah you use that basically Len

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:17.750
evidence yeah you use that basically Len
 

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.150
evidence yeah you use that basically Len
created you but you're careful right you

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:19.160
created you but you're careful right you
 

00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.350
created you but you're careful right you
say that we don't have all the documents

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:20.360
say that we don't have all the documents
 

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.340
say that we don't have all the documents
we're never gonna have all the

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:21.350
we're never gonna have all the
 

00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:23.470
we're never gonna have all the
documentation right and so I think you

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:23.480
documentation right and so I think you
 

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.850
documentation right and so I think you
walked right up to that line and don't

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:24.860
walked right up to that line and don't
 

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.320
walked right up to that line and don't
but as part of the argument you're

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:26.330
but as part of the argument you're
 

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.060
but as part of the argument you're
making is driven by its sort of broader

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:28.070
making is driven by its sort of broader
 

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:29.380
making is driven by its sort of broader
points that certain bi-racial the

00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:29.390
points that certain bi-racial the
 

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:30.910
points that certain bi-racial the
notions right racial prejudice and

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:30.920
notions right racial prejudice and
 

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.380
notions right racial prejudice and
nationalism and my argument is that

00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:32.390
nationalism and my argument is that
 

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:33.940
nationalism and my argument is that
there are other alternative explanations

00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:33.950
there are other alternative explanations
 

00:32:33.950 --> 00:32:36.340
there are other alternative explanations
at work that that these factors have to

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:36.350
at work that that these factors have to
 

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:38.890
at work that that these factors have to
be proven and against other social

00:32:38.890 --> 00:32:38.900
be proven and against other social
 

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.120
be proven and against other social
science theories about what's driving

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:40.130
science theories about what's driving
 

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:41.650
science theories about what's driving
these conflicts including revenge

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:41.660
these conflicts including revenge
 

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.510
these conflicts including revenge
including operating motives of the

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:43.520
including operating motives of the
 

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.130
including operating motives of the
russian soldiers including theft and

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:45.140
russian soldiers including theft and
 

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.510
russian soldiers including theft and
corruption all these other reasons for

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:46.520
corruption all these other reasons for
 

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.710
corruption all these other reasons for
the why the violence is the way it is

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720
the why the violence is the way it is
 

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:50.320
the why the violence is the way it is
and so so now I think I've used my 10

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:50.330
and so so now I think I've used my 10
 

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:51.460
and so so now I think I've used my 10
minutes on my one point so I'll go a

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:51.470
minutes on my one point so I'll go a
 

00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:54.160
minutes on my one point so I'll go a
little faster on the other ones the

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:54.170
little faster on the other ones the
 

00:32:54.170 --> 00:32:56.470
little faster on the other ones the
second point is the rebels for me are

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:56.480
second point is the rebels for me are
 

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.690
second point is the rebels for me are
still a bit of mystery in the book and I

00:32:58.690 --> 00:32:58.700
still a bit of mystery in the book and I
 

00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.220
still a bit of mystery in the book and I
do think that this is very much

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:00.230
do think that this is very much
 

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:03.070
do think that this is very much
documenting Russian crimes there is one

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:03.080
documenting Russian crimes there is one
 

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.920
documenting Russian crimes there is one
chapter on the on the rebels I agree

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:05.930
chapter on the on the rebels I agree
 

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:07.630
chapter on the on the rebels I agree
with Kim I you know I think there is the

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:07.640
with Kim I you know I think there is the
 

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.310
with Kim I you know I think there is the
political economy side as of is missing

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320
political economy side as of is missing
 

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:10.550
political economy side as of is missing
a bit but actually

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:10.560
a bit but actually
 

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.080
a bit but actually
it's actually harder just to get a sense

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.090
it's actually harder just to get a sense
 

00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:13.760
it's actually harder just to get a sense
of who the rebels are in the book and I

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:13.770
of who the rebels are in the book and I
 

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.080
of who the rebels are in the book and I
have partly because this is not your

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:15.090
have partly because this is not your
 

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:16.640
have partly because this is not your
fault partly because there isn't an

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:16.650
fault partly because there isn't an
 

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:18.410
fault partly because there isn't an
insurgency there are multiple insurgents

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:18.420
insurgency there are multiple insurgents
 

00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:20.780
insurgency there are multiple insurgents
right and they sometimes fight with one

00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:20.790
right and they sometimes fight with one
 

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:22.490
right and they sometimes fight with one
another they very different motives and

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:22.500
another they very different motives and
 

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.700
another they very different motives and
assertions and so where I where I sort

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:25.710
assertions and so where I where I sort
 

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:27.140
assertions and so where I where I sort
of push hard on what you're doing is I

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:27.150
of push hard on what you're doing is I
 

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.940
of push hard on what you're doing is I
don't think this radicalization

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:28.950
don't think this radicalization
 

00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:31.010
don't think this radicalization
narrative the insurgents becoming

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:31.020
narrative the insurgents becoming
 

00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.520
narrative the insurgents becoming
progressively Islamic actually holds and

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:34.530
progressively Islamic actually holds and
 

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:37.640
progressively Islamic actually holds and
so there is a wing of the insurgent see

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:37.650
so there is a wing of the insurgent see
 

00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:39.380
so there is a wing of the insurgent see
that it has become progressively

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:39.390
that it has become progressively
 

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.420
that it has become progressively
radicalized no question but there's a

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:41.430
radicalized no question but there's a
 

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.190
radicalized no question but there's a
huge schism inside the movement even

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200
huge schism inside the movement even
 

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.990
huge schism inside the movement even
today between some more nationalist

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000
today between some more nationalist
 

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.120
today between some more nationalist
forces and more radical groups and they

00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:47.130
forces and more radical groups and they
 

00:33:47.130 --> 00:33:48.860
forces and more radical groups and they
struggle for dominance of the movement

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:48.870
struggle for dominance of the movement
 

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:51.380
struggle for dominance of the movement
and the thing that I that I mean that

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:51.390
and the thing that I that I mean that
 

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:52.850
and the thing that I that I mean that
it's just a sort of commonly repeated

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:52.860
it's just a sort of commonly repeated
 

00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:54.470
it's just a sort of commonly repeated
idea right that the movement is become

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480
idea right that the movement is become
 

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.760
idea right that the movement is become
progressive Islam and progressive

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:55.770
progressive Islam and progressive
 

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.560
progressive Islam and progressive
radicalized yet if you look at the

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:57.570
radicalized yet if you look at the
 

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.150
radicalized yet if you look at the
suicide bombings all right that actually

00:33:59.150 --> 00:33:59.160
suicide bombings all right that actually
 

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.060
suicide bombings all right that actually
go down the heyday of suicide bombing in

00:34:02.060 --> 00:34:02.070
go down the heyday of suicide bombing in
 

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:05.300
go down the heyday of suicide bombing in
Chechnya is 2001 2002 after that is a

00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:05.310
Chechnya is 2001 2002 after that is a
 

00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:06.800
Chechnya is 2001 2002 after that is a
steady decline in the use of these

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:06.810
steady decline in the use of these
 

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:08.480
steady decline in the use of these
tactics in fact there's a huge movement

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:08.490
tactics in fact there's a huge movement
 

00:34:08.490 --> 00:34:10.669
tactics in fact there's a huge movement
inside the overall movement it's

00:34:10.669 --> 00:34:10.679
inside the overall movement it's
 

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:12.919
inside the overall movement it's
actually sort of ban these the use of

00:34:12.919 --> 00:34:12.929
actually sort of ban these the use of
 

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:14.360
actually sort of ban these the use of
this it's a it's not working it's it's

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:14.370
this it's a it's not working it's it's
 

00:34:14.370 --> 00:34:16.220
this it's a it's not working it's it's
alienating the people and so if you look

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:16.230
alienating the people and so if you look
 

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:18.440
alienating the people and so if you look
at the number of suicide attacks inside

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:18.450
at the number of suicide attacks inside
 

00:34:18.450 --> 00:34:21.110
at the number of suicide attacks inside
Chechnya over time the height is 2002 so

00:34:21.110 --> 00:34:21.120
Chechnya over time the height is 2002 so
 

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.669
Chechnya over time the height is 2002 so
in has been progressively dropping which

00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:22.679
in has been progressively dropping which
 

00:34:22.679 --> 00:34:24.919
in has been progressively dropping which
is a weird argument behaviorally for

00:34:24.919 --> 00:34:24.929
is a weird argument behaviorally for
 

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:26.570
is a weird argument behaviorally for
these sort of notions of radicalization

00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580
these sort of notions of radicalization
 

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.850
these sort of notions of radicalization
right there have been these in terrorist

00:34:28.850 --> 00:34:28.860
right there have been these in terrorist
 

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.280
right there have been these in terrorist
groups and terrorist attacks outside of

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:31.290
groups and terrorist attacks outside of
 

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.409
groups and terrorist attacks outside of
Chechnya and we've seen who looted some

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:33.419
Chechnya and we've seen who looted some
 

00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:35.330
Chechnya and we've seen who looted some
we've seen number of them it's not clear

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:35.340
we've seen number of them it's not clear
 

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.619
we've seen number of them it's not clear
that those are Chechens first of all

00:34:36.619 --> 00:34:36.629
that those are Chechens first of all
 

00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:39.159
that those are Chechens first of all
because the conflict has spread out and

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:39.169
because the conflict has spread out and
 

00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:41.450
because the conflict has spread out and
it's second of all it's maybe it's a

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.460
it's second of all it's maybe it's a
 

00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:43.280
it's second of all it's maybe it's a
single piece of the insurgency but it's

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:43.290
single piece of the insurgency but it's
 

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:45.409
single piece of the insurgency but it's
not the whole insurgency and I think we

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:45.419
not the whole insurgency and I think we
 

00:34:45.419 --> 00:34:46.490
not the whole insurgency and I think we
lose sight of the fact that this

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:46.500
lose sight of the fact that this
 

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.500
lose sight of the fact that this
movement is fractured it's divided and I

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:48.510
movement is fractured it's divided and I
 

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.690
movement is fractured it's divided and I
think oftentimes it's just isn't a

00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:50.700
think oftentimes it's just isn't a
 

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.639
think oftentimes it's just isn't a
movement sometimes it is just simple

00:34:52.639 --> 00:34:52.649
movement sometimes it is just simple
 

00:34:52.649 --> 00:34:55.280
movement sometimes it is just simple
revenge people taking shots at Russian

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:55.290
revenge people taking shots at Russian
 

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:57.020
revenge people taking shots at Russian
forces are now Pro Russian and Chechen

00:34:57.020 --> 00:34:57.030
forces are now Pro Russian and Chechen
 

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.090
forces are now Pro Russian and Chechen
forces and it isn't they're not ascribed

00:34:59.090 --> 00:34:59.100
forces and it isn't they're not ascribed
 

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.770
forces and it isn't they're not ascribed
to any kind of movement they're just

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:00.780
to any kind of movement they're just
 

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:02.540
to any kind of movement they're just
taking revenge for something that's been

00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:02.550
taking revenge for something that's been

afflicted on them there are estimates

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:04.230
afflicted on them there are estimates
 

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.930
afflicted on them there are estimates
that you know up to 80 percent of the

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940
that you know up to 80 percent of the
 

00:35:05.940 --> 00:35:07.550
that you know up to 80 percent of the
Taliban in Afghanistan operate in the

Taliban in Afghanistan operate in the
 

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.560
Taliban in Afghanistan operate in the
same way where we say the Taliban but

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:09.570
same way where we say the Taliban but
 

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.080
same way where we say the Taliban but
isn't there isn't a Taliban and in fact

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:12.090
isn't there isn't a Taliban and in fact
 

00:35:12.090 --> 00:35:14.210
isn't there isn't a Taliban and in fact
it may not even be a unified movement I

00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220
it may not even be a unified movement I
 

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:15.140
it may not even be a unified movement I
think this is very much the case in

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:15.150
think this is very much the case in
 

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:17.030
think this is very much the case in
position yet in part because a Russian

position yet in part because a Russian
 

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.070
position yet in part because a Russian
state has shattered the insurgency I

state has shattered the insurgency I
 

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.840
state has shattered the insurgency I
mean I think part of what gets lost a

00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:20.850
mean I think part of what gets lost a
 

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:21.660
mean I think part of what gets lost a
little bit in

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:21.670
little bit in

Woori details of the book and and of the

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:24.190
Woori details of the book and and of the
 

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:25.680
Woori details of the book and and of the
conflict is that the Russians have

00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:25.690
conflict is that the Russians have
 

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.980
conflict is that the Russians have
largely won in Chechnya and I think this

00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:28.990
largely won in Chechnya and I think this
 

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:30.329
largely won in Chechnya and I think this
raises a really interesting set of

00:35:30.329 --> 00:35:30.339
raises a really interesting set of
 

00:35:30.339 --> 00:35:32.390
raises a really interesting set of
questions both morally as well as

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400
questions both morally as well as
 

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.710
questions both morally as well as
pragmatically you know what happens if

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:34.720
pragmatically you know what happens if
 

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.329
pragmatically you know what happens if
you're a human rights activist who wants

00:35:36.329 --> 00:35:36.339
you're a human rights activist who wants
 

00:35:36.339 --> 00:35:38.309
you're a human rights activist who wants
to decry these human rights abuses and

00:35:38.309 --> 00:35:38.319
to decry these human rights abuses and
 

00:35:38.319 --> 00:35:39.480
to decry these human rights abuses and
the Russian state turns you and said

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:39.490
the Russian state turns you and said
 

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:41.760
the Russian state turns you and said
look we're winning right what is the

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:41.770
look we're winning right what is the
 

00:35:41.770 --> 00:35:43.289
look we're winning right what is the
what is the push back to go sort of this

00:35:43.289 --> 00:35:43.299
what is the push back to go sort of this
 

00:35:43.299 --> 00:35:45.210
what is the push back to go sort of this
theme of the human rights on this panel

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:45.220
theme of the human rights on this panel
 

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.130
theme of the human rights on this panel
and this is speaking seriously what is

00:35:47.130 --> 00:35:47.140
and this is speaking seriously what is
 

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.809
and this is speaking seriously what is
the leverage you can use if that state

00:35:48.809 --> 00:35:48.819
the leverage you can use if that state
 

00:35:48.819 --> 00:35:50.130
the leverage you can use if that state
believes that this is the way in which

own citizens to do this I'm not clear
 

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.190
own citizens to do this I'm not clear
what the arguments are but if you look

00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200
what the arguments are but if you look
 

00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:58.349
what the arguments are but if you look
at these practices that the insurgency

00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359
at these practices that the insurgency
 

00:35:58.359 --> 00:36:00.150
at these practices that the insurgency

it's a sheer Russian use of brutality in

allowed to buy off the rebels so there

00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:18.760
allowed to buy off the rebels so there
 

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:20.339
allowed to buy off the rebels so there

the pro-russian government in Chechnya
has largely used force selectively but a

00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480
has largely used force selectively but a
 

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.930
has largely used force selectively but a
lot of carrots - and this kind of

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:30.940
lot of carrots - and this kind of
 

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.970
lot of carrots - and this kind of
nuanced perspective I think gets lost we

00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:32.980
nuanced perspective I think gets lost we
 

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.380

actually a lot of strategies not just

00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599
actually a lot of strategies not just
 

00:36:37.599 --> 00:36:39.270
actually a lot of strategies not just
that Ramzan is this brutal act or the

tiger there's that side of him but
 

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.109
tiger there's that side of him but
there's also not clear and we can debate

00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119
there's also not clear and we can debate
 

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:45.180
there's also not clear and we can debate
that in the discussion okay yeah and so

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:45.190
that in the discussion okay yeah and so
 

00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:46.740
that in the discussion okay yeah and so
I think there actually is a calculated

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:46.750
I think there actually is a calculated
 

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:48.089
I think there actually is a calculated

00:36:48.089 --> 00:36:48.099
strategy oxidant disagree I think
 

00:36:48.099 --> 00:36:50.039
strategy oxidant disagree I think
there's Putin has more control than I

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:50.049
there's Putin has more control than I

group of people I was really surprised

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:03.609
group of people I was really surprised
 

00:37:03.609 --> 00:37:04.650
group of people I was really surprised
we're not in the book with Russians

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:04.660
we're not in the book with Russians
 

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:06.750
we're not in the book with Russians
themselves and I wonder what the

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760
themselves and I wonder what the
 

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.010
themselves and I wonder what the
Russians thought of this is very good

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:08.020
Russians thought of this is very good
 

00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:10.109
Russians thought of this is very good

00:37:13.170 --> 00:37:13.180
settlement in Chechnya
 

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.970
settlement in Chechnya
and there seems to be a general

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:14.980
and there seems to be a general
 

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:17.039
and there seems to be a general
tiredness among the people for of the

00:37:17.039 --> 00:37:17.049

war in particular the cost of their

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:18.430
war in particular the cost of their
 

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:19.740
war in particular the cost of their
paying and particularly when there were

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:19.750
paying and particularly when there were
 

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:21.299

conscripts young kids going down and

00:37:21.299 --> 00:37:21.309
conscripts young kids going down and
 

00:37:21.309 --> 00:37:22.799
conscripts young kids going down and
there were their kids going down to

00:37:22.799 --> 00:37:22.809
there were their kids going down to
 

00:37:22.809 --> 00:37:24.030
there were their kids going down to
fight and they're typically

00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:24.040
fight and they're typically
 

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.589
fight and they're typically
ill-equipped to do this I mean this is

00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599
ill-equipped to do this I mean this is
 

00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:27.750
ill-equipped to do this I mean this is
why you get a lot of this rating and and

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760
why you get a lot of this rating and and
 

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.579
why you get a lot of this rating and and
these sweep operations so they can get

00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:29.589
these sweep operations so they can get
 

00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:31.510
these sweep operations so they can get
food right and

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520
food right and
 

00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.830
food right and
and things that supplies things of that

00:37:32.830 --> 00:37:32.840
and things that supplies things of that
 

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.540
and things that supplies things of that
nature and so I wondered what you

00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:34.550
nature and so I wondered what you
 

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:36.340
nature and so I wondered what you
thought of the Russians and just the

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:36.350
thought of the Russians and just the
 

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:38.050
thought of the Russians and just the
Russian people and having them look at

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:38.060
Russian people and having them look at
 

00:37:38.060 --> 00:37:39.940
Russian people and having them look at
this conflict and how the human rights

00:37:39.940 --> 00:37:39.950
this conflict and how the human rights
 

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:42.040
this conflict and how the human rights
group interface with them I spent the

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:42.050
group interface with them I spent the
 

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.380
group interface with them I spent the
early 2000s with the human rights groups

00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:44.390
early 2000s with the human rights groups
 

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.150
early 2000s with the human rights groups
standing on street corners handing out

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:46.160
standing on street corners handing out
 

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.770
standing on street corners handing out
leaflets and watching them hand out the

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:47.780
leaflets and watching them hand out the
 

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.240
leaflets and watching them hand out the
leaflets and people would just walk by

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:49.250
leaflets and people would just walk by
 

00:37:49.250 --> 00:37:51.310
leaflets and people would just walk by
and I wonder if that was because of

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:51.320
and I wonder if that was because of
 

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.810
and I wonder if that was because of
Russian and DIF kind of like American

00:37:52.810 --> 00:37:52.820
Russian and DIF kind of like American
 

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:54.580

that there was a set of strategies that

that there was a set of strategies that

when we stood out there and I froze my

Peter and winters they would hand out

Peter and winters they would hand out
 

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:20.500
Peter and winters they would hand out
broad sheets that had all the lists of

00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:20.510
broad sheets that had all the lists of
 

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.630
broad sheets that had all the lists of
atrocities and they would light a candle

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640
atrocities and they would light a candle
 

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.400
atrocities and they would light a candle
and they'd stand out there for about 90

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:24.410
and they'd stand out there for about 90
 

00:38:24.410 --> 00:38:26.109
and they'd stand out there for about 90
minutes 100 minutes or so and then

00:38:26.109 --> 00:38:26.119
minutes 100 minutes or so and then
 

00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:28.000
minutes 100 minutes or so and then
they'd go home and that was the extent

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:28.010
they'd go home and that was the extent

of the outreach they were there to be a
symbol and I almost often wondered that

symbol and I almost often wondered that
 

00:38:31.460 --> 00:38:33.130
symbol and I almost often wondered that
there wasn't a real lost opportunity to

there wasn't a real lost opportunity to
 

00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:34.480

things that we did in the in the early
 

00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:27.500
things that we did in the in the early
or in the late 90s and early 2000s was

actually do the documentation of the
 

00:40:29.730 --> 00:40:31.730
actually do the documentation of the
human rights abuses that were that were

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740
human rights abuses that were that were
 

00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:35.120
human rights abuses that were that were
taking place and doing that work it was

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:35.130
taking place and doing that work it was
 

00:40:35.130 --> 00:40:37.640
taking place and doing that work it was
never my feeling that this was a

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:37.650
never my feeling that this was a
 

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:38.180
never my feeling that this was a
genocide

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:38.190
genocide
 

00:40:38.190 --> 00:40:41.840
genocide
we were not I don't think the intent to

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:41.850
we were not I don't think the intent to
 

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:45.620
we were not I don't think the intent to
destroy in part or in whole a particular

00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:45.630
destroy in part or in whole a particular
 

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:49.070
destroy in part or in whole a particular
population was there I think what we

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:49.080
population was there I think what we
 

00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:55.070
population was there I think what we
were looking at was a and armed forces

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:55.080
were looking at was a and armed forces
 

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.020
were looking at was a and armed forces
and police forces that were incompetent

00:40:59.020 --> 00:40:59.030
and police forces that were incompetent
 

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:02.570
and police forces that were incompetent
that had gotten certain you know they

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:02.580
that had gotten certain you know they
 

00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:04.790
that had gotten certain you know they
were they were they were given certain

00:41:04.790 --> 00:41:04.800
were they were they were given certain
 

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.310
were they were they were given certain
objectives that they they had to achieve

00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.320
objectives that they they had to achieve
 

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.130
objectives that they they had to achieve
they had no idea how to do that they

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140
they had no idea how to do that they
 

00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.250
they had no idea how to do that they
didn't have the sophisticated material

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:13.260
didn't have the sophisticated material
 

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.060
didn't have the sophisticated material
you know equipment etcetera that they

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:17.070
you know equipment etcetera that they
 

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.360
you know equipment etcetera that they
needed to be able to do that they didn't

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:20.370
needed to be able to do that they didn't
 

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.840
needed to be able to do that they didn't
have the kind of intellectual resources

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:22.850
have the kind of intellectual resources
 

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:27.920
have the kind of intellectual resources
to do it and so the the the conflict

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:27.930
to do it and so the the the conflict
 

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:30.530
to do it and so the the the conflict
really degenerated into something where

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540
really degenerated into something where
 

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.110
really degenerated into something where
I think the racism that already existed

00:41:33.110 --> 00:41:33.120
I think the racism that already existed
 

00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.880
I think the racism that already existed
the hatred of the Chechens that already

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:34.890
the hatred of the Chechens that already
 

00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:37.310
the hatred of the Chechens that already
existed I think that is really what

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:37.320
existed I think that is really what
 

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:41.390
existed I think that is really what
turned it into such an abusive conflict

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400
turned it into such an abusive conflict
 

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.590
turned it into such an abusive conflict
but but I don't think there was an

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:42.600
but but I don't think there was an
 

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:46.370
but but I don't think there was an
intent to to commit genocide and I think

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:46.380
intent to to commit genocide and I think
 

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.599
intent to to commit genocide and I think
if you look at that the map

00:41:49.599 --> 00:41:49.609
if you look at that the map
 

00:41:49.609 --> 00:41:52.630
if you look at that the map
you put up Jason I think this it

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640
you put up Jason I think this it
 

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:58.450
you put up Jason I think this it
illustrates very clearly how how in

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:58.460
illustrates very clearly how how in
 

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.950
illustrates very clearly how how in
certain parts of Chechnya there was very

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960
certain parts of Chechnya there was very
 

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.229
certain parts of Chechnya there was very
you know there weren't as many abuses

00:42:05.229 --> 00:42:05.239
you know there weren't as many abuses
 

00:42:05.239 --> 00:42:07.269
you know there weren't as many abuses
the north of Jetts Nia we documented

00:42:07.269 --> 00:42:07.279
the north of Jetts Nia we documented
 

00:42:07.279 --> 00:42:09.220
the north of Jetts Nia we documented
very few abuses there were a few

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:09.230
very few abuses there were a few
 

00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:11.529
very few abuses there were a few
disappearances a few sweep operations

00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:11.539
disappearances a few sweep operations
 

00:42:11.539 --> 00:42:13.720
disappearances a few sweep operations
but it was really mostly in that middle

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:13.730
but it was really mostly in that middle
 

00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:18.519
but it was really mostly in that middle
stretch of of Chechnya which is well

00:42:18.519 --> 00:42:18.529
stretch of of Chechnya which is well
 

00:42:18.529 --> 00:42:20.499
stretch of of Chechnya which is well
most densely populated but which is also

00:42:20.499 --> 00:42:20.509
most densely populated but which is also
 

00:42:20.509 --> 00:42:22.599
most densely populated but which is also
kind of you know edging on the on the

00:42:22.599 --> 00:42:22.609
kind of you know edging on the on the
 

00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:24.099
kind of you know edging on the on the
mountains which is where a lot of the

00:42:24.099 --> 00:42:24.109
mountains which is where a lot of the
 

00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:26.109
mountains which is where a lot of the
rebel activity sprouted from and so I

00:42:26.109 --> 00:42:26.119
rebel activity sprouted from and so I
 

00:42:26.119 --> 00:42:28.720
rebel activity sprouted from and so I
think and then when I I've spent a lot

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:28.730
think and then when I I've spent a lot
 

00:42:28.730 --> 00:42:30.609
think and then when I I've spent a lot
of time thinking about the

00:42:30.609 --> 00:42:30.619
of time thinking about the
 

00:42:30.619 --> 00:42:32.380
of time thinking about the
disappearances that were happening and

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:32.390
disappearances that were happening and
 

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.970
disappearances that were happening and
as you I mean you talk in your book

00:42:33.970 --> 00:42:33.980
as you I mean you talk in your book
 

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.979
as you I mean you talk in your book
about you know three to five thousand

00:42:35.979 --> 00:42:35.989
about you know three to five thousand
 

00:42:35.989 --> 00:42:38.289
about you know three to five thousand
people who are estimated to have

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:38.299
people who are estimated to have
 

00:42:38.299 --> 00:42:41.049
people who are estimated to have
disappeared and and I've spent a lot of

00:42:41.049 --> 00:42:41.059
disappeared and and I've spent a lot of
 

00:42:41.059 --> 00:42:42.430
disappeared and and I've spent a lot of
time thinking about you know how did

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440
time thinking about you know how did
 

00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.650
time thinking about you know how did
those disappearances actually happen why

00:42:44.650 --> 00:42:44.660
those disappearances actually happen why
 

00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.989
those disappearances actually happen why
did this become such a wave of

00:42:46.989 --> 00:42:46.999
did this become such a wave of
 

00:42:46.999 --> 00:42:49.809
did this become such a wave of
disappearances over over the course of

00:42:49.809 --> 00:42:49.819
disappearances over over the course of
 

00:42:49.819 --> 00:42:51.819
disappearances over over the course of
several years and and my sense is really

00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:51.829
several years and and my sense is really
 

00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:55.120
several years and and my sense is really
that what what happened was that once

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.130
that what what happened was that once
 

00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:56.589
that what what happened was that once
the Russians had more or less

00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599
the Russians had more or less
 

00:42:56.599 --> 00:42:58.960
the Russians had more or less
established kind of nominal control over

00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:58.970
established kind of nominal control over
 

00:42:58.970 --> 00:43:01.479
established kind of nominal control over
much of Chechen s territory the

00:43:01.479 --> 00:43:01.489
much of Chechen s territory the
 

00:43:01.489 --> 00:43:03.910
much of Chechen s territory the
insurgency was still going on in you

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920
insurgency was still going on in you
 

00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.529
insurgency was still going on in you
know all of these towns in study up the

00:43:05.529 --> 00:43:05.539
know all of these towns in study up the
 

00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:08.380
know all of these towns in study up the
Gihon or smart on etc all of those towns

00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:08.390
Gihon or smart on etc all of those towns
 

00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:10.269
Gihon or smart on etc all of those towns
were supposedly under Russian control

00:43:10.269 --> 00:43:10.279
were supposedly under Russian control
 

00:43:10.279 --> 00:43:12.729
were supposedly under Russian control
but the rebels were operating you know

00:43:12.729 --> 00:43:12.739
but the rebels were operating you know
 

00:43:12.739 --> 00:43:15.640
but the rebels were operating you know
pretty openly and and pretty freely and

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:15.650
pretty openly and and pretty freely and
 

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:17.799
pretty openly and and pretty freely and
so I think what was happening was that

00:43:17.799 --> 00:43:17.809
so I think what was happening was that
 

00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:20.739
so I think what was happening was that
the Russians would get an informant who

00:43:20.739 --> 00:43:20.749
the Russians would get an informant who
 

00:43:20.749 --> 00:43:22.900
the Russians would get an informant who
would give a name they would then pick

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:22.910
would give a name they would then pick
 

00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:24.519
would give a name they would then pick
up that person they would torture that

00:43:24.519 --> 00:43:24.529
up that person they would torture that
 

00:43:24.529 --> 00:43:26.859
up that person they would torture that
person until that person gave up you

00:43:26.859 --> 00:43:26.869
person until that person gave up you
 

00:43:26.869 --> 00:43:29.349
person until that person gave up you
know gave more names then that person

00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359
know gave more names then that person
 

00:43:29.359 --> 00:43:30.759
know gave more names then that person
would be killed would be dumped

00:43:30.759 --> 00:43:30.769
would be killed would be dumped
 

00:43:30.769 --> 00:43:32.769
would be killed would be dumped
somewhere in a forest and they would you

00:43:32.769 --> 00:43:32.779
somewhere in a forest and they would you
 

00:43:32.779 --> 00:43:34.900
somewhere in a forest and they would you
know that kind of they went for the the

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:34.910
know that kind of they went for the the
 

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:36.729
know that kind of they went for the the
people whose names were were mentioned

00:43:36.729 --> 00:43:36.739
people whose names were were mentioned
 

00:43:36.739 --> 00:43:38.890
people whose names were were mentioned
and they picked them big them up and the

00:43:38.890 --> 00:43:38.900
and they picked them big them up and the
 

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:40.539
and they picked them big them up and the
same thing happened with them and so

00:43:40.539 --> 00:43:40.549
same thing happened with them and so
 

00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:44.259
same thing happened with them and so
that kind of led to this you know this

00:43:44.259 --> 00:43:44.269
that kind of led to this you know this
 

00:43:44.269 --> 00:43:48.519
that kind of led to this you know this
wave of disappearances but I don't think

00:43:48.519 --> 00:43:48.529
wave of disappearances but I don't think
 

00:43:48.529 --> 00:43:50.529
wave of disappearances but I don't think
there was necessarily you know the the

00:43:50.529 --> 00:43:50.539
there was necessarily you know the the
 

00:43:50.539 --> 00:43:52.299
there was necessarily you know the the
intent to kill all of these people I

00:43:52.299 --> 00:43:52.309
intent to kill all of these people I
 

00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:54.970
intent to kill all of these people I
mean this was part of a a very very

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:54.980
mean this was part of a a very very
 

00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:58.749
mean this was part of a a very very
poorly executed military or policing

00:43:58.749 --> 00:43:58.759
poorly executed military or policing
 

00:43:58.759 --> 00:44:02.950
poorly executed military or policing
strategy in which clearly

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960
strategy in which clearly
 

00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.870
strategy in which clearly
Russian commanders did not give a hoot

00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:04.880
Russian commanders did not give a hoot
 

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.609
Russian commanders did not give a hoot
about what was happening to two

00:44:06.609 --> 00:44:06.619
about what was happening to two
 

00:44:06.619 --> 00:44:08.140
about what was happening to two
junctions right I mean I think it's the

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:08.150
junctions right I mean I think it's the
 

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:10.960
junctions right I mean I think it's the
it's the the negligence on the part of

00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:10.970
it's the the negligence on the part of
 

00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:13.270
it's the the negligence on the part of
the leadership much more than that there

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280
the leadership much more than that there
 

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.270
the leadership much more than that there
were specific orders to the to two

00:44:16.270 --> 00:44:16.280
were specific orders to the to two
 

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.570
were specific orders to the to two
soldiers to commit these abuses so

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:19.580
soldiers to commit these abuses so
 

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:23.880
soldiers to commit these abuses so
that's the first the the second point is

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:23.890
that's the first the the second point is
 

00:44:23.890 --> 00:44:27.160
that's the first the the second point is
about the European Court which of course

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:27.170
about the European Court which of course
 

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:29.920
about the European Court which of course

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:32.510
talk about that because I was one of the
 

00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:33.970
talk about that because I was one of the
one of the people who was very much

00:44:33.970 --> 00:44:33.980
one of the people who was very much
 

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:36.339

applications to the European Court from
 

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:43.510
applications to the European Court from
from Chechen victims of abuses and you

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:43.520
from Chechen victims of abuses and you
 

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:47.589
from Chechen victims of abuses and you
you you you say in in the chapter on the

00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599
you you you say in in the chapter on the
 

00:44:47.599 --> 00:44:54.339
you you you say in in the chapter on the
court that it has a controversial the

00:44:54.339 --> 00:44:54.349
court that it has a controversial the
 

00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:56.200
court that it has a controversial the
role of the court is a controversial one

00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:56.210
role of the court is a controversial one
 

00:44:56.210 --> 00:45:01.240
role of the court is a controversial one
and and you kinda mean you explain why

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:01.250
and and you kinda mean you explain why
 

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:03.849
and and you kinda mean you explain why
you think that it was is a controversial

00:45:03.849 --> 00:45:03.859
you think that it was is a controversial
 

00:45:03.859 --> 00:45:06.190
you think that it was is a controversial
one but I think that's actually a bit of

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:06.200
one but I think that's actually a bit of
 

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.230
one but I think that's actually a bit of
a mischaracterization of the role of the

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:08.240
a mischaracterization of the role of the
 

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:12.520
a mischaracterization of the role of the
court because the court has a particular

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:12.530
court because the court has a particular
 

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:16.089
court because the court has a particular
mandate and it is fulfilling that

00:45:16.089 --> 00:45:16.099
mandate and it is fulfilling that
 

00:45:16.099 --> 00:45:18.780
mandate and it is fulfilling that
mandate and that mandate is not to

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:18.790
mandate and that mandate is not to
 

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:21.810
mandate and that mandate is not to
conduct criminal investigations to try

00:45:21.810 --> 00:45:21.820
conduct criminal investigations to try
 

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.820
conduct criminal investigations to try
people accused of war crimes or crimes

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:24.830
people accused of war crimes or crimes
 

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:28.180
people accused of war crimes or crimes
against humanity it plays you know it

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:28.190
against humanity it plays you know it
 

00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:32.740
against humanity it plays you know it
plays the role of adjudicating a case

00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:32.750
plays the role of adjudicating a case
 

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.230
plays the role of adjudicating a case
between an individual who claims their

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:35.240
between an individual who claims their
 

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:38.050
between an individual who claims their
rights have been violated and and the

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:38.060
rights have been violated and and the
 

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.579
rights have been violated and and the
country that is alleged to have

00:45:39.579 --> 00:45:39.589
country that is alleged to have
 

00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:42.339
country that is alleged to have
committed that violation and so I think

00:45:42.339 --> 00:45:42.349
committed that violation and so I think
 

00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:47.500
committed that violation and so I think
it's really more the the this Court

00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:47.510
it's really more the the this Court
 

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:49.960
it's really more the the this Court
could only play this role it's the fact

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:49.970
could only play this role it's the fact
 

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:51.490
could only play this role it's the fact
that the international community didn't

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:51.500
that the international community didn't
 

00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:54.550
that the international community didn't
step up to the plate and say what is

00:45:54.550 --> 00:45:54.560
step up to the plate and say what is
 

00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:56.349
step up to the plate and say what is
happening in Chechnya are war crimes and

00:45:56.349 --> 00:45:56.359
happening in Chechnya are war crimes and
 

00:45:56.359 --> 00:45:58.810
happening in Chechnya are war crimes and
are crimes and humanity that means that

00:45:58.810 --> 00:45:58.820
are crimes and humanity that means that
 

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:01.210
are crimes and humanity that means that
there needs to be a response the way

00:46:01.210 --> 00:46:01.220
there needs to be a response the way
 

00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:04.180
there needs to be a response the way
there was with Ronda or with with you

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:04.190
there was with Ronda or with with you
 

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:06.339
there was with Ronda or with with you
miss la Via that has kind of pushed the

00:46:06.339 --> 00:46:06.349
miss la Via that has kind of pushed the
 

00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:09.040
miss la Via that has kind of pushed the
European Court of Human Rights into kind

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:09.050
European Court of Human Rights into kind
 

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.400
European Court of Human Rights into kind
of the only institution that was you

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:12.410
of the only institution that was you
 

00:46:12.410 --> 00:46:14.870
of the only institution that was you
know that was hearing cases that was

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880
know that was hearing cases that was
 

00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.150
know that was hearing cases that was
looking at the you know at the evidence

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160
looking at the you know at the evidence
 

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.370
looking at the you know at the evidence
and assessing the evidence so I think

00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380
and assessing the evidence so I think
 

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:21.789
and assessing the evidence so I think
the court was kind of pushed into a role

00:46:21.789 --> 00:46:21.799
the court was kind of pushed into a role
 

00:46:21.799 --> 00:46:25.370
the court was kind of pushed into a role
that it was never you know it was never

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:25.380
that it was never you know it was never
 

00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.450
that it was never you know it was never
meant to play or maybe we or Chechen

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460
meant to play or maybe we or Chechen
 

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:33.019

civilians are kind of projecting what we

00:46:33.019 --> 00:46:33.029
civilians are kind of projecting what we
 

00:46:33.029 --> 00:46:35.299
civilians are kind of projecting what we
would like to see on a court that

00:46:35.299 --> 00:46:35.309
would like to see on a court that
 

00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:37.880
would like to see on a court that
doesn't have that that kind of

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:37.890
doesn't have that that kind of
 

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:44.390
doesn't have that that kind of
jurisdiction and then you talked about a

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400
jurisdiction and then you talked about a
 

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:49.220
jurisdiction and then you talked about a
documentation center and I think if we

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:49.230
documentation center and I think if we
 

00:46:49.230 --> 00:46:51.650
documentation center and I think if we
look at what the numbers of cases that

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:51.660
look at what the numbers of cases that
 

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.740
look at what the numbers of cases that
the European Court of Human Rights has

00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:53.750
the European Court of Human Rights has
 

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:56.569
the European Court of Human Rights has
has looked at so far the number of

00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579
has looked at so far the number of
 

00:46:56.579 --> 00:47:01.940
has looked at so far the number of
judgments we have is I think 165 right

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:01.950
judgments we have is I think 165 right
 

00:47:01.950 --> 00:47:06.529
judgments we have is I think 165 right
now it's looked at hundreds of of cases

00:47:06.529 --> 00:47:06.539
now it's looked at hundreds of of cases
 

00:47:06.539 --> 00:47:08.809
now it's looked at hundreds of of cases
of disappearances probably approaching

think that's a moral victory that is

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:57.170
think that's a moral victory that is
 

00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:59.920
think that's a moral victory that is
really really important for for many of

00:51:59.920 --> 00:51:59.930
really really important for for many of
 

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:01.900
really really important for for many of
of the victims that that we've

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:01.910
of the victims that that we've
 

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.930
of the victims that that we've
represented over the years and so it's

00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:04.940
represented over the years and so it's
 

00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:06.759
represented over the years and so it's
not just you know the money is only a

not just you know the money is only a
 

00:52:06.769 --> 00:52:09.969
not just you know the money is only a
small a small part of it but I have to

00:52:09.969 --> 00:52:09.979
small a small part of it but I have to
 

00:52:09.979 --> 00:52:13.660
small a small part of it but I have to
say once you win the case that you know

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:13.670
say once you win the case that you know
 

00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:16.329
say once you win the case that you know
that the applicants actually do want the

00:52:16.329 --> 00:52:16.339
that the applicants actually do want the
 

00:52:16.339 --> 00:52:17.859
that the applicants actually do want the
money because that most of them are

00:52:17.859 --> 00:52:17.869
money because that most of them are
 

00:52:17.869 --> 00:52:20.170
money because that most of them are
desperately poor and so if you know if

00:52:43.970 --> 00:53:05.410
one
and well I have five minutes okay so

00:53:05.410 --> 00:53:05.420
and well I have five minutes okay so
 

00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:08.110
and well I have five minutes okay so
okay I just I might go backwards

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:08.120
okay I just I might go backwards
 

00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:11.580

somewhat and I'm I hope Diedrich that

00:53:11.580 --> 00:53:11.590
somewhat and I'm I hope Diedrich that
 

00:53:11.590 --> 00:53:14.290

that the chapter didn't come across as

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:14.300
that the chapter didn't come across as

that the chapter didn't come across as
unduly harsh on the European Court I I

00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880
unduly harsh on the European Court I I
 

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.000
unduly harsh on the European Court I I
think that wasn't my intention actually

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:19.010
think that wasn't my intention actually
 

00:53:19.010 --> 00:53:24.010
think that wasn't my intention actually
and in many respects I used that notion

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:24.020
and in many respects I used that notion
 

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:26.470
and in many respects I used that notion
of the fee for human life because for

00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480
of the fee for human life because for
 

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.060
of the fee for human life because for
some people that I had talked to that

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:28.070
some people that I had talked to that

some people that I had talked to that

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:30.530
was how they equated it and it's a very
 

00:53:30.530 --> 00:53:33.820
was how they equated it and it's a very
strong quote and perhaps slightly

00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:33.830
strong quote and perhaps slightly
 

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:37.390
strong quote and perhaps slightly
misused in in that sense but the degree

00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400
misused in in that sense but the degree
 

00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:39.790
misused in in that sense but the degree
to which I guess that I support what's

00:53:39.790 --> 00:53:39.800
to which I guess that I support what's
 

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.110
to which I guess that I support what's
happening at the European Court of Human

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:41.120
happening at the European Court of Human
 

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.430

article now on the ways in which the

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:46.550
article now on the ways in which the
 

00:53:46.550 --> 00:53:48.550
article now on the ways in which the
judgments of the court are helping us to

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:48.560
judgments of the court are helping us to
 

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:51.220
judgments of the court are helping us to
understand the conflict better so in

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:51.230
understand the conflict better so in
 

00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:53.140
understand the conflict better so in
that regard I totally agree with you

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:53.150
that regard I totally agree with you
 

00:53:53.150 --> 00:54:02.010
that regard I totally agree with you
about the documentation okay

00:54:02.010 --> 00:54:02.020
 
 

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:09.460
 
the when I said you said that that the

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:09.470
the when I said you said that that the
 

00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:11.140
the when I said you said that that the
role of the court is a controversial one

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:11.150
role of the court is a controversial one
 

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:12.760
role of the court is a controversial one
and you felt that perhaps I'd

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:12.770
and you felt that perhaps I'd
 

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:15.720
and you felt that perhaps I'd
mischaracterized that that actually

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:15.730
mischaracterized that that actually
 

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:19.780
mischaracterized that that actually
wasn't was that my role wasn't to to

00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:19.790
wasn't was that my role wasn't to to
 

00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:22.630
wasn't was that my role wasn't to to
mischaracterize it I think what I was

00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640
mischaracterize it I think what I was
 

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:25.270
mischaracterize it I think what I was
trying to say was that although these

00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:25.280
trying to say was that although these
 

00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:28.780
trying to say was that although these
cases are extremely important what I

00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:28.790
cases are extremely important what I
 

00:54:28.790 --> 00:54:32.260
cases are extremely important what I
found lacking was evidence that the role

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:32.270
found lacking was evidence that the role
 

00:54:32.270 --> 00:54:33.850
found lacking was evidence that the role
of the court not only by paying

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:33.860
of the court not only by paying
 

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.160
of the court not only by paying
compensation but actually part of their

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:36.170
compensation but actually part of their
 

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:37.570
compensation but actually part of their
role is to pressure the Russian

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:37.580
role is to pressure the Russian
 

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.640
role is to pressure the Russian
government of the Russian judiciary to

00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:39.650
government of the Russian judiciary to
 

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:42.400
government of the Russian judiciary to
change their practices inside Russia to

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:42.410
change their practices inside Russia to
 

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:45.400
change their practices inside Russia to
actually do something about solving the

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:45.410
actually do something about solving the
 

00:54:45.410 --> 00:54:47.320
actually do something about solving the
problems themselves so they don't you

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:47.330
problems themselves so they don't you
 

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:49.630
problems themselves so they don't you
know as you know they're overloaded with

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:49.640
know as you know they're overloaded with
 

00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:50.550
know as you know they're overloaded with
case

00:54:50.550 --> 00:54:50.560
case
 

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.980
case
at the European Court of Human Rights so

00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:52.990
at the European Court of Human Rights so
 

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:55.650
at the European Court of Human Rights so
I guess you know having talked to Philip

00:54:55.650 --> 00:54:55.660
I guess you know having talked to Philip
 

00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.360
I guess you know having talked to Philip
leach and Bill borrowing and people who

00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:57.370
leach and Bill borrowing and people who
 

00:54:57.370 --> 00:54:58.920
leach and Bill borrowing and people who
are actually working on that they

00:54:58.920 --> 00:54:58.930
are actually working on that they
 

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:01.410
are actually working on that they
themselves hasn't seen any evidence that

00:55:01.410 --> 00:55:01.420
themselves hasn't seen any evidence that
 

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.330
themselves hasn't seen any evidence that
that is really working on a significant

00:55:03.330 --> 00:55:03.340
that is really working on a significant
 

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.870
that is really working on a significant
level so in a sense I guess my my claim

00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880
level so in a sense I guess my my claim
 

00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.730
level so in a sense I guess my my claim
was that this has sort of been out

00:55:08.730 --> 00:55:08.740
was that this has sort of been out
 

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:11.970
was that this has sort of been out
sourced if you like and the role of the

00:55:11.970 --> 00:55:11.980
sourced if you like and the role of the
 

00:55:11.980 --> 00:55:14.340
sourced if you like and the role of the
court it seems that they don't have the

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:14.350
court it seems that they don't have the
 

00:55:14.350 --> 00:55:16.740
court it seems that they don't have the
capability to put the structure in place

00:55:16.740 --> 00:55:16.750
capability to put the structure in place
 

00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.050
capability to put the structure in place
to actually keep the pressure on the

00:55:19.050 --> 00:55:19.060
to actually keep the pressure on the
 

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.540
to actually keep the pressure on the
Russian government so that was one of my

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:21.550
Russian government so that was one of my
 

00:55:21.550 --> 00:55:26.670
Russian government so that was one of my
one of my concerns and so that that was

00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680
one of my concerns and so that that was
 

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.240
one of my concerns and so that that was
that I will go back now to Kim and and

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:30.250
that I will go back now to Kim and and
 

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:38.310
that I will go back now to Kim and and

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.740
Jason's sorry issues okay I have to make
the claim with regard to Kim that I

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:40.750
the claim with regard to Kim that I
 

00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:42.480
the claim with regard to Kim that I

00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:45.790
Kadir off I mean really my book stops in
 

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:49.680
Kadir off I mean really my book stops in
2005 when misheard off dies so there is

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:49.690
2005 when misheard off dies so there is
 

00:55:49.690 --> 00:55:52.140
2005 when misheard off dies so there is
a period of when you're talking about I

00:55:52.140 --> 00:55:52.150
a period of when you're talking about I
 

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:55.650
a period of when you're talking about I
guess largely from 2004 to 2010 that I

00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:55.660
guess largely from 2004 to 2010 that I
 

00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:57.600
guess largely from 2004 to 2010 that I
don't that's not actually the period

00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:57.610
don't that's not actually the period
 

00:55:57.610 --> 00:56:01.320
don't that's not actually the period
that I deal with but that said I think

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:01.330
that I deal with but that said I think
 

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:04.170
that I deal with but that said I think
your criticism about political economy

00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:04.180
your criticism about political economy
 

00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.980
your criticism about political economy
is a is a correct one and that I

00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:07.990
is a is a correct one and that I
 

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:14.460
is a is a correct one and that I
probably don't give as much traction to

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:14.470
probably don't give as much traction to
 

00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:16.890
probably don't give as much traction to
that argument as I do to arguments about

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:16.900
that argument as I do to arguments about
 

00:56:16.900 --> 00:56:20.010
that argument as I do to arguments about
racism and nationalism and so I think in

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:20.020
racism and nationalism and so I think in
 

00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:22.110
racism and nationalism and so I think in
terms of understanding the conflict I

00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:22.120
terms of understanding the conflict I
 

00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.120
terms of understanding the conflict I
would I would absolutely agree that that

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:24.130
would I would absolutely agree that that
 

00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:25.980
would I would absolutely agree that that
there's a shortage of that if you like

00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:25.990
there's a shortage of that if you like
 

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:32.160
there's a shortage of that if you like
within the book itself I think that you

00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:32.170
within the book itself I think that you
 

00:56:32.170 --> 00:56:37.380
within the book itself I think that you
said that I make the claim that Russian

00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:37.390
said that I make the claim that Russian
 

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:40.230
said that I make the claim that Russian
nationalists or Russian radical Chechen

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240
nationalists or Russian radical Chechen
 

00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.510
nationalists or Russian radical Chechen
separatists were really driven by

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:42.520
separatists were really driven by
 

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:45.210
separatists were really driven by
revenge and I don't actually make that

00:56:45.210 --> 00:56:45.220
revenge and I don't actually make that
 

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:47.160
revenge and I don't actually make that
claim all the way throughout my book I

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:47.170
claim all the way throughout my book I
 

00:56:47.170 --> 00:56:49.500
claim all the way throughout my book I
think that very much the character of

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:49.510
think that very much the character of
 

00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:54.570
think that very much the character of
that resistance changes and it does fit

00:56:54.570 --> 00:56:54.580
that resistance changes and it does fit
 

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.850
that resistance changes and it does fit
very much between shamil Basayev and

00:56:56.850 --> 00:56:56.860
very much between shamil Basayev and
 

00:56:56.860 --> 00:56:58.490
very much between shamil Basayev and

yes there are the other factors at work

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:00.450
yes there are the other factors at work
 

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:03.349
yes there are the other factors at work
but these two have the main power base

00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359
but these two have the main power base

but these two have the main power base
within that society and so therefore I

00:57:05.779 --> 00:57:05.789
within that society and so therefore I
 

00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:09.200
within that society and so therefore I
guess that I concentrated on them I also

00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:09.210
guess that I concentrated on them I also
 

00:57:09.210 --> 00:57:10.670
guess that I concentrated on them I also
concentrated on them because there was a

concentrated on them because there was a
 

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.579
concentrated on them because there was a
lack of material for me about what the

civil war with inside the church to know
it so so I think that that could have

00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:53.730
it so so I think that that could have
 

00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:55.760
it so so I think that that could have
been elaborated on if I had known more I

00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:55.770
been elaborated on if I had known more I
 

00:57:55.770 --> 00:57:59.720
been elaborated on if I had known more I
wish I had and so I think that's a point

00:57:59.720 --> 00:57:59.730
wish I had and so I think that's a point
 

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:04.450
wish I had and so I think that's a point
very very well taken and and and I agree

very very well taken and and and I agree

very very well taken and and and I agree
the issue about the concentration of my

the issue about the concentration of my

the issue about the concentration of my
book being just on racism and

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160
book being just on racism and
 

00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:12.980
book being just on racism and

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:16.190

I think that's slightly unfair because I

00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200
I think that's slightly unfair because I
 

00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.990
I think that's slightly unfair because I
think I point out in the introduction

00:58:17.990 --> 00:58:18.000
think I point out in the introduction
 

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.079
think I point out in the introduction
that this is just one aspect of this

00:58:21.079 --> 00:58:21.089
that this is just one aspect of this
 

00:58:21.089 --> 00:58:23.450
that this is just one aspect of this
particular war that I think has been

00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:23.460
particular war that I think has been
 

00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:25.400
particular war that I think has been
marginalized in our discussions and

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:25.410
marginalized in our discussions and
 

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:28.190
marginalized in our discussions and
perhaps if I talk more about political

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200
perhaps if I talk more about political
 

00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:29.930
perhaps if I talk more about political
economy I could have slightly offset

00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940
economy I could have slightly offset
 

00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:34.069
economy I could have slightly offset
that more right to make that give the

00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079
that more right to make that give the
 

00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:36.349
that more right to make that give the
sense that I'm only introducing one lens

00:58:36.349 --> 00:58:36.359
sense that I'm only introducing one lens
 

00:58:36.359 --> 00:58:37.880
sense that I'm only introducing one lens
through which we could try and

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:37.890
through which we could try and
 

00:58:37.890 --> 00:58:43.210
through which we could try and
understand this campaign so the issue of

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:43.220
understand this campaign so the issue of
 

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:48.109
understand this campaign so the issue of
genocide I don't actually say that it's

00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119
genocide I don't actually say that it's
 

00:58:48.119 --> 00:58:51.410
genocide I don't actually say that it's
genocide first art I actually make the

00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.420
genocide first art I actually make the
 

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:54.019
genocide first art I actually make the
claim that I think by international law

00:58:54.019 --> 00:58:54.029
claim that I think by international law
 

00:58:54.029 --> 00:58:55.730
claim that I think by international law
that we could call this crimes against

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740
that we could call this crimes against
 

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.130
that we could call this crimes against
humanity and the reason why I make that

00:58:58.130 --> 00:58:58.140
humanity and the reason why I make that
 

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:00.170
humanity and the reason why I make that
claim is because with crimes against

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:00.180
claim is because with crimes against
 

00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:02.569
claim is because with crimes against
humanity you can make the claim that if

00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579
humanity you can make the claim that if
 

00:59:02.579 --> 00:59:05.900
humanity you can make the claim that if
there's racial prejudice that drives or

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:05.910
there's racial prejudice that drives or
 

00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:07.549
there's racial prejudice that drives or
motivates people to commit particular

00:59:07.549 --> 00:59:07.559
motivates people to commit particular
 

00:59:07.559 --> 00:59:09.410
motivates people to commit particular
crimes but you don't have to prove

00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420
crimes but you don't have to prove
 

00:59:09.420 --> 00:59:10.210
crimes but you don't have to prove
intent

00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:10.220
intent
 

00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:14.410
intent
right so and also I think that I I made

00:59:14.410 --> 00:59:14.420
right so and also I think that I I made
 

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:16.600
right so and also I think that I I made
the claim very much as Didrik said right

00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:16.610
the claim very much as Didrik said right
 

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:19.810
the claim very much as Didrik said right
that it is up to battalion leaders I

00:59:19.810 --> 00:59:19.820
that it is up to battalion leaders I
 

00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:21.730
that it is up to battalion leaders I
can't prove that there's any state

00:59:21.730 --> 00:59:21.740
can't prove that there's any state
 

00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:24.070
can't prove that there's any state
policy and I mean again if we look at

00:59:24.070 --> 00:59:24.080
policy and I mean again if we look at
 

00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.170
policy and I mean again if we look at
Russians during the Second World War for

00:59:26.170 --> 00:59:26.180
Russians during the Second World War for
 

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:28.630
Russians during the Second World War for
example then it is very much determined

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:28.640
example then it is very much determined
 

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.220
example then it is very much determined
by battalion commanders who are making

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:30.230
by battalion commanders who are making
 

00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:32.410
by battalion commanders who are making
decisions I can't prove I have not

00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:32.420
decisions I can't prove I have not
 

00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:35.050
decisions I can't prove I have not
absolutely no evidence to say that the

00:59:35.050 --> 00:59:35.060
absolutely no evidence to say that the
 

00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:37.660
absolutely no evidence to say that the
Russians are directed from the FSB or

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:37.670
Russians are directed from the FSB or
 

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:39.460
Russians are directed from the FSB or
whatever to commit crimes against

00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:39.470
whatever to commit crimes against
 

00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:43.720
whatever to commit crimes against
civilians so I just want it to be to be

00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:43.730
civilians so I just want it to be to be
 

00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:45.850
civilians so I just want it to be to be
clear about that and and hope that

00:59:45.850 --> 00:59:45.860
clear about that and and hope that
 

00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:48.940
clear about that and and hope that
that's not exactly misunderstood but I

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:48.950
that's not exactly misunderstood but I
 

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:52.570
that's not exactly misunderstood but I
think in a book about Chechnya you have

00:59:52.570 --> 00:59:52.580
think in a book about Chechnya you have
 

00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:54.730
think in a book about Chechnya you have
to address that issue precisely because

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:32.650
no I don't think that I say I think it's
a motivating factor in the causal

01:04:32.650 --> 01:04:32.660
a motivating factor in the causal
 

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.599
a motivating factor in the causal
origins of the war but I don't say that

01:04:34.599 --> 01:04:34.609
origins of the war but I don't say that
 

01:04:34.609 --> 01:04:37.870
origins of the war but I don't say that
it's the sole and only motive but that's

01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880
it's the sole and only motive but that's
 

01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:39.819
it's the sole and only motive but that's
how you're presenting it though right

01:04:39.819 --> 01:04:39.829
how you're presenting it though right
 

01:04:39.829 --> 01:04:43.150
how you're presenting it though right
but then if Jason makes the claim right

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160
but then if Jason makes the claim right
 

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.580
but then if Jason makes the claim right
that

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:44.590
that
 

01:04:44.590 --> 01:04:48.650
that
just because it's not widespread

01:04:48.650 --> 01:04:48.660
just because it's not widespread
 

01:04:48.660 --> 01:06:01.700
just because it's not widespread
complete brutalization of there's no I

01:06:01.700 --> 01:06:01.710
 
 

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:04.260
 
just want to say in here you've backed

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:04.270
just want to say in here you've backed
 

01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:06.060
just want to say in here you've backed
off and we have sort of ignored the

01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:06.070
off and we have sort of ignored the
 

01:06:06.070 --> 01:06:07.560
off and we have sort of ignored the
great discussion that you have of the

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:07.570
great discussion that you have of the
 

01:06:07.570 --> 01:06:09.810
great discussion that you have of the
aerial bombing campaigns and I think

01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:09.820
aerial bombing campaigns and I think
 

01:06:09.820 --> 01:06:11.850
aerial bombing campaigns and I think
that really helps your evidence perhaps

01:06:11.850 --> 01:06:11.860
that really helps your evidence perhaps
 

01:06:11.860 --> 01:06:13.470
that really helps your evidence perhaps
even more than the question of what

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.480
even more than the question of what
 

01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.780
even more than the question of what
members of the FSB battalions do I guess

01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:15.790
members of the FSB battalions do I guess
 

01:06:15.790 --> 01:06:17.970
members of the FSB battalions do I guess
I take those for granted actually I mean

01:06:17.970 --> 01:06:17.980
I take those for granted actually I mean
 

01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:20.400
I take those for granted actually I mean
I think that I take I mean perhaps I've

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:20.410
I think that I take I mean perhaps I've
 

01:06:20.410 --> 01:06:22.980
I think that I take I mean perhaps I've
I take the the disproportionality

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:22.990
I take the the disproportionality
 

01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:25.050
I take the the disproportionality
argument for granted and I shouldn't

01:06:25.050 --> 01:06:25.060
argument for granted and I shouldn't
 

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:28.650
argument for granted and I shouldn't
draw that more to the table and I think

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:28.660
draw that more to the table and I think
 

01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:30.480
draw that more to the table and I think
that there are two cases of that you

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:30.490
that there are two cases of that you
 

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:31.740
that there are two cases of that you
know both the aerial bombing in the

01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:31.750
know both the aerial bombing in the
 

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:34.770
know both the aerial bombing in the
first and the second war and also the

01:06:34.770 --> 01:06:34.780
first and the second war and also the
 

01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.570
first and the second war and also the
fact that and Diedrich would know it as

01:06:36.570 --> 01:06:36.580
fact that and Diedrich would know it as
 

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.000
fact that and Diedrich would know it as
well absolutely no state of emergency

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:39.010
well absolutely no state of emergency
 

01:06:39.010 --> 01:06:42.030
well absolutely no state of emergency
called absolutely no evacuation routes

01:06:42.030 --> 01:06:42.040
called absolutely no evacuation routes
 

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.770
called absolutely no evacuation routes
set up for people to actually get out of

01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:43.780
set up for people to actually get out of
 

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.290
set up for people to actually get out of
the country so I think I actually posed

01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:46.300
the country so I think I actually posed
 

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:48.330
the country so I think I actually posed
the question in the book is this a case

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:48.340
the question in the book is this a case
 

01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:52.490
the question in the book is this a case
of negligence right or is this you

01:06:52.490 --> 01:06:52.500
of negligence right or is this you
 

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:58.160
of negligence right or is this you
a racial and I can't I'm not saying I

01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:58.170
a racial and I can't I'm not saying I
 

01:06:58.170 --> 01:06:59.810
a racial and I can't I'm not saying I
can't answer that question though

01:06:59.810 --> 01:06:59.820
can't answer that question though
 

01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.270
can't answer that question though
but it's a bit - you can either so I

01:07:02.270 --> 01:07:02.280
but it's a bit - you can either so I
 

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.970
but it's a bit - you can either so I
can't say that I have heard at least

01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980
can't say that I have heard at least
 

01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:07.340
can't say that I have heard at least
that a number of very large number of

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:07.350
that a number of very large number of
 

01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:08.630
that a number of very large number of
the people that were killed in the

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:08.640
the people that were killed in the
 

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.250
the people that were killed in the
aerial bombing campaigns for elderly

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:10.260
aerial bombing campaigns for elderly
 

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:12.710
aerial bombing campaigns for elderly
Russians know that's the first well but

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720
Russians know that's the first well but
 

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.120
Russians know that's the first well but
the fact that the same technique was

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:14.130
the fact that the same technique was
 

01:07:14.130 --> 01:07:15.770
the fact that the same technique was
used in both wars indicates that the

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:15.780
used in both wars indicates that the
 

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.390
used in both wars indicates that the
second war can't be racist if the first

01:07:17.390 --> 01:07:17.400
second war can't be racist if the first
 

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.910
second war can't be racist if the first
war wasn't racist ladies I would say I

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920
war wasn't racist ladies I would say I
 

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:21.920
war wasn't racist ladies I would say I
guess I didn't say that the first wasn't

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:21.930
guess I didn't say that the first wasn't
 

01:07:21.930 --> 01:07:24.740
guess I didn't say that the first wasn't
racist I mean I never said that either

01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:24.750
racist I mean I never said that either
 

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:28.010
racist I mean I never said that either
so and I think that racism did partly

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:28.020
so and I think that racism did partly
 

01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:31.010
so and I think that racism did partly
Drive the first war but I think that it

01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020
Drive the first war but I think that it
 

01:07:31.020 --> 01:07:33.500
Drive the first war but I think that it
wasn't as much as the second more and I

01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:33.510
wasn't as much as the second more and I
 

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:35.720
wasn't as much as the second more and I
think the precise reasons for that are

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:35.730
think the precise reasons for that are
 

01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:37.460
think the precise reasons for that are
the actions of the Chechen separatists

01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:37.470
the actions of the Chechen separatists
 

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:40.040
the actions of the Chechen separatists
themselves right the fact that they led

01:07:40.040 --> 01:07:40.050
themselves right the fact that they led
 

01:07:40.050 --> 01:07:42.650
themselves right the fact that they led
the incursion into Dagestan they there's

01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:42.660
the incursion into Dagestan they there's
 

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:44.120
the incursion into Dagestan they there's
no evidence to suggest that they're

01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:44.130
no evidence to suggest that they're
 

01:07:44.130 --> 01:07:45.560
no evidence to suggest that they're
responsible for the apartment bombings

01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:45.570
responsible for the apartment bombings
 

01:07:45.570 --> 01:07:48.530
responsible for the apartment bombings
but the collective wisdom is right that

01:07:48.530 --> 01:07:48.540
but the collective wisdom is right that
 

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.240
but the collective wisdom is right that
at least they play they may have played

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:50.250
at least they play they may have played
 

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:53.600
at least they play they may have played
some role right so also I think that the

01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:53.610
some role right so also I think that the
 

01:07:53.610 --> 01:07:57.560
some role right so also I think that the
the Russian military was extremely upset

01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:57.570
the Russian military was extremely upset
 

01:07:57.570 --> 01:07:59.690
the Russian military was extremely upset
that its so-called lost the first war

01:07:59.690 --> 01:07:59.700
that its so-called lost the first war
 

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.570
that its so-called lost the first war
and so wanted to go back and achieve

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:02.580
and so wanted to go back and achieve
 

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.730
and so wanted to go back and achieve
what had set out to achieve in the

01:08:04.730 --> 01:08:04.740
what had set out to achieve in the
 

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:11.140
what had set out to achieve in the
didn't achieve in in the first war so

01:08:11.140 --> 01:08:11.150
didn't achieve in in the first war so
 

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:22.039
didn't achieve in in the first war so
not gone one thing I think we can do and

01:08:22.039 --> 01:08:22.049
not gone one thing I think we can do and
 

01:08:22.049 --> 01:08:24.400
not gone one thing I think we can do and

Jack's second question about the
 

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:49.690
Jack's second question about the
strategic and tactical lessons I think

01:11:49.690 --> 01:11:49.700
strategic and tactical lessons I think
 

01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:52.270
strategic and tactical lessons I think
in the case of the first war that the

01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:52.280
in the case of the first war that the
 

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.280
in the case of the first war that the
evidence suggests that they sent in you

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:54.290
evidence suggests that they sent in you
 

01:11:54.290 --> 01:11:56.110

use the the common soldier right in the

respect they did learn a big lesson and

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:41.270
respect they did learn a big lesson and

respect they did learn a big lesson and
that they they knew that they had to

that they they knew that they had to
work in smaller tactical very very

01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:45.650
work in smaller tactical very very
 

01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:47.950
work in smaller tactical very very
strong units the other thing that was

01:12:47.950 --> 01:12:47.960
strong units the other thing that was
 

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:52.060
strong units the other thing that was
different was that they stopped they

01:12:52.060 --> 01:12:52.070
different was that they stopped they
 

01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:54.040

they bombed their area for about three

01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:54.050
they bombed their area for about three
 

01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:55.720
they bombed their area for about three
months which they did similarly in the

01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:55.730
months which they did similarly in the
 

01:12:55.730 --> 01:12:58.060
months which they did similarly in the
first war but essentially what they did

01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:58.070
first war but essentially what they did
 

01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:59.920
first war but essentially what they did
was that they prohibited ground troops

01:12:59.920 --> 01:12:59.930
was that they prohibited ground troops
 

01:12:59.930 --> 01:13:02.830
was that they prohibited ground troops
from going in too quickly so the

01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840
from going in too quickly so the
 

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.720
from going in too quickly so the
consensus is that the bombing during the

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:04.730
consensus is that the bombing during the
 

01:13:04.730 --> 01:13:06.730
consensus is that the bombing during the
second war was far more widespread and

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:06.740
second war was far more widespread and
 

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:09.490
second war was far more widespread and
far more damaging that it had been in

01:13:09.490 --> 01:13:09.500
far more damaging that it had been in
 

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:14.410
far more damaging that it had been in
the first war so their their operational

01:13:14.410 --> 01:13:14.420
the first war so their their operational
 

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.210
the first war so their their operational
tactic was to save their own men and

01:13:16.210 --> 01:13:16.220
tactic was to save their own men and
 

01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:19.480
tactic was to save their own men and
then to use these stronger units and the

01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:19.490
then to use these stronger units and the
 

01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:21.100
then to use these stronger units and the
question of whether they've won or not

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:21.110
