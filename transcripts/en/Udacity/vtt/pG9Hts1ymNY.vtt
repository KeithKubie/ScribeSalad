00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.650
Web app install banners give
you the ability to quickly and

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.170
seamlessly add your web
app to their home screen,

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.250
making it easy to launch and
return to your app.

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.540
The best part, Chrome handles most
of the heavy lifting for you.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.945
Prompting the user to add your web app
to their home screen is a powerful

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:18.025
feature.

00:00:18.025 --> 00:00:21.545
Before showing the Add to
Home Screen banner, Chrome looks for

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:25.165
several heuristics to ensure
a great user experience.

00:00:25.165 --> 00:00:28.820
It needs to use service workers
to provide an offline experience.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.796
Apps that are added to the home screen
should be fast and always available.

00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:34.601
No Offlinosaurus.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:39.440
It needs to have a web manifest
file to define what to launch and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.570
how to launch it.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.870
And it needs to have an engaged user.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.690
Currently, that means two navigations
within at least five minutes, but

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.240
that will change in the future.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.650
When these heuristics are met,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.590
Chrome will show the Add to Home Screen
banner across the bottom of the page.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.530
We've set the bar high because
it's important when users see

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.920
the Add to Home Screen banner, they
know that the app that they're going to

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.520
be adding will be reliable,
fast and engaging.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.330
It some cases,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.340
you might want to defer or even cancel
the banner until more convenient time.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.510
For example, an e-commerce
company might want to defer it

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.390
until the user is in a check out flow
and they've completed the transaction.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.200
Check the link in the instructor notes
for more details on how you can add

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.870
analytics to the prompt and understand
how users are responding to the banner.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.784
For testing, you can disable
the engagement checks by enabling

00:01:30.784 --> 00:01:36.379
the #bypass-app-banner-engagement-checks
in Chrome and restarting the browser.

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:36.949
