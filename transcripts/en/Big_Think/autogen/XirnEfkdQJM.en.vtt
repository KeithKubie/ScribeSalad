00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:13.389
Americans have always been magical thinkers
and passionate believers in the untrue.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:22.539
We were started by the Puritans in New England
who wanted to create and did create a Christian

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:28.750
utopia and theocracy as they waited for the
eminent second coming of Christ and the end

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.230
of days.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.250
And in the south by a bunch of people who
were convinced, absolutely convinced that

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.469
this place they’d never been was full of
gold just to be plucked from the dirt in Virginia

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:49.179
and they stayed there looking and hoping for
gold for 20 years before they finally faced

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.190
the facts and the evidence and decided that
they weren’t going to get rich overnight

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.190
there.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.190
So that was the beginning.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.280
And then we’ve had centuries of buyer-beware
charlatanism to an extreme degree and medical

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:13.340
quackery to an extreme degree and increasingly
exotic extravagant implausible religions over

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.360
and over again from Mormonism to Christian
Science to Scientology in the last century.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.861
And we’ve had this antiestablishment "I’m
not going to trust the experts, I’m not

00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:29.870
going to trust the elite" from our character
from the beginning.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:36.980
Now all those things came together and were
super-charged in the 1960s when you were entitled

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.840
to your own truth and your own reality.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.980
Then a generation later when the Internet
came along, giving each of those realities,

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:55.920
no matter how false or magical or nutty they
are, their own kind of media infrastructure.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.240
We had entertainment, again for the last couple
hundred years, but especially in the last

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.380
50 years permeating all the rest of life,
including Presidential politics from John

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.480
F. Kennedy through Ronald Ragan to Bill Clinton.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:19.819
So the thing was set up for Donald Trump to
exploit all these various American threads

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:27.370
and astonishingly become president, but then
you look at this history and it’s like no

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.430
we should have seen this coming.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.780
The idea of America from the beginning was
that you could come here, reinvent yourself,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:42.639
be anybody you want, live any way you wanted,
believe any thing you wanted.

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:47.310
For the first few hundred years, like everywhere
else in the world, celebrity and fame were

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.060
a result of some kind of accomplishment or
achievement, sometimes not a great accomplishment

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.529
or achievement, but you did something in the
world to earn renown.

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:06.379
America really was the key place that invented
the modern celebrity culture, which was, beginning

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:14.040
a century ago, more and more not necessarily
about having won a war or led a people or

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.469
written a great book or painted a great painting,
but about being famous, fame for its own sake.

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:27.510
We created that, we created Hollywood, we
created the whole culture industry and that

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.309
then became what I call the fantasy industrial
complex where, certainly in the last few decades

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:40.549
more than ever more than anybody thought possible
before, fame itself, however you’ve got

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.030
it, was a primary goal for people.

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.969
And again, as so many of the things I talk
about in Fantasyland, not uniquely to America

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.609
but more here than anywhere.

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:59.659
And then you get reality television, which
was this unholy hybrid of the fictional and

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:06.290
the real for the last now generation where
that blur between what’s real and what’s

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.840
not is pumped into our media stream willy-nilly.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.430
There are now more reality shows on television
than there were shows on television 20 years

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.799
ago.

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.360
And that’s another way for nobodies to become
famous overnight.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.730
YouTube, another way for nobodies to become
a famous overnight for doing almost nothing

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.500
or nothing.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:39.920
So... again back to Donald Trump, he had the
advantage, unlike any normal politician, any

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.690
person or normal businessperson for that matter
who might presume to run for president he

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.230
was a celebrity, he was a show business celebrity.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:55.650
He was a member of the WWE Hall of Fame after
all and then also had this primetime show

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.030
The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice
of which he was the star playing himself for

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.200
15 years.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:08.140
So he was pre-marketed in a way that in the
past would have been disqualifying for a president.

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.080
Yes we elected a former actor Governor of
California and President of the United States,

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.310
but not all at once and only 20 years essentially
in Ronald Ragan’s case after he gave up

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.140
his Hollywood career.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.860
This is a different thing, this is I will
go directly from this playing myself on a

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:35.740
reality television program to being president
and it worked proving the sheer power of any

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.790
kind of celebrity.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:44.570
And again, yeah he was celebrated for having
made a lot of money, but he made a lot of

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:54.630
money in all kinds of dubious ways rather
than normal forms of business achievement,

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.630
but he’s famous.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.650
He’s a star.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.770
He was a star and that’s why he won the
nomination and that’s why he became president.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.200
Like all humans, Americans suffer from what’s
called confirmation bias, which is I believe

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:15.450
this; I will look for facts for pseudo-facts
or fictions that confirm my pre-existing beliefs.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:22.320
Americans, long before psychologists invented
that phrase confirmation bias, had that tenancy,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.490
again, at the very beginning.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.010
"I’ve never been to the New World.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.620
Nobody I know has been to the New World.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.841
I never really read any first and accounts
of the New World, but I’m going to give

00:06:31.841 --> 00:06:36.240
up my life and go there because it’s going
to be awesome and perfect and I’m going

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:41.340
to get rich overnight and/or create a Christian
Utopia."

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.910
So we began that way and that has kept up
"I just want to believe what I want to believe

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:56.200
and don’t let your lying eyes tell you anything
different."

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:03.940
And again, that was always there in the American
DNA but kept in check by the needs of survival,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.980
by reality checks of various kinds.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:15.720
In this softer age where most people aren’t
going to probably die tomorrow as a result

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:23.220
of believing fantasies and untruths we became
freer to believe them.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:28.210
So believing whatever nutty thing you want
to believe or pretending you are whatever

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:34.760
you are or having even kooky conspiracy theories
or speaking in tongues, whatever it is fine

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.470
if it’s private.

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:41.840
The problem is when that, as it has in the
last couple of decades especially, leeched

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.130
into the public sphere and the policies sphere
and like "there’s no global warming.

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:48.750
We don’t have to worry about the seas rising."

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:54.951
Or "nah scientists say that vaccines are safe
but I think they cause autism so I’m not

00:07:54.951 --> 00:08:00.300
going to vaccinate my children" and so on
and so on that’s when the rubber hits the

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:06.360
road, will hit the road, and people will start
saying wait a minute.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.770
Not until then, not until there’s a consequence
and not until there is a price to pay and

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:17.840
not until the Donald Trump-ian fantasies,
for instance, the more short-term ones of

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:23.420
oh I’m going to make every dream come true
that you’ve ever had for your country, actually

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.610
one of his promises during the campaign.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:31.110
Or I’m going to create a healthcare system
that is better and cheaper and will cover

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:32.149
everyone.

00:08:32.149 --> 00:08:40.760
Well, that’s probably not going to happen
and so once these fantasies are taken into

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:46.420
the public sphere and the political sphere
and really in the short-term turn out to be

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:53.500
fantasies and falsehoods that will persuade
some people, but not everybody.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:59.440
According to a recent survey 98 percent of
the voters who voted for Donald Trump in the

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:07.450
primaries, which is to say his real base,
98 percent of them in late 2017 still absolutely

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:08.580
supported him.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.180
So I don’t think that’s going to fall
a lot.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.520
Those are true believers.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:22.900
Back in the 1800s - back in before the 20th
century, especially in the 1800s, American

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:29.760
journalism was a very, very factionalized
partisan thing.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.660
Political parties had their own newspapers
and their own magazines and everyone gave

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.390
its version of political spin and interpretation.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:44.800
20th century, for a variety of reasons not
just because we got smarter or more rational,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:53.500
maybe somewhat that, there began being more
of a shared set of facts in our media.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:10:01.870
People disagree violently left, right, center,
whatever, but the facts were agreed upon.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:08.320
What has been enabled in the last 30 years,
first through deregulated talk radio where

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:16.400
you didn't have to be fair and balanced anymore
then national cable television, FOX News comes

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:24.360
to mind, and then, of course, the Internet
as well where these more and more not just

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:31.310
politically different points of view but these
alternate factual realities could be portrayed

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.430
and depicted.

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:41.820
We’ve been in that state now for 20 years
or more so, again, we were softened up as

00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.830
a people to believe what we want to believe
but then we have this new infrastructure that

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:49.330
I think is new that I think is a new condition.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:56.340
So there’s a history of oh I believe this
or I believe this or slavery is good, no slavery

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.450
is bad, those are disagreements.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:06.800
But in 1860 Southerners didn’t say "oh no
there are no slaves.

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.960
No there’s no slavery."

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:09.690
That’s the condition we have now.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:15.839
That is the Kellyanne Conway/Donald Trump
situation and Republican Party situation before

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:26.641
Donald Trump ever came along where we say
no there’s no climate change or oh this

00:11:26.641 --> 00:11:28.920
factual truth is not true.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:38.550
That’s the new thing and this new media
infrastructure is a new condition.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:44.840
Now, it may not be the end of things as a
result, but we don’t know yet.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:51.340
We’re only 20 years into it and maybe we’ll
learn new protocols of what to believe and

00:11:51.340 --> 00:12:02.360
what not, we’ll grow up and be able to accommodate
ourselves to this new media situation, but

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:08.339
I’m worried that we won’t and I’m worried
that a significant fraction of us, for now

00:12:08.339 --> 00:12:14.150
mostly on the right but there’s no reason
it should be limited to the right, will be

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:22.899
in their bubble and their silo and with their
own reality and not be able to be retrieved

00:12:22.899 --> 00:12:24.810
into the reality-based world.
