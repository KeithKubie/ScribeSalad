Our last handler is NewPost handler. This actually should look fairly familiar to you.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This kind of has the general kind of form submission error handling process

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
we've been using before.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If you just do a get on that page /newpost, we return the newpost.html.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If you post to it, we try to verify the forms.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The first thing to do is we get the two parameters out of the request--subject and content.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Those are the name of the form fields.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If we don't have a subject and content, we will do this clause first.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We create an error message "subject and content please,"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and we render the form again with the user's entered subject, content, and error.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Newpost.html expects these parameters.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If they did enter a good subject and content we create a new post.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I set my parent. Again, you don't have to set a parent.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It might make future organization easier. I was learning data store myself.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I set the subject equal to subject that the user entered

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and I set the content to be the content that the user entered.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Remember the two date parameters created and last modified would be set automatically.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We call p.put to store this element in the database.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Then I redirect the user to /blog/ the ID of the element,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and this is how you get an object's ID and datastore.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Let's see this in action in the browser one more time now that we know what all the pieces are.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Here we are in the new post again. Let's submit this form without a subject and body.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You can see that we have the error message "subject and content please."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We'll enter a subject and a little body, and when we click submit,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
we get redirected to /blog/4, which is the ID of this post.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
You can see our subject and our body, and if we go back to our blog's front page,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
you can see all of our entries. That's the homework.
