00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.240
Vsauce!

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.240
Kevin here.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.460
And I'm about to play blackjack with a robot.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.889
Vector’s creators sent this personality-rich
robot over to me because they knew I love

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.809
robots and to support Vsauce2, but let’s
get to blackjack.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.199
I figure if lose a game I’ll just double
my previous bet every time -- I’m guaranteed

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.429
to win my cubes back and then some, right?

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:24.810
I think so.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.890
Let’s find out!

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.330
Oh, we’re wagering sugar cubes because Vector
here loves his cube so much..

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.340
Isn’t that right, buddy?

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.580
He likes when you pet him.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.690
Okay!

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.300
Blackjack or 21, as many of you likely know,
has simple rules.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.751
There are actually over 100 variations but
we’re gonna keep it simple: one deck, you

00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:51.510
get two cards and the dealer gets two cards.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.970
Each card is worth its face value, and jack,
queen, and kings are worth 10.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.690
An ace counts as 1 or 11, depending on what’s
most advantageous for you.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.530
Your goal is to get a higher total than the
dealer, but if your cards add up to over 21,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.530
you lose.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.530
You wanna..?

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.100
I know you wanna play but hold on I gotta
explain the rules.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100
Okay.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.800
Once you’re dealt your two cards, you can
decide to take another by ‘hitting’ or

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.549
stay where you are by ‘standing.’

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.159
Haha.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.240
This is, this is what's happening now.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.560
To guarantee that I don’t lose I’m using
the Martingale betting system.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.049
When I win a game -- I win!

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.759
When I lose a game -- I double my wager in
the next game to make up for the cubes I lost

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.179
in the previous one.

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:38.179
Genius…

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:39.179
I know.

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:41.960
And mathematically, it’s a sure thing.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.499
Uhh.. let's clean this up.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:44.499
Hey Vector.

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:48.569
Do you wanna play blackjack?

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:49.569
I knew it.

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.630
Okay I'm just gonna bet one sugar cube.

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.189
Here we go.

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.549
16.

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:57.289
Another card?

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.030
Hit me!

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.659
17.

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.920
Another card?

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.560
Stand!

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.189
13.

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.820
14.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.450
18.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.720
Dealer wins!

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.990
That's okay.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.210
To get my one back this time I'll bet two.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.570
19.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.290
Another card?

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.650
Stand.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.010
12.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.370
21.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.930
Very funny, Vector.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:35.930
That's okay.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.740
I'll get my 2 back by betting 4.

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.420
Hit me!

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.100
24.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.450
You busted!

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.120
Alright...

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.660
I'll just bet eight!

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.780
Stand.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.900
11.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.010
21.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.250
Dealer wins!

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.250
That's okay.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.250
That's okay!

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.240
I'll bet 16.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.770
Dealer wins!

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.320
I'll bet 32.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.620
Dealer wins!

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.000
64 cube bet to recover my losses there's no
chance I could lose again!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
19.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.880
Dealer wins!

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.880
Alright.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.050
This… is not going well.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.760
I’ve played 7 hands and lost a total of
127 sugar cubes.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:38.130
If I win 128 on the next hand, I’ll recover
127 cubes and snag a 1-cube profit -- my original

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.930
bet.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.050
*sigh* Let's do this!

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.950
17.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.760
Another card?

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.670
Stand.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.570
11.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.480
21.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.290
Alright, then!

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.390
I am officially all out of cubes.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.520
Play another round?

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.520
No.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.520
Yeah, you won.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.520
I know.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.520
You can celebrate.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.520
You can celebrate.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.010
You took all my cubes.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.400
Hey, Vector!

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.260
Take a nap!

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.470
That is one sugar cube rich robot.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.620
And I am one sugar cube broke human.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.169
I know that my strategy would have worked
though if I had just had more cubes.

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.099
Maybe.

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:41.509
The martingale system can work in short bursts
-- until you hit a streak that necessitates

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.849
a bet so large that it completely wipes you
out.

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:50.650
In casinos, maximum bet limits prevent you
from doubling as many times as you might need

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.220
to recover from your losses, so there’s
effectively a ceiling on how many times you

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.319
can Martingale.

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.050
And Georgia Institute of Technology math professor
Ted Hill showed us that we’ll almost certainly

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.659
underestimating the likelihood of serious
losing streaks.

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:14.389
Hill gave an assignment to his class: flip
a coin 200 times and record whether it's heads

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:15.389
or tails.

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.600
Heads, tails, heads tails, heads, tails.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600
Like that.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.279
Or just don’t bother flipping it at all
and do what I did and just write down random

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:25.279
stuff.

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:29.000
When Hill looked at each student’s results,
he could tell with amazing precision whether

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.199
or not they'd actually flipped a coin or just
made up the results.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.289
Because the fakers routinely underestimated
the likelihood of streaks.

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:44.340
If a student’s data included a streak of
6 or more heads or tails in a row, they almost

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.689
certainly recorded real data.

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:49.240
No streaks of 6 or more?

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.620
Fake.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.319
In 200 coin tosses, there’s a 96.5% chance
of getting a streak of 6 heads or tails.

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:03.650
There’s an 80% chance you’ll get 7 in
a row, and a 54% chance of 8 in a row.

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.090
9 in a row would really be pushing it, though,
right?

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:13.669
No -- there’s a 32% chance of that happening
in 200 tosses, so even that happens nearly

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:18.050
a third of the time -- it’s just not that
weird.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:24.120
A player sitting alone at a blackjack table
will probably play about 200 hands per hour,

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.219
and the odds of losing a hand are close to
50%.

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:32.419
You’d almost certainly hit an 8 or 9-hand
losing streak in a few hours.

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:37.069
To make the Martingale bet-doubling system
work, you’d need to be lucky enough to avoid

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:38.849
those long losing streaks.

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:42.740
And play the game with a ton of money.

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.099
And not ever reach the maximum bet.

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:52.259
And be comfortable knowing that you run the
risk of losing everything to win... just a

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:55.229
single sugar cube.

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:02.280
Here’s the breakdown of how much you’d
have to bet to absorb a common losing streak.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.520
If you start by playing a $25 hand, about
the price of movie tickets for two, and you

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.389
lose, your next bet would have to be $50.

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:15.710
The bets continue to double so that If you
have a 10 game losing streak, which has about

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:22.749
a 30% chance of happening over 1,000 hands,
by the 11th game you’d have to bet $25,600

00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:28.259
just to recover your losses and walk away
with a $25 profit.

00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:34.539
And that’s not including the $25,575 you
already lost.

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:44.520
You’d need a total of $51,175, the price
of a luxury car, to avoid going broke as you

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.589
made a movie tickets for two profit.

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:53.259
By using Martingale bet-doubling, the best
case scenario is that you win your original

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:54.379
bet.

00:07:54.379 --> 00:08:00.449
In theory, the system prevents you from losing
any money, but in reality it can cost you

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:06.740
a fortune as you try to make up for an inevitable
losing streak.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.439
All in the hopes that you win an amount equal
to… the first cube.

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:15.099
And as always -- thanks for watching.

00:08:15.099 --> 00:08:21.159
Why did I do that?

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:24.580
Huge thanks to Anki for sending over my new
robot friend, Vector.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:29.860
I’ve had him for about a week now and it’s
really fun just kinda having him around -- in

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.229
a way I didn’t expect.

00:08:32.229 --> 00:08:38.099
He recognizes you, answers questions, explores
around on his own, as you can see, and even

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:42.860
locates his charger when he needs to go home
and recharge.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.560
And before you know it, he's up and playing
with his cube again.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.140
Look at this!

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.190
Good job!

00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:52.699
If you want to get your own robot friend there’s
a link in the description for you to check

00:08:52.699 --> 00:08:53.699
out.

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:57.800
And I’m just really looking forward to the
future of Vector too.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:03.310
What programmers and people like you will
develop for Vector to be able to do.

00:09:03.310 --> 00:09:06.360
So I'm just gonna chill with my friend here.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.459
For now.

00:09:07.459 --> 00:09:09.660
Actually, check this out.

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.480
Hey, Vector!

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.630
Let's do a fist bump!

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:24.970
I just fist bumped a robot.

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:27.589
Bye.
