[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:08.050
JULIA TURSHEN: This is
super fun because, yes, I've

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.160
known Karen for 25 years.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.640
We met in the third grade.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.690
We did some math.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.030
And so when "Small
Victories," which

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.530
was my first cookbook as
a solo author came out,

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.670
I was right here.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.297
And it was pretty much
exactly two years ago.

00:00:24.297 --> 00:00:26.380
And I feel like I recognize
some of you from that.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.540
We made turkey meatballs,
and it was so fun.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.090
And that was such
a joy, because that

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.490
was the first event I had
ever done for my own cookbook.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.970
And now I'm in this very
unusual, very privileged

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.610
position of this is my
third book in three years.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.420
So that was-- I feel
very full circle.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.374
And thank you for coming.

00:00:44.374 --> 00:00:45.040
I appreciate it.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.700
So now and again--

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.270
we have lots of displays--

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.870
it's all about
menus and leftovers.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.700
And it started
off as a book just

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.670
about reinventing leftovers,
because I love leftovers.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.890
I think the world
is either people who

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.340
love them or hate them, and I
am very much on team leftovers.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.924
And I was going to do a book
just of reinventing leftovers,

00:01:06.924 --> 00:01:09.340
mostly because I fell in love
with a title I came up with,

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.900
which was "It's Me Again."

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.440
And I thought that
was so clever.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.240
But then I had an issue
because I was like,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.657
do I give you the recipe for
the thing in the first place?

00:01:20.657 --> 00:01:21.740
How is that going to work?

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.860
So it became a much
bigger and, I think,

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.570
much more useful
and meaningful book.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.850
So it's all my favorite
menus in one place, all

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.040
the very, very simple
recipes to make those menus.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.669
So you can make a whole meal.

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:34.210
And all the menus
are super personal,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.420
and there's old family
stories and stuff like that.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.940
And then following each
menu are all these ideas

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.630
for ways to use your
leftovers in creative ways.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.460
And the whole notion of
that is to really empower

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.620
home cooks to love
leftovers as much

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.170
as I do, to open your
fridge, and if you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.090
see a container, to
not feel like, oh,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.604
that same thing again.

00:01:56.604 --> 00:01:58.270
You can really do
something new with it,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.520
make a whole new
meal that is almost

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.920
unrecognizable from the first.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.050
So yeah, that's the book.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.470
I'm super excited about it.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.310
And yeah, as Karen mentioned,
it came out this week

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.180
on Beyonce's birthday, which I
feel like is a very good omen.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.980
So I'm super excited
to share it with you.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.860
And I'm going to
show you guys two

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.020
of the incredibly simple
recipes, the original and then

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.890
the leftover.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.780
And because it's
Friday and TGIF,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.310
we're going to start
with a boozy recipe.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.010
And so the first one--

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.600
it's a dessert
recipe for something

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.990
I called a boozy lemon slushie.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.140
For anyone who doesn't cook,
this is the perfect recipe.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.080
It's a very, very
festive dessert.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.890
Everyone loves it.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.510
I think it takes
everyone by surprise.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.830
It's a little unexpected.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:51.940
But you really don't--

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.050
you just need to know how to
open a bottle or a container,

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.300
and that's it.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.470
So it starts with lemon sorbet,
which I say you should buy.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.260
They made it because
they're amazing.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.580
You do not need to make it.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.290
If you like making lemon
sorbet, by all means.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.900
But I feel like my secret is
I'm actually a really lazy cook,

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.640
and I don't like to
do a lot of dishes.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.580
So if you can get a really
great outcome for as little work

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.220
and as few dishes as possible,
that is fine with me.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.990
So this is the lemon
sorbet they made.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.670
It's beautiful.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.420
It's super tart and delicious.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.510
And then you
basically-- this could

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.590
be a champagne glass or wine
glass or anything like that.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.930
And you just put a little
scoop, and then you top it off.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.200
So Marianne has already
put a little bit of vodka

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.030
and a little bit
of sparkling wine.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.030
And then you can serve
it with-- just as is.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.780
You can serve it with
a spoon and a straw,

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.150
kind of like a milkshake.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.010
It's beautiful, it's
effervescent, and it's tart.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.350
And it's a little sweet,
and it's not too sweet

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.100
because you have
vodka in all that.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.630
And it's such a festive,
fun way to end a meal.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.350
So I'm just going
to scoop these out.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.440
And then if you guys
want to make your Friday

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.360
lunch a little more mellow--

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.440
yeah, thank you so much.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.770
Thank you.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.570
I think the biggest
secret in the kitchen

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.077
is bringing her with you.

00:04:16.077 --> 00:04:20.769
And she can prepare everything
ahead, and it makes it so easy.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.950
So then the fun--

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.119
so I don't know if you'll have
leftovers from this, per se.

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:27.660
But if you have a
little bit of vodka

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.493
in the bottle left, a
little sparkling wine,

00:04:29.493 --> 00:04:30.520
a little lemon sorbet--

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.390
if you didn't quite scrape
the bottom of the container,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.930
the super fun thing
to do is if you have--

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.080
I'm going to move over here.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.850
This is just
store-bought poundcake.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.580
Again, you don't have
to make anything.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.530
You obviously can
make it if you'd like.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:47.540
But if you slice it, and
then if you put-- well,

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.890
we're just going to
do little pieces.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.300
And then this is a little bit--

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.230
that mixture I just made, the
lemon sorbet, vodka prosecco--

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.400
now it's kind of melted.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.620
It's not as cold and refreshing,
but it's still perfectly good.

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.446
So then you just pour
it over your slice,

00:05:05.446 --> 00:05:07.070
and you just let that
sit a little bit.

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.730
And I feel like I should
have done the other cup.

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.280
You just let that soak in, and
it makes this delicious, lemony

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.890
poundcake.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.780
And you can serve
that with vanilla ice

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.560
cream or whipped cream, creme
fraiche, something like that.

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.930
Again, a really, really
lovely dessert, and you're

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.770
not wasting that little
bit that might be left.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.750
And interestingly,
"Now and Again"

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.680
is totally a book about food
waste without ever overtly

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.460
saying so.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.180
But it's really about using
up everything and seeing

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.420
the potential in the bottom of
the jar, the leftover, whatever

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.350
you might have.

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.510
And it's seeing the
potential in all this stuff,

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.460
knowing that you
can make something

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.700
totally new and great, and
yeah, not wasting stuff.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.660
And I know you guys do
amazing work with that

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.860
here, which is incredible.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.650
Because especially on a
large scale at Google,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.290
you really can make
a big difference.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:05.990
You think about how much
food we all throw out.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.990
And if you times that
by however many people

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.050
work here and eat here all
the time, it's enormous.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.620
And my feelings about
food waste and everything

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.130
is things need to change
at really large scale,

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.070
industrial levels
with companies,

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.820
with large-scale
farms and stuff.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.920
But I think I'm also a big
believer that small differences

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.220
add up to big changes.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.190
And if we as individuals
reframe the way

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.590
we think about everything
we consume, whether it's

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:36.890
food or anything, and
not throwing things out,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.850
really taking the time
to invest in good stuff--

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.140
I do believe that
makes a difference.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:45.549
And I think that's
just a way to reframe

00:06:45.549 --> 00:06:46.590
your thinking in general.

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.730
I think if you start
looking at your food-- which

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:53.210
is the thing we consume every
day-- in this way, that's,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:54.530
I guess, a bit more mindful.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.670
For me, at least, it kind of
floats into everything else.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.650
And it's also an
excuse to just keep

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.680
eating vodka, which is great.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.741
So yeah, we'll pass
out the drinks.

00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:07.490
I should mention, if
anyone has a question

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.740
at any point about something I'm
cooking, or the book, or dogs--

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.440
I love to talk about
my dogs at any point.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.240
So the next recipe
is a savory one.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.430
It's not a drink or dessert.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.147
And it's actually the
cover of the book.

00:07:24.147 --> 00:07:25.730
So we thought it
would be a little fun

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:26.870
to bring the cover to life.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.510
So the story behind it is it's
a radicchio and squash salad,

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.970
and then the leftover
is turning it

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.030
into a really, really delicious
grilled cheese sandwich.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.480
Basically, any excuse for a
grilled cheese is fine by me.

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.110
And the salad comes from
the Thanksgiving menu

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.500
in the book, which I named a
"No Stress Thanksgiving," which

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.700
you normally don't see those
two terms together, I think.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.290
Has anyone here ever
made a Thanksgiving meal?

00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:57.020
Yeah, a few of you.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.860
It can be-- did you
find it daunting?

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:00.430
Was it?

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.120
Yeah.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.640
Yeah.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.430
And I think it really
doesn't have to be.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.642
I think so many people
who prepare a big meal,

00:08:06.642 --> 00:08:08.600
whether it's Thanksgiving
or any other holiday,

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.940
or just a large
group of friends,

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.450
there's so much pressure
and a long to-do list.

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.450
And I'm a big believer in
taking that pressure away as

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.230
much as possible.

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.120
You can delegate things.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.220
You can make so
much ahead of time.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:23.480
You can simplify recipes.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.540
You still have all these
really familiar, great flavors

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.600
without having to make every
single component from scratch

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.020
or anything like that.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:34.220
So this salad is such a
great example of, I think,

00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.059
the book in general,
but also that menu.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:39.950
Since it's radicchio,
which is so hearty--

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.320
it's not like a really
delicate lettuce or anything.

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.690
This can really
stand up to anything.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.820
And roasted squash-- you
can make the whole salad.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:49.070
You can dress it and
everything, and it can just

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.520
sit, whether it's on your buffet
table or whatever it might be,

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.551
your counter.

00:08:53.551 --> 00:08:54.800
You can make it ahead of time.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.180
You can even make it a day
ahead of time and serve it,

00:08:57.180 --> 00:08:58.790
and it will be great.

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.130
So I love thinking about
stuff like that when you're

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:03.126
entertaining so you're not--

00:09:03.126 --> 00:09:04.250
again, you're not stressed.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:06.830
You're not having to wait
last minute to make a dressing

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.720
and toss it
together, and worried

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.955
if someone shows up
late, and something

00:09:10.955 --> 00:09:13.770
is getting wilted and soggy,
or anything like that.

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.040
So that's the idea
for this salad.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.330
And then this radicchio--

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:20.780
which we're in early
September, but by the time

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.830
Thanksgiving rolls
around, radicchio squash

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.020
are everywhere in the market.

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:27.470
I feel like I'm
seeing a happy face.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.600
Do you guys like the-- yeah.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:30.630
It's a good--

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:34.264
I feel you could have this for
breakfast because it's fruit.

00:09:34.264 --> 00:09:37.820
That would be fun.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.020
But the radicchio is
a little bit bitter,

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:41.520
and then the squash
is really sweet.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.700
So I love that together.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.450
For some people, it's
a little too bitter.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.130
I really like a
little bit of bitter.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:47.964
I love broccoli rabe
and that kind of stuff.

00:09:47.964 --> 00:09:49.671
But if it is a little
too bitter for you,

00:09:49.671 --> 00:09:51.590
this could be any kind
of tough, hearty green.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.100
So this could make a beautiful
kale salad, anything like that.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.500
You could use--
escarole would be great.

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.870
So the way we prepare it is--

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:01.020
this is perfect.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.980
Sometimes when you
get it, there's

00:10:03.980 --> 00:10:06.740
kind of sad leaves
on the outside.

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.730
They're a little dry or wilted.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:09.980
These are beautiful and fresh.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.620
But if you have that,
you just peel them off.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:17.330
And then with that kind of food
waste stuff in mind, you can--

00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:22.130
what I love to do is keep
a Ziploc bag in my freezer.

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:28.850
So when I have onion peels,
or if I'm scraping a carrot,

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.046
and you have the peel from
that, or the end of celery,

00:10:32.046 --> 00:10:33.920
which is maybe not
something you want to eat,

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.503
but there's a lot
of flavor in there--

00:10:35.503 --> 00:10:38.000
all those little bits of
vegetable scraps and stuff,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.730
you go into your freezer,
into your plastic bag,

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.930
and you just put them there.

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.763
And then you don't have
to worry about them.

00:10:43.763 --> 00:10:46.211
And they're not going to go
bad or get smelly or anything

00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:46.710
like that.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.001
And when that bag is full of
all your vegetable scraps,

00:10:49.001 --> 00:10:51.840
you just dump it into a
pot, cover it with water,

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.182
and you can make delicious,
wonderful vegetable broth

00:10:54.182 --> 00:10:55.640
that you can use
to cook things in.

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.850
It's great to cook rice
in, or you can add--

00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:01.910
if you buy rotisserie chickens
or you make roast chicken,

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:04.500
you can put those bones
or whatever it might be.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.790
And then it's not like every
single time you're cooking,

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.710
you have to go make stock.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.980
But you can keep
your stockpile going.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.060
So that's a great tip.

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.090
But we don't have to do that
here because these are perfect.

00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:20.100
So just cut it up.

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:22.844
And I like to cut it
to keep the root intact

00:11:22.844 --> 00:11:25.010
so it doesn't go everywhere
while you're cutting it,

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.005
and then just across.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.580
And that little guy could
go into your container.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.430
And then they have
already roasted

00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:48.240
the squash, which makes my
life super easy and is awesome.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.720
So this is butternut squash.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.350
So with that, because
the skin is tough,

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.900
you can peel it off with a
vegetable peeler and knife.

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.500
You can also buy peeled
squash at the supermarket.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:01.200
I feel like every supermarket
these days has those done.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.042
I'm all for-- if
that shortcut means

00:12:04.042 --> 00:12:06.500
you're going to go home and
make dinner, take the shortcut.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.800
That is totally fine by me, not
that you need my permission.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.480
But I think that's
the hardest part

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.270
of preparing squash
is the peeling it,

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.790
because that skin is so tough.

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:18.660
If you can find--

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.243
which you can, because
I feel like you

00:12:20.243 --> 00:12:23.460
guys live in or
near here, and you

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.550
live-- you're working near
Chelsea Market and everything.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:29.130
So in the fall, if
there's delicata squash,

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.420
I love the salad with that.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.585
It's the cylindrical one,
and it's got striped skin.

00:12:34.585 --> 00:12:36.960
And I love it because the skin
on delicata is super thin,

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.209
and you don't have to peel it.

00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:41.130
It's totally edible.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.940
It gets really
crispy and delicious.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:47.040
So again, I'm a little bit lazy,
so that's my preferred squash,

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.090
because it's so easy.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:48.900
Because you don't
have to peel it.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:50.816
You just scrape out the
seeds like if you were

00:12:50.816 --> 00:12:52.890
cutting a melon, basically.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.810
You can also make a salad
with sweet potatoes.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.060
But anyway, whatever you
use-- sweet potatoes, squash,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.280
whatever kind, just
cut it into cubes,

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.985
toss it with some olive oil and
salt, and roast it in a 400,

00:13:02.985 --> 00:13:05.684
425 oven until--

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:06.350
this is perfect.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:08.460
It's a little bit brown.

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:13.150
And brown just means sweeter
and crisper and more flavorful.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:17.460
So don't-- I always find that
whenever I roast vegetables

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.280
or anything, it turns out the
best when I forget about them

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:22.830
for a little bit and I
really let them get brown,

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.010
because I can be a
little impatient.

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:27.120
So the browner it
is, the more flavor.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.980
And then the
dressing is so easy.

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.420
So it's a little bit of mustard.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:37.140
And this is my go-to dressing
for pretty much everything.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.150
A little-- I think we
did apple cider vinegar.

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:41.610
You can use any vinegar.

00:13:41.610 --> 00:13:44.940
I think in general,
use what you have.

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.635
I hate if I'm going
to make something,

00:13:46.635 --> 00:13:48.510
and someone calls for
something I don't have,

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:51.170
and I feel like I have to
go the grocery store again.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.170
If you have any vinegar,
just use what you have.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.010
Use sherry vinegar.

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.770
Use red wine vinegar.

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.040
All you're doing is adding acid,
so whatever you have, use that.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.784
and I feel like whatever you
have is probably what you like,

00:14:01.784 --> 00:14:03.450
because I would hope
you wouldn't buy it

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:04.324
if you don't like it.

00:14:04.324 --> 00:14:06.180
So if you don't like
apple cider vinegar,

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.460
but you love white wine
vinegar, and that's

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.230
what you, by all means,
use what you enjoy.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:14.880
So a little bit of that.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.791
And then this is maple syrup,
but this could easily be honey.

00:14:20.791 --> 00:14:22.540
You could even use a
pinch of brown sugar.

00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.780
You're just looking to add
a little bit of sweetness.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.446
I like using honey
or maple syrup mostly

00:14:26.446 --> 00:14:28.570
because they're
already in liquid form,

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:31.110
so they dissolve really easily
when you're making dressings.

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.776
They also have a
little bit more flavor,

00:14:32.776 --> 00:14:35.460
which is really nice,
as opposed to sugar.

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.970
And yeah, they're--
sugar is sugar,

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:40.480
but they're a little
bit healthier.

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.410
They're a little less processed
than white sugar or something

00:14:43.410 --> 00:14:44.360
like that.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.200
So a little bit.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:51.110
And we're going to season this
with some salt and pepper.

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.375
And then my--

00:14:58.375 --> 00:15:00.110
I love these little jars.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:06.500
My favorite way
to mince garlic is

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:10.222
either use a microplane grater
or use the side of your knife.

00:15:10.222 --> 00:15:14.060
I'll make a little room
here so you can see.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.810
And I think garlic and
dressings is like--

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.351
I feel like anytime you have a
dressing that you really love,

00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:20.840
and you're like, what's that
little something, in my mind,

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.298
it's usually a little bit of
garlic or shallot or something

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.970
from the onion, garlic family.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:28.664
I think you can really
taste when that's there.

00:15:28.664 --> 00:15:30.830
And when it's not there,
it's sort of like something

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:32.090
is missing.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.640
So yeah, I don't like using
a garlic press-- again,

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.009
because I hate cleaning them.

00:15:36.009 --> 00:15:37.800
I feel like everything
gets stuck in there.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.206
And why take out something
else that you're just

00:15:40.206 --> 00:15:41.330
going to use for one thing?

00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:46.007
So I've used this for the
squash, or they did it for me.

00:15:46.007 --> 00:15:47.090
And I've used it for this.

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.220
So why clean something else?

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.660
So I just took that little--

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:53.200
you know the root end of it?

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.840
I just sliced that off.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.250
And then I just put the
knife like this, like flat,

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:01.220
and give it a little smash.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:04.070
And then once it's smashed up,
you just put a little salt.

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:06.650
And salt is flavor, so
that's great to add,

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:08.680
but it's also an abrasive.

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.640
So it's going to help you--

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.720
it basically acts as a little
grinder for your garlic.

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.280
So you keep the
knife flat like that,

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:19.850
and then just the heel of
your hand-- you just mash it.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:22.892
And you mash it into a paste.

00:16:22.892 --> 00:16:24.350
And what's great
about this is it's

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:26.726
like you're turning your
knife into a garlic press.

00:16:26.726 --> 00:16:28.100
So you're making
this puree of it

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.100
so it will dissolve
into your dressing.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:32.840
Because I love
garlic in dressings,

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.120
but I don't want to eat
a whole clove of it.

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.570
I feel like that
would be not fun--

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:41.480
or not fun for probably
whoever I'm eating with.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.270
So yeah, so then you just turn
it like that, scrape it up.

00:16:47.524 --> 00:16:48.190
And that's that.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.400
So you whisk that in.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:52.210
So anytime I make
a dressing, I like

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.350
to mix basically
everything except the oil

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.600
or whatever fat you're using--

00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:01.270
I like to mix it all together,
make one emulsified mixture

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.480
that can then--

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.611
you mix your oil into.

00:17:04.611 --> 00:17:06.069
And you can taste
it at this point.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.890
It's going to be really
strong because it doesn't

00:17:08.890 --> 00:17:11.829
have the fat cutting it.

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:14.140
But you're tasting
it at this point

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.810
for that balance
of sweet to acidic,

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.000
and the garlic if you
wanted to add more,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.187
if you need a little
bit more vinegar.

00:17:21.187 --> 00:17:22.270
I'm super happy with this.

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:24.220
So this thing-- I press here.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.400
So most salad dressing
recipes, there's

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:30.660
usually a ratio of usually 3--

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.630
I'm sorry, 1 part vinegar to 3
parts oil, or even 4 parts oil.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:40.420
I like really strong, assertive
dressing, so more like 1 part

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.720
vinegar to 2 parts oil.

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.310
And I think you just
taste more stuff.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.630
So I'm just going to eyeball
it based on what I have.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.030
I'm also going to do my
other favorite trick, which

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.640
if you're whisking dressing
or anything, if you

00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.770
put a little towel under your
bowl, it'll help hold it.

00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:00.524
And wait to put that in.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:07.940
Yeah.

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:13.208
And then-- oh, there we go.

00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:14.570
You can do it kind of slowly.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.740
This thing is good
because it keeps you--

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:21.810
like portion control.

00:18:33.655 --> 00:18:36.280
I feel like this is like trying
to take a selfie when you press

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.000
the button at the same time.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.760
Yeah, that looks pretty good.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.250
Yeah, that's great.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.590
So then you've
got your dressing,

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.790
and then you just add the
roasted squash, again,

00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:56.580
sweet potato, whatever you
want, all that beautiful, sliced

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.592
radicchio.

00:18:58.592 --> 00:19:01.050
I'm just going to go a little
light on it since the bowl is

00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:01.710
kind of small.

00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:03.660
And then I wash my
hands just before.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:07.200
I think your hands are the most
useful tool in the kitchen.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.670
And clean hands-- just don't
be afraid to get in there.

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.714
And I think the more you
interact with your food

00:19:11.714 --> 00:19:13.380
and touch it and all
that kind of stuff,

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:18.060
the more you'll develop
those intuitive senses of how

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.400
dressed your salad should
be, when your chicken is

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:22.300
done, when your fish is done.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:24.870
So I think-- just don't
be afraid to touch it.

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:28.027
And it's also good because
it means you can really coat

00:19:28.027 --> 00:19:29.235
everything with the dressing.

00:19:32.794 --> 00:19:35.150
And then-- yeah.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:39.900
Use a bigger bowl so
you don't spill it all.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:40.870
But yeah, that's it.

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.150
And that's the salad you
guys are all enjoying.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.640
And what's awesome is that--
yeah, that can just sit,

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.300
and it's good the next
day, or you can make it

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.730
a few hours ahead of time.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:53.480
And that dressing you
can put on anything.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.370
It's amazing also
just as its own sauce.

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:00.250
If you-- I feel like I'm
always using roasted chicken

00:20:00.250 --> 00:20:03.340
or grilled fish as an example,
but a vinaigrette doesn't just

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.480
have to belong on a salad.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.795
You can spoon that on
top of grilled steak

00:20:06.795 --> 00:20:07.670
or whatever you want.

00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.780
It'll just add that nice,
garlicy, acidic thing.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:12.280
Yeah.

00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.238
You can do a different
green, different squash,

00:20:14.238 --> 00:20:16.130
but super versatile.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.720
And also nice for holiday
meals to have something really

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.220
healthy and fresh, because I
think sometimes we get a little

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.484
weighed down with all the
really delicious stuffing

00:20:24.484 --> 00:20:26.400
mashed potatoes, which
I have no problem with.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.230
But it's nice to cut it with
something acidic and crunchy.

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:32.160
And then if you have
leftover salad--

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.160
everyone has had their
meal, they've enjoyed it,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.029
but there's still some at
the bottom of the bowl.

00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.820
Don't throw it out.

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.903
I feel like salad is one
of the things people just

00:20:39.903 --> 00:20:41.030
get rid of immediately.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:41.990
Because you feel
like, what are you

00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.610
going to do with leftover salad?

00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:45.370
This one-- again,
because it is so hearty,

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.870
will really stay in good shape.

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:49.610
And my favorite thing
to do is to turn it

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:52.160
into a grilled cheese.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.450
But a few ideas for other--

00:20:53.450 --> 00:20:57.590
if you have just dressed greens,
like bib lettuce or something

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.710
like that, that's going to
get really wilted and soggy.

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:04.430
My recommendation for
that is to lean into it.

00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:06.110
Don't try to fight that texture.

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:08.220
And there's an idea in the book.

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.310
There's a menu, actually,
for a bib lettuce salad.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.900
It has a really delicious
shallot vinaigrette,

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.010
and I serve it as part of a
meal with mashed cauliflower

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.510
that's sort of like
mashed potatoes,

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:20.910
but much lower in
carbohydrates and stuff,

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:24.470
which normally I wouldn't
necessarily suggest.

00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:28.010
But A, it's delicious,
and B, my wife Grace

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:29.136
lives with type 1 diabetes.

00:21:29.136 --> 00:21:30.510
We were talking
about it earlier.

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:32.970
And it's made a lot of really
healthy changes in our homes.

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:40.142
But that cauliflower
and the salad--

00:21:40.142 --> 00:21:41.600
if you have leftovers
the next day,

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.100
I suggest turning
that into a soup.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.890
And then you just put your
leftover wilted greens

00:21:45.890 --> 00:21:48.620
in with it, and you puree it,
and that wilted lettuce will

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:50.480
just wilt into oblivion.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.869
But that vinaigrette and
the body from the lettuce

00:21:52.869 --> 00:21:55.160
and everything-- it's going
to be such a beautiful part

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.040
of a really silky,
delicious cauliflower soup,

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.030
and it will season it.

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.110
So there is really new life
for anything and everything.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:05.420
So grilled cheese--

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.400
I don't think
anyone really needs

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.840
a recipe for a grilled cheese.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.560
But my big tip for
it is to really not

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.790
be afraid of mayonnaise.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:16.610
And I put a little bit on
both sides of the bread.

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.650
And that means the inside
of your grilled cheese

00:22:18.650 --> 00:22:20.150
is going to have
some good moisture,

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:22.550
like mayonnaise on any sandwich.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.839
But it also means that
the outside of the bread--

00:22:24.839 --> 00:22:26.630
I'm not going to put
any butter in the pan.

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:28.300
And mayonnaise is mostly oil.

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:30.190
It's oil in a solid form.

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:33.991
It's held together with an
egg yolk or whatever Hellman's

00:22:33.991 --> 00:22:34.490
uses.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:36.620
I have no idea.

00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:39.950
So when you spread
it on the outside,

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:43.460
it means that every
single bit of this bread

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:46.130
is going to hit the
pan, and that oil

00:22:46.130 --> 00:22:47.180
is going to make contact.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.790
And when fat and
heat come together

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.580
on something dry like
bread or chicken skin,

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.650
or if you're roasting
it or something,

00:22:54.650 --> 00:22:57.740
that's when you get really
nice, brown, delicious--

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.350
like a crust on something,
like butter in pie

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:02.100
dough and stuff like that.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.100
So yeah, a little
mayonnaise on the outside,

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:05.059
a little on the inside.

00:23:05.059 --> 00:23:07.266
I feel like if you're going
to have a grilled cheese,

00:23:07.266 --> 00:23:08.680
you should really go for it.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:12.380
Really just use your
mayo and your cheese.

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:17.170
And then this is cheddar,
but it can be whatever cheese

00:23:17.170 --> 00:23:18.040
you have.

00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.215
Swiss cheese or
Gruyere is great.

00:23:20.215 --> 00:23:21.290
It doesn't matter.

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:25.930
And then I put a
little layer of that,

00:23:25.930 --> 00:23:32.320
and then the leftover
salad, a little handful.

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.450
And it just adds a little--

00:23:34.450 --> 00:23:36.700
not only is it a good way
to use that leftover salad,

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:39.820
but it also adds a
nice, wonderful layer

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.410
to your grilled cheese, a
little bit more substantial.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.540
I feel like it's a
vegetable, so then you

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:51.530
can feel really guiltless about
eating your grilled cheese.

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:54.850
And I'm just going to turn this
down a little because it's hot.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.760
A little cheese
on top, and then--

00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:00.480
yeah, mayo here for the inside.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.704
I just give it a little press,
put all that stuff together.

00:24:09.704 --> 00:24:12.120
That also guarantees that the
bottom of the grilled cheese

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.370
is really pressing down
onto that hot surface

00:24:14.370 --> 00:24:15.940
and will get super,
super crispy.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:16.440
Yeah.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.090
When you guys were
doing them before,

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:20.070
that smell of toasted bread--

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:23.370
bread toasting and any kind
of fat, I think, is like--

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:28.700
you need to sell your house or
something, make a few of these.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:29.200
Yes?

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.310
AUDIENCE: What
cheese are you using?

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.540
JULIA TURSHEN: Cheddar, yeah.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:33.330
But it could be anything.

00:24:33.330 --> 00:24:35.980
And you can use a mixture, too,
if you have a few little bits

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.109
of cheese lying around.

00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:40.150
If you just grate them
all and mix them together,

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:41.740
that's a great way to use up--

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.810
if you've had a party,
and you've served cheese

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.772
with wine or whatever, and
you're left with little ends,

00:24:46.772 --> 00:24:48.730
and it's like, what am
I going to do with this,

00:24:48.730 --> 00:24:51.710
and you're not going to put them
out again, cut off the rind.

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.360
Grate them all.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:53.500
Mix them together.

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.180
I think that's the best thing.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:56.680
And then--

00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:58.005
JULIA TURSHEN: Sorry?

00:24:58.005 --> 00:24:58.947
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:24:58.947 --> 00:25:00.530
JULIA TURSHEN: That's
a good question.

00:25:00.530 --> 00:25:01.540
I have never done that.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.910
I feel like I wouldn't
recommend that.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:07.780
I feel like it's going
to get a little cloudy.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.190
That's a good question, though.

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.690
Yeah.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.880
That's one thing I don't have
an idea for, the cheese rind.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.410
Some things you just let go.

00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:17.410
Yeah.

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:18.540
So just let that get brown.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.664
I'm going to flip it over
because I bet it's brown.

00:25:20.664 --> 00:25:23.920
And that little piece--
sometimes I will purposely

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.710
sprinkle extra cheese on the
pan because that little bit that

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:29.200
comes off that's crispy and
delicious is the best part.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.970
So you can do that on purpose
and just make extra of that.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.660
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:38.890
Yeah.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:40.400
And that is the grilled cheese.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.780
I'm just going to let
the other side get brown.

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:46.184
But yeah, I've
successfully made a mess.

00:25:46.184 --> 00:25:48.100
But you've seen two of
the recipes that are so

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:51.160
simple-- the salad,
the lemon sorbet,

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.610
the boozy slushy that can turn
into the lemony poundcake.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:57.310
And you can make things.

00:25:57.310 --> 00:25:58.990
You can make them
more than once.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.730
It can be a whole other thing.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:03.280
And I should mention
also, a big part

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:06.790
of the inspiration for the
book is because Grace, my wife,

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.170
and I live in a
really rural area.

00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.540
We're just two
hours north of here.

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:14.950
But it's-- it feels
very far away.

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:18.190
And I grew up a block
from here, and I grew up

00:26:18.190 --> 00:26:21.100
with lots of takeout, lots
of-- a million restaurants

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.320
in a five-minute vicinity.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.630
And now I live in an area
where there's no takeout

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:28.940
and you have to go pretty
far to go to a restaurant.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:29.940
But yes, it's beautiful.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.773
No, I'm super happy.

00:26:30.773 --> 00:26:32.750
But it means we eat
every meal at home,

00:26:32.750 --> 00:26:34.117
so we're always cooking.

00:26:34.117 --> 00:26:36.200
And I don't necessarily
want to start from scratch

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.030
every single day.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.052
So I will always--

00:26:39.052 --> 00:26:40.760
I will make this, or
even more than this,

00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.400
just for the two of us,
because I know that I'm

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.600
going to keep using it.

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:45.680
And in addition to
the grilled cheese,

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.480
this can also be part of
a grain bowl or something

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:52.010
like that the next day.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:54.820
This with some shredded
roast chicken tossed into it

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.200
is delicious, or a
piece of grilled salmon,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.160
or something like that.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.490
So I just love the idea
that the food you make,

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:03.950
you can make it once, and
it can keep serving you.

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.810
And you can put in that
effort at one point.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:08.310
And it doesn't have to be a ton
of effort, as you have seen,

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.940
but then you can keep
reaping the benefits of it.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:14.360
So that's the "again"
of "Now &amp; Again."

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:16.570
And I should probably
pull this off.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:19.905
Does anyone have any questions?

00:27:19.905 --> 00:27:20.655
How are you doing?

00:27:20.655 --> 00:27:20.940
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.773
JULIA TURSHEN: Good.

00:27:21.773 --> 00:27:22.521
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:27:22.521 --> 00:27:24.440
JULIA TURSHEN: Oh, that's OK.

00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.397
Yeah.

00:27:25.397 --> 00:27:27.730
AUDIENCE: What might you use
instead of radicchio if you

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:28.780
don't have that lying around?

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.320
Yeah

00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.300
JULIA TURSHEN: I think
kale is awesome in here.

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.920
And I like when--

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:36.040
I think you were talking about
you did a kale salad yesterday.

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.170
I'd be curious what
his technique is.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:42.100
But I like to chop
up kale, any kind,

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:44.380
like the curly one
or the dinosaur kale,

00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:45.802
whatever you have.

00:27:45.802 --> 00:27:47.010
Chop it up kind of like this.

00:27:47.010 --> 00:27:51.250
And then I put a little--
either lemon juice or vinegar,

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.920
and a little bit of
salt. And you have

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.260
to give it a little massage.

00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.850
So you really work it with
your hands and break it down.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:01.660
Because I think
sometimes, kale salads,

00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.590
you feel a little
bit like a dinosaur

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:06.910
eating it or something.

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.230
It's so leafy and stuff.

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:11.134
So when you do that
stuff to break it down--

00:28:11.134 --> 00:28:12.550
that's the only
difference I would

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:15.520
do if I did this with
kale is to give it that--

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:18.100
break it down with a little
something acidic-- lemon,

00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:20.320
vinegar, salt. And then
just the same dressings,

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.110
same sweet potatoes
or squash, whatever.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.870
You can also-- this is
delicious with arugula.

00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:28.240
A box of washed baby
arugula is great.

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.075
It won't last in the
same way because it

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:31.450
will get a little
bit more wilty,

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.560
but that would be delicious
tucked into a grilled cheese,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.180
either of those.

00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.650
JULIA TURSHEN: Does
it have sorbet?

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:42.290
That's OK.

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:43.750
It's like if you had leftovers.

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:45.390
There's some-- you
want some here?

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.130
Yeah, come.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:51.580
The only problem
with the boozy--

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:55.000
yeah, the problem with the boozy
slushies is if you have one,

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.790
and then you go to
make the poundcake,

00:28:57.790 --> 00:28:59.960
you'll probably
forget something.

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.600
You keep eating.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:05.180
Yeah.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.450
There's no wrong at all.

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:10.476
Any other questions?

00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:17.460
AUDIENCE: Besides vodka,
what kind of other alcohol

00:29:17.460 --> 00:29:18.720
would you recommend?

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.553
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah.

00:29:19.553 --> 00:29:22.800
So instead of vodka, would I
recommend any other alcohol?

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:24.780
You can do this just
with a sparkling wine.

00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:27.330
That would be fine
if you wanted to make

00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:30.830
it a little less boozy boozy.

00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.000
And you can mix
it up in any way.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.100
I feel like if you
did-- you can really

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.240
get creative and have fun.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.770
An orange sorbet
with a little bit

00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:41.610
of Campari and a sparkling wine
would be delicious, kind of

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:44.220
like a spritz, basically.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.760
You can really mix it up.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:50.740
I haven't tried anything in the
bourbon category or anything

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:51.240
like that.

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.890
I did-- actually, in
"Small Victories,"

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:54.960
there's a really
delicious milkshake that

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.970
has peaches and bourbon in it.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.760
So I think I have brown
liquor and a more ice

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.290
cream, milkshake direction.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.510
But yeah, the clear stuff for--

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.680
rum would be delicious.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.340
A clear-- a white
rum would be awesome.

00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:09.100
So yeah.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.630
Now I'm thinking of more ideas.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:12.390
Use what you have.

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:14.357
But yeah, you can
be really flexible.

00:30:14.357 --> 00:30:15.190
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:19.720
JULIA TURSHEN: Or a lime sorbet
with tequila would be awesome.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.770
Invite me over for that.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.290
AUDIENCE: I just love that
this is a food waste book,

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:29.470
but it's not in your face, and
it seems really approachable.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.212
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:30.212 --> 00:30:31.420
JULIA TURSHEN: Oh, thank you.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:32.650
Yeah.

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:38.110
It wasn't the-- that wasn't
even the original idea.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.670
And then as I was
working on it, I

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:43.090
was like, oh, this is the
message here that I didn't

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.220
even quite realize,
which I think sometimes

00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:46.760
is a nice way to--

00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:48.410
it's a really serious issue.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.770
And I think sometimes,
if you approach it

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:54.550
in a way that's
fun, it's a nice way

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.150
to approach lots of tough stuff.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.534
So yeah, thank you.

00:31:00.534 --> 00:31:01.590
Do you have a question?

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:11.230
AUDIENCE: Is there anything
that you have found that--

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:14.530
when you have made dinner,
or any kind of a meal,

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:18.747
that you should
not use it again?

00:31:18.747 --> 00:31:20.330
JULIA TURSHEN: That's
a good question.

00:31:20.330 --> 00:31:25.900
Some things-- I would say the
only thing I can think of is

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.985
if you're doing any--

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:28.610
which there's not a
recipe in the book,

00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:31.490
but if doing any kind
of raw fish thing--

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:35.380
if you're making your own
sushi or ceviche or something,

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.810
I feel like leaving that
in the fridge for a week

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:42.040
and then making something
might be a little questionable.

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.350
But one question that's
come up a few times

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:45.840
in talking about the book is--

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.590
I think a lot of people
look at leftovers,

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:49.750
and you think the food
is not good anymore.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:50.935
It's not fresh.

00:31:50.935 --> 00:31:53.710
You can probably speak
more to this than I can in.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.660
In restaurant kitchens
and everything,

00:31:55.660 --> 00:31:57.080
you make so much ahead of time.

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:58.960
Not everything is
made just that minute.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.710
And so much of cooking
is about planning ahead.

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:05.420
And with that comes the
knowledge that food lasts.

00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.420
You can make something
and put it in the fridge,

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:08.890
and it's going to be OK.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:10.540
You can hold onto
it for a few days.

00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:13.570
You can hold onto most
stuff for, like, a week.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:14.070
Yeah.

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:15.903
AUDIENCE: Is there an
ingredient in the book

00:32:15.903 --> 00:32:19.810
that you find is most occurring
or the more recurring that's

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:21.280
never out of your pantry?

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:21.980
JULIA TURSHEN: That's
a great question.

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:23.340
AUDIENCE: What's one thing
that you don't run out of

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:24.850
or that comes up in
the book most often?

00:32:24.850 --> 00:32:26.475
JULIA TURSHEN: That's
a great question.

00:32:26.475 --> 00:32:30.490
This is probably really
obvious, but I am never

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.630
out of olive oil.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:34.670
There is not just the
bottle on my counter.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.740
There's two in the drawer.

00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.250
Because to me, the idea of
running out of olive oil

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:40.640
is like, well,
then what do I do?

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.340
I can run out of anything
else and figure it out.

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:42.850
That's fine.

00:32:42.850 --> 00:32:45.500
But with that, I would be lost.

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.680
So olive oil and salt--
it sounds really basic,

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:49.460
but I really think
with those two things,

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:53.020
you can make anything.

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:57.210
AUDIENCE: Just for fun,
what's your go-to meal?

00:32:57.210 --> 00:33:00.310
JULIA TURSHEN: Lately,
what is my go-to meal?

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:03.872
Well, so much of this book comes
from that I don't love eating

00:33:03.872 --> 00:33:05.080
the same thing over and over.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.610
It's like the reinvention thing.

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:08.710
But I would say in
general, I've been--

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:15.010
because it's end of summer where
we all live, in New York state

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:19.630
or nearby, the tomatoes
and peppers and everything

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:21.170
are so delicious right now.

00:33:21.170 --> 00:33:26.470
So I do a lot of chop, Greek-ish
salads, so all different kinds

00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:28.270
of tomatoes, chopped
cucumbers, peppers,

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:31.870
and then big pieces of good
feta cheese and vinegar and oil

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.100
and dried oregano.

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:33.960
I love that.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:36.700
And that with-- sometimes
we'll grill sausages

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:37.790
or chicken or something.

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:39.604
And to me, that's
a perfect meal.

00:33:39.604 --> 00:33:40.770
AUDIENCE: Sounds good to me.

00:33:40.770 --> 00:33:41.603
JULIA TURSHEN: Yeah.

00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:45.000
And then leftovers of that--

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.005
you can-- maybe
take out the feta.

00:33:47.005 --> 00:33:48.130
Take out your little cubes.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:50.827
But then you can make
delicious gazpacho.

00:33:50.827 --> 00:33:53.160
Or you can just eat the salad
the next day, That's fine.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.100
Yeah.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:58.060
Any other questions?

00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:06.084
AUDIENCE: What's next?

00:34:06.084 --> 00:34:07.250
JULIA TURSHEN: What is next?

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:08.749
I'm about to start
working on a book

00:34:08.749 --> 00:34:12.620
with a friend of mine that
is not like my recipes.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.602
We're doing recipes from--

00:34:14.602 --> 00:34:17.060
I probably shouldn't-- I should
ask her how much I can say.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:18.889
It's going to be
recipes from grandmas,

00:34:18.889 --> 00:34:20.719
which I'm really excited about.

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:22.610
So maybe we can come
back here in maybe--

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.260
probably two years
with some grandmas.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.440
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.949
JULIA TURSHEN: Not my grandma
because she doesn't cook.

00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:31.199
I gave her "Now &amp; Again,"
and she's like, that's nice.

00:34:36.011 --> 00:34:36.719
PRESENTER: Great.

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:37.530
Thank you.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:39.113
JULIA TURSHEN: Thank
you guys so much.

00:34:39.113 --> 00:34:40.239
PRESENTER: Thanks to Julia.

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:40.988
JULIA TURSHEN: OK.

00:34:40.988 --> 00:34:44.570
