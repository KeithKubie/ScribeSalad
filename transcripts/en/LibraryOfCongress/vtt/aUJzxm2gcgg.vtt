00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.740
&gt;&gt; Good evening, ladies
and gentleman.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.400
Bienvenidos.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.590
Welcome to the Pickford,
the very intimate,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.400
lovely, beautiful Pickford.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.160
We're very glad to have you here.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.530
I am Marie Arana.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.140
And I am here to welcome
you on behalf

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.840
of the Librarian Hispanic
Initiative.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.390
This is an initiative that was
begun by the Librarian of Congress,

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.510
James Billington, who
just about a year ago.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.060
[ Applause ]

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.690
Just about a year ago,
Dr. Billington decided

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.760
that an organization was
needed, an initiative was needed

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.690 position:56%
with a working group behind it to
better serve the Hispanic population

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.130
of this country and to better
represent the collection,

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.200 position:56%
the Luso-Hispanic collection in this
institution, which is the largest

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.090
and finest Hispanic
collection in the world.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.510
And to bring attention to that,
not only for the Hispanic-Americans

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.520
of this country, but for all of the
world and all the Americas, really.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.460
And the third part of
this initiative was

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.690
to better represent the Hispanic
population within the institution

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.200
of the Library of Congress.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.520
So this has been a very busy year
for the Hispanic Working Group.

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.720
And I think a very productive year.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.780
And this is really a
product of their efforts.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.480
I want to say a little
bit about the program.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.780
You know, a vibrant American
theatre, which celebrates and stars

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.080 position:56%
and serves Hispanics, has been
flourishing in this country probably

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.040
since the mid-19th Century.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.370
And that's more than 150 hears.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.010
But in fact, very few contemporary
American historians have written

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.900
about it or know about
or have recorded it.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.830
Certainly, little of that story has
been recorded in any of the annals

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.620
of American theatre history even.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.670 position:56%
And now come these two scholar, Tony
Mata [phonetic] and Ralf Remshardt

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.380
to correct that oversight and
to rescue a really vivid slice

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.580
of history, the history of New
York's dynamic Latino Theatre

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.010
over the course of
the past 50 years.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.400
They call it the Theatre
of Rice and Beans.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.030
The documentary you're about to see

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.280
and hear represents a major
corrective and one that we want

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.530
to honor here at the
Library of Congress.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.350
We hope that you appreciate
its broader cultural context,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.120
the sweeping infusion of the
Hispanic arts that Professor Mata's

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.540
and Professor Remshardt
very moving film represents,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:23.890
especially as they engage in
conversation with two giants

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.030
of the Washington D.C.'s
storied GALA Theatre here

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.870
in D.C. [foreign language].

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.600
We're very fortunate
to have these very.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.710
Very fortunate to have these very
engaged witnesses join us tonight

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.090
in a tribute to the wider story.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.390
Now Roberto Slazar who is with
the Hispanic Working Group will be

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.120
introducing our speakers
in a moment.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.580 position:56%
But first I want to make a few
acknowledgments, if you'll allow me.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.580
Dr. Billington.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.160
This was his idea.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.800
This evening was his idea.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.300
And it is really an example
of the kind of passion

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.040
that Dr. Billington has
brought as librarian,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.810
investing this institution with
his vision of the humanities

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.880
and a conviction that the study
of humanities that knowledge

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.330
that reading makes us
all better human beings.

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.050
And his leadership in my
view has been characterized

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:40.780
by a very keen acuity of
-- about cultural issues.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.770
And I have always appreciated
as a Hispanic myself

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.810
in particular his appreciation for
the broader story of the Americas.

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.760
So thank you, Dr. Billington,
for all you have done.

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.920
And let me just enumerate
a few things

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.450
in the past year that he has done.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.900
He has named a U.S. poet
laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.470
who is the first Hispanic
ever to be a poet laureate

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.550
of the United States of America.

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:16.080
He has three of the Living Legend
Awards that were given in 2013,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.320
2015, and next year
2016 are to Hispanics.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.140
The first one was to Miguel Leon
Portilla, a wonderful linguist,

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:30.930
a really enormously important
historian, anthropologist,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.080
linguist who virtually single
handily rescued the language

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.150
Nahuatl, which is the
language of the Maya

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.970
and recorded it for all time.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.310
And he was given a
Living Legend Award.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.250
On November 2, Marta Casals
Istomin, a magnificent contributor

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.140
to the arts and to music.

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.500
In not only in this country, but
around the world, in the Americas

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.650
and around the world will be
given the Living Legend Award.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.700
And next spring Mario Vargas
Llosa, I hope you've heard of him,

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:07.930
Peruvian novelist,
Nobel Prize winner

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.570
who will be receiving
a Living Legend Award

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.240
from the Library of Congress.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.860
And Dr. Billington has always
had a keen eye for Mexico,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.670
our neighbor, our closest neighbor.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:25.900
In many ways not only our
neighbor but our sibling.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.960
And someone who is very
much a part of our family.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.720
So for all of these things,
thank you Dr. Billington.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:37.250
And thank you to Margery
Billington as well for her work

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.240
so many years [inaudible] and wife,
really, of the institution itself.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.040
Thank you so much.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:53.090
[ Applause ]

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:57.230
I want to acknowledge, also, David
Mao who is our acting Librarian

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.620
of Congress, who is the
host of this evening.

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:03.940
And the chief of staff
Robert Newlen,

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.740
thank you so much for
all your support.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:12.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.860
There are three people
who were very instrumental

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.070
in bringing this together, Angela
Kinney, there she is over there

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.870
with the Hispanic Working Group.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.500
Catalina Lomas, I don't
know if you are here.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.820
Catalina has also helped very much.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:38.010
And of course, what you'll see
in the program that it says

00:07:38.010 --> 00:07:42.780
that I am the chair of the
Hispanic Working Group.

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.380
Well, the chair of the Hispanic
Working Group is actually

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.680

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.980
I'm the former chair.

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:49.900
And I want to introduce
Avelia Rubiala [phonetic]

&gt;&gt; I do have the distinct privilege
of introducing our speakers

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.940
who after the film screening
will treat us, I believe,

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:19.670

special guest who is here with us
this evening the other co-founder

00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:59.510
of GALA Theatre, Rebecca Medrano.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:08.510
[ Applause ]

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:23.040
[ Music ]

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.380
&gt;&gt; Keeping it theatre, Latina
Theatre in New York City

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.790
for four years, he
started this [inaudible].

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.090
&gt;&gt; I agree.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:34.830
&gt;&gt; And then people say,
well why are you doing it?

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:38.970
Nobody's putting a gun on my
chest to say you have to do that.

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:40.780
I do that because I want it.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.850
I do that because it gives
me enormous pleasure.

00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:50.120
&gt;&gt; I think that what we're doing
is enriching the cultural life

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.250
of this country.

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:54.980
&gt;&gt; Latino is [inaudible].

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.640
The moment that [inaudible]
start to become different,

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.790
then you're going to be different.

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:05.060
&gt;&gt; These theatres, the three
theatres, have allowed us

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:08.860
to just be human beings, not have
to define ourselves by our identity

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.520
because our identity's only
one part of our humanity.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.310
&gt;&gt; I would definitely
express my gratitude

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.200
for the kind of work they've done.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.250
And for the gift they've
offered to the American Theatre.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:21.680
They are the pioneers.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.170
&gt;&gt; Is it 40 years?

00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.680
I mean, it's a tremendous
amount of time.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.540
And that her theatre has survived.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:34.500
She just introduced us to the
world, our poets, our writers.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.920
And she's still doing it.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.400
She's still doing it.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:45.510
&gt;&gt; I would like to tell those
three pioneers thank you for being

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.100
so far ahead of the curve.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.170
And for shouting our voices when
no one was listening to our voices.

00:12:53.170 --> 00:12:56.280
When we were still
struggling to get work.

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.510
For planting a flag in the sand.

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:31.510
[ Music ]

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:37.390
[ Applause ]

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.710
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] it provides a
historical [inaudible] for the work

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.600
of the Latino Theatre artists
I think in this country

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.950
and three very significant pioneers
who are focused in New York.

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:50.040
But we can also touch on what
was also happening in California

00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:52.300
with [inaudible] started
about the same time.

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:57.960
GALA here in Washington D.C. There
was a theatre in Boston, also,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.540
that was started about
the same period of time.

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.240
But I think that the piece really,
the documentary also touched

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.390
on a lot of issues
that really could come

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:07.620
under the state of Latino theatre.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:11.250
You know, and some of the
issues that they were dealing

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:15.070
with as pioneers [inaudible], Louis
Valdez [phonetic] were also dealing

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.930
with as well is what
is the relationship

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:20.580
between the art and the audience.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.070
You know, how do you
continue the work?

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:23.660
What is Latino theatre?

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.690
What is the importance of
the language or the question

00:14:25.690 --> 00:14:28.020
of what does language play a
key role in this [inaudible]?

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:34.120
Where the language is
culture or is just semantics.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:40.130
Also, the importance of creating
space for to develop the work

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:42.510
where it's being understood
that where to come from has

00:14:42.510 --> 00:14:46.280
to have a context for that to be
able to develop something has to be

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.910
like to provide an environment in
which someone understands the role

00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:51.060
that he plays in society.

00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.080
So I think I really
touch on a lot of this.

00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.780
But I'm also curious
as to why you want --

00:14:56.780 --> 00:14:59.470
you hinted at it at the very
beginning of the documentary

00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:03.810
about being in New York and going
to New York about you as an artist,

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:07.250
why this project was
important to you.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:08.550
&gt;&gt; I'll tell you.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:14.100
It was because they were the
surrogate parents to so many of us

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.610
when we arrived to New York,
not just me but so many of us.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:21.790
And they were not only
surrogate parents to all of us,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.300
they were also great teachers.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:27.580
I had wonderful opportunities to
work as an actor and as a director

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:31.560
in Miriam's Theatre and to assist
Rene Bush [phonetic] as a director.

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:36.810
And so he highly influenced me as a
director, just being his assistant

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:40.480
and getting to be on stage as
an actor with him and working

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.950
at Intar [phonetic] with
Maria Repornaz [phonetic]

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.280
in the playwrights lab.

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.870
So having been in New York all
those years working with them

00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:50.780
and having a conversation
with Ralf after he got

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.080
out of class one afternoon.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.380
And he said you know, I
have some students that want

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:56.370
to do some research on
these three theatres,

00:15:56.370 --> 00:15:58.560
and there's virtually
nothing out there.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.460
And you know these three people,
and I said well you're good

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.920 position:56%
with the camera, let's do something.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.740
Let's -- I'll have
a dinner with them.

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.600
Let's get them all together
and start with the dinner

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:12.390
because I really thought if
I can get the three of them

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:14.790
because they were also
getting up in their years,

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.740
and I knew that if we didn't
capture some of the history

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.130
that like Marie said has
been omitted in a lot

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.020
of theatre history
books that this part

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.730
of American theatre history was
going to vanish and be gone.

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.660
And I didn't want people
to read this information

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.960
in a theatre history book.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.210
I wanted them to get it from them.

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.720
And I wanted all of the people

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:39.820
to understand the great influence
they had on multiple generations.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.870
So that was important to depict
in the film was all of the people

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.000
and the generations
that they impacted.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.450
But so when Ralf said that
to me, I said all right,

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.740
well I'll organize the dinner,
and we'll get them together,

00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.580
which was chore in and of
itself to get three people

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.810 position:56%
of their caliber to agree on a date.

00:16:56.810 --> 00:16:59.990
And then my dear friend Dave
had offered his apartment,

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.880
who's here tonight in New
York, and said all right,

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:03.730
we can have it in his apartment.

00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.110
And we'll gather everybody
together and have a dinner.

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:10.110
And from that dinner, which was
about three hours of shooting,

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:13.110
we said thank God, okay
we have that, right, Ralf?

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:14.410
And --

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:15.710
&gt;&gt; We had the film at that point.

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:17.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then --

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; We couldn't have been more wrong.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:23.910
&gt;&gt; No. Because went from the dinner
what we started to discover is,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:27.000
I said, well now we have
to get some of these people

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.220
that they're talking about.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.470
So when, you know, to try to
get somebody like Nilo Cruz

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:35.320
who just won the Pulitzer
Prize or Lin-Manuel Miranda

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.290
who just won the Tony for
In the Heights and trying

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.520
to schedule interviews
with them while we're kind

00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.710
of have our full-time
academic schedule and directing

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.410
and all the things that we do.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:50.840
And I might also add that during
this process, we were applying

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.870
for grants and were getting nothing

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:57.230
because we were not professional
documentarians, by the way.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.530
We had never done this before.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.120
So every time we would apply for
a grant, they would say, well,

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.000
you've never done this before,
so we're not going to --

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.400
even Latino Public Broadcasting
did not give us a dime.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.820
And we applied twice.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:11.540
And even though this was such an
important story, they said oh no.

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:14.640
You know, it's not
worthy or whatever it is.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.940
And so --

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:20.460
&gt;&gt; I think they had a justified
skepticism, which is when we talked

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.720
to our editor, who by
the way we really have

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.020
to acknowledge Dennis Gatson.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:25.320
&gt;&gt; Oh my goodness.

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:26.620
&gt;&gt; Terrific, terrific.

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:30.490
In this process because
he gave much of his --

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.060
much of his time for free or for
very little money to help us.

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:38.970
But when we talked to him, he was a
very experience documentary maker.

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:41.990
He said 80 or 90 percent
I forget what --

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.880
anyways a very high
number of documentaries

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.970 position:56%
that start never, ever get finished.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:54.630
And so, so the skepticism of PBS
was, you know, understandable.

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:56.940
Why would they think that
we would finish this?

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:00.570
Why did we think we would finish?

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.980
And so, you know, somehow
it got made.

00:19:02.980 --> 00:19:07.780 position:56%
&gt;&gt; But I think that the sheer --
this really was a true labor of love

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:10.010
because we were determined.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.270
We were driven by the fact that
we knew we had to finish it

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.060
because we knew we wanted them to
see it before anything happened.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:21.390
And we know that Rene had gotten
rather frail, had gotten sick.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.540
And so that pushed us
even further to we have

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:25.420
to finish this, we
have to finish this.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.010
And so we had our first screening,

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.090
and the film was an
hour and twenty minutes.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.960
And we had it at Tribeca
Cinemas in New York last year,

00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:33.670
and thankfully they
were all able to come.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.990
Rene almost didn't make it even
the day before we weren't sure

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:38.540 position:56%
because he had been in the hospital.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:39.840
But they were all able to attend.

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.140
And Chita Rivera came.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.760
And a bunch of the community came
to support and watch the film.

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:47.280
And they were just so happy
just to see their lives,

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.540
I think, on the screen, you know.

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.570
And what they've done and the
legacy that they've left with all

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:56.200
of us was truly, it was a gift.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.150
It was very, very exciting
for Ralf and myself to think

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:05.080
that we could even take on
something that was incredibly,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.740
something we had never done
but just sheer passion and will

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.410
to finish this film
and get it out there.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:18.210
And so -- and it really
was Ralf and Dennis Gatson

00:20:18.210 --> 00:20:22.890
who were absolutely incredible,
the three of us were just --

00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:27.170
we couldn't have done it without
Dennis because like Ralf said he's,

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:29.280
you know, he had done
so many documentaries.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.650
And he gave in kind
so many of his hours.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.200
Because I want to thank
the University of Florida

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.000
for allowing us to get these small
little grants that we would apply

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.010
for that would give us
$1500 here and $2,000 here

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:45.600
so that we could travel and
get the interviews done.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.930
Just very basic.

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.440
We weren't Ken Burns.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.910
And we didn't have millions of
dollars, and we didn't have a team

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:53.720
of people to do this for us.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.840
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] reflect actually
[inaudible] pioneers because --

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.140
&gt;&gt; Well, exactly, yeah.

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.120
&gt;&gt; You're pioneering actually the
same way because I mean is was

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.400
to their persistence that
actually created [inaudible].

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.700
&gt;&gt; Shoestring.

00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.410
&gt;&gt; Shoestring and they
did everything and stuff.

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:12.880
I wanted to ask Hugo because I
know you're a colleague of Rene

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:16.350
and Intar and Miriam as well.

00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:21.710 position:56%
How did what you saw in the film
mirror or what GALA, your experience

00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:24.270
with GALA, starting GALA
as an individual artist,

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:27.220
and then the relationship
to community and language,

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.320
the issues of language
and how you relate to some

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.770
of the questions that addressed?

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.110
&gt;&gt; So, so, similar that actually
[inaudible] I was looking

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:41.140
at them we were thinking,
what way we different?

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:44.040
Because we are some way different.

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:47.750
But we have exactly the
same background, exactly.

00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:56.560
I was listen to Rene about his
dreams about what he wanted to do.

00:21:56.560 --> 00:22:03.170
The fact that he wanted to do in
Spanish the I was listen to --

00:22:03.170 --> 00:22:04.470
&gt;&gt; Miriam.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:09.660
&gt;&gt; -- Miriam about trying
to go out, take the theatre

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.020
out of the inside theatre.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:19.170
And there so things that that's
exactly what we were doing.

00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:20.880
The same thing with the language.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.850
This kind of decision and security
about doing it in Spanish only

00:22:26.850 --> 00:22:32.850
or in English to whom we
talk to in terms of audience.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.830
What is our audience?

00:22:34.830 --> 00:22:40.070
And then when I saw
really our difference

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.420
in the question of the audience.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:48.230
I think that GALA, first of all,
GALA is the abbreviation for Group

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:52.140
of Artistas from Latin American.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:53.510
That's why it's GALA.

00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:58.520
Isn't that a wonderful place
to dance or [inaudible].

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.450
But yes, it's a group of
Latin American artists,

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:07.730
which is a conduction of
many, many different nations.

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:12.090
Many different type of artists.

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.680
And they don't have the unity,

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:21.020
identity as these people
that we saw tonight.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:26.050
As the Caribbean group, as the
Nuyoricans as the Chicanos,

00:23:26.050 --> 00:23:30.020
which are not here but you
know it's another big group.

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:32.750
As the Cuban American in Miami.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:38.890
So we are so heterogeneous
so diverse that from

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:41.890
in one side is wonderful
because it's very rich.

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:46.360
It's very, very much
culture in many ways.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:52.270
But at same time we don't have that
type of unity, that type of focus

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.450
on who are we referring to.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:58.870
It's too general being
Latin American.

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.670
Now it is.

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:05.760
So it is very difficult
at every level.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.710
At the level of the administration.

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:10.800
At the level of development.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.070
At the level of creating a
company, maintaining a company.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:19.300
At the level of choosing
the season every season.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:22.410
To whom we put this play.

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:28.310 position:56%
Is the play exciting for some sector
of our audience because we have

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.140
to divide our audience in sectors.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.720
You know, we are referring
to Anglos.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:36.430
And we're referring
to Latino Americanos.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:39.690
And we're referring
to Hispanic Americans.

00:24:39.690 --> 00:24:42.880
So it is -- it is a very difficult.

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.690
And in that sense we're
different [inaudible].

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:50.180
But in terms of experience
in terms of the past,

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:54.930
we have the same experience
starting from zero.

00:24:54.930 --> 00:25:00.540
Trying to create a
company, training a company,

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:04.590
you'd be part of that
whole process too.

00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:06.650
So and stage too [inaudible].

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:13.200
But yeah, that is.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.040
That is what [inaudible].

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.470
&gt;&gt; I was also struck by the point

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:22.270
that as pioneers [inaudible] same
way I think is their committed

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.910
to the next generation of artists.

00:25:24.910 --> 00:25:26.210
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:27.510 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And the importance that it wasn't

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:29.460
about just creating an
institution for the sake of vanity.

00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:33.030
But the importance of willing to
the creative process and how much

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:36.100
of their efforts has been
about commissioning work,

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.710
whether it's for their own
companies or their own ensembles

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:42.020
or commissioning artists
or now trying

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:45.240
to support a particular
artist like [inaudible].

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:53.540
But that is really important to
them, the next generation I think.

00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:59.110
&gt;&gt; I think that when you look
at how many young Latinos

00:25:59.110 --> 00:26:03.570 position:56%
in this country don't speak Spanish,
it's really important that you look

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:07.290
at theatre from a broader
perspective because you don't want

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.530
to lose your identify
and your culture.

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:11.520
But yet you have to think about,

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.350
which is what Lynn
did so brilliantly.

00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:18.060
I think that Miriam, Max, and
Rene and Hugo and so many pioneers

00:26:18.060 --> 00:26:21.460
who start these companies
from the ground up.

00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:25.840
And then you have some
of the younger generation

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:32.210
like Lin-Manuel say, you know,
they reap the rewards, you know.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:35.730
I think it was -- it was
the idea that every one

00:26:35.730 --> 00:26:39.110
of those companies would launch
a show to Broadway in terms

00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:41.770
of a musical and all of
those kinds of ideas.

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.450
But it was a struggle,
and it was hard.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.980
And I think that when you have
somebody like Lin-Manuel say well

00:26:47.980 --> 00:26:52.510
to identify how to tell the story
about our people not in the sense

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:56.350
of West Side Story, but in the
sense of community and the sense

00:26:56.350 --> 00:27:01.690
about family and love and culture
that embraces our communities.

00:27:01.690 --> 00:27:05.240
I think that's what made that show
so brilliant is that he was able

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:09.450
to capture that with the language
and the bilingually in the music

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:11.880 position:56%
and the songs as well as the script.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:16.940
And I think it was told from a
perspective of family and unity.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:21.140
And so I think that show really
is a milestone in our community.

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:22.640
And I'm not saying it just

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:26.080
because I'm a musical theatre
director and specialist.

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:29.350 position:56%
I think that it really did something
really special to our community

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.800
in terms of telling a story
that was about family.

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:38.280
It wasn't about what we
do in terms of violence

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:40.970
or stereotyping or
all of the things.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.060
And I think that that's
slowly changing.

00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:47.140
But I think it's a broader
conversation from the fact

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:51.440
that often we're not included
at the table in the industry.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:56.330
I think that many times
that we are left out and not

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:59.430
because they don't understand
where we're coming from

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.200
or sometimes I don't
believe it's intentional.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.120
I just don't think they
know how to include us.

00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:12.030
And so when I see film and I see TV
shows continuously and the omission

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:15.390
of our people sometimes,
it really --

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:21.070
and there's an attempt for
that to happen, it's still not

00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:23.710
where it should be at this
point because of the fact

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:28.240
that we represent such a
large geographic community,

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.900
and we are a great influence
financially to this country.

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:35.630
&gt;&gt; At the same time,
though, what is similar,

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:40.160 position:56%
I think about all these individuals
Hugo [inaudible] is they didn't wait

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.100
for somebody to invite
them to the table.

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:43.400
&gt;&gt; No.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.700
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.500
&gt;&gt; They didn't wait for somebody
to invite them to the table.

00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:47.800
[inaudible] they decided.

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:50.750
They saw a need, and
then they addressed it.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:52.050
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:28:52.050 --> 00:28:53.650
&gt;&gt; Because if you think of their
history, their history's almost

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.560
as old as the original
theatre movement.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.860
&gt;&gt; Completely.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.230
&gt;&gt; But the perception of that
theatre, of these theatres

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.260
and the two is very different.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:03.560
&gt;&gt; Very.

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:04.970
&gt;&gt; Because they're not
necessarily at the table.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:08.990
But it's not because they -- but
they didn't wait to be invited.

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:13.260
And I think that that's a
lesson that we can't forget.

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:14.560
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.590
&gt;&gt; One of the things you pointed
out, I think, is quite right,

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:20.060
which is instantly, as soon as they
had established these institutions,

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:25.720
they also understood the need for
perpetuation and for continuity.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:28.670
And so the training units
were instituted very early on.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:30.720
The playwrights units
were instituted very early

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:37.180
on in recognition of the embattled
nature of any theatre that is,

00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:39.010
you know, that's not
mainstream theatre.

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:41.390
And so that's one of the
things they've done very,

00:29:41.390 --> 00:29:42.690
very successfully.

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:46.410
Now obviously there's been
several people who've emerged

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:48.470
who are now big names.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:51.400
But just to keep workshops going.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.410
To keep playwrights writing.

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:58.470
To just kind of spread that
sensibility in a way that's kind

00:29:58.470 --> 00:30:02.910
of immeasurable is, I think,
an enormous achievement,

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:04.230
you know, apart from that.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:06.750
So when they ask what's next,

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.640
they really were very
much the generators,

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.230
the progenitors of
what's coming next.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:16.270
It's not something --
it's not an idle question.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.310
It's really kind of, you know,
it's a hand over in some ways.

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:22.000
And for us, you know, yeah --

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.830
for us, we also felt that we were
just able to get them at the moment

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:32.180
at which they -- there was a
certain maturity [inaudible]

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:34.470
to these institutions,
but they were ready

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:37.390
to think about handing it over.

00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.750
You know, I mean these institutions
are all so very connected

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:43.460
to strong personalities
as they have to be.

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:46.380
And you know, so it's very,
very difficult, obviously,

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.790 position:56%
to then find a successor, to find --

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:52.330
figure out how the
institution might go on.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:56.130
And -- but that thinking had
exactly started to happen.

00:30:56.130 --> 00:31:01.120
And so that's I think why the
question immediately sort of stood

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.510
in the room as we served
the dinner, so to speak.

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:07.380
Tell us everything you've done.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.110
But also tell us where
it's going, you know.

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:12.210
And that -- they were
ready to do that.

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:16.720
&gt;&gt; And I think that Puerto Rico
[inaudible] is already matched

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.020
with another group.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.320
&gt;&gt; It is [inaudible].

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.620
&gt;&gt; Which is fantastic.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:21.920
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they have a co --
they're co-producing now.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.220
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.520
So I think that's the --

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:28.880
&gt;&gt; That's what I was
going to ask you, Tony,

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.420
can you give us up
to date since then?

00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:35.680
Because it's been a few years.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.540
&gt;&gt; Well, Miriam, what happened is
that Miriam was trying to figure

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:43.510
out a way how to pass
the theatre on.

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:45.760
And she wanted to stay
very much a figurehead

00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.440
because she still is very
important to the theatre,

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.290
the Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre.

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.480
So she Rosada [phonetic] and
her had established a very

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.780
strong relationship.

00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.300
And so I think the idea was
that Rosada would be the person

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:04.080
that would run these two theatres,
and Miriam as a figurehead.

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.720
So but Rosada is the one
that's really running those two

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:10.040
institutions both Playwanas
[phonetic]

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.450
and the Puerto Rican
Traveling Theatre

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.670
and the programming that's
going on in these two theatres.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.670
Rene is not involved anymore
in any of this decision making

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.900
because he's been quite ill.

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:26.190
And Max is having quite
a nice career in Miami,

00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:28.310
you know, teaching and directing.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:30.710
So he continues to do his work.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:35.930
But I think that Lou Merana
[phonetic] is now running Intar.

00:32:35.930 --> 00:32:38.100
And he's the new artistic director.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.490
And he's also operating out of
a very small theatre because,

00:32:41.490 --> 00:32:44.070
you know, Intar was on
Theatre Row for many years.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:46.520
And they had a beautiful,
beautiful facility.

00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:51.500
And they basically promised to
give it back and they never did.

00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.740
And so they ended up back
in a very, very tiny space

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.650 position:56%
on the Upper West Side where they're
still continuing to do theatre.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.840
But again, with very limited
funds in hoping that somebody

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.210
that the city is going to
grant them a new space.

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:10.180 position:56%
So it's -- I think that what we done

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:16.570
in some ways is just brought
these theatres to a platform

00:33:16.570 --> 00:33:24.040
so that everybody is aware of what
they struggle to do and just like,

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.430
you know, Hugo has done, there's
so many people that have done

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:32.950
such amazing work in our
community to tell these stories

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.650
and develop these wonderful
young playwrights.

00:33:35.650 --> 00:33:39.990
And so the idea was just to
not let them be forgotten

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.290
because it would have been.

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:46.810
&gt;&gt; So I was going to ask you, how
do you hope that this film is used

00:33:46.810 --> 00:33:50.060
to keep telling that story?

00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.980
&gt;&gt; I think one of the
things we're --

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:55.750
&gt;&gt; Because particularly I think the
importance of it is now you have,

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.790
like, scholarly material or
material that scholars can use.

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.090
&gt;&gt; Correct.

00:34:00.090 --> 00:34:01.390
&gt;&gt; Can refer to.

00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:04.540
&gt;&gt; Right. And I think that's what
we want to do is that we want to go

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:09.620
into the different film festivals
and continue to screen it.

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:14.950 position:56%
And then we've already gotten
offers to show it on PBS in Florida.

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:19.330
And so that's why we had
to cut down to 57 minutes

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:23.010
because it had to be
to that standard.

00:34:23.010 --> 00:34:27.120
And then hope is that eventually
that this documentary is shown

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.410
at every theatre appreciation
and theatre history class

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:35.120
across the country so that it is
a part of the curriculum of much

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:37.500
of the theatre history
classes, so that --

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:40.380
because one of our
colleagues Charlie Mitchell

00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:45.120
who teaches these classes,
Theatre Appreciation, says please,

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.330
I can't wait until you're
able to let us use this film

00:34:48.330 --> 00:34:51.640
because there's nothing
that I can use in my class

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.740
at this point to talk about this.

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:56.460
&gt;&gt; He actually reads several
of the plays with his students

00:34:56.460 --> 00:34:58.400
that are mentioned here, like
the Cuban Swimmer, and so forth.

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.930
So this would be a wonderful
sort of [inaudible] of that.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.700
Eventually, it's probably
going to --

00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:08.930
we'll have to find some way to make
it accessible through streaming

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:13.370
because that's really kind of
the next mode of distribution.

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:16.150
So we'll have to figure
out how to do that.

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:17.450
&gt;&gt; We have a website.

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:24.190
And we have, of course, a way for
people to kind of view the trailer.

00:35:24.190 --> 00:35:29.490 position:56%
And eventually, my hope is that it's
available for everybody to see it.

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:33.560
And with the amazing technology
that we have today, I don't --

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:37.140
this was not about money or
making money or anything like that

00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:38.720
for any of us, God knows.

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.170
It was really about
sharing the story.

00:35:42.170 --> 00:35:46.290
So for me, if everybody can
see this, and if it's available

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:50.470
on YouTube or wherever
it is that other scholars

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.020
and students can see this.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:57.060
Then I think it's worth doing
what we did because it's not --

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:59.360
it's really about sharing
the stories.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.660
&gt;&gt; Latino playwrights too.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.120
&gt;&gt; And Latino playwrights, yes.

00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:04.370
&gt;&gt; Before we open it
up to the audience,

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.780
I want to touch on
a couple of things.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:09.770
And that is -- or maybe Hugo
and Rebecca you might want

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.690
to chat add something
to about the context.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:16.510 position:56%
Because there was a context of these
theatres at this particular time

00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:19.800
when they were being formed in
the '60s and '70s [inaudible].

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:23.380
Can you talk about what the
times were [inaudible] time?

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.700
And also because I just happen to
know that Anna Steal's [phonetic]

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.480
in the audience who's with the
National Endowment for the Arts,

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:31.330
and they had a program there
which was called Expansion Arts.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:35.870
It was really important to the
birth of these theatres here.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:37.350
So I think that, you know,

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:40.360
understanding that context
I think is important.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:44.600
&gt;&gt; Well, I think that we founded
the theatre in the middle --

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.990
very particular time
in Washington D.C.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:55.550
Because there were very particular
audience composed of basically,

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:59.700
I mean, audience, community,
Latino community in Washington,

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:07.150
who was really conform
of many people immigrants

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:12.520
from different countries
and their dictatorship.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:18.440
So there were people with a very
high grade of education, doctors,

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:26.510
actors, professionals who had
to leave the country desperately

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:30.920
to another city and basically
Washington D.C. because many

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:33.900 position:56%
of them were involved also in trying

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:37.910
to change what was going
on in Latin America.

00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:44.020
So there was a very particular
audience, very well-educated

00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:49.630
that needed a kind of space
where they could find out,

00:37:49.630 --> 00:37:52.920
where they could enjoy
their own culture.

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:56.280
And we did plays and
we cannot afford to do

00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:02.320
that because they were very
political, very sociopolitical.

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.110
They were written.

00:38:04.110 --> 00:38:10.890
They were as they say in
the movie place and we broke

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:16.430
from Latin America, which
has a very European kind

00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:18.550
of literature and theatre.

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:22.850 position:56%
That never was done in Washington
D.C. I mean, at the time we were one

00:38:22.850 --> 00:38:26.870
of the four most avant-garde
theatres when we started.

00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:28.340
We didn't know that.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:35.250
But of course less
the American audience.

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:43.230
So it is as they say, it is a
question of doing what you need

00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.010
to do what your guts tell you.

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:49.820
And to that people who need it.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.440
As you said we never thought
about the table or whatever.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.920
We really wanted to create
this because of the need of it.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.110
Not only the audience, our
community, but also ourselves,

00:39:01.110 --> 00:39:04.120
this group of artists
from Latin America.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:05.500
&gt;&gt; I want to open it up
to the audience to see

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.800
if there are any questions.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.100
Right here.

00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:09.400
&gt;&gt; Yes. Thank you for doing this.

00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:13.100
I think it's great, and it's
great to teach future generations.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:16.770
But I was wondering, you know,
I've been thinking about the idea

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:21.540
of language and identity.

00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:27.090
And to see the generations that
are being born here of immigrants,

00:39:27.090 --> 00:39:31.390
unfortunately some of them
are losing the Spanish.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:33.130
They're not bilingual.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:35.880
They don't know, some of them
have never been to the countries

00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.770
where there parents came from.

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:42.590
So looking down the road,
what do you see the future

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:47.670
of Hispanic theatre is given that
there's this generation of kids

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:53.430
who don't necessarily have
that emotional and cultural tie

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:54.830
to language and identity?

00:39:54.830 --> 00:39:57.950
What is the future
shaping up as you look

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:01.260
at both playwrights
and your audiences?

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:03.020
&gt;&gt; Tony, you go.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.610
&gt;&gt; I think it's a brilliant
question.

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:08.230
I wish I had a way to
look into the crystal ball

00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:09.580
to look into the future.

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.300
But I think that we're dealing
just in you know the amount of time

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.250
that I've been teaching,
which is over 20 years.

00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:20.840
We've see a change in the
way young people think.

00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:25.460
And so to look ten years down
the line or even five years

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:27.560
down the line with this
technology and the fact

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.860
that they're completely hooked

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:33.850
to a black screen 24/7
and cannot leave it.

00:40:33.850 --> 00:40:36.280
That's challenge in and of itself.

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.090
Because they are multitaskers
of so many things

00:40:39.090 --> 00:40:41.490
but cannot keep their mind on one.

00:40:41.490 --> 00:40:44.000
And theatre is so much about focus.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.730
And it's so much about clarity.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:47.560
And it's so much about
collaboration.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.750
It's not so much about this.

00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:53.240
But yet, it's important to
include that because if you don't,

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.710
you start losing that,
your young audience.

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:02.180
So I think it's a real challenge to
figure out how theatre can continue

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.890
to develop, bring young people
in, and especially Latinos

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:08.550
so that stories that
they can understand.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:11.120
I mean, there's the show right
now called Jane the Virgin

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.420
that everybody is watching

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.290
on television right now,
which I think is great.

00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:17.310
And young people are watching it

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.730
because they can relate
to some of the stories.

00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:23.760
So I think it's about trying to
figure out ways to create stories

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.270
that young people want to
come to the theatre to see.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:30.990
And yet, preserving some of the
culture and some of the classics

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:34.120
because we don't want
to forget [inaudible]

00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:36.900
and all the great Spanish
playwrights

00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:38.690
or Latino playwrights
in this country.

00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:42.660
We want to -- so it's a
balance to try to figure

00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:46.290
out what it is they need
and how to address it

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:48.550
from a larger perspective.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.480
So I'll let Hugo.

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.030
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] I think
that we do know is just

00:41:53.030 --> 00:42:00.900 position:56%
with being cultivating the future
ideal Latino, which is a combination

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:06.620
of knowledge and experience of
their own culture [inaudible] going

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:14.340
to the countries, original
country from the families.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:20.030
Having a more or less understanding
of the language, possible,

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:24.290
completely understanding of the
language that would be idea.

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:30.620
And really conscious of
what their own culture is.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.570
I don't think it is already.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:38.450
That there is a real
conscious of being a Latino.

00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:45.680 position:56%
Because maybe I'm thinking like that
because of the subject I put before,

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:51.620
which is [inaudible]
community that we have here.

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:55.980
But yes, I believe that it's
going to be a future audience

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:01.570
and future Hispanic
authors that are going to be

00:43:01.570 --> 00:43:04.340
in the mainstream, definitely.

00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.060
&gt;&gt; But I will -- yes,
getting ready to close

00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:09.770
because we have a reception
waiting for you guys.

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:12.780
And I don't want to keep you
from the food and the drinks.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:16.820
But I will add -- our service
indicate at GALA that they want

00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.720 position:56%
to see the plays in Spanish, but
they want to receive the information

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.780
about the plays in English.

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:24.640
So it's something for us that
we are constantly looking at.

00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.980 position:56%
Because they want to see the play in
the original language it was written

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:33.190
because of what they get from
it physically and visually.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:34.950
But they want it to technology.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:36.940
They want to get the
information in English.

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.220
&gt;&gt; I think one of the things
that [inaudible] currently is

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:44.150 position:56%
that they do the productions in
Spanish, and they have the earphones

00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:47.510
so they can translate the
production in English.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:51.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:52.370
&gt;&gt; And playwrights.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.670
The question not just to
audience to goes to the future

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.570
of Latino theatre who's
writing them.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:59.100 position:56%
And what I think we're seeing with a
lot of Hispanic American playwrights

00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:01.470
as well including [inaudible]
who came to GALA.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:02.770
We did his show in English.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:07.290
And then afterwards he said, I
wish I had written it in Spanish.

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.580
So there's an awareness
among those playwrights

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.520
who are all the second generation.

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.820
What am I missing?

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.120
I'm still that being.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.420
I still think.

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:19.070
The difficulty is, who's going
to produce them in Spanish.

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:22.460 position:56%
They get to a level where they
don't want to be produced, you know,

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:26.720
at GALA because you know they
want bigger and they need bigger.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.710
And there should be more
companies who produce them,

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.650 position:56%
but they have to do them in English.

00:44:31.650 --> 00:44:34.790
And that's a question of
not having expansion arts,

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:37.940
not having enough endowment money,
not having enough stake money,

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:39.740
not have enough attention.

00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:41.240
It goes in 30-year cycles.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.210
When we started, we got a six --

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.410
you know, Miss Manners gave
us a six-column headline

00:44:47.410 --> 00:44:51.010
for a show [foreign language] that
nobody even knew because it was in.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.310
Because Spanish was in.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:53.610
Bilingualism was in.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.410
You had to speak Spanish in school.

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:59.150
You took it 30 years ago, right?

00:44:59.150 --> 00:45:00.450
Now it wasn't [inaudible].

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:04.400
So I think it's going
to come around.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.780
I think as fashion does.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:10.310
&gt;&gt; I think there are authors
like [inaudible] Washington D.C.

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:14.280
That they really have
been successful

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:17.390
in Spanish and an English.

00:45:17.390 --> 00:45:19.880
And Karen [phonetic]
[inaudible] writes in English

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.580
but immediately she does
translations of her own things.

00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:29.850
&gt;&gt; Karen just [inaudible] opened
there in season and did [phonetic]

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:33.010
at GALA last season
in Spanish, last fall.

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:34.310
I want to thank you all.

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:37.510
I want to thank our
guests and our panelists.

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:43.460
[ Applause ]

00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.460
I want to acknowledge again
the Library of Congress,

00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.770
the Librarian of Congress, and
the interim Librarian of Congress

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:51.490
and the association here
[inaudible] putting this on.

00:45:51.490 --> 00:45:55.020
It's been of great
benefit to the community.

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.820
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:01.240

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.900

of the Library of Congress.
