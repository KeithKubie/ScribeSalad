UTTAM TRIPATHI:
Hello, and welcome

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.437
to the new, exciting show of
GDL that we're recording out

00:00:11.437 --> 00:00:12.270
of the India studio.

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.110
With me, I have today
is Anirudh Dewani,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.860
who is the DPE developer
program engineer on the Android

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.990
developer relations team.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.700
He has worked with Indian
developers for many years,

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.102
so I think he's
an expert to talk

00:00:25.102 --> 00:00:27.060
about what Indian developers
have been building

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.740
and what are some of
the advice that he has.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.660
So welcome, Anirudh,
to our show today.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.910
ANIRUDH DEWANI: Thanks, Uttam.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.420
It's great to be back in India
and to be joining you guys.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.253
UTTAM TRIPATHI: It's a
pleasure to have you.

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.682
So before we get started,
Anirudh, talk a little bit more

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:41.140
about the kind of
Indian developers

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.990
you have worked with,
the kind of partners,

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.640
and what do you see is a common
trend emerging out of India.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.500
ANIRUDH DEWANI: So
when I was in India,

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.240
and I was for the
last three years--

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.206
I just recently moved
to New York this year.

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:53.580
So when I was in
India, we worked

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.430
with a lot of top media
companies, news companies,

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.820
and a lot of the big,
big, big partners.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.770
And we also interacted
a lot with the community

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.450
and developers who are
independent and building

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.860
some amazing apps with
some innovative stuff,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.969
a lot of startups.

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:09.510
So we worked with
the entire spectrum

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.664
of developers and content
generators here in India.

00:01:12.664 --> 00:01:13.580
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Great.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.790
So let me start with this.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.560
What do you think is one common
mistake that you see developers

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.170
from this part of the
world, from our region,

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.504
make when they build an
app and put it out there.

00:01:23.504 --> 00:01:25.420
ANIRUDH DEWANI: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.890
So what I noticed was that
the apps that were coming out

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.240
of India were really
feature heavy.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.120
I mean they would try to do
a lot of things, wherein they

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.550
could instead concentrate
on a smaller feature set

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.150
and maybe do it in a better
way, providing fuller,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.130
complete experience
to the user, focusing

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.880
on more important stuff like
UX and navigation and all

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.580
those things.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.310
So instead of
making cluttered UIs

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.340
and packing in a lot
of functionality,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.210
remember it's a mobile device.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.180
The real estate is limited,
the use is limited,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.490
and you have to take
care of touch targets

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.690
and provide appropriate spacing.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.440
So instead of making it
feature heavy and cluttered,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.594
just focus on a lesser number of
things and make them beautiful.

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:07.510
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Great.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.970
A question that we
get-- a common request

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.810
we get from developers-- how can
we get featured on Play Store,

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.940
what does it take
to get featured?

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.690
So what would you say
are the top three or five

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.160
things that the teams look
when they are deciding

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.980
on getting an app
featured on Play Store?

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.060
ANIRUDH DEWANI: In general,
the experience for the user

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.810
should be amazing.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.310
So when you start with that
mentality, you would do well.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.950
So that includes building the
right UX, following the patents

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.450
and guidelines that are
published by the Android team.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.110
And there are plenty
of those to make

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.790
your app consistent
with the other apps

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.680
and the system UI itself.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.560
We regularly update
our guidelines across

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.190
whenever there are
new version releases

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.850
and there are new
things coming up.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.310
So I would say navigation,
interaction design, UX,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.220
and support for all
sorts of devices.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.880
Support for tablets
is important.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.840
Making no assumptions
on user behavior.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.700
There are some developers
who release their app

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.820
with just a portrait or
a landscape orientation,

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.084
thinking this is how a
user would use my app.

00:03:14.084 --> 00:03:16.000
But there are users who
have different habits.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.120
So taking care of these
things are important,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.050
and they really go a long
way in bringing good reviews

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.234
to your apps.

00:03:23.234 --> 00:03:24.150
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Great.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.570
How important would you say
is focusing on tablet apps,

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.020
or making sure that you have
a tablet version of your app?

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.520
How important would
you say is that?

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.430
ANIRUDH DEWANI: So
really, there are

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.510
a lot of large screen
devices that are coming.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.170
And it's important for users
to experience your apps

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.940
on these devices.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.720
I myself am a heavy
user of a tablet,

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.594
and I look forward to access
my favorite apps on the tablet.

00:03:46.594 --> 00:03:48.635
And there are a lot of
tablets in the market that

00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:49.490
are there now.

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:52.560
So it's really important now
to focus on tablets as well.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.830
During your development
process, if you

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.760
get that thought
in early, that you

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.280
have to build a
tablet-friendly UI,

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.256
it's actually much easier
to achieve the goal.

00:04:04.256 --> 00:04:06.130
There are many developers
who start out with,

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.040
OK, I'm going to do
a phone UI, and maybe

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.635
after six months or one-year
period, I will do a tablet UI.

00:04:11.635 --> 00:04:13.759
That actually complicates
the development process.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.550
So if you have those
goals set in your mind

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.540
that my app should
run on all devices,

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.194
there are features of
it in the framework,

00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:21.610
like fragments,
that can help you,

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.690
can actually go a long way in
making it simpler and easier

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.920
to develop applications.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.520
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Great.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.890
I think that's great
feedback for the developers.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.650
So you talked about these
best practices and guidelines

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:33.780
that are documented.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.070
Where can developers
go and find them?

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.870
ANIRUDH DEWANI: So in
our developer site,

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.890
which is developer.android.com,
we have a section dedicated

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.190
to app quality, where we
enlist the core app quality

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.660
guidelines, which cover the
basic things that an app should

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.390
have.

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.970
That includes permissions and
policies and interaction design

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:53.890
and stuff like that.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.660
There are tablet-specific
guidelines available.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.760
And then there's
a section on how

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.670
to improve your app quality.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.040
So if you launch an app, and you
start getting some user reviews

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.510
and ratings, which say,
OK, this is crashing here,

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.560
or this is really
inaccessible, I

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.300
could not find this
feature in the app.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.290
How do you engage with the user,
with groups and communities,

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.430
and other things in
this one, user reviews,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.900
with reply to review features?

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.590
And so there is a whole
section dedicated to that.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.590
So we will have these published.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.220
And the other thing that we
have is there's a lot of content

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:34.950
that comes in forms of videos
on YouTube and posted on G+

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.230
by our engineers, the
members of my team.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.220
And there are videos that are
dedicated to helping you design

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.280
your apps really well and
performance tips and stuff

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:44.780
like that.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.970
So yeah, there's a lot
of content available.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:47.886
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Great.

00:05:47.886 --> 00:05:49.840
Yeah, so just get
all the guidelines,

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.810
the best practices on
developer.android.com,

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.475
follow the team on Google+.

00:05:53.475 --> 00:05:55.850
Also, I think you guys are
very active on Stack Overflow,

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.850
so these can be some
of the avenues-- some

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.540
of our developers can get
in touch with the team

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.740
and get the best practices.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.080
So finally, before we move to
the second part of our show,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.460
we will have you talk about
the latest things that

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.330
have come out with
the Android KitKat.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.540
What would be one
final advice, if you

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:17.720
are asked to give one advice
to developers in our region?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.360
How can they be
really successful?

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.151
What would be that?

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.139
ANIRUDH DEWANI:
Focus on the user.

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.930
And there are some
important considerations

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.430
when you're in an emerging
market like India,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.320
in terms of data
connectivity and stuff.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.430
So focus on those things,
make sure you do not

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.495
load heavy assets on lower end
devices, which are available

00:06:38.495 --> 00:06:39.830
and plenty in India.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.120
So taking care of that
stuff, making the user

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.630
experience really
wonderful, is--

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.230
and by following all the
guidelines that I mentioned

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:48.059
about-- is what you
should start with.

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:50.350
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Great, I
think that's a great feedback.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.080
And great advice for all the
developers in the region.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.970
So the second part
of the show, I

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:58.850
want you to talk about-- we
had the recent Android update,

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.640
the KitKat that came out,
and a lot of developers

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.900
have already been using it
and playing around with it.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.608
But if you can talk
about some of the key

00:07:05.608 --> 00:07:08.020
highlights that
the team rolled out

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.770
as part of the
latest release, that

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:11.864
would be really useful
for our developers.

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:12.780
ANIRUDH DEWANI: Right.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.880
So we've always had this
theme with Jelly Bean,

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.740
about their UI as what we said.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.330
So with KitKat, the
focus was really

00:07:19.330 --> 00:07:24.980
on creating an operating system
and a framework for apps, which

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.980
would chart a really
low memory footprint

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.090
and making it run on
lower end devices.

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:32.600
I think the number published,
we said, is 512 MB of RAM,

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.510
is what KitKat should run on.

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.905
And that's especially
relevant for, again,

00:07:37.905 --> 00:07:39.280
in an emerging
market like India,

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.700
right, so this was a
really important project.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.000
There was a lot of
engineers working

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.940
towards making
the footprint low.

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.690
And so we've enabled some
APIs also for developers.

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.780
There's an API where
you can find out

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:55.491
if your app is running
on a low RAM device,

00:07:55.491 --> 00:07:56.990
and then you can
adjust accordingly,

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:00.909
adapt your application
to lower specs.

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:01.950
So this was a big effort.

00:08:01.950 --> 00:08:04.590
There are some tools that
came out of it, like procstats

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.472
for helping you
analyze process memory.

00:08:07.472 --> 00:08:08.930
Apart from that,
there were a bunch

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.190
of features that came out.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.570
There's the host card emulation
for payments and gateways

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.560
and a lot of programs,
which can help

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.730
you make NFC-based
secure payments.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.410
We rolled out a completely
new print framework,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.430
which can allow you to print
your content over Wi-Fi

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:28.120
or cloud services like
Google Cloud Print.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:31.050
It can also help
printer manufacturers

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.929
to write their own
pluggable modules, which

00:08:33.929 --> 00:08:37.559
can enable you to interact
with special printers

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:40.120
that they may come out with.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.159
There was a lot of improvement
in the media platform,

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:51.120
starting with support for DASH
and captioning and adaptive

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.650
playback.

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:55.340
Apart from that, we rolled
out the new storage access

00:08:55.340 --> 00:09:00.710
framework, which would help
apps to retrieve documents

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:04.760
from their preferred document
provider, maybe Box or Google

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.830
Drive or whatever it is.

00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:09.220
It's a common UI,
a consistent UI.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.900
And then there were
a lot of features,

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:14.340
other features of two new
profiles added to Bluetooth,

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:18.870
and a new hardware batch
and framework for sensors,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:22.250
which reduces your power
consumption on the device,

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:25.386
support for captioning in
the accessibility section.

00:09:25.386 --> 00:09:26.760
Yeah, a lot of
features came out,

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.890
and these are all detailed
on our developer site again.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:29.230
UTTAM TRIPATHI: Great.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:30.870
Yeah, it sounds like a
lot of exciting stuff

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.210
that the team came out with.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:34.870
So with that, this is the
wrap for today's show.

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.930
I'm sure you guys would follow
some of the advice and best

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:40.647
practices that Anirudh had
to talk to you guys about.

00:09:40.647 --> 00:09:42.480
Also, the latest things
that were rolled out

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.440
as part of the Android
KitKat release.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.900
I'm sure that you guys
are already working on it.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.930
We can't wait to hear more
about what you guys are working,

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.800
so do get in touch with us on
Google+ and some of the other

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.397
channels that Anirudh
mentioned here.

00:09:54.397 --> 00:09:56.730
And we would like to learn
what you guys are working on,

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.840
and our goal is
to make developers

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.250
successful in the region.

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.700
So with that, it's a
wrap for today's show.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:06.570
Thanks once again for joining
in, and I'll see you guys soon.
