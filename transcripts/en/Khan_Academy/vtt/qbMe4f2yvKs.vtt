00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:06.719
Let's see if we can write
12.98 as a mixed number.

00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:08.760
So the first thing you
might want to realize here

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.287
is that this is the exact
same thing as 12 plus 0.98.

00:00:14.287 --> 00:00:16.120
And this simplifies it,
because then we just

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.840
have to write it as 12, and
to some fraction, that's

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.870
the same thing as 0.98.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.220
So if we could write
0.98 as a fraction,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.829
then we're almost done.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.120
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.332
So this 9 right over here
is in the tenths place.

00:00:31.332 --> 00:00:32.540
I'll just write it like that.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.910
Tenths place.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.040
And this right over here
is in the hundredths place.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.730
So you could view 0.98
two different ways.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.910
You could view it as 9/10.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.000
That's this part
right over here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.729
9/10 plus 8/100.

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:55.770
And if you want to find
a common denominator that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:04.620
would be the same thing as
90 over 100 plus 8 over 100,

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:11.080
which is equal to 98 over 100.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.649
And so 0.98 is 98/100.

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:16.690
And another way you could
have said that is look,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.230
the space right over here
is in the hundredths place,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.050
and so this is 98/100 or 98/100.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.020
So you could have skipped
this right over here.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.145
So if we just wanted to
write it as a mixed number,

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:29.360
we could just write
it as 12 and, instead

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.440
of 0.98, 12 and 98/100.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.310
Now we haven't reduced
this to lowest terms yet.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.140
So let's see if we
can simplify this.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.600
98 is divisible by
2, and so is 100.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.780
So let's divide
both of them by 2.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.310
They have that common factor.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.570
So we're going to divide
both of them by 2.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.090
And so this is the same thing as
12, and 98 divided by 2 is 49.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.856
100 divided by 2 is 50.

00:01:55.856 --> 00:01:57.730
And I think that's about
as far as we can do.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.950
49 factors, it's divisible
by 7, but 50 isn't, so we've

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.690
put it in lowest terms.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.449
So 12.98 can be written as a
mixed number, 12 and 49/50.
