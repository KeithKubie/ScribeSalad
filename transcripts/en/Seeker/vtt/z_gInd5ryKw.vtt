00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.080
NASA has observed a nearby supermassive black
hole “burping,” which has lead to new

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.080
insights.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.960
Namely, that black holes make terrible dinner
guests.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.000
Hello earthlings, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.330
On January 5th, 2016 NASA announced that its
Chandra X-ray Observatory has discovered something

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.330
quite peculiar.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.380
26 million light years away, or what astronomers
call “nearby,” the supermassive black

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.480
hole anchoring the galaxy NGC 5195 has spewed
out two huge bursts of energy.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.270
Lead author of the study Eric Schlegel of
the University of Texas said that if black

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.220
holes can be described as eating nearby stars
and gas, then this is analogous to a burp.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.390
NGC 5195 is colliding with a much larger galaxy
called NGC 5194, better known as the Whirlpool

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.640
galaxy, because, well, look at it.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.660
It’s possible the x-ray arcs were caused
when matter was gravitationally catapulted

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.050
as the galaxies collided, but Schlegel rejects
this idea.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.440
Instead astronomers think this 'burping' black
hole gorged itself on the Whirlpool galaxy's

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.730
dust, and the infalling matter had so much
energy it caused waves of X-Rays to "burp"

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:08.730
out into space.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, I know what you’re thinking.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.760
If there’s one thing everybody knows about
black holes, it’s that nothing gets out.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.320
If there’s one thing that smart alecs know
about black holes it’s that only Hawking

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.650
radiation gets out.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.780
So was the black hole somehow giving something
back?

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.780
Not really.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.930
What's happening here is the matter outside
the Schwarzschild radius -- or the point of

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.640
no return -- is heating up from the galaxies
colliding which is causing this blasting off

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.640
of x-rays.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.530
In fact some of the brightest objects in the
universe are the areas surrounding supermassive

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.330
black holes called quasars.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.190
The bursts from NGC 5195 are different though
because they’re two distinct waves that

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.120
were shot off 3 million and 6 million years
ago.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.630
Interestingly, optical telescopes found these
waves of X-rays have formed thin lines of

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.090
hydrogen gas at their leading edges, like
a snow plow or broom.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.530
It’s this line of gas and dust that definitively
shows the x-rays are traveling away from the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.570
black hole, not falling into it.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.340
Some areas have pockets of HII, a hydrogen
ion… commonly seen as a sign that new stars

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.259
are forming, so it’s possible this belching
process answers a longstanding question.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.260
Often the area around supermassive black holes
are lacking in star formation, so it’s possible

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.080
that this belch is a rarely glimpsed intermediate
stage where stars are forming but being pushed

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.780
away from the center of the galaxy.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.310
Schlegel says this may have been more common
in the early universe when galaxies were more

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.340
densely packed, but today it’s harder to
see examples of black hole feedback shaping

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.670
star formation.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.000
This "burping" black hole is close enough
to be observed clearly by Chandra, which took

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.450
11 looks at it between 2000 and 2012 to gather
this data.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.940
So these findings represent the work of 15
years, and the exact process for how this

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.550
release of energy happened is still unknown.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.180
Schlegel himself says more research is needed.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.410
Black holes are one of the all-time coolest
astronomical topics, and it’s fun to think

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.300
about what would happen if you fell into one.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.310
Did I say fun?

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.790
I meant horrifying.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.840
Anyway one of my first videos for DNews was
about just that and you can see it here.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:15.209
Do you feel like there are some stellar topics
(pun intended) we’re neglecting?
