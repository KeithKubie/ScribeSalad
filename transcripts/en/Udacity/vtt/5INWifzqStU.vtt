00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now that you know what a spanning tree is, I would like to introduce to you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the concept of a minimum spanning tree.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So a minimum spanning tree is still a spanning tree on a graph,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and in order to find a minimum spanning tree,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
you actually need to have a special kind of graph,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and that is one that looks just like the input for shortest tour.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And what I mean by that is that all of the edges

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
have a certain number assigned to them.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So in the case of shortest tour, those were distances,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
but it can be other values as well; that doesn't really matter.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The important thing is that each edge must have a certain value attached to it

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
such as in this one here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now what is a minimum spanning tree?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.500
Now, first of all, let's take any spanning tree for this graph here.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
So let's say we take this spanning tree.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.000
And what you can do if you have a graph like this where you have numbers

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
attached to the edges is, for each spanning tree, you can sum up those numbers.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So here we have 2+4+3+2+3+6, and the sum of that is 20.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And so what you say is that this spanning tree here has a weight of 20.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now if you choose another spanning tree--for example, this one here--

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that spanning tree will have a weight of 3+4+3+2+3+6, which is a total weight of 21.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And now you can almost guess what a minimum spanning tree will be.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
A minimum spanning tree is the spanning tree for the graph

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
for which this total weight--the sum of all of the edge numbers--

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
is the smallest possible one.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.500
A graph can have more than one minimum spanning tree,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.000
but every minimum spanning tree has to have the property that

00:01:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
the sum of the edges is as low as possible.
