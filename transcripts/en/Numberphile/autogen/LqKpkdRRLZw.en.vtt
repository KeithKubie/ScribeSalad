what do you think this is I mean I look

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870
what do you think this is I mean I look
 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.530
what do you think this is I mean I look
like maybe seaweed or it definitely

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540
like maybe seaweed or it definitely
 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.360
like maybe seaweed or it definitely
looks like something from the sea like a

looks like something from the sea like a
 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.280
looks like something from the sea like a
okay well it's interesting mathematical

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290
okay well it's interesting mathematical
 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.959
okay well it's interesting mathematical
seaweed and I can explain exactly how we

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
seaweed and I can explain exactly how we
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.940
seaweed and I can explain exactly how we
made that image because to me that image

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
made that image because to me that image
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.890
made that image because to me that image
is one of the most mind-blowing pictures

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900
is one of the most mind-blowing pictures
 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.230

refresher with a take a number and we

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290
refresher with a take a number and we
 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.360
refresher with a take a number and we
can do two things to this number

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:42.370
can do two things to this number
 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.979
can do two things to this number
depending on its parity that's why

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989
depending on its parity that's why
 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.670
depending on its parity that's why
there's others even if it's even we're

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680
there's others even if it's even we're
 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.110
there's others even if it's even we're
going to divide by two and if it's odd

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120
going to divide by two and if it's odd
 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.910
going to divide by two and if it's odd
we're going to multiply by three so

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920
we're going to multiply by three so
 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.329
we're going to multiply by three so
triple it and add one which we're going

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:57.339
triple it and add one which we're going
 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.799
triple it and add one which we're going
to make it even which will then make it

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809
to make it even which will then make it
 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.810
to make it even which will then make it
even and then we know we do believe in

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820
even and then we know we do believe in
 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.369
even and then we know we do believe in
numbers that we divide them by two let's

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379
numbers that we divide them by two let's
 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.760
numbers that we divide them by two let's
say start with say 13 so 13 is odd so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770
say start with say 13 so 13 is odd so
 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.830
say start with say 13 so 13 is odd so
multiplied by three and add one so 13

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840
multiplied by three and add one so 13
 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.300
multiplied by three and add one so 13
will go to 39 or on 40 goes to 40 okay

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310
will go to 39 or on 40 goes to 40 okay
 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.460
will go to 39 or on 40 goes to 40 okay
even they divide that by 2 goes to 20

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470
even they divide that by 2 goes to 20
 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.410
even they divide that by 2 goes to 20
okay we divide that by 2 goes to 10

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420
okay we divide that by 2 goes to 10
 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.370
okay we divide that by 2 goes to 10
again divided by 2 goes to 5 odd

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380
again divided by 2 goes to 5 odd
 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.219
again divided by 2 goes to 5 odd
multiplied by 3 15 add 1 16 they go 16

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229
multiplied by 3 15 add 1 16 they go 16
 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.859
multiplied by 3 15 add 1 16 they go 16
and then look 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1 the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
and then look 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1 the
 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.270
and then look 16 - 8 - 4 - 2 - 1 the
conjecture made by Collett is that every

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280
conjecture made by Collett is that every
 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.249
conjecture made by Collett is that every
number that you choose is eventually

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259
number that you choose is eventually
 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.010
number that you choose is eventually
going to go down to number 2 1 so some

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020
going to go down to number 2 1 so some
 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.090
going to go down to number 2 1 so some
of them are going to go all over the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100
of them are going to go all over the
 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.310
of them are going to go all over the
place but eventually everything's going

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320
place but eventually everything's going
 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.219
place but eventually everything's going
to want as a conjecture which is think

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229
to want as a conjecture which is think
 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.310
to want as a conjecture which is think
is true but we can't prove it and one of

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320
is true but we can't prove it and one of
 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.140
is true but we can't prove it and one of
the reasons why the conjecture is one of

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150
the reasons why the conjecture is one of
 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.600
the reasons why the conjecture is one of
the most famous unsolved problems in

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610
the most famous unsolved problems in
 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.899
the most famous unsolved problems in
math is that we appear to be nowhere

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909
math is that we appear to be nowhere
 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.969
math is that we appear to be nowhere
close to a solution I know a close at

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979
close to a solution I know a close at
 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.060
close to a solution I know a close at
all people believe that whole new bits

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070
all people believe that whole new bits
 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.499
all people believe that whole new bits
of math need to be invented before we

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509
of math need to be invented before we
 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.690
of math need to be invented before we
can do this and it's one of the few

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700
can do this and it's one of the few
 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.420
can do this and it's one of the few
things that is so simple to state yet

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430
things that is so simple to state yet
 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.550
things that is so simple to state yet
still so complicated it's got the sort

mathematicians and what I want to do is

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650
mathematicians and what I want to do is
 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.490
mathematicians and what I want to do is
show how Edwin Harris who is Masterson

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500
show how Edwin Harris who is Masterson
 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.830
show how Edwin Harris who is Masterson
who I work with has created this amazing

with Carl Apps and when he first showed

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
with Carl Apps and when he first showed

it to me I was like blown away I've got

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209
it to me I was like blown away I've got
 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.500
it to me I was like blown away I've got
at 13 and then a line like that actually

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510
at 13 and then a line like that actually
 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.870

already what people do is you've build

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880
already what people do is you've build
 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.970
already what people do is you've build
this big tree because eventually things

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980
this big tree because eventually things
 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.110
this big tree because eventually things
are going to have to get to one so if

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120
are going to have to get to one so if
 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.490
are going to have to get to one so if
they get to one they're going to have to

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500
they get to one they're going to have to
 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.740
they get to one they're going to have to
come from two then they're going to have

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750
come from two then they're going to have
 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.740
come from two then they're going to have
to come down from four and so you can

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750
to come down from four and so you can
 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.630
to come down from four and so you can
build this big tree what you see with

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640
build this big tree what you see with
 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.460
build this big tree what you see with
the tree is that you've got all these

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470
the tree is that you've got all these
 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.530
the tree is that you've got all these
branches coming down

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
branches coming down
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.039
branches coming down
like this you know and get enter and

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049
like this you know and get enter and
 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:52.789
like this you know and get enter and
going into it

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799
going into it
 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.589
going into it
and normally when you see this done

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599
and normally when you see this done
 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.780
and normally when you see this done
they're done to try and maximize the

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
they're done to try and maximize the
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.220
they're done to try and maximize the
sort of logic of how it's done

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230
sort of logic of how it's done
 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.380
sort of logic of how it's done
so the distance will be the same they'll

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390
so the distance will be the same they'll
 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.360
so the distance will be the same they'll
be done so it like kind of looks looks

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370
be done so it like kind of looks looks
 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.940
be done so it like kind of looks looks
good on the page and it looks like

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950
good on the page and it looks like
 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.259
good on the page and it looks like
something in a math textbook but

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269
something in a math textbook but
 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.809
something in a math textbook but
actually what Edmunds has done is to

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819
actually what Edmunds has done is to
 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.619
actually what Edmunds has done is to
make it so it's interesting to look at

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629
make it so it's interesting to look at
 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.959
make it so it's interesting to look at
but so that you get more of an insight

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:17.969
but so that you get more of an insight
 

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:19.250
but so that you get more of an insight
about why this whole problem is

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260
about why this whole problem is
 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.629
about why this whole problem is
interesting imagine if you start at the

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639
interesting imagine if you start at the
 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.449
interesting imagine if you start at the
bottom either going to go up to an odd

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459
bottom either going to go up to an odd
 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.039
bottom either going to go up to an odd
number or an even number if we're

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049
number or an even number if we're
 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.629
number or an even number if we're
getting to an even number then it's

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:26.639
getting to an even number then it's
 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.460
getting to an even number then it's
going to slightly go off in that

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470
going to slightly go off in that
 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.190
going to slightly go off in that
direction if it's going to an odd number

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200
direction if it's going to an odd number
 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.809
direction if it's going to an odd number
it's going to slightly in that direction

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819
it's going to slightly in that direction
 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:34.640
it's going to slightly in that direction
clockwise or anticlockwise

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650
clockwise or anticlockwise
 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.979
clockwise or anticlockwise
yeah anti-clockwise for odd and

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989
yeah anti-clockwise for odd and
 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.110
yeah anti-clockwise for odd and
clockwise for even and then you get the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120
clockwise for even and then you get the
 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.929
clockwise for even and then you get the
tree becomes this this is something

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939
tree becomes this this is something
 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.250
tree becomes this this is something
already a starting look a bit

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260
already a starting look a bit
 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.960
