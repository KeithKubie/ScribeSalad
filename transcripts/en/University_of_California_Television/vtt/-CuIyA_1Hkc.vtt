- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape:
bipedal, naked, large-brained. Long the

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:38.610
master of fire, tools, and language, but
still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:48.590
Aware that death is inevitable, yet filled
with optimism. We grow up slowly. We hand

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.100
down knowledge. We empathize and deceive.
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.480
understanding of the past. CARTA brings
together experts from diverse disciplines

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:11.300

we got there. An exploration made possible

- [Mark] I would like to thank the
organizers. This is great opportunity to

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:19.340
come and listen to all these talks and
present some as well. So I would like to

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.560
start...so genes are really central and
they're central for a couple of reasons.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.050
Well we can use lots of sources of
evidence to identify which are the genes

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.800
that are important in any process. Here,
we're talking about skin pigmentation so

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.350
we have molecular biology data, clinically
significant conditions generally

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:48.310
hypopigmentation, different types of
albinism, non-human animals especially the

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.000
mouse has really been influential in
helping us understand how genes affect

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.320
pigmentation. We can follow evolution in a
number of ways; molecular evolution as

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.170
well as just the evolution across
different populations. And finally,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:12.260
Admixture mapping. This is an approach to
find the genes that determine differences

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.960
between populations. When we have those
genes, we can then use them to design more

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.160
experiments to help us understand better
how they function. So knowing those genes

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.970
is really central. We can address
questions like where and when these new

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:36.610
gene mutations happen that give us
different skin color in this case,

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.570
potentially improved diagnostic and
treatments, test different kinds of

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:47.490
molecular hypotheses and finally predict
trait values. This could be useful in a

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.450
forensic context when the person's not
there, you don't have any information

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.620
about who he is, to make some predictions
as well as in Epidemiology. Skin is

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.860
mediating something about the disease
condition. We know it's really critical in

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.120
producing enough Vitamin D.
We can measure the skin from the DNA

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:16.640
alone, so not having measured it in the
person. So there's a lot of potential

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:23.210
there. Here's an example of a melanocyte
and keratinocytes, typically they reach up

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.110
to 30 or 40 keratinocytes and pass off
melanosomes. So it's just a little bit

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.560
about the biology. We know a lot about the
genes that are forming these melanosomes

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.490
and controlling their transfer up to the
keratinocytes. I've always been fascinated

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:47.750
by human variation and here's a slide of
18 young women who we collected recently

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.210
as part of our sampling. You can get
quickly a sense of the diversity of human

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:03.200
pigmentation; skin, hair, and eyes from
this. We can look at more detailed

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.970
descriptions, quantitative descriptions.
This is a histogram showing the

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.520
pigmentation levels measured in three
populations. The one on the far left is

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:19.990
European-American sample from State
College, the black bars to the right are

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:27.590
African-Americans from Washington DC, and
then a sample of African-Caribbeans from

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.270
England. The African-Caribbeans are
shifted over to the right a little bit

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:39.170
compared to the African-Americans and
that's darker skin. In fact they have less

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:45.930
European ancestry, less European admixture
than the African-Americans do; about 10%

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.460
compared to 20%. So there's a strong
relationship there between your recent

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:58.370
admixture and your skin color. We do see
too, this red bar here shows the extent of

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:06.070
overlap because this slide also emphasizes
how our observation of each other is

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.860
substantially biased.
Sociologists have studied this in detail

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.500
and light skinned people see dark skin
people as darker than they are. Dark

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.990
skinned people see light skinned people as
lighter than they are. So you can't really

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:26.240
rely on your perceptions or at least it's
worth looking inward to see what effect

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.720
that may have on how you see those around
you. We know the environment has been a

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.440
major factor in the evolution of skin
color. That green line there is the

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:45.610
equator and latitude or the distance north
and south of the equator have a major

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:51.610
effect on skin color. We know from more
detailed analyses that it's actually the

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.650
ultraviolet radiation at ground level that
really has the strongest effect on skin

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:03.390
color. So our skin is tied to the
environment and we can propose or discuss

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:09.030
the different mechanisms that may be
controlling this response. I think the

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:15.620
strongest evidence is for lightning of
skin due to the need to produce Vitamin D.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:22.760
A very few natural sources that we can
dietarily consume enough Vitamin D to keep

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.450
us healthy, but our skin can produce
Vitamin D. So with ultraviolet light

00:07:27.450 --> 00:07:32.490
hitting your skin, you can produce Vitamin
D if your skin's light enough for that

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.410
environment and if you're exposed enough,
if you have enough skin showing and if you

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:44.280
spend enough time outdoors. So lots of
conditions on being healthy through

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:49.190
getting your Vitamin D from your skin.
Potentially immune suppression is also

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:55.370
something that is good in certain
instances. Darker skin probably evolved to

00:07:55.370 --> 00:08:00.850
protect us from sunburn, skin cancer,
protect us from too much immune

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:08.970
suppression and also perhaps to mediate
folic acid photolysis to protect our folic

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:13.480
acid stores from being destroyed.
Ultraviolet light helps to create Vitamin

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:21.150
D, but it also destroys folic acid.
Finally, both low and high pigmentation

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:26.500
can be mediated through sexual selection
and also the relaxation of selection as

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:32.840
population move from one area to another
area. We can talk about the average

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:40.850
history of individuals, persons and
populations. And this tree shows... I know

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:46.780
it's kind of complex but that's really the
best representation that we can make of

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:52.610
our history. Although this is about 10
years old, I think it still holds in most

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:58.130
of the major branches here. And it's not
only a branching through the fission,

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:03.400
separation of populations, but also the
fusion of populations. You can see here

00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:08.000
how we have drawn these little branches
here to illustrate admixture or the

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.320
movement of people to join other
populations. Our species really has much

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:20.920
more of a wisteria vine history when
branches cross they fuse and they join

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.180
again making new populations as opposed to
any kind of tree or bush pattern. That is

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:31.830
an average pattern. Evolution really
doesn't happen...at least a lot of

00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:37.930
evolution, the adaptive evolution, happens
more on a gene by gene basis. So it's

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:44.460
modular, each gene has its own history.
The genes that cause differences among us

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:48.920
today are genes that have very recent
evolutionary histories and have been very

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:57.620
actively evolving in the past 75,000
years, say, since human populations had

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:03.380
their common origin in Africa. Many
populations stayed in Africa, some small

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:08.830
set of populations moved out of Africa.
We have tools that let us study how

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:15.880
these...tracking the molecular evolution
of these genes and how quickly they

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.910
evolved showing clear evidence that they
have evolved recently or changed frequency

00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:27.280
recently. So these are very valuable
tools. I'll show you an application of one

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.390
of those methods in a minute. But I want
to focus really on just three populations

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:37.020
to start with. These aren't the three most
important populations or three central

00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:42.220
populations. That tree I showed you before
is really a better sampling of human

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:47.090
diversity, but these are worth looking at.
We were initially very light skinned

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:51.800
before we lost our fur, all mammals are.
You spread your cat's fur, even if it's a

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:57.080
black cat, you'll see the skin is white
underneath. As we lost our fur, changed

00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:01.960
our habits, we needed to become dark
skinned. There's other branches here, the

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:08.000
second branch is a common branch to East
Asians and Europeans. The third branch

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.700
there would contain skin lightening events
that were specific to East Asians, the

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:18.880
fourth branch is the branch specific to
European changes. Finally, additional skin

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.210
darkening events possibly on that fifth
branch that I show in this tree. So I

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:28.720
mentioned admixture mapping before and
this is really a fundamental tool for

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:34.550
finding genes that cause differences
between populations. Most of the genes are

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:39.300
the same across all populations. If you
look at the frequencies of alleles across

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:45.780
populations, about 95% of the total
variation is in common. We have this very

00:11:45.780 --> 00:11:50.970
recent common history, but for certain
things, especially superficial aspects,

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:57.080
superficial traits, we have evolved very
quickly and we can map those kinds of

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:02.080
genes with this approach. So we basically
start out with two parents; one light skin

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.420
and one dark skin. These are the
histograms describing their distributions.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:13.570
When they mate, you have the first admixed
generation and there is much less

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:18.410
variation in skin color here or whatever
trait it is that you're talking about.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:24.360
Everybody has two copies, two genomes; one
from European ancestor and one from an

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:29.100
African ancestor in this case. But by the
second generation and all the generations

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:33.680
afterwards, you have a lot of variation. A
lot of phenotypic variation and these are

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:39.790
ideal samples for discovering which are
the genes that are affecting this trait.

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:45.950
Here it is as a chromosomal view. So you
have two European chromosomes, two African

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:50.650
chromosomes or one of each. You get one of
each by having one parent from each

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:56.390
population. These black bars are
recombination points so you don't pass on

00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:00.380
to your kids the same chromosomes you got
from your parents. You mix them up and

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:07.260
then pass on this mixed up set of
chromosomes to your kids. And after a few

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.360
generations, you end up with these
chimeric chromosomes that have different

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:16.310
ancestry segments. We can track those
ancestry segments and use that information

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:24.100
to map genes. We do need to be careful
about stratification. So there's variation

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:29.900
in admixture levels across population.
This slide here shows you how the

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:34.550
proportion of West African ancestry is
positively correlated with the skin color

00:13:34.550 --> 00:13:40.160
measure, the M index. You see a positive
correlation, you also see the variance is

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.420
different so there is a lot more
dispersion here, a lot more variability.

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:50.510
This is because like most traits, skin
color is much more variable in Africa.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:55.210
Even just considering the subset of
Africa, West Africa where the enslaved

00:13:55.210 --> 00:14:00.380
ancestors of the African-Americans and
Brazilians and other populations that are

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:06.240
represented here were derived. So even at
that subset of Africa is much more

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:10.550
variable than Europe.
But you have this confounding. So you have

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:16.460
to deal with the fact that ancestry is
going to be correlated with any...our skin

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.590
color will be correlated with any marker
that you measure that's different between

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:26.170
those parental groups. But you can reduce
that, you can remove that statistically.

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:30.450
It's a process called conditioning or
controlling. You basically remove the

00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:36.190
effects of one variable to study another.
This is the Duffy null locus, locus of

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:41.960
very substantially between populations and
you can see the genotype determines the

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:47.160
distribution of skin color. It has nothing
to do with skin color. When you control

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:54.230
for the variation and ancestry, you get
rid of that effect on skin color. This is

00:14:54.230 --> 00:15:01.750
the cover of the journal where we
published on the SLC24A5 gene. This gene

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:08.870
was first discovered by Keith Cheng as the
golden gene for zebra fish. So it affected

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.210
zebra fish coloration. Keith called me up
and said, "Hey, maybe this affects skin

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:18.400
color." I was quite skeptical until I
looked at public data set where it showed

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.480
a locus where Europeans, the blue dot
here, were totally fixed for an allele.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:31.150
You didn't find much in other populations.
That's a very unusual circumstance and

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.700
sure enough it has a very dramatic effect
on skin color. You can see that here even

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:41.090
after controlling for ancestry, you still
have a strong effect on skin color. And in

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:48.960
fact in genome-wide admixture mapping we
find SLC24A5 is really the strongest gene

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.040
affecting skin color. You see these other
smaller peaks here. Once you condition for

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.900
the effect of SLC24A5, those genes are
much more prominent. So you can see that

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:06.170
you can detect those. So this statistical
conditioning is a very common tool and

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.870
very useful.
One of the interesting things we found

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:16.190
about not only SLC24A5 but some of those
other genes that come up in this gene

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:23.860
mapping analysis like SLC45A2 or the MATP
gene is that the variation that causes

00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:29.130
Europeans to be light skinned is not the
same as the variation that causes East

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:35.250
Asians to be light skinned. So this
selective pressure to lighten the skin

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:40.570
probably in response to migrating to
higher latitudes where there's less UV

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:46.050
light was quite strong. I mean it seems to
affect any population that moves to a

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:54.300
higher latitude. This is really kind of
unexpected. We had other hypotheses about

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:59.320
populations like Melanesians maybe they
shared or didn't share genes with darker

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:06.860
skinned populations, but this is what we
found. And in fact, there are many genes,

00:17:06.860 --> 00:17:11.960
I'm not going to talk to you about many of
these other genes, but I just wanted to

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:19.930
show you a slide that identified what
we're finding about where these genes

00:17:19.930 --> 00:17:25.250
occur and on which branches they seem to
have evolved. So we're not finding too

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:30.540
many that are on this common branch of
lightning, in the common population coming

00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:39.470
out of Africa and only a few that are back
as far as on the common branch of all

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:44.000
human populations. But some of these are
more difficult to study, too. This is

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.040
probably the case. I don't think that
those genes don't exist and we can't

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.530
understand them, we just haven't been able
to find them yet. One very interesting

00:17:53.530 --> 00:18:00.240
tool we have is to look at the local
genetic diversity. So this is using Short

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:06.940
Tandem Repeats or STRs. If you watch too
many crime TV shows, you probably already

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.070
know this acronym.
But these are the markers you use for

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:16.500
identity analysis if you have a forensic
case you type the STR alleles. You can see

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:22.650
there's lots of different variants. This
is the chromosome here that doesn't have

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:27.210
the new allele, the A allele, that gives
you a lighter skin. This is the chromosome

00:18:27.210 --> 00:18:31.650
with the lighter skin. So you can see
there is much less variation on that

00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:36.010
chromosome even though it's basically
fixed in Europeans. So there's lots of

00:18:36.010 --> 00:18:39.990
copies of that chromosome which usually
means it's old and you are going to see

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:44.700
lots of different mutations on it. Lots of
different STR alleles, but you don't. You

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:50.080
only see pretty much one primary alleles
on most of these. So you can use that

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:56.270
information to date when that mutation
occurred or when it started to change

00:18:56.270 --> 00:19:00.540
frequency. That's really the more
important point is when did that really

00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:07.000
start to evolve. So the dates or the time
is here and the selective coefficient, how

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:13.420
strong the selection was is there, and you
can put these on a tree then. So you can

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:22.680
look at when the timing of some of these
genes SLC24A5, MATP, and TRP1 changed

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:27.860
frequency compared to when KIT Ligand and
some of the other ones changed frequency.

00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:33.980
And they seem to match those splits on the
tree. So I just want to say we're very

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:39.570
grateful to all of our volunteers who
participated in these research projects

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:46.390
and I have lots of other colleagues who
have also helped in getting to this point

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:50.008
and then several other research labs as
well who are looking into a lot of these

00:19:50.008 --> 00:19:53.991
same questions. Thank you very much.

00:19:57.261 --> 00:19:59.943
♪ [music] ♪

00:20:04.614 --> 00:20:10.920
- [Nina] We share with these beautiful
cousins of ours skin that serves a variety

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.440
of important functions, and we've heard a
lot about those functions already today:

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.780
protection, thermoregulation. Today, I'm
going to reprise a little bit of what's

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:27.270
been said already about the first two
functions, and then talk somewhat about

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:35.270
this enormous realm of human communication
that we engage in with skin. Over time,

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:42.220
and through evolution, if we compare the
relative importance of protection and

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:48.670
thermoregulation versus communication, we
can see that in human evolution,

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:55.140
communication has become one of the major
functions of skin especially since the

00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:00.820
evolution of functionally naked skin. I
want to first just reprise a little bit

00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:05.130
information about protection, though,
because it's useful to think about what we

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:13.210
lost. Hair is enormously useful, and our
primate relatives and our mammalian

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:18.330
ancestors had hair that help to insulate
and protect against all manner of

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:24.770
environmental problems and abrasion,
ultraviolet radiation and water, and hair

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:32.730
helps to slow the ingress of pathogens to
the skin. But we lost hair, and although

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:40.480
there is some controversy about why we
lost it and exactly when, we know that we

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:48.620
now have functionally naked skin probably
by early Homo times, and almost certainly

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:55.930
for reasons having to do with the need to
keep cool during exercise by a high volume

00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:01.740
of eccrine sweating. And what the
important conclusion of this is is that

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:10.640
for much of our...the key portions of our
evolution, hairless bodies are interfaced

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:14.290
with the environment.
A very different situation than in other

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:21.230
mammals. The evolution of the stratum
corneum, the very top part of the

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:27.200
epidermis is something that has been dealt
with a lot in the dermatological

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:33.200
literature. We know that the epidermis,
and particularly the stratum corneum at

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:37.860
the very surface of the epidermis, here,
resists abrasion, restricts water loss,

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:44.190
and prevents the ingress of pathogens. But
that great change from the haired to the

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:51.360
hairless condition basically involved
changes to the stratum corneum. So when we

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:56.980
think about really what Ajit Varki's point
was at the very beginning of this

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:05.830
symposium, "Why is the skin different." We
see from referring to the chimp genome

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:15.580
project that in fact, the skin is the most
distinct organ. Human skin has been...has

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:21.160
many genes that have been evolving
independently, and very different from

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:28.640
those of chimpanzees much more so than any
organ or cell system. And the most

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:34.950
important genes in this regard are those
having to do with the stratum corneum and

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:41.460
the barrier functions of the epidermis. We
could go on at length, my colleague, Peter

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:46.740
Elias has done distinguished work in this
area. We know that this stratum corneum in

00:23:46.740 --> 00:23:52.600
humans is particularly lipid-rich that we
have interferon gamma that helps to

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:57.720
generate a potent antiviral state in the
stratum corneum and that the skin

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:06.060
microbiome plays an enormously important
and still quite unclear, but emerging

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.200
role.
The skin also has to protect against

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.700
another major assault which is that of the
sun and particularly, ultraviolet

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:22.680
radiation. We know from data provided from
NASA that the ultraviolet radiation load

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:28.790
that we get on the Earth's surface is
strongest around the equator shown in the

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:34.990
bright pink and red tones here in the map.
Much, much lower as we get close to the

00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:40.370
poles, especially in these large land
masses in the northern hemisphere. How

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:48.410
have humans coped with these high levels
of UV in our ancestral areas, and much

00:24:48.410 --> 00:24:58.350
lower levels in areas of habitation later
in aspects of our evolution? In early

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:06.500
Homo, the loss of body hair is associated
with the development of permanent, dark

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:13.200
pigmentation. So instead of having dark
hair covering lightly pigmented skin, we

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:21.490
evolve permanently, darkly pigmented skin.
And that is largely to do with the

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:28.710
production of high amounts of the
tremendously interesting pigment called

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:35.810
eumelanin; a fascinating polymer that has
myriad important properties. The most

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:41.790
important for our purposes being the
ability to scatter and absorb ultraviolet

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:49.690
radiation and prevent damage to underlying
tissues. Ultraviolet radiation causes a

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:55.980
lot of damage to the skin that can lead to
skin cancer, especially in individuals who

00:25:55.980 --> 00:26:04.720
are genetically susceptible. But skin
cancer rarely causes mortality.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:11.480
So I, as someone who is interested in
figuring out why skin pigmentation evolved

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:16.640
as it did, and specifically why dark
pigmentation evolved, got very interested

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.920
in the effect of ultraviolet radiation on
something that would really count for

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:30.150
reproductive success in evolution. And I
started looking a lot at folate

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:36.610
metabolism. Without going into a lot
detail, suffice it to say that we need

00:26:36.610 --> 00:26:43.760
folate, one of the key B vitamins, in
order to fuel DNA synthesis which is

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:50.380
particularly important in certain parts of
our development in life especially in

00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:56.730
early embryogenesis. When we know that
folate is critical for the formation of

00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:04.480
the embryonic neural tube which is the
precursor of the modern, or the adult,

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:09.970
nervous system. So, if you have an
environmental agent like ultraviolet

00:27:09.970 --> 00:27:17.530
radiation that can actually break down
folate and affect other aspects of folate

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:24.140
metabolism in a pregnant mother, then you
can affect reproductive success, and this

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:30.730
is why we've highlighted that mechanism.
So.here I say the primary, not the only,

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:36.150
but the primary selective force for the
evolution of permanent dark pigmentation

00:27:36.150 --> 00:27:43.030
is protection against ultraviolet-induced
changes in folate availability and DNA

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:50.620
synthesis in early embryogenesis and in
sperm production. But humans did not

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:57.610
remain in the ancestral environment of
Africa. Much of human evolution, including

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.700
much of Homo Sapien's evolution, has
occurred in Africa. Tremendous amounts of

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:04.270
diversification, but humans have moved
around a lot.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:10.310
And here we can see in the history of
modern humans. We have people

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:16.850
moving...small populations moving out of
Africa into areas of very different

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:24.120
ultraviolet radiation including very low
areas or very low UV areas later in our

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:30.150
evolutionary history. Why is that
important? Because ultraviolet radiation,

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:36.230
mostly a malign influence that we think
about in evolution, is a creative

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:42.370
influence, and is extremely important in
all vertebrates in the production of

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:48.480
Vitamin D in the skin. Without
ultraviolet-B radiation we cannot make

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:55.540
Vitamin D in the skin. And what we have
shown in our research and this has been

00:28:55.540 --> 00:29:00.370
supported by many collateral lines of
evidence is that the primary selective

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:05.970
force for the evolution of lightly pink
bennet [SP] or more correctly, depigmented

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:12.150
skin is promotion of ultraviolet
radiation-induced Vitamin D production in

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:17.930
the skin under conditions of low and
seasonal ultraviolet radiation. And so

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:24.200
here in modern humans, we have this
beautiful and delightful contrast between

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:31.050
skin on the left that maximizes photo
protection against ultraviolet radiation,

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:36.390
and skin on the right that maximizes
photosynthesis of Vitamin D under

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:43.720
conditions of low UV. Skin pigmentation is
a superb evolutionary compromise.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:49.140
Something that we should talk about in our
classes of evolution and human biology; a

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:54.670
superb compromise that is an excellent
illustration of the action of natural

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:59.010
selection on the human body.
Themoregulation, I'm only going to say

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:09.260
that as we evolved through time, we became
far more active. This beautiful example of

00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:15.340
an early member of the genus Homo was not
a tentative biped. This was a striding,

00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:22.680
running, active individual that built up a
lot of body heat under hot environmental

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:29.910
conditions. Here was the natural selective
substrate, as it were, for the loss of

00:30:29.910 --> 00:30:37.690
most functional body hair. Evaporation of
sweat is impeded by hair, and so we

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:44.490
reasoned that most body...most functional
body hair was actually lost because of the

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:51.170
importance of facilitating the evaporation
of sweat from the surface of the body. And

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:57.330
so, functional hairlessness, then, can
best be thought about as facilitating

00:30:57.330 --> 00:31:03.200
active body cooling, whole body cooling,
through eccrine sweating during lengthy

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:10.900
periods of sustained exercise.
Communication has always been an important

00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:17.120
function of skin, whether we're talking
about a distant mammalian ancestor or a

00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:23.480
primate relative. Primates touch one
another. Communication through touch

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:30.470
especially beginning with infant-mother
communication is central. This continues,

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:37.250
and is elaborated in the hairless human
infant and in hairless bodies contacting

00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:42.270
one another. And we know that this type of
touch communication is absolutely

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:49.000
essential for mother-infant bonding in our
primate relatives and in ourselves. When

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:58.260
we lost most of our body hair, we lost an
important method of displaying our

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:06.750
emotions. This chimpanzee on the left is
exhibiting a display, a very visible

00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:11.630
display, of anger and aggression toward
the individual on the right.

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:17.320
And he is able to manifest this
magnificent raising of hackles. What do we

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:24.440
do without hair? We have no hackles. We
might...our little feeble hairs might go

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:34.850
up. What do we do instead? We don't know
for certain, but what we do know is that

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:41.300
modern humans have much more finely
differentiated, and highly active facial

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:49.010
muscles than do even chimpanzees, and we
have the evolution of enhanced facial

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:54.960
expressivity in humans that is probably
related to that loss of expressivity in

00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:02.250
the raising of the hackles. As soon as
humans evolved naked skin or probably very

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:09.250
soon, thereafter, people realized that
they could decorate their skin. We don't

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:15.570
know when they happened upon this, but we
have some enticing evidence that comes

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:20.810
from Blombos Cave in South Africa from
about 70,000 years ago that would indicate

00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:27.130
that by that time, people were beginning
to use ocher for decorations and for

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:34.780
decorating the inside of rock shelters.
This is exciting because I would venture

00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:41.110
that probably long before this, humans had
been using ocher and similar pigments to

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:47.860
rub on themselves, to mark themselves. We
can't prove this, but it seems highly

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:56.960
likely. Humans are lavish decorators of
themselves. We may not have colorful fur,

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:04.410
but we more than compensate for this by
having myriad ways of decorating ourselves

00:34:04.410 --> 00:34:12.990
with body paint, with cosmetics.
In most cultures, both sexes are involved

00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:19.490
and many parts of the body are involved in
decoration. There is no culture that we

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:28.460
know in the world that does not adorn its
skin in some way. Modern humans have

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:35.880
developed not only body paints but also
cosmetics. Now, mostly associated with

00:34:35.880 --> 00:34:41.610
women, but certainly centuries ago, not. A
lavish form of communication that is

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:47.840
incredibly important that individuals can
manipulate and change from one day or one

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:55.710
season to another. We also start making
permanent marks on our body. We know from

00:34:55.710 --> 00:35:02.880
the preserved remains of the so-called
Tyrolean iceman, dating from around 5,000

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:08.850
years ago, that we have evidence of
tattooing of the skin. These are thought

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:15.420
to be therapeutic tattoos that were on the
skin not necessarily decorative. Many of

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:22.500
them are crosses or simple lines, parallel
lines. But the fact that they are present

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:29.010
that early in the archaeological record in
neolithic humans is significant. And

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:36.830
humans around the world tattoo themselves,
and sometimes lavishly. This woman from

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:46.520
Burma has beautiful facial tattoos that
signify her marriageable status. And that

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:56.930
identify her to a particular clan group.
But what do we say just through our color?

00:35:56.930 --> 00:36:02.180
And the rest of this lecture I want to
devote to the messages, the communication

00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:10.160
that actually comes from our color.
During most of human history, humans moved

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:18.380
around slowly. They came into contact with
one another gradually. There were no big

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:26.380
surprises. And it's not surprising that
through much of history, not just

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:33.050
prehistory but much of history, we have no
indication that humans treated one another

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:40.910
differently on the basis of color. It only
is relatively recent, in the last few

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:48.970
hundred years that color becomes something
that has social significance, and that has

00:36:48.970 --> 00:36:56.050
some kind of set of stereotypes and even
stigmas attached to it. We really see the

00:36:56.050 --> 00:37:05.160
emergence of a modern color-consciousness
beginning in the 18th century when innate

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:14.090
skin color comes to communicate both
racial identity or race belonging, and

00:37:14.090 --> 00:37:21.880
social status. One of the most interesting
figures in this history is the philosopher

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:29.960
Immanuel Kant. Immanuel Kant was a very
careful reader of Linnaeus, the great

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:37.870
taxonomist. Linnaeus made very simple
descriptions of humans according to skin

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:45.280
color and geography. Later, he associated
skin color and geography with some

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:53.990
characteristics of behavior and culture.
Kant was an avid reader of Linnaeus, and

00:37:53.990 --> 00:38:01.740
Kant, although he's known far more for his
thoughts on rationality and human

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:08.670
thinking, had tremendous curiosity about
human diversity, human origins, and the

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:12.080
origins of human capacity for
civilization.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:18.960
And so, he thought a lot about Linnaeus
and what Linnaeus said, and Kant, not a

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:23.790
naturalist, but Immanuel Kant the
philosopher, was the first to actually

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:31.670
enunciate the presence of four races. And
the key thing about Kant's races where

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:38.060
that in his mind, they were immutable.
They couldn't change ever. And this was

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:46.640
just not a list, it was a hierarchy. And
critical here is the primacy of the white

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:53.160
race which is something that we see
emerging again in different guises for

00:38:53.160 --> 00:39:01.310
many centuries, for many decades after
this. Kant's tremendous influence was

00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:09.360
complemented by the importance of
maintaining a strict social hierarchy in

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:16.800
order to keep the trans-Atlantic slave
trade going. By the early 1800s, there was

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:26.570
tremendous pressure to end slavery, to end
the slave trade. But it was very, very

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:34.330
financially appealing and important for
the hierarchy of races and especially the

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:40.580
primacy of the white race over the
so-called black race to be enunciated so

00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:46.500
that slavery could be maintained. And we
see this complementarity between a

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:51.980
philosophical and a religious or
pseudo-religious underpinning for race

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:58.580
hierarchies and slavery along with the
mercantile and capitalist underpinnings. A

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:05.390
very pernicious system that led to the
social differentiation of color.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:12.490
Something that hadn't existed at least in
as strong a form and violent a form

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:19.580
before. And so we see race definitions
that are associated with color that lead

00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:26.280
seemingly inexorably to the development of
racial stereotypes especially when they're

00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:33.410
propagated by individuals like Kant, like
Thomas Jefferson who were highly, socially

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:38.220
influential through their writings leading
to the development of what I've called

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:44.670
color memes that are adopted and
transmitted from family to family,

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:51.370
generation to generation leading to a
durable psychosocial template for racism.

00:40:51.370 --> 00:40:59.970
So skin, coming from this delightful and
beautiful evolutionary background, skin

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:07.680
color actually reflects our evolutionary
history, but in this most recent part of

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:16.910
human written history comes to represent
something entirely different. But I am not

00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:23.650
a pessimistic person, and the beautiful
thing about humans as primates is that we

00:41:23.650 --> 00:41:32.220
are tremendously imitative and suggestible
and we can change. We adopted in Western

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:38.340
civilization broadly, certain attitudes
toward color and we can change those

00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:44.910
attitudes. We're not trapped by the color
memes that we have created. And this

00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:53.220
aspect of communication through skin can
in fact change. I want to celebrate the

00:41:53.220 --> 00:42:01.960
beauty of human skin and invite you to
think more about the exquisite path that

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:08.670
skin has taken through the last seven or
so million years of the human lineage.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:16.050
The evolution of hairlessness, functional
nakedness, sweating, the development of

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:23.660
these marvelous appendages, and the
beautiful feast of microbes and other

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:29.890
creatures that live on the surface of our
skin. And then, the superb things that we

00:42:29.890 --> 00:42:36.500
do with this beautiful, naked canvass that
has been produced by evolution. Let's

00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:43.409
celebrate those and continue an active
program of research. Thank you very much.

00:42:47.514 --> 00:42:50.419
♪ [music] ♪

00:42:54.442 --> 00:43:00.170
- [James] I'd like to thank very much to
the organizers of this conference for

00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:05.500
inviting me. I just want to, as I
frequently speak to clinical audiences, I

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:18.310
have to make my declaration of disclaim. I
essentially work in borrowed space, use

00:43:18.310 --> 00:43:27.100
borrowed money, and I'm living on borrowed
time. Hence, I like as my theme Thomas

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:34.680
Huxley's remark that, "Scientists over 60
do more harm than good." Now I want to

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:44.440
direct you to a traveling story. Skin is
our major defense against an onslaught of

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:51.470
one of the strongest carcinogens that we
experience, ultraviolet light. And some

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:55.820
years ago I was directed to this village
in Northern Guatemala were the

00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:00.430
missionary's orders that the children had
enormous amount of skin cancer, and they

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:05.330
were dying at 10 years of age. Now,
commonly, you would think skin cancer as

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:11.950
an older person's problem. These are
dramatic examples of how, if we lose the

00:44:11.950 --> 00:44:18.200
genetic defense against sun exposure,
cancer can be an enormously disastrous

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:22.840
problem at the skin level. So they
directed me to this village and it had the

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:29.110
phenotype of a disease that I'd work for
many years, xeroderma pigmentosum. That's

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:34.920
normally a recessive disease. In then U.
S.population, it occurs about one to four

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:39.500
per million of the population. Twenty-five
percent of the children had this disease.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:44.530
They lived under extreme poverty. When we
had a look at the patients, you could see

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:51.890
the enormous sun damage of their face, and
the painful sunburns. When we brought

00:44:51.890 --> 00:44:58.120
cells back, you can see here and exposed
these cells to ultraviolet in the lab

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:03.860
where the normal skin has excellent
survival, their cells were killed at very,

00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:09.140
very low doses of UV.
So they had a genetic predisposition in

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:16.900
which they could not handle sun exposure,
solar exposure. We sequenced, and we found

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:23.610
that they lacked what you call now the
global genome repair pathway. The founder

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:29.530
effect in this village was a mutation
which caused...which removed one cytosine

00:45:29.530 --> 00:45:35.910
from a gene we call XPC which is one of
the main damage recognition proteins in

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:42.830
the skin. When we did...even a staining of
a section of the skin, the black staining

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:48.630
here, indications of high expression of
the XPC protein in the epidermis of normal

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:54.050
skin. From the Guatemalan village, there
is no expression of this gene. As a

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:59.360
result, their cells fail to recognize DNA
damage and it goes on to develop into

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:06.550
cancer. I will show you some of the
ramifications of this. Now, xeroderma

00:46:06.550 --> 00:46:12.460
pigmentosum, XP, is one of a family of
some sensitive diseases involving

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:18.190
different components of the nucleotide
excision repair pathway. As an aside, I'd

00:46:18.190 --> 00:46:24.690
just like to mention that you may have
seen that the Nobel prize for chemistry

00:46:24.690 --> 00:46:30.950
this year was given to Tom Lindahl, Z.
Sancar, and the mismatch repair pathway

00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:40.750
for unraveling the biochemistry of this
pathway. Now, xeroderma pigmentosum is

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:47.790
unique from among the repair systems for
solar UV in that they have very high

00:46:47.790 --> 00:46:59.680
cancer. These other diseases are also
components of the same repair pathway, but

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:04.080
they essentially are photosensitive but
without skin cancer.

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:11.150
And especially a disease here known as the
UVS syndrome has acute sunburn, but no

00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:16.280
neurological disorders, none of the
developmental disorders or the current

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:22.910
Cockayne syndrome, and a very mild
version. So there's an extremely wide

00:47:22.910 --> 00:47:28.630
variation in the genetic response to sun
exposure. Now the main photoproducts

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:34.670
caused by UV occur between two adjacent
pyrimidines in the DNA. The major

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:40.860
photoproduct is the dimer in which two
covalent bonds are formed. An alternative

00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:48.500
photoproduct, the 6-4 photoproduct. Now if
you do not remove these photoproducts,

00:47:48.500 --> 00:47:53.970
either of these, if you don't remove them
bio-chemically from the DNA, they can go

00:47:53.970 --> 00:48:00.500
on to interfere with DNA replication. And
a cytosine and a TC photoproduct can

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:06.070
deaminate, code as an A, you know, codes
as a T and then opposite an A is placed.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:13.900
After two cycles of replication, a TC
sequence becomes a TT. So, a C to a T

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:20.150
transition mutation in a TC sequence is an
absolute fingerprint for UV exposure and a

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:27.390
UV-induced mutation. Now, the excision
repair pathway for UV damage has two major

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:36.690
routes. If the DNA is unexpressed, which
is a large majority of our DNA, damage is

00:48:36.690 --> 00:48:41.520
recognized by a dedicated damage
recognition protein of which XPC, the

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:47.600
Guatemalan population, has a mutation. So
they failed to recognize. An alternative

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:53.760
mechanism by which damage is recognize is
an arrested transcription. If cells cannot

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:58.270
recover from this, they have the disease
called Cockayne syndrome.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:03.150
And then, these two pathways converge on
an extensive remodeling system to repair

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:07.720
the DNA. If we look more closely at the
transcription process, there are two

00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:12.000
strands, the coding strands and a template
strand. The template strand is the one

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:19.200
which is transcribed into RNA. The repair
of these two strands is different. The XPC

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.350
system repairs this strand. The
transcribed strand is repaired by a

00:49:24.350 --> 00:49:28.270
complex of proteins that are associated
with a transcription complex. The

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:33.900
difference between these two strands have
a major impact on carcinogenesis. First,

00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:38.910
if you look at repair in terms of the
removal of a number of photoproducts, with

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:46.900
time, in a highly expressed gene like P53
or Dhfr, the photoproducts were remove

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:52.170
rapidly. In unexpressed or lower expressed
genes, the photoproducts were removed to a

00:49:52.170 --> 00:49:57.700
much lower extent. So the rate of repair
depends upon which strand the damage lies.

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:03.380
We then collaborated recently with a group
in Seattle, Laura Loeb and Kev Bayliss, in

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.790
which they use a high throughput
sequencing method to determine exactly

00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:10.520
what are the sequence changes in a
UV-rated population. Now, those of

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:14.530
you...those of us who have worked in a
million [sp] cell biology and tissue

00:50:14.530 --> 00:50:19.790
culture immunogenesis realize that over
the years, we've only had one or two genes

00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:25.100
that are capable of studying mutagenesis
in culture because of the number...the

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:30.400
rarity of having a drug-selectable locus.
With high throughput sequencing, we can

00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:34.920
get by that completely. And so, here is
the result of measuring the mutation

00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:40.200
frequency in nucleotide changes per 10 to
the 7th nucleotides. High resolution

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:45.120
sequencing averaged over a large number of
genes that are relevant for skin cancer.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.960
And you can see that a wild-type normal
cell has a low increase in mutations or

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:58.850
function of dose, but in a XPC such as we
see in Guatemala village, enormous

00:50:58.850 --> 00:51:04.490
increase in mutation rates.
Going up from 0.5 up to 5, a tenfold or

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:09.040
more increase in mutation rates. We then
decided once we had that system working,

00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:15.970
we went back to Guatemala and with some
help of a clinical service team that goes

00:51:15.970 --> 00:51:19.940
there from San Diego regularly to treat
the patients and give them some clinical

00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:27.350
help, we brought back five squamous
carcinomas from this population. Sequenced

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:32.920
three million single nucleotide mutations
by exome sequencing. Transition mutations

00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.830
were a majority in XPC. Now since it was a
small population size, we didn't

00:51:37.830 --> 00:51:43.010
concentrate on which genes were mutated,
but we asked, "What is the frequency of

00:51:43.010 --> 00:51:47.520
mutations per kilobase across the whole
genome?" and asked, "What's the mutation

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:53.730
density?" When we do that...this is a very
interesting situation to illustrate how

00:51:53.730 --> 00:52:00.250
the genome structure and function have a
major impact on mutation rates. In a

00:52:00.250 --> 00:52:04.500
normal population...see in here, normal
squamous carcinomas from a normal

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:10.720
population. There is a protein in the
histone that methylates a region and

00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:18.120
suppresses access for other enzymes. As a
result, the mutation density goes up

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:25.060
because those regions of the chromatin are
inaccessible to repair. As transcription

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:31.950
increases across the genome, we find that
this is...removes the repression, and as a

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:36.970
result mutation frequency declines. But
still, if you compare the non-transcribed

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:41.580
strand to the transcribed strand in the
tumor, there are more mutations in the

00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:47.300
non-transcribed strand. When we move to
the XPC tumors from the Guatemalan

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:55.450
patients, we find no removal on mutagenic
lesions right across the genome

00:52:55.450 --> 00:53:00.610
irrespective of transcription level, but
in the transcribed strand, very efficient

00:53:00.610 --> 00:53:03.520
removal.
Now these are striking illustrations of

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:10.250
the fact that it depends critically which
strand of the DNA is damaged, which one

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:16.800
gets repaired. If the cells fail to repair
the non-transcribed strand, mutation rate

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:21.070
is very high when replication comes along
there. On the other strand, the

00:53:21.070 --> 00:53:26.660
transcribed strand, it doesn't matter how
well that's repaired in the Guatemalan

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:32.200
population. Because they can't repair the
other strand, cancer is high. So that the

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:37.690
repair of these transcribed strand could
be very efficient, but if confers

00:53:37.690 --> 00:53:43.290
absolutely no protection against
UV-induced mutations and carcinogenesis.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:50.120
Now, if we can turn to another response of
the skin to ultraviolet exposure, sunburn.

00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:57.830
We often think and it's established more
or less that the risk for melanoma from

00:53:57.830 --> 00:54:03.430
the sun is related to how many sunburns
you get. Well in squamous carcinoma

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:08.520
there's a very different situation. This
is the spectrum of xeroderma pigmentosum

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:12.520
patients from sun exposure, you can have a
patient with very high erythema and

00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.630
sunburn. You can have patients with
freckling. Patients that develop severe

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:23.670
skin cancer. So you're going to have this
range, and this is under genetic control.

00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:28.070
If you look, and this is data published
recently from England where they

00:54:28.070 --> 00:54:33.170
have...bring in all the XPC patients from
the country, and treat them and follow

00:54:33.170 --> 00:54:38.420
them in one single location. And this was
reported a couple of years ago. If you

00:54:38.420 --> 00:54:47.470
look at sunburn versus which gene in the
XP repair pathway is mutated. If you look

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:54.720
at the patients with mutations in XPC,
XPE, or XPV which are genes that code for

00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:01.490
proteins involved in the processing of DNA
damage in the non-expressed regions of the

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:06.930
genome.
They get cancer but they get no sunburn.

00:55:06.930 --> 00:55:13.730
However, if the genes are involved in
repair and in transcription, sunburn is

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:19.640
very high. If you now look at the
probability of cancer, and then look at

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:26.450
patients that are involved...in which the
genes involved in transcription, cancer

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:35.580
appears slowly over time. And the 50%
onset is out...almost out as late as the

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:41.730
normal population. If we look at XPC and E
patients which are involved in the repair

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:47.140
of the non-transcribed regions and they
don't get sunburn, the cancers are

00:55:47.140 --> 00:55:54.350
appearing more rapidly. Their 50% onset is
about the age of 20. So an acute sunburn

00:55:54.350 --> 00:56:00.740
in this disease is actually delays
squamous carcinoma. It's the converse of

00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:07.010
what you get with melanoma. As an aside,
it's interesting for me to note that the

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:14.240
50% onset here is in the early 20s. In
American xeroderma patients, it occurs

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:20.210
below the age of 10 which is reminiscent
for my childhood that England is a pretty

00:56:20.210 --> 00:56:29.560
cloudy, damn rainy place. So let me just
summarize. Xeroderma pigmentosum and

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.640
related nucleotide repair diseases
highlight mechanisms of sunburn and

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:41.040
cancer. Repair is more rapid in more
highly expressed genes. Presumably because

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:46.370
an expressed gene has to open up the
chromatin to allow transcription to work

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:51.390
whereupon repair can work. Now deficient
repair of solar UV products in the

00:56:51.390 --> 00:56:56.150
non-transcribed strands, and in
unexpressed DNA results in a high mutation

00:56:56.150 --> 00:57:00.730
rate and cancer, but deficient repair in
the transcribed strand results in

00:57:00.730 --> 00:57:05.140
increased sunburn.
Cancer is delayed or not increased. And in

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:09.680
fact, in Cockayne Syndrome, which is
uniquely involved in the repair of the

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:14.590
transcribed strands, those patients with
Cockayne Syndrome have severe

00:57:14.590 --> 00:57:22.300
developmental disorders, but as far as we
know they never get cancer. So, my

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:27.730
question that I leave you with is, "Can we
increase repair in otherwise healthy

00:57:27.730 --> 00:57:32.850
persons to protect against skin cancer
including melanoma and other cancers?" And

00:57:32.850 --> 00:57:38.280
alternatively, since the nucleotide
excision repair pathway repairs UV-type

00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:44.140
damage which is large modifications of DNA
very similar to what occurs when you use

00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:50.620
chemotherapy like cisplatins. Since it's
the same repair pathway, "Can we inhibit

00:57:50.620 --> 00:57:56.820
repair, and then sensitize cancers to
chemotherapy with very few side effects?"

00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:59.483
So I leave you with that. Thank you.
