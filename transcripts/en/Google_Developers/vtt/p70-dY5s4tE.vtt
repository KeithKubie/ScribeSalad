JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.990
Welcome to YouTube Developers
Live take two for today.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.430
My name is Jarek Wilkiewicz.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.970
And I have exciting show
for you today.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.610
We have guests from
Pixability.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.320
Andreas, how are you doing?

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.800
ANDREAS GOELDI: Very well.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.140
Thanks.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.560
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: And Bettina?

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.280
BETTINA HEIN: Thank
you for having us.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.770
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: How are
you, Bettina, today?

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:25.470
Great.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.550
In the studio we have
Jeremy Walker.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.390
JEREMY WALKER: Hello.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.150
Hello, everyone.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.600
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Long
time no see, Jeremy.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.990
JEREMY WALKER: I know.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.780
You're been in Mexico?

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:34.400
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yes.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.150
I was down in Mexico.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.010
We can talk a little
bit about it later.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.360
And then Jeff is not joining us
tonight because we had to

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.930
rewire our studio.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.020
And in the process of rewiring,
we lost Jeff.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.450
All right.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.830
But hopefully we'll try
to manage without him.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.530
So first of all, thank you
very much for coming.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.070
I'm very excited to have
you in the studio.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.340
I know you have a very
busy schedule.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.780
Coming from Boston, right?

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.410
BETTINA HEIN: Yes.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: To
Silicon Valley.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.510
How long are you staying?

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.680
BETTINA HEIN: We're actually
going back tomorrow morning.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.600
We came in on Sunday.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.510
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: OK, great.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.290
So we're going to try to squeeze
the maximum amount of

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.370
value out of your
short trip here.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.540
So we wanted to talk to you
about your company.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.440
But maybe first, Bettina,
I know you've been an

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.390
entrepreneur for quite
some time.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.650
So I wanted to learn a little
bit more about how did you get

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.000
into that and what did you
do before Pixability?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.740
And then we will transition
and talk a little bit more

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.970
about your current project.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.210
BETTINA HEIN: Sure.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.140
Well, I like to brag that I've
never had a real job.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.490
So I started my first
tech company right

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.980
out of graduate school.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.170
Actually, I started it in
Zurich, Switzerland--

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.350
a spin-off of the Swiss
Federal Institute of

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.600
Technology.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.740
And it was a bunch of
engineers and I.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.750
And we started a speech
technology

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.850
company called SVOX.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.830
And if you have an Android phone
or use Google Translate,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.850
you will have text to speech
software from SVOX in there.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.870
And so the technology today is
in the hands of over half a

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.169
billion people.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.780
And it's in the GPS systems
of most cars.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.010
And we raised some money for
that from investors from

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.720
Angels and VCs, about
$8 million.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.650
And we then sold it to Nuance
Communications from

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.270
Burlington, Massachusetts
for $125 million.

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.090
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: That's
pretty amazing.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.540
So 10x plus return, which is
I know all businesses are

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.640
looking for.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.220
BETTINA HEIN: Yeah.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.270
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Can the text
to speech software do Polish

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.390
accent, by any chance?

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.480
BETTINA HEIN: Absolutely
it can.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.740
Yes.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:38.110
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: All right.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.751
Now I need to try it.

00:02:39.751 --> 00:02:40.850
BETTINA HEIN: It's
available in 32

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.300
languages, I think, so far.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.440
So, yeah.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.765
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, wow.

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:45.090
Great.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.480
So now your working
on Pixability.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.840
So what brought you into
this world of video?

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.010
BETTINA HEIN: Well, I was
a Sloan Fellow at MIT

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.270
after I'd done SVOX.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.880
And that was actually the time
when YouTube was getting

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.430
acquired by Google.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.530
And I was studying technological
disruption.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.140
And what I saw was this drop of
orders of magnitude in the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.540
input factors into video.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.570
So the cost of cameras, the
cost of editing software,

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.360
bandwidth, all of that
was dropping majorly.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.290
And I knew from studying
previous technological

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.130
disruptions that that was
an opportunity to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.650
create a big business.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.700
And I also saw that there
was a chance for

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.865
democratization, actually.

00:03:38.865 --> 00:03:44.920
You know, TV is an oligopolistic
game, networks,

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:45.995
cable TV stations.

00:03:45.995 --> 00:03:50.550
But here small content creators,
small businesses all

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.710
had an equal chance
to succeed.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.130
And so I decided to found
Pixability on that premise.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.960
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: It sounds
very exciting.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.250
It's also interesting that
you went from voice

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.670
and audio to video.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.550
So I'm wondering what's
coming next, ESP?

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.980
Extrasensory--

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.650
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: But before
we get there, I'm also

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.120
curious-- and I am sure you get
that question a lot, so

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.200
pardon the repetition.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.230
But as a woman running the
company do you think is it

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:18.920
easier, is it harder for you?

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.589
Do you have to answer this
question a lot of times?

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.230
We don't have a lot of female
guests on this show.

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.720
I think our entrepreneur guest
speakers are kind of a male

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.370
dominated group.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.370
So can you speak a little bit
about your experience to all

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.455
the women that might be
watching us right now?

00:04:37.455 --> 00:04:37.780
BETTINA HEIN: Yeah.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.930
Well, it's almost like if I
would ask Jeremy here, I see

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.790
you're wearing glasses, what
is it like as a myopic

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.050
entrepreneur?

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.840
No, in all honesty, I get asked
that question a lot.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.230
And I wish that weren't a
pertinent question, but it is.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.760
It goes both ways.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.280
It's actually a big advantage
in some ways.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.560
If a magazine wants to cover
a hot new start up and they

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.320
have, all things being equal,
a male entrepreneur and a

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.290
female entrepreneur,
guess what?

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:13.320
I get chosen.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.270
So that's the cool
thing about it.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.510
The downside is that I have to
relate to people that have a

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.650
different interest set than I
often times, or a different

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.450
background.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.220
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I get that
a lot with football.

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.860
BETTINA HEIN: Yeah, especially
with investors, I just don't

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.310
fit the mold exactly.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.560
So it's maybe not
as comfortable.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.890
And a lot about business and
investing is about pattern

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:46.570
recognition.

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.070
And I don't fit that pattern.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.560
But I roll with the punches.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.500
And I like to just take
that as a challenge.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.150
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.950
And so now I think this is a
great prelude to Pixability.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.070
So tell us a little bit more
about the problem you're

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.800
trying to solve and how
you're approaching it.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.860
BETTINA HEIN: Sure.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.680
So Pixability helps companies
and content creators make the

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.060
most of their YouTube channel.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.460
Find their audience, optimize
their content, optimize ads,

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.260
and do that all the
YouTube platform.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.750
If you've heard of a company
that's called Buddy Media,

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:25.480
they do everything
for Facebook.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.410
We do everything for YouTube.

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:27.790
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.310
So the target audience is
content creators that really

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.800
want to amplify their presence
on YouTube, get more

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.950
subscribers, get more views?

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.720
Or who is the customer?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.290
BETTINA HEIN: Actually,
it's content creators.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.830
So publishers of content as well
as corporate marketers.

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.380
Because that is actually
coming together.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.640
We see that more and more.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.240
If you look at Red Bull
Stratos, right?

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.740
Companies are becoming
content creators.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.250
And content creators
are businesses.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.800
So we serve both of those.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.410
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.850
So maybe before we get
into more details

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:06.880
can we see a demo?

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.510
ANDREAS GOELDI: Sure.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.443
Absolutely.

00:07:08.443 --> 00:07:09.210
JAREK WILKIEWICZ:
Let's try that.

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.870
ANDREAS GOELDI: Right.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.040
So first of all, our product
really has two

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:13.990
main parts to it.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.020
So there's one part that is
really optimized to help

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:20.530
businesses, content creators
manage their YouTube channel.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:23.820
And there's the second part that
is really optimized to

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:26.460
what we call to do audience
insights.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.970
And that means basically that we
help businesses and content

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:32.380
creators understand what
is going on YouTube.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.350
So basically, to answer the
question, what kind of content

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.310
should I produce?

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.660
Who are my competitors?

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:42.030
What is a really popular type
of video in my field?

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:42.860
And so on.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.070
And that's really kind of the
combination that seems to work

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.270
extremely well.

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.250
So what we see here, to start a
quick demo, is basically the

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.450
dashboard for people who manage
their YouTube channel.

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:58.490
So we created a UI that is
really designed to be optimal

00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:59.550
for business users.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:02.790
And they have slightly different
needs from what you

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:06.890
have as a person, as an
individual, using YouTube.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.040
Or even as a content provider.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:14.250
A lot of marketing oriented
users, for instance, don't

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.890
full time manage their
YouTube channel.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:17.530
It's just one part
of their job.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.300
So they need a lot
of efficiency.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:22.190
Very often you find teams
who manage two

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.370
channels at the same time.

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:25.800
So one person might only
upload videos.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.700
Another person might do
all the SEO work.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:31.450
And a third person approves
everything and publishes it.

00:08:31.450 --> 00:08:33.700
So this is really designed
as a kind of multi-user

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.570
environment.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.419
When you log in the first thing
you see is dashboard.

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:40.320
And this shows you some
high-level metrics like how

00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.039
your viewers are currently
developing, what your traffic

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:46.480
sources are, where you get
your traffic, what social

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.520
engagement numbers
are, and so on.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.600
And you also see that's
important for business users

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.390
and content creators alike,
professionals.

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:56.860
You see what your competitors
are up to.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.460
So we have this online
video grader score.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:02.170
It's basically a score between
0 and 100 points

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:03.070
that you can get.

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:05.290
It really measures how
successful your YouTube

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.940
channel is performing, how many
viewers you get, how many

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.250
social sharing activities you're
triggering, how you are

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:14.980
using videos on your
website, and so on.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:18.030
And so you can configure what
your competitors are and keep

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:18.630
an eye on them.

00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:21.340
You get alerts when they
publish successful

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:22.170
videos and so on.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.420
So it's really an easy way
to get on top of things.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.390
Then when you dig a little bit
more in depth-- so I'm logged

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.490
in here as one of our customers,
dailygrommet.com,

00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.140
which is an e-commerce website
that introduces a new

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.140
interesting product every day.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.880
They produce one
video per day.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.810
So a lot of high volume
production there.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.690
And they manage their channel
through our software.

00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:46.980
And here you basically see the
list of videos that you have.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:48.440
So that's very similar
to the video

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.470
manager in YouTube itself.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.510
But the difference is you
have some workflow

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.420
functionality here.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:56.570
So for instance, this progress
bar shows you at all times how

00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.520
far advanced you are in treating
this video optimally

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.750
for business purposes for
reaching out to people.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:08.410
So I click on here on one
example video I see that I'm

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.280
currently done with uploading
my video, but I still have

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.800
some work to do with SEO.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:17.360
So it gives me a warning here
saying that I need to work on

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.380
my description text,
for instance.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.980
So we baked in a lot of best
practices from our experience,

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.120
from our customer's experience,
about what makes a

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.300
video on YouTube really
successful for SEO purposes

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:31.965
and for discovery just to
get found by people.

00:10:31.965 --> 00:10:32.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
that was going

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.210
to be my next question.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.090
So all these scores are actually
actionable, right?

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:36.570
ANDREAS GOELDI: Yes.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:39.950
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: The marketer
or content creator strives to

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.220
achieve 100%.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:41.810
ANDREAS GOELDI: Yup.

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:42.580
Exactly.

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.320
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: But you give
them suggestions about things

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.150
that they should do to really
improve the metrics that

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:47.850
you're tracking.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:49.050
ANDREAS GOELDI: That's
exactly right.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:51.430
So as you type here in the
description field, for

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:53.700
instance, actually the
score goes up.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.930
So up to 100%.

00:10:55.930 --> 00:10:58.110
So you always know where
you stand and what

00:10:58.110 --> 00:10:59.960
you have to do next.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.430
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So let
me get that straight.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:02.860
So typing in some
random gibberish

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.250
increases my score to 100%?

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.500
ANDREAS GOELDI: No, no.

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.760
That's was just a
minor change.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.550
No, it actually looks at
how many different

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.520
keywords you're using--

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:09.830
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:10.730
ANDREAS GOELDI: --in
your space.

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.140
So it's really based on
what you need to do

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:15.340
to get found online.

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.040
And we also have kind
of a feedback loop.

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.800
So for instance, you can at
any time see how you are

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.760
measuring up on YouTube
search against

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:23.970
your text, for instance.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.270
In this case here
is a video about

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.180
particularly compact umbrella.

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.670
And we see that we are currently
ranking at number

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:34.150
seven for the keyword portable
umbrella and number three for

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.910
travel umbrella.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:35.950
So that's pretty good.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.930
And you get a lot of this SEO
feedback all the time so that

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:42.040
you know if people are actually
able to find you for

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.460
long tail searchers.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.840
Also part of this is, of
course, analytics.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.880
We basically tap into YouTube
analytics and add some value

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.230
on top of that, especially
making the whole thing easier

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:55.770
to understand for
business users.

00:11:55.770 --> 00:11:59.220
So we're not just giving
you the raw numbers.

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.330
But we also tell you what the
next three things are that you

00:12:02.330 --> 00:12:03.060
should be doing.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:05.730
In this case here, this channel
here increased traffic

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.550
from embedded players
by a lot.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:08.670
So that's great.

00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:12.740
But you also have to do some
work here in SEO and link

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:16.280
building campaigns on external
sites so people know

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.680
immediately what the next
step should be.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.140
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: What's a
link building campaign?

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:21.900
ANDREAS GOELDI: Well, basically
we are seeing that a

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.940
lot of success for YouTube
videos really comes from links

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:28.030
from external sites to
your video pages, to

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:29.160
your channel page.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.290
And reaching out to bloggers,
for instance, to link to your

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.040
channel directly is something
that really

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.760
helps you assess your--

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.100
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:36.820
I see.

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.110
Is subscriber count something
that your

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:39.630
also tracking as isometric?

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:40.270
ANDREAS GOELDI: Absolutely.

00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.150
We're looking at that as well.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.150
The reality of that is frankly
that for more marketing

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.840
oriented users subscribers
tend to

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.520
be a bit less important.

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:51.440
So it's mostly important for
producers of original content.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.680
And that's definitely an
important metric as well.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:53.570
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:54.510
Great.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:56.430
JEREMY WALKER: So this is
a really fascinating.

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.630
Can you tell us a little
bit about the actual

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:01.980
implementation you did with
the YouTube APIs?

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.020
Whatever you're comfortable
with.

00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.510
And maybe even the language
you used?

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.080
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sure, sure.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.780
I would say we are probably
using almost every part of the

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:11.490
YouTube API.

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.450
We are using definitely the
Data API, allow people to

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:19.930
upload videos to modify metadata
and all that stuff.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.370
We also use the Player API.

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:25.360
So we have some functionality
that lets people customize the

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.220
YouTube player when
they want to embed

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.220
videos on their website.

00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:30.600
And that's something that a lot
of people don't know that

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.090
this even exists.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:36.050
And finally, we used the Insight
API to pull down

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.500
statistics information.

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.310
So it's pretty broad really.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.240
And our system is actually
implemented in Python.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.380
Mostly we use MySQL and Redis
for data storage.

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.880
And we're currently hosted on
Amazon EC2 in the cloud.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.110
But from the beginning we really
decided to be totally

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:57.480
cloud agnostic so we can
actually move to a different

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.190
cloud at any time.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.720
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.370
ANDREAS GOELDI: Definitely
keeping an eye on Google's

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:03.870
Computes Cloud and other
possible solutions.

00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:04.800
JEREMY WALKER: That's
great to hear.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.250
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Have you
looked at the new Analytics

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:08.565
API that we have recently
launched?

00:14:08.565 --> 00:14:09.090
ANDREAS GOELDI: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:10.940
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: For those of
you who are watching, we have

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.900
recently removed the whitelist
requirement from the new

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:15.650
Analytics API.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:20.620
So historically we had the
Insight API, which is robust.

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:22.950
But it requires you to unzip
the file, and then

00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:24.460
[INAUDIBLE], and so forth.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.060
I think the new Analytics API is
a little bit easier to use.

00:14:27.060 --> 00:14:28.750
ANDREAS GOELDI: I think it's
much better from that

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.410
perspective.

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:33.050
And it also helps us a lot for
kind of the second part of our

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.710
product, which is audience
insight.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.380
And just maybe have a
quick look on that.

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.050
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Let's
take a look.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.450
ANDREAS GOELDI: So what people
typically ask us when they

00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:44.320
contact us for first time is
what kind of content should I

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.920
really create to be successful
on YouTube?

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.630
Because it's not really clear.

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:51.030
I mean, obviously when you're
a marketer it's not a 30

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.655
second commercial.

00:14:51.655 --> 00:14:53.750
That probably will not
fly on YouTube.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.320
If you're a traditional content
creator, you probably

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.960
have to change your style
a little bit to what you

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.380
normally do.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.380
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is cat videos
normally the answer?

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.940
ANDREAS GOELDI: Cat
videos is great.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.640
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Is that the
[INAUDIBLE] in your code?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.000
ANDREAS GOELDI: Cat yes.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.810
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cat video.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.405
ANDREAS GOELDI: If nothing
works, use cats and babies.

00:15:08.405 --> 00:15:09.450
It always flies.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.030
That's great.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.820
No, I mean that's actually
a question that a lot

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:13.530
of people ask us.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.170
How do I make a viral video?

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.370
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Sure.

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.070
ANDREAS GOELDI: And
the reality is

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:19.190
there's no proof in concept.

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:21.770
But you really have to
understand what your industry

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:24.210
is doing and what people
really like in terms of

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:25.890
content in your industry.

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.435
So we created this product
called The Video Radar that

00:15:28.435 --> 00:15:31.080
taps heavily into Insight
APIs, and

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.700
Search API, and so on.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:38.670
And it assembles, basically,
information from YouTube about

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.120
keywords that you
initially set to

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.840
that define your industry.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.060
So in this case here, we just
ran this analysis for a new

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.500
customer of ours, Rokenbok,
which is actually a very

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.870
successful user of YouTube
advertising especially.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:53.060
Some amazing videos.

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.200
They're a toy company.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.440
They make educational toys
where you can build very

00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:58.490
complex models.

00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:00.490
And it's very sophisticated
stuff.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:03.730
And they gave us a bunch of
keywords here that we use to

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.650
analyze their space
on YouTube.

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.010
And this first graph here shows
you the visualization of

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.180
what the most popular channels
in this whole

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.130
educational toy space are.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:15.570
So there's a company called
Bruder Toys, which is one of

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:16.590
their competitors.

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:18.970
There's Toys "R"
Us, of course.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:21.600
And there's K'NEX, another
competitor.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:26.180
And a bunch of just channels run
by individuals who happen

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.310
to be very fascinated by
these educational toys.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.470
So then from thereon you can
basically drill down into a

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.330
number of different metrics.

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.360
You can figure out how
many views in total

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.630
there are on the space.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:39.940
And how many relevant videos
are out there.

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:44.230
You can look at what the top 100
videos are in your space,

00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:46.930
who the most successful
content produces are.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:51.130
And finally, you can actually
drill down in full detail into

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.210
each of these channels and
figure out what they are doing

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:56.160
well and what they are
not doing so well.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.910
So here the number one ranked
channel, which is a competitor

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.000
of our customer, has
a lot of use.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.540
That's great.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.100
But they also have a relatively
moderate sentiment.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.990
So about equal number of
likes and dislikes.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:10.170
Not a tremendous amount
of Facebook

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.020
activity and Twitter activity.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:14.690
So you can use this information
to figure out what

00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:17.904
are these guys doing well, what
are success recipes that

00:17:17.904 --> 00:17:20.540
we should copy apart from
cats and babies.

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:23.614
And what should we avoid because
it clearly doesn't

00:17:23.614 --> 00:17:24.710
seem to fly?

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:27.740
We're also using this
information for ad targeting,

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:28.339
for instance.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.260
So we actually provide our
customers with a list of

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.530
channels that they can use
to promote their videos.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.730
And we also help them to find
the right online communities

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.100
for social engagement,
for social sharing.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.280
So it's a very broad tool that
helps people understand the

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:43.955
entire space.

00:17:43.955 --> 00:17:44.660
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Cool.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.610
JEREMY WALKER: That's great.

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:48.560
Just out of curiosity, did you
run into anything that was

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.920
counterintuitive using
the YouTube APIs?

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.610
Or anything that you kind
of saw some issues with?

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.400
ANDREAS GOELDI: Specifically
for the API--

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.940
so first of all, YouTube's API
is way more robust and mature

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:07.380
than other APIs, like
Facebook's, or Twitter's, or

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:10.750
especially LinkedIn, which tends
to never work at all.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.450
So it's a very robust API.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.160
But the surprise is that you
really have to still build a

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.860
bit of infrastructure
around it.

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:21.320
So a typical topic
is quota issues.

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.360
We are a very heavy
user of the API.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.500
And occasionally we run
into coda issues.

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:30.060
And you have to put in a lot
of functionality to really

00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:32.650
accommodate these issues
and work around them.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:35.360
So you have to catch all these
potential errors, and so on,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.850
and special cases.

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:40.175
So this needs a little bit of
infrastructure on the side of

00:18:40.175 --> 00:18:42.400
the API user really.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.245
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Similar
question to Bettina, when you

00:18:44.245 --> 00:18:46.920
were building the company,
building the product, anything

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.790
that really surprised you
about your audience?

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:50.090
Or about the space?

00:18:50.090 --> 00:18:53.840
Things that you felt like you
could use the previous

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.440
experience and it just
didn't apply?

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.910
Anything that you would
be willing to share?

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:01.650
BETTINA HEIN: Well, so the
commonality between the two

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:05.770
companies is the heavy text
analytics, right?

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.470
Text to speech software
is all about that.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:09.660
But here as well.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.820
I mean, we do a lot of analytics
on the metadata

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:17.830
surrounding all the videos
that we tap into.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:21.340
And one of the things from a
user perspective that I still

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.100
find astounding is that this
concept of, and I'll use air

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:30.950
quotes here, a "viral video"
still exists in the heads of

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:32.420
lots of people.

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:34.960
We'll just create a video and
we'll put it out there.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.670
And it will go viral.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:41.440
That concept still exists.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.030
Maybe not for the people
watching this webinar.

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.800
But out there, people that are
creating content don't really

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.430
know a lot about the metadata
optimization

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:51.510
that you have to do.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:54.700
And also that you have to see
a video as a member of the

00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.650
social network.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:20:00.040
One thing that Andreas didn't
really talk about very much in

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.210
the demo are our cross-platform
analytics.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:07.990
So looking at what videos are
being watched and commented on

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:11.420
via Facebook, on Twitter,
LinkedIn.

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:13.380
And we aggregate all
of that data.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:24.390
So the really advanced people
in the space, they look at

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.330
what a video is doing
in the social space.

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:31.190
They don't rely solely on
putting it up on YouTube and

00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:32.500
hoping that people will come.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:37.280
It's not a build it and
we will come scenario.

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.060
So you have to embed it.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.120
You have to work on
link building.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.400
You have to share it out
via different networks.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.020
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So I guess
what folks expect is you just

00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:50.740
put together this interesting
content, you put it out there,

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.280
and it'll go viral.

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.460
And the reality is not
quite like that.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.160
BETTINA HEIN: Yeah.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:55.660
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So you
need to do some--

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.870
BETTINA HEIN: Another astounding
thing is that often

00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:02.020
times the content that people
think they should be creating

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.880
is diametric to what
actually people are

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.980
watching in the space.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:07.500
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.200
BETTINA HEIN: That's why
we developed the radar.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:13.790
I mean, we've helped very
big companies and brands

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:18.110
completely change the kind of
content that they're creating,

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.660
what they're putting in there.

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:25.080
Because they're seeing, oh,
this will get zero views.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.630
There are no people watching
that associated with our brand

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:29.600
or our content.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:32.342
ANDREAS GOELDI: One great
example is the length, the

00:21:32.342 --> 00:21:33.250
duration of the video.

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.460
So most people still think that
a YouTube video has to be

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.120
a maximum of two minutes long
because people have such a

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.560
short attention span and they
will never watch it.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.840
And we can basically prove with
our technology in almost

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.915
every industry that that's
absolutely not true.

00:21:46.915 --> 00:21:47.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Not
true anymore.

00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:49.950
ANDREAS GOELDI: People watch
more and more long form

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:52.710
content on YouTube, up
to 20 minutes long.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.430
And if you really have
interesting content, if you

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:59.460
have something to say, people
will absolutely watch it.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.590
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So we still
have a little time left.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:04.670
Jeremy, we wanted to go
through the Q&amp;A--

00:22:04.670 --> 00:22:05.450
JEREMY WALKER: Sure.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.860
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: --part.

00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:07.670
I know we have a couple of
questions for the moderator.

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:08.900
So should we get to it?

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.830
Before we get into that, I
know you looked in the

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:11.890
Analytics API.

00:22:11.890 --> 00:22:14.450
Have you looked at the v3
version of the API as well?

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:14.850
ANDREAS GOELDI: Yes,
absolutely.

00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.940
We have actually started
to experiment with it.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:18.380
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Any
additional feedback?

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.600
ANDREAS GOELDI: Yes, it's
great, first of all.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:23.840
I think it's great because it's
very lean and efficient.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:24.550
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:22:24.550 --> 00:22:26.880
ANDREAS GOELDI: The old
API used to be a bit

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.080
heavy in some ways.

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.420
I mean, XML and so on.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.500
And now you have this very
lean JSON framework.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.540
And you can really shape it
in a way that it gives you

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.090
exactly the data
that you want.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.510
And that's really a great
advantage, I think especially

00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:41.050
for mobile developers.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:44.050
And I'm definitely looking
forward to switching to the

00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:44.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:44.370 --> 00:22:45.300
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Have you
tried the Python Client

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:45.930
Library yet?

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:46.340
ANDREAS GOELDI: Yes.

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.510
That's another great thing.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:51.750
I mean, the old library for G
Data was a bit, you know, old

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:52.060
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:52.730
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah,
we're stuck at

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.470
version one of the API.

00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.090
So old school.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:57.520
This is all about to change.

00:22:57.520 --> 00:22:57.960
ANDREAS GOELDI: Right, yeah.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:58.710
So it's great.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.200
It's great progress really.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.730
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.580
Well, we have a couple
questions.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.620
I'll start with the ones,
because there's quite a few

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.930
for you guys.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:11.095
So one of our questions is from
Paris, actually. "Most of

00:23:11.095 --> 00:23:14.970
the examples I see in this video
are related to business,

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:17.880
to consumer campaigns.

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:21.720
What advice for business to
business service delivery

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.555
companies do you have?" Like,
one size fits all?

00:23:24.555 --> 00:23:27.280
They just a little more
information on that.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:30.370
BETTINA HEIN: We actually
recently did a study of the

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:35.020
top 100 brands in the world,
how they are using YouTube.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:39.860
And among those are actually the
winners of our study, so

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:42.320
to speak, the number of views,
the number of videos that they

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.030
publish, are technology
companies.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:48.560
And often times they
are B2B companies.

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:52.360
And we see some really good
examples, for example, Intel

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.790
does really well with YouTube.

00:23:55.790 --> 00:23:58.160
Cisco does very well
with YouTube.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.530
And what you can learn from
those companies is actually

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:07.930
that you have to create content
that is interesting

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:10.410
for a broad mass of people.

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:12.430
But then you have to
segment it down.

00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:16.180
So Intel, for example, will have
examples that are for a

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.560
particular chipset.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.070
And they just have a developer
explaining the new

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:22.920
developments around what
they're doing, how

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:28.140
functionalities work, how this
works when you're integrating

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:31.370
this into the boards that
you're working on.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:35.280
And that doesn't have
to be totally sexy.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.910
The same goes for lots
of product videos.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:41.960
People really do a
lot of research.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:47.500
And most people know that
YouTube's search box is the

00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.230
second largest search
engine in the world.

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:52.190
So if you have a really
technical product and

00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:55.530
something that people usually
would want to see in action,

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:58.260
that's what works for
video very well.

00:24:58.260 --> 00:25:03.720
We had a milling company
do videos.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.680
And it was very interesting that
they wanted, for example,

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:10.670
they figured out that they had
to absolutely put no music on

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.780
their videos.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:14.520
Because people wanted
to hear the shavings

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.485
fall with the machine.

00:25:16.485 --> 00:25:17.360
JEREMY WALKER: That's amazing.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.030
BETTINA HEIN: So it really
depends on your vertical.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:26.390
And then another key is
to always use the

00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:27.460
content that you have.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.440
In email marketing for B2B
that works really well.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:33.170
Integrate those videos
in there.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:35.370
You'll get click-throughs.

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.650
Use it in trade shows.

00:25:36.650 --> 00:25:40.200
Use it in those B2B areas.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.050
JEREMY WALKER: Great, great.

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:46.270
Let's see we got another
one here for you.

00:25:46.270 --> 00:25:50.400
So "what advice would you get
for dealing with cultural

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.830
differences in positioning
video content?

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.940
Do you have any recommendations
that work best

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:56.980
for different parts
of the world?

00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:00.850
How's the approach effected?"

00:26:00.850 --> 00:26:05.190
BETTINA HEIN: Well, it's
definitely different.

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.430
YouTube's dominance is
not as big in some

00:26:08.430 --> 00:26:10.130
areas of the world.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:14.490
So if you have a YouTube only
strategy, in some countries

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.200
you may want to think
about that.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.950
For example, I think
in France--

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:22.070
I think this question is from
France-- if you're doing movie

00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:25.955
trailers, I think they have
[FRENCH], where people go if

00:26:25.955 --> 00:26:29.500
they're looking for movie
trailers instead of YouTube.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.020
But apart from that, I think you
have to be really in tune.

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:37.280
If you're doing a multi-national
strategy, you

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.220
have to be in tune with pop
culture and political

00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:43.040
developments in that
culture if you're

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.420
creating content for that.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.900
So let's say you're
targeting Greece.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.310
A Greek viewer will know
what Golden Dawn is.

00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:53.140
Whereas a Chinese viewer might
be very confused if you

00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.280
mentioned that.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.760
Another thing to be aware of is
that passionate communities

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.260
on YouTube are often
very international.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.770
So looking into that if you're
optimizing your metadata, your

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:11.490
tagging, your descriptions,
think about using not just

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:15.110
English, but also some other
languages if you're targeting

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:17.060
those international audiences.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.730
And a third thing is for
content creators, that

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.260
aesthetic tastes vary
often culturally.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:28.620
So for example, in Latin
America stark

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.760
lighting is very popular.

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:34.380
And color schemes are very
different than tastes would

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.648
be, for example, in
northern Europe.

00:27:36.648 --> 00:27:37.516
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Great.

00:27:37.516 --> 00:27:37.950
Great.

00:27:37.950 --> 00:27:39.920
That's some great information.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.170
Let's see.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:53.210
So the other one we have is,
of course, is Google

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.250
Developers hiring?

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.090
Jarek, you want to
take that one?

00:27:57.090 --> 00:27:57.800
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Andreas
was looking at me.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.610
I hoped you were going to
take the other one.

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:01.200
Yes.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.270
We are hiring.

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:06.550
Both YouTube Developers and
Developer Relations as well as

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:08.700
Google Developer Operations
is hiring.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.500
To find out more go to
developers.google.com/jobs

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:15.820
where you can see all the job
descriptions and the positions

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.760
that we have open.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.230
And as far as the type of work
we do we hang out in the

00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:22.780
studio every Wednesday.

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.980
But beyond that, and we were
going to mention that, we have

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.120
a bunch of speaking
engagements.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:31.460
Jeremy was just speaking at the
Silicon Valley Code Camp.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.860
That was last week, right?

00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:33.070
JEREMY WALKER: Yep.

00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:34.980
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I actually
came back from Mexico, where

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:39.670
we were hosting a Latin America
Google Developers

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:40.770
Group Summit.

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:44.230
So community leaders from a
number of Latin American

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:46.510
countries came together.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:49.460
We visited Telmex hub in Mexico,
which is just an

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.345
incubator, and shared
office space.

00:28:52.345 --> 00:28:53.650
So it quite exciting.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.220
And then we have a number of
events actually coming up

00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:58.940
where we'll be speaking.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.660
I think DevFest West is coming
up this weekend.

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:02.600
JEREMY WALKER: This
weekend, right.

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:03.870
We'll be speaking there.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:04.190
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Yeah.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:08.130
And then if anybody's actually
watching from Korea, we're

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:13.450
looking to participate in an
event there mid-November.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:17.680
So again, if you would like
to join us, please go to

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.860
developers.google.com/jobs
and learn more there.

00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:22.620
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.990
We actually have a couple
more questions.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:27.360
BETTINA HEIN: And Pixability
is hiring as well.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:34.120
So if devs are interested
in YouTube, absolutely.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:34.440
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.730
Well, we have a couple
more questions

00:29:35.730 --> 00:29:36.410
that we'll fly through.

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:37.870
And then we'll close it out.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:43.320
So "how do captions provided in
English on YouTube videos,

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.090
for example in French,
effect SEO?"

00:29:48.090 --> 00:29:51.010
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: So captions
are definitely something very

00:29:51.010 --> 00:29:52.270
important for SEO.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:29:55.480
And if you can upload multiple
language versions, that's

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.770
definitely helpful.

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.850
We typically recommend if you're
really going with a

00:29:59.850 --> 00:30:04.660
multilingual strategy, it
typically makes sense to

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.090
separate out your channels
by language group.

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.200
Simply because then you can
really optimize playlists and

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.390
all the metadata around the
channel, even the channel

00:30:12.390 --> 00:30:15.260
design for the specific
market.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:18.530
But uploading captions
is a very good idea.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:19.850
It really helps.

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:20.120
JEREMY WALKER: Great.

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:24.180
And then our last one that we
have time for, and this I

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:27.010
think is more general, "how much
of a shake up will things

00:30:27.010 --> 00:30:30.900
like Hangouts on air cause in
the brands or in YouTube

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:35.990
channels?"

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:37.540
ANDREAS GOELDI: In the
sense that brands

00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:38.810
will use that, or--

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:40.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I guess, maybe
the question is it's a

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:44.190
different type of video
engagement as an interactive

00:30:44.190 --> 00:30:44.720
experience, right?

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.526
Rather than video on demand.

00:30:46.526 --> 00:30:48.240
Do you see brands
adopting that?

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.390
Do you get approached about how
should people use that as

00:30:51.390 --> 00:30:53.690
a yet another way to connect
with the customers?

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:56.210
ANDREAS GOELDI: Occasionally
people ask us about how do I

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:58.225
do a live show like
this one here.

00:30:58.225 --> 00:30:58.550
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:30:58.550 --> 00:30:59.950
ANDREAS GOELDI: So that's
definitely something that

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.340
people start discovering
a little bit.

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:05.020
But I think it's still a few
years away at this point.

00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.780
Because most companies still are
struggling with developing

00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.340
their video strategy in the
first place just for standard

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:12.400
video content.

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.455
So I think it's attractive,
especially if you're going in

00:31:15.455 --> 00:31:19.290
the B2B sector and really have
to provide in depth content.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:20.690
And it's a great format.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:23.080
And we have been using
it at Pixability very

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.110
successfully as well.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:27.280
So we have a monthly live
webinar, which is actually

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.430
airing right now in competition
with this one.

00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:32.030
And this has been very
successful for us.

00:31:32.030 --> 00:31:33.410
So I think that's definitely
something that

00:31:33.410 --> 00:31:34.000
people should look at.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:34.240
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: I see.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:34.850
Great.

00:31:34.850 --> 00:31:35.630
So maybe--

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:36.580
BETTINA HEIN: Actually the
question came from

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.000
[? Cheryl ?]

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:37.750
[? Lock ?]

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:40.170
from Las Vegas, who's
a loyal viewer of

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.600
the Pixability webinar.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:41.970
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Oh, great

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:43.890
BETTINA HEIN: Hi, Cheryl.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:44.580
JAREK WILKIEWICZ: Thanks
for joining.

00:31:44.580 --> 00:31:45.340
So maybe I was wrong.

00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:47.810
Maybe the next gig is
not ESP, it's live.

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:52.600
So it's audio, video, live
video, and then ESP.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.330
All right, I think this is all
we have time for today.

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:58.040
So thank you very much for
visiting our studio.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.480
Have fun on the West Coast.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.360
