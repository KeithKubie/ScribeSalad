in earplugs or ear cuffs and that's

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239
in earplugs or ear cuffs and that's
 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.000
in earplugs or ear cuffs and that's
great until you really you need to

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010
great until you really you need to
 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.619

there in these you know these are pretty

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179
there in these you know these are pretty
 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.869
there in these you know these are pretty
important things to hear and so the the

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879
important things to hear and so the the
 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.399
important things to hear and so the the
idea is that you want to be able to

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409
idea is that you want to be able to
 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.010
idea is that you want to be able to
protect hearing but also preserves what

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020
protect hearing but also preserves what
 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.960
protect hearing but also preserves what
they call situational awareness like you

because about fifty percent of that
 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.749
because about fifty percent of that
comes from hearing even somebody riding

realize that so the military's challenge
 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:24.459
realize that so the military's challenge
has been to create a to come up with a

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:24.469
has been to create a to come up with a
 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.399
has been to create a to come up with a
way to protect hearing but also enable

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409
way to protect hearing but also enable
 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.840
way to protect hearing but also enable
you to hear more quiet noises so there's

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850
you to hear more quiet noises so there's
 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.370
you to hear more quiet noises so there's
something in the special operations they

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380
something in the special operations they
 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.840
something in the special operations they
have something that they're using which

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850
have something that they're using which
 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.760
have something that they're using which
is really cool it's these ear cuffs that

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770
is really cool it's these ear cuffs that
 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.020
is really cool it's these ear cuffs that
magically not magically it's technology

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030
magically not magically it's technology
 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.090
magically not magically it's technology
but they they attenuate loud noise they

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100
but they they attenuate loud noise they
 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.709
but they they attenuate loud noise they
minimize loud noises they sense

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719
minimize loud noises they sense
 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.149
minimize loud noises they sense
something that's over a certain decibel

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159
something that's over a certain decibel
 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.660
something that's over a certain decibel
level cut that but amplify quiet noises

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670
level cut that but amplify quiet noises
 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.940
level cut that but amplify quiet noises
like a human voice so you put these on

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950
like a human voice so you put these on
 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.770
like a human voice so you put these on
and when they're when they're switched

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780
and when they're when they're switched
 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.719
and when they're when they're switched
on its kind of amazing it's like you can

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729
on its kind of amazing it's like you can
 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:01:59.980
on its kind of amazing it's like you can
you're kind of like the Bionic Woman

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990
you're kind of like the Bionic Woman
 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.450
you're kind of like the Bionic Woman
you're able to hear a conversation

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460
you're able to hear a conversation
 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.469
you're able to hear a conversation
across the street so so that's the

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479
across the street so so that's the
 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.419
across the street so so that's the
challenge of military hearing how do you

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429
challenge of military hearing how do you
 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.010
challenge of military hearing how do you
the other thing the other thing that's

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020
the other thing the other thing that's
 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.100
the other thing the other thing that's
that's tough is that when really not

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110
that's tough is that when really not
 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.780
that's tough is that when really not
know starts happening there's no warning

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790
know starts happening there's no warning
 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.570
know starts happening there's no warning
so you could be going along for hours in

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580
so you could be going along for hours in
 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.930
so you could be going along for hours in
a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940
a
 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.510
a
convoy and there's no there's not any

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520
convoy and there's no there's not any
 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.850
convoy and there's no there's not any
firefight or anything going on but

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860
firefight or anything going on but
 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.040
firefight or anything going on but
suddenly an IE D goes off with so you

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050
suddenly an IE D goes off with so you
 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.960
suddenly an IE D goes off with so you
you don't you don't have any warning to

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
you don't you don't have any warning to
 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.000
you don't you don't have any warning to
put in put on or in your ear protection

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010
put in put on or in your ear protection
 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.280
put in put on or in your ear protection
so that's the other challenge and it's

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290
so that's the other challenge and it's
 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.050
so that's the other challenge and it's
hard to convince a soldier to wear a

heavy headset the entire eight hours
that they're driving somewhere so you

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310
that they're driving somewhere so you
