00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, with a little bit of math, we realize that this is 80%.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The way to calculate this is 724,000 is the votes that party A received,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but the total number of votes was 724,000 plus 181,000,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is 724,000 over 905,000.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
That's exactly 0.8, which is the same as 80%.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It follows that party B got 20%.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You get to that number when you replace 724,000 with 181,000--the number of party B.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It turns out 181,000 divided by 905,000 is exactly 0.2.

00:00:42.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This is exactly 5 times as large as this number over here.
