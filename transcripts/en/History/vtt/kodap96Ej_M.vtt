00:00:01.501 --> 00:00:06.297
NARRATOR: On June 6, 1944,

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:08.425
stormed the beaches of Normandy.

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:12.554
23,400 more landed
from the skies.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:16.015
It became known as
D-Day, the major turning

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.767
point of World War II.

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.769
But it almost never happened.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.062
Why?

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:23.565
Well, try getting
three of the biggest

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:25.316
personalities in
history to agree

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:27.652
on something at the same time.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.864
In September of 1939,
Britain officially

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.532
entered World War II.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:36.453
In 1940, Winston Churchill
became Prime Minister, standing

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.580
alone against Nazi Germany.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.167
Across the sea, Britain's
close ally, the United States,

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.293
remained neutral.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:45.587
President Franklin
Delano Roosevelt

00:00:45.587 --> 00:00:48.923
yearned to support his friend,
but for the American people,

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.425
it was a different story.

00:00:50.425 --> 00:00:53.428
Traumatized by the Great
Depression and the horrors

00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.972
of World War I, most
Americans favored

00:00:55.972 --> 00:00:58.683
isolationism over intervention.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:01.978
But they couldn't remain
isolated for long.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:06.566
On December 7, 1941, Japan
attacked Pearl Harbor.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:09.194
Neutrality was no
longer an option.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:13.281
Less than 24 hours later,
Congress declared war on Japan.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.452
By the end of the week, Germany
had declared war on the US.

00:01:17.452 --> 00:01:20.330
From the beginning, US
President Franklin Roosevelt

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.790
and British Prime
Minister Winston

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.875
Churchill agreed on one thing--

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:27.295
an Allied victory would
require a massive invasion

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:28.797
of mainland Europe.

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:31.007
They just needed to get
their other ally, Russia's

00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:33.134
leader Joseph Stalin, on board.

00:01:33.134 --> 00:01:35.470
Back in the Soviet
Union, Stalin was

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.973
getting slammed, fighting the
Nazis in the eastern theater.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:40.975
Attacking mainland
Europe and diverting

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.977
Nazi troops to the
west could ease

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:44.729
pressure on the Soviet army.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.606
So Stalin was in.

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:50.151
But opening a front in the
West was easier said than done.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.654
Internal pressures,
lack of resources,

00:01:52.654 --> 00:01:55.073
and constantly
changing circumstances

00:01:55.073 --> 00:01:57.742
pushed back the date
for a Western invasion.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.577
And there was another problem--

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:00.829
Japan.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:02.956
The US had its own
war in the Pacific

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:06.292
that required ships,
landing crafts, and troops.

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:08.586
They just couldn't provide
resources to launch

00:02:08.586 --> 00:02:10.797
a successful attack in Europe.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.591
Instead, Roosevelt's
advisors proposed

00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:17.720
Operation Sledgehammer, a plan
to seize ports along France's

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.765
northwest coast and then
conduct a major invasion

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.184
in the spring of 1943.

00:02:23.184 --> 00:02:26.271
Churchill's team countered
with Operation Torch.

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:28.356
The Americans would
invade Northwest

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:32.485
Africa, relieving British
forces defending the Suez Canal.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:35.155
Churchill argued this
would improve relations

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:39.325
with the increasingly impatient
Soviets and lift Allied morale.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.994
The Americans agreed.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:44.956
A large scale attack on mainland
Europe would have to wait.

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.499
But it couldn't wait long.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:48.418
Stalin was getting desperate.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:50.712
If Churchill and
Roosevelt took too long

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.881
to offer military
relief for Russia,

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:56.301
Stalin might call for a
peace agreement with Hitler.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:59.971
Roosevelt still couldn't
commit to a mainland invasion.

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:03.474
But in January of 1943,
he agreed to invade

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:05.476
the soft underbelly of Europe--

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.061
Sicily.

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:09.856
The Allies overran the
island, but once they crossed

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.567
into mainland Italy, they were
bogged down with high costs

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.110
draining resources.

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.404
The rough terrain with
fierce German resistance in

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:19.073
southern Italy eroded morale.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:23.703
In November 1943, Roosevelt,
Churchill, and Stalin met.

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:26.164
They could no longer
wait to invade France.

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.499
The time was now.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.919
Allied generals Dwight
Eisenhower and Bernard

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.837
Montgomery suggested a plan--

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.714
Operation Overlord.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:38.134
A full-on invasion of Normandy.

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:40.678
Stalin saw it as the only way.

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:42.430
Churchill was skeptical.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.558
He feared it would be a heavy
and hazardous adventure, paid

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.019
for with human life and blood.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.812
But he agreed.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:51.522
The plan was risky.

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:55.318
It hinged on cooperative weather
and the element of surprise.

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:57.612
If the Nazis caught
wind of their plan,

00:03:57.612 --> 00:04:01.157
the Allies would undoubtedly
suffer a violent defeat.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:04.035
Hitler knew an invasion
of France was coming.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:07.997
It was only a matter of
when, where, and how many.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:10.667
So the Allies set up
an elaborate campaign

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.378
of disseminating
misinformation in an effort

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.296
to trick the Nazis.

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:19.759
On June 6, 1944, Hitler
was caught off-guard.

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:24.847
132,600 American, British,
and Canadian forces

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:28.685
landed on five beaches along
the Normandy coast of France,

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:32.855
in the largest amphibious
military assault in history.

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:36.442
An additional
23,400 troops landed

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.611
inland by parachute or glider.

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.489
The fighting lasted
until September.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:45.159
While the plan was an ultimate
success, Churchill was right.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:47.996
On D-Day alone,
over 4,000 Allied

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:50.873
troops were confirmed
dead, and thousands

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:52.959
were wounded or missing.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.128
The total casualties
for the invasion

00:04:55.128 --> 00:04:59.048
included nearly
37,000 Allied dead.

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:00.842
Their efforts were not in vain.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:04.804
By the end of September,
1944, all of northern France

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.222
was liberated.

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:08.891
Seven months later,
Allied forces would

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.103
finally defeat Nazi Germany.
