00:00:13.853 --> 00:00:15.377
Would you believe that walruses,

00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:16.249
rattlesnakes,

00:00:16.273 --> 00:00:17.424
and parakeets

00:00:17.448 --> 00:00:20.084
all once lived in the same house?

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:23.418
Let's go back about 350 million years.

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:24.390
Look around.

00:00:24.414 --> 00:00:27.677
Steamy swamps and rain forests
of horsetails and ferns

00:00:27.701 --> 00:00:29.021
cover the region.

00:00:29.045 --> 00:00:31.689
Amphibians are the dominant
land vertebrates.

00:00:31.713 --> 00:00:33.689
They range in size from newts

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:34.859
to crocodiles.

00:00:34.883 --> 00:00:38.152
And all require water
to do their egg laying.

00:00:38.176 --> 00:00:39.605
If they don't go to the water,

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.641
their shell-less, jelly-like
eggs will dry out.

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:43.711
Because of this hazard,

00:00:43.735 --> 00:00:45.116
they spend most of their time

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.214
living in or near fresh water.

00:00:47.238 --> 00:00:49.770
That is, until a breakthrough

00:00:49.794 --> 00:00:51.996
in evolution changes everything:

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.022
the amniotic egg.

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:55.987
The amniotic egg is shelled,

00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:57.005
waterproof,

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:59.076
and can be laid on dry land.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.935
It is produced by the amniotes,

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:04.702
a new group of animals named
after their revolutionary egg.

00:01:04.726 --> 00:01:06.526
The first amniote is a tetrapod,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.606
a four-legged animal,

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.614
resembling a small lizard.

00:01:09.638 --> 00:01:11.860
While some amphibians
can walk around on land

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:15.367
and bury their eggs in wet
soil or highly humid areas,

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.838
nothing before the amniotes
has the ability

00:01:17.862 --> 00:01:20.589
to lay its eggs on completely dry land.

00:01:20.613 --> 00:01:22.334
Because of this evolved egg,

00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:24.219
the amniotes are the first animals

00:01:24.243 --> 00:01:27.879
with the ability to live
a fully terrestrial life.

00:01:27.903 --> 00:01:29.714
But, despite their move inland,

00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:31.215
the amniotes have not abandoned

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:33.179
their pond-dwelling upbringing.

00:01:33.203 --> 00:01:36.304
In fact, the amniotic egg
brings the pond with them

00:01:36.328 --> 00:01:39.605
by enclosing the aquatic
environment within its shell.

00:01:39.629 --> 00:01:41.881
This is achieved by four main upgrades

00:01:41.905 --> 00:01:44.146
that are unique to amniotic eggs.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.518
Let's take a closer look.

00:01:45.542 --> 00:01:47.655
The first development is the most obvious:

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:49.477
the egg's protective shell.

00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:50.909
It's tough but flexible,

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:52.412
and has a leathery surface,

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:55.045
still seen in reptile eggs today.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.117
The shell protects
the eggs from predators,

00:01:57.141 --> 00:01:57.671
bacteria,

00:01:57.695 --> 00:01:58.432
damage,

00:01:58.456 --> 00:01:59.729
and drying out.

00:01:59.753 --> 00:02:01.748
But, unlike the walls of a fish tank,

00:02:01.772 --> 00:02:04.215
the shell of the amniotic egg is porous,

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.048
allowing oxygen to pass through

00:02:06.072 --> 00:02:09.738
so that the growing amniote
inside doesn't suffocate.

00:02:09.762 --> 00:02:12.515
The next two developments
are two separate membranes

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:14.599
that work together like a pair of lungs.

00:02:14.623 --> 00:02:16.737
They bring oxygen into the embryo

00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:18.811
while removing carbon dioxide.

00:02:18.835 --> 00:02:20.820
The first is the chorion,

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:23.511
which is the protective layer
that oxygen passes through

00:02:23.535 --> 00:02:25.694
after entering the shell's tiny pores.

00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:27.381
You may recognize the chorion

00:02:27.405 --> 00:02:30.870
as the thin skin you peel
away on a hard boiled egg.

00:02:30.894 --> 00:02:32.618
Think of this waterproof membrane

00:02:32.642 --> 00:02:35.112
as the in and out doors of the egg.

00:02:35.136 --> 00:02:36.582
It's the entrance for oxygen

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:39.148
and exit for carbon dioxide.

00:02:39.172 --> 00:02:41.126
The membrane working with the chorion

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.786
is the allantois.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.170
If the chorion is the doors,

00:02:44.194 --> 00:02:47.217
then the allantois is essentially
the lobby of the building.

00:02:47.241 --> 00:02:49.630
It directs the oxygen and carbon dioxide

00:02:49.654 --> 00:02:51.273
while simultaneously storing

00:02:51.297 --> 00:02:53.279
unneeded waste from the embryo.

00:02:53.303 --> 00:02:55.684
The chorion and the allantois
make sure the embryo

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.017
has everything it needs

00:02:57.041 --> 00:02:59.217
and gets rid of anything it doesn't.

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:01.676
The last and perhaps
the most important development

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.109
is the amnion, the membrane
for which the egg is named.

00:03:05.133 --> 00:03:08.022
The amnion is also contained
within the chroion

00:03:08.046 --> 00:03:10.654
and holds the fluid
in which the embryo floats.

00:03:10.678 --> 00:03:13.409
Because it has left the watery
world of the amphibians,

00:03:13.433 --> 00:03:15.664
the amnion is necessary for preventing

00:03:15.688 --> 00:03:17.246
the embryo from drying out.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.018
It is the transportable pond

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:22.128
that allows the amniote
to lay the egg on dry land.

00:03:22.152 --> 00:03:23.837
Its fluid also protects the embryo

00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.174
from any collisions or rough landings,

00:03:26.198 --> 00:03:28.967
like a shock absorber on your bike or car.

00:03:28.991 --> 00:03:31.339
Together, the shell
and these four membranes

00:03:31.363 --> 00:03:33.392
create a safe, watery environment

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:35.486
for the embryo to grow and develop.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.890
The new amniote offspring will continue

00:03:37.914 --> 00:03:39.734
the process of vertebrate evolution

00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:42.688
as it explores new land
away from the water.

00:03:42.712 --> 00:03:44.556
They will spend the next million years

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.443
splitting into two distinct groups:

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:48.693
the synapsids and sauropsids.

00:03:48.717 --> 00:03:50.529
Synapsida is the group of animals

00:03:50.553 --> 00:03:51.642
that contain mammals,

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:53.762
while sauropsida
is the group that contains

00:03:53.786 --> 00:03:54.409
reptiles,

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:55.051
birds,

00:03:55.075 --> 00:03:56.316
and dinosaurs.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.180
These two amniotic groups
collectively contain

00:03:59.204 --> 00:03:59.788
the walruses,

00:03:59.812 --> 00:04:00.539
rattlesnakes,

00:04:00.563 --> 00:04:02.665
and parakeets we know today.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:03.707
Like a family reunion,

00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:06.040
with relatives of every shape and size,

00:04:06.064 --> 00:04:08.541
coming together from different
corners of the Earth,

00:04:08.565 --> 00:04:11.151
these animals can all call one place home:

00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:13.596
the amniotic egg.
