00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.402
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.832 --> 00:00:09.234
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.160
ZELDA LA GRANGE:
Thank you, Natalie.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.580
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.300
Good afternoon.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.410
Thank you very much,
Rob, also, for having us.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.920
It's an honor to be in London,
although this weather gets

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.490
to me every time I visit London.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.982
Thanks, Natalie.

00:00:25.982 --> 00:00:27.523
NATALIE MAYHEW:
Thank you for coming.

00:00:27.523 --> 00:00:30.670
So how did you
then become to work

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.790
for him within his company?

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.380
And how did your family take
it, I suppose, the change?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.020
ZELDA LA GRANGE: In
1994, Mr. Mandela

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.030
became the first democratically
elected president in April of--

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.980
May 1994.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.910
And in October of that
year, I applied for a job

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.730
in his extended office.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.090
He had a few ministers
in his office.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.840
And one of the ministers,
it was good for a minister

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.360
without portfolio.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.740
So I looked at the ad.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.720
And I was only
driven by the fact

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.390
that I needed a job
closer to my parents' home

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.840
because I was still living with
them at the age of 23, which

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.810
no child should do
at the age of 23.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.310
I was living with
my parents, and I

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.620
needed a job closer to home.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.370
So that was the one thing that
was attractive about the job

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:26.950
that the Union Buildings in
which the president's head

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.220
office is situated was
close to my parents' home.

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.940
And secondly, the job
was also advertised

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.690
that you would do six months
duty in Pretoria, which

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.100
is the administrative capital.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.660
It's about 20 miles, I
think, from Johannesburg.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.470
I'm not sure about
miles and kilometers,

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.580
but about 20 miles
from Johannesburg.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.436
And then you could
spend six months--

00:01:50.436 --> 00:01:52.060
the rest of the six
months of the year,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.677
you could spend in Cape Town.

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:55.510
Now, you all know, if
you know South Africa,

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.520
everyone knows about Cape Town.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.230
And even as a young
South African,

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.710
we all just want
to go to Cape Town.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.430
So the job was advertised
as part of a sessional duty

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.690
office, so you could spend six
months of the year in Pretoria,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.070
and then when Parliament
is in session in Cape Town,

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.440
you would spend the six
months in Cape Town.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.960
Those two things
were the only things

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.900
that I was interested
in when I applied

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.530
for the job in the
ministry without portfolio.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.840
I thought to myself,
well, because there's

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.840
no portfolio attached
to this minister,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.644
the job couldn't
be too complicated.

00:02:35.644 --> 00:02:37.060
I thought to myself,
this minister

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.300
doesn't even have a job because
he doesn't have a portfolio.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.120
So I thought to myself,
apply for the job

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.150
and see how it goes.

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.160
And of course, never
thinking that I would end up

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.930
in Mr. Mandela's office.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.360
So I was invited for an
interview in the head

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.470
office of the presidency.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.740
And during the
interview, I was still

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.930
conversing with the HR people.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.320
And the door flung open,
and this very flamboyant,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.380
beautifully dressed
black lady entered.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.240
Her name was Mary.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.670
And she was the president's--

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.760
President Mandela's private
secretary at the time.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.920
Now, if you don't believe
in fate or destiny,

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.940
then this story will make you
believe in fate and destiny.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.910
I sat in that office
when Mary entered.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.970
And she really just physically
burst into the office

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.580
without announcement
and interrupting us.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.740
And she just said,
I need an assistant,

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:30.790
and I need it right now.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.070
And I didn't care
what color she is.

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.470
And I thought to
myself, I'm your person.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.370
You need someone?

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.880
I need a job, yeah.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.800
You know, the two of
us, it's meant to be.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.210
And she left.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.260
We never got introduced.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.130
And I was never
told who she was.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.280
And after the interview, they
called me, and they said,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.390
would you be interested in
a job in President Mandela's

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.460
private office?

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:56.170
And I thought to
myself, private,

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.020
it sounds dangerous, actually.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:02.650
I thought, well, I hope I never
expected to go to his house.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.310
Because now, remember, I'm still
very afraid of this person.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.270
With the same conservative
mindset, I thought,

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.020
if I work in a bigger office,
I could just disappear.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.630
So a private office, you
know, didn't sound right.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.690
And so I said, is this job in
the Union Buildings in the head

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.510
office, because I
was trying to avoid

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.550
to go to a private office.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.760
They said, yes, yes, it's
in the Union Buildings.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.070
I said, and would
I be able to do

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.760
sessional duties, six months
Pretoria, six months Cape Town.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.450
They said, yes.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.130
I said, I'm sold--

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.440
never asking questions about
how big is this private office,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.480
you know, who would
I be working for,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.260
would I ever have to
meet the president.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.140
Never asking those questions.

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.960
It was just the logistics
that made sense to me

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.470
and that was attractive to me.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.740
And so I said yes.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.130
And of course, then I realized--

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.330
the first day, I started my
job in the Union Buildings.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.390
I thought at first that
I made a big mistake.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.850
I walked into this
very stately office.

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.280
It's like 10 Downing Street.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.300
And you walk into his
office, and the doors

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.740
open by motion detector.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.240
And it's very stately
inside and very formal.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.040
And you can hardly hear a pin
drop, and all this grandeur

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.280
and beautiful carpets
and everything.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.380
And then I met
one or two people,

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.300
and I thought, well,
where is the rest?

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.517
Where's the other 200 people
I'm expecting to find here?

00:05:33.517 --> 00:05:35.100
And they said, no,
no, no, we are only

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.060
five people in the
president's private office.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.230
So for the first few
weeks in my job there,

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.690
whenever I heard the
president arriving,

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.370
I would just lock
my door quickly,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.560
my office door, the
door to my office,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.580
and hide, because I
thought, we can never meet.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.520
I just can't meet this person.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.130
And you know, he's
the president now.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:02.580
And I also kind of feel
ashamed for Apartheid.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.800
And I'm understanding a
little bit more, of course,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.460
now of the environment.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.830
But I thought, it's just not
proper that we ever meet.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.131
So I would really hide
for the first few weeks.

00:06:12.131 --> 00:06:14.130
NATALIE MAYHEW: It's
astonishing to go from that

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.570
to where you ended up.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:21.990
So the title of this book is
"Good Morning, Mr. Mandela."

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.400
But that came from a
watershed moment, didn't it?

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.460
So I know because
I've read the book.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.010
But how did that happen?

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:32.280
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Yeah, so
two weeks into the job,

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.070
I walked into Mary's
office because, of course,

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.990
I was now employed by her.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.030
I walked into her
office to deliver

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.790
a pile of books or something.

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.030
And suddenly, this group of
people, a crowd of people

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.160
exited her office, all men, all
of them dressed in dark suits.

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:53.280
They're wearing
sunglasses indoors.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.130
They have hearing aids, and
they have all this technology,

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.390
speaking to their watches.

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.000
And you're realizing, oh,
this is like bodyguards.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.210
These are definitely the
stereotype bodyguards.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.880
And immediately, you
realize, well, these people

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.870
are all armed so you need to
behave in a different way now.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.240
Don't make sudden movements.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.560
And then things started
happening in slow motion for me

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.350
because this moment
was so important.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.870
And from this crowd
of people emerged

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.180
President Mandela, the
first democratically

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.320
elected black president
of South Africa.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.330
And the first
thing, of course, I

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.560
say to him was, good
morning, Mr. Mandela.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.530
And he extended his hand to me.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.040
And I thought, well, what
am I supposed to do now.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.100
And now, you must remember,
I'm 23 years of age.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.030
I'm young.

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:46.240
I'm naive.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.800
I'm stupid.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.800
I am vulnerable, extremely
vulnerable still.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.160
And he's extending
his hand to me.

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.520
And I thought-- it was like
moments that I thought, well,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.410
should I run away.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:03.577
Can I turn around and
run down this corridor?

00:08:03.577 --> 00:08:05.660
And then I realized, well,
these people all armed.

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:07.409
They're going to shoot
you on this carpet.

00:08:07.409 --> 00:08:08.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.050
There's going to be
blood everywhere.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:10.680
Don't run.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.690
You can't run.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.482
And then the first
thing you notice

00:08:14.482 --> 00:08:16.440
when you meet Nelson
Mandela for the first time

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.550
was this incredible
kindness in his eyes,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:24.780
the sincerity of his smile,
this infectious smile of his.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.750
And he looked at me, still
waiting for me to do something.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:28.692
And I took his hand.

00:08:28.692 --> 00:08:30.150
And throughout the
conversation, he

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:34.770
held my hand into a firm
grip, just holding onto it.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.052
And then there was a pause.

00:08:36.052 --> 00:08:38.010
He was saying something,
and there was a pause.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:40.051
And I realized, well, he
just asked me something.

00:08:40.051 --> 00:08:43.500
But I have no idea
what he just asked.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.450
And I had to ask him
to repeat himself.

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:48.130
So I said, excuse
me, Mr. President.

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:50.700
So when he repeated
himself, I realized

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.510
he was speaking to me in
Afrikaans, my home language

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.700
and the language of the
white people, the language

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.790
of the oppressor
in South Africa.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:01.470
And I heard him
say over the years

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.470
that when you speak to a
man, it goes to his head,

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:06.810
but when you speak to
a man in his language,

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:08.884
it goes to his heart.

00:09:08.884 --> 00:09:10.050
That's what he did that day.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.920
By holding onto my hand and
speaking to me in Afrikaans,

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.080
he destroyed my
defenses immediately,

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.650
and he opened me up to
the rest of my life.

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.860
That was the watershed
moment for me

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.680
because I then found this
person in front of me.

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.870
We stood there for
about seven minutes.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.850
Well, it felt like two years.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:33.180
But he asked about
my upbringing.

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.950
Luckily, he didn't
ask what I voted.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:35.450
OK?

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.250
Because I think that was
going to be the last--

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:38.960
no, not really.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.460
He asked about my family.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.800
He asked about my
upbringing, about my parents,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:48.100
everything, these very
unimportant things, really.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.270
And I felt respected for
that moment, standing there.

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.880
And I felt undeserving.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.330
Because of course, then, I knew
of the history of South Africa,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.590
what happened in my country.

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:01.860
And immediately, you
feel responsible,

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.140
because the person you
find in front of you

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.470
is completely the opposite
of what you were taught

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:08.910
to believe about this man.

00:10:08.910 --> 00:10:10.110
He's friendly.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.340
He's kind.

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.750
He's extremely caring
in just his personality.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.720
So you know what women do best
in a situation like that then?

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.360
We start crying as well.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.130
Still holding his
hand, now, that tears

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.020
are rolling down my face.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.730
And I try and answer
whatever he was asking.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:30.354
And he saw I was crying.

00:10:30.354 --> 00:10:32.270
And then he put his other
hand on my shoulder.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.210
And he said, no, no, no, relax,
you are overreacting now.

00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:39.510
Of course, he realized that I
felt responsible immediately,

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:42.920
and that I felt
sorry, and that I--

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.710
I was just overcome
with emotion.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:48.270
And that moment really
changed my entire life.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:51.600
Because I walked away from that
meeting wanting to know more,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.430
what happened in my country.

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:56.400
Why these things that I
was told in the media,

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.320
in the church, my parents--

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.260
I had to question
my own upbringing

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.480
and have very difficult
conversations with people,

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:05.830
asking, why didn't you tell me.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.110
Why did you only present
one side of history to us?

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.470
And yeah, it was all
started by just that one

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.301
moment with Mr. Mandela.

00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:17.050
NATALIE MAYHEW: Do you
have any questions?

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:17.716
I'll keep going.

00:11:17.716 --> 00:11:18.290
I have loads.

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:24.110
AUDIENCE: I'm short, so
I might just take time.

00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.610
Hi.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:25.630
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Hello.

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:28.840
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
that this sort of role, job

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.620
can kind of consume a life, and
their life becomes your life.

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:37.711
Prior to you getting the first
role, what was your dream job?

00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:39.460
Or where did you think
it was going to be?

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.560
And do you ever
regret not pursuing

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.350
that over where you are now?

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.630
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Thank you, yes.

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:49.190
At the age of 23, I
really just wanted

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:52.000
a day job, something just
to earn a little money

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.570
to buy my makeup.

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:57.160
And I had no real
ambition at that point.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.010
My father was a businessman.

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.880
And he was a logistics manager
at the South African Breweries.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.150
And he had a very, very
effective personal assistant.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.970
And she really embraced me.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:16.060
And I wanted to be as
organized and performing

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.250
like Danny, who
was the secretary.

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:20.500
So that was who I
wanted to become.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.620
I wanted to marry and have
three children, three boys,

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.750
to be specific.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.790
But then, you
know, life happens.

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.140
Something happens along the way.

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:30.940
You don't recognize
these opportunities

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.260
when they come along.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.330
And as I said to you, destiny
and fate played a role.

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:39.400
And this is the life
that was handed to me.

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.270
And I always say to people
that when you talk of regret,

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:44.920
I look at Nelson Mandela's life.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.270
And I look at him spending
27 years in prison,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.960
away from his family,
away from life,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.290
sacrificing, really, his
life so that I could have

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:58.480
the freedom of speech,
the freedom of movement,

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.090
the freedom of
association today.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:04.030
So who am I to talk
about my sacrifices

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:05.710
in comparing my life to his?

00:13:05.710 --> 00:13:08.320
My sacrifices,
there was nothing.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.610
There was really none.

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.860
I would do everything
exactly the same

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:18.130
if I knew what I do
now, well, 25 years ago.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:24.140
And there's 7.5 billion
people on the planet now.

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.640
Right?

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.950
And I am that one person
who had this opportunity.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.117
So how do I dare
talk about regret?

00:13:31.117 --> 00:13:31.950
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:33.075
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Thank you.

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.660
AUDIENCE: Hi, Zelda, I'm
your fellow South African

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:38.875
and also, I guess, Afrikaner.

00:13:38.875 --> 00:13:39.180
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Hello.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.275
Oh, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:40.275 --> 00:13:41.840
AUDIENCE: I'm wearing my Madiba
t-shirt for you, as well.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.714
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Oh,
it's a fabulous t-shirt.

00:13:43.714 --> 00:13:44.560
Thank you.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.750
AUDIENCE: It was really
interesting to listen to you

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:48.200
talking about your upbringing.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.830
I mean, I was born two weeks
before the Soweto riots.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:57.150
So I know about indoctrination
by state and by family

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.404
and by church more
than most actually.

00:14:00.404 --> 00:14:02.320
I was just wondering,
what is your perspective

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.080
on how racial
attitudes have changed

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.350
for white people in South
Africa towards other races,

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:10.630
and particularly, I
guess, Afrikaners?

00:14:10.630 --> 00:14:11.710
Do you think we're there?

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:13.185
Do we have a long way to go?

00:14:13.185 --> 00:14:15.025
And where do you see it going?

00:14:15.025 --> 00:14:16.150
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Thank you.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.270
Yeah, I always say
to people, it feels

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.280
like we haven't made
progress, but we

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:25.210
have made a lot of
progress in South Africa.

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:27.190
Look at me.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.540
Change is possible.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.640
And we measure things
maybe differently

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.440
now because of technology.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.350
I think in South
Africa you will always

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.730
have-- in any society
across the world,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.550
you will have pockets of racism.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.630
People will just simply
refuse to change,

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.630
not for any good
reasoning, but people

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:45.880
who just don't want to change.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.022
And you'll always have
that in any society.

00:14:48.022 --> 00:14:49.480
South Africa,
specifically, I think

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.960
there's been massive,
massive progress

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.290
as far as racial
relationships are concerned.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.360
The problem, however,
there is that I

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.220
heard someone say that
we live in the age

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.610
of smartphones
and stupid people.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.760
So, [INAUDIBLE] people, it's the
age of instant gratification.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:10.350
We don't listen to
each other anymore.

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.910
And you know, that was
one of Madiba's strongest

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:16.150
characteristics was his
ability to listen to people

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.850
and to listen with the intention
of really understanding

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:22.270
what a person is saying,
rather than listening

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:24.640
with the intention
of responding.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.770
And with smartphones
and social media

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:29.770
these days, that's what we do.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:30.670
We look at something.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.710
And without thinking or
listening, we respond.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.630
Because I do want most likes.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:37.270
I do want to be the
most famous person.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.280
Or I do want to shame
someone publicly.

00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:43.060
So that's who we, as
a society, has become.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:45.850
So when it comes to racial
relations in South Africa,

00:15:45.850 --> 00:15:48.880
you have the radicals.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.810
And I'm sure you know
who I'm talking about.

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:54.550
And we have the radicals on
both white and black side,

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:57.760
that it makes it appear that
we haven't made progress

00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.290
or that we are moving backwards.

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:00.610
But you know what?

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:04.180
In all the years, I have
not found that people

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.610
on the street that's
so intolerant as you

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.417
see in politicians.

00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:10.750
People on the street in South
Africa are not intolerant.

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.820
People in the street
want to live together.

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:15.560
They want to work together
to bring solutions.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:18.750
So I do think we've
made great progress.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:20.970
It's just that it
appears, because things

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:24.220
are so open and so
transparent in society

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.517
because of the internet
that it appears different.

00:16:27.517 --> 00:16:29.350
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
absolutely agree with you.

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:31.900
And especially, when you see
the newer, younger generations,

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.690
and just when you see them
going out socializing,

00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:37.330
and just how
comfortable they are

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.410
living in such a
multicultural society.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:40.451
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Totally.

00:16:40.451 --> 00:16:41.410
Totally.

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.140
I always say to people that
everywhere in the world, if you

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:51.820
look at the US today as well,
you have this very intolerant

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:53.230
atmosphere.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.884
And it's everywhere
in the world.

00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:56.800
It's not just America.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.000
It's not South Africa.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.680
Everywhere in the world,
it's the radicals shouting

00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.280
that makes us all move back into
a more conservative society.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:09.970
So I'd rather be bland
than say how I really feel.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:16.240
The thing is that if you are
serious about righteousness,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.130
and equality, and the freedoms
that people like Nelson Mandela

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.970
fought for, you need
to shout louder and not

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:27.910
become discouraged bland
society and the person who

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:31.090
doesn't have an opinion
just because it's safer.

00:17:31.090 --> 00:17:32.020
It's hard.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.900
And I myself had to learn
through social media

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.710
the hard lessons.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:39.260
But it is a powerful,
powerful tool for us.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:41.570
And if you look at
Nelson Mandela's legacy,

00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:43.090
he stood on the world stage.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:46.650
And then at times, there
were maybe 50,000 people

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:49.390
in a stadium that he addressed.

00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:51.340
Those days, they didn't
have smartphones.

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.850
So his opinion was confined
to the 50,000 people

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:55.990
in front of him.

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.320
With the internet today,
all of us in this room

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.740
is on some form of social media.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.490
If we all have 100 people
to influence, actually,

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:11.500
our power is much bigger
than it was those years.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:12.000
You know?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.870
And we can reach more people.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.130
So how do you choose to
use that responsibility?

00:18:18.130 --> 00:18:23.140
In this age of influence,
the age of technology,

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:27.100
use it to build the bridges,
to promote tolerance,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:31.540
to promote equality, to promote
the things that we all know

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:32.927
makes the world a better place.

00:18:32.927 --> 00:18:33.760
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.180
And thank you for
your time today.

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.930
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Thank you.

00:18:37.930 --> 00:18:39.810
AUDIENCE: Both my
parents are Palestinian.

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:42.370
So I'm sure you can imagine
that this is something that's

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.597
also very close to my heart.

00:18:44.597 --> 00:18:46.180
And I was wondering
if you could maybe

00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:49.900
speak a little bit
about Nelson Mandela

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.130
and if he ever spoke about
forgiveness from within,

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.520
or how he could come
over the things that

00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.510
happened to him personally
to work with and integrate

00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:04.480
these people who had done
this to him and in society

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.237
as he was president.

00:19:06.237 --> 00:19:07.570
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Thank you, yes.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:11.380
Mr. Mandela, I think about
10 years after I started

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.190
working for him, he
started this thing

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.320
of saying that he misses prison.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.340
I would like, what?

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.694
I said, you can't say that.

00:19:19.694 --> 00:19:21.610
That's disgusting to say
that you miss prison.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.260
Don't repeat that.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.420
And then he said it's not
that he missed prison,

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.070
it's that he misses
the opportunity

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.790
to think about things properly.

00:19:29.790 --> 00:19:32.160
And he then said to me--

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.307
at another stage I
said to him, when

00:19:34.307 --> 00:19:36.640
I started knowing him quite
well, I said, you know what?

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.190
It's very unnatural of
you not to hate, not

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.130
to have resentment, and not
to want to have revenge.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:47.440
And with me alongside you,
just take that opportunity.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.240
And I'm sure we
can overcome this.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.730
But be angry at me
because it's not natural

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:52.690
that you are not angry.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.155
You have to be angry at
white people specifically.

00:19:56.155 --> 00:19:58.420
So I said, take it out on me.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:20:00.640
We can sing "Kumbaya"
afterwards again.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:01.240
You know?

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:02.740
We can make up.

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.120
But you have to get it out.

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:05.890
And then he would laugh at me.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.210
And he would say to
me, there's no anger.

00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:09.160
There's no resentment.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.880
Because he realized that
unless he worked it himself,

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.520
he could not take
the country forward.

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.430
So unless he worked at his own
anger and his own resentment,

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:20.350
he couldn't influence
the people around him.

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.600
And he said, it's
much harder work

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:26.620
to change yourself than it
is to change other people.

00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.660
So when it comes to
something like forgiveness,

00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:31.180
when it comes to something
like reconciliation,

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:34.180
that made me realize
that, in prison, he

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.500
took a lot of time thinking
about these things.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.350
What is the best way forward?

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.150
And it is really to work
at oneself much harder.

00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:47.590
In forgiving, you have to also
reconcile with your own past.

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.170
Through my life story, I had
to come to terms with the fact

00:20:50.170 --> 00:20:51.550
that that is who I was.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:55.180
And that is why I can be
so brutally honest about,

00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:58.440
yes, I was a racist when
I started working for him.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.240
But I've been
through this change.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.730
And we need to take
the time to think

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.740
of ourselves in any
situation and how

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.960
do I appear to
other people, rather

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.360
than wanting to preach
to people how to behave.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.820
Because we all
know how difficult

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.240
it is to change behavior.

00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.240
If you want to stop drinking,
stop swearing, stop smoking,

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:24.070
stop whatever it is,
it's difficult. Yet,

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:28.240
we want to tell everyone
around us how to behave.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.520
Behavior is like fashion.

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.550
If I change my behavior,
other people will follow.

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:37.060
So all of that made me realize
that Mr. Mandela worked very

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:39.210
hard at himself to forgive.

00:21:39.210 --> 00:21:42.160
And it's only because
he did that that we

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.730
had such a smooth
transition in South Africa

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:48.760
because the people
followed his example.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.400
AUDIENCE: That's very brave
of you to work on yourself

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.560
and share this
experience with us also.

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.700
Thank you so much for that.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.800
ZELDA LA GRANGE: Thank
you very, very much.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.140
NATALIE MAYHEW: So
one final question.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:03.112
What did you learn most from
President Nelson Mandela?

00:22:03.112 --> 00:22:04.570
ZELDA LA GRANGE:
I think the lesson

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:10.960
that stands out, Natalie, is
to respect, to respect people,

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.950
irrespective of who they
are, and what they represent,

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:19.480
and what they appear to me
to be, without judgment.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.500
Mr. Mandela always said that
if you question a person's

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.620
integrity without
valid reason, it

00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:30.130
could well be a reflection
of your own integrity.

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.900
And I often think
of those things.

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:35.530
And I always think of the
person that approaches me now,

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.525
strip him from all those
layers, because that's

00:22:37.525 --> 00:22:40.150
what I learned from Mr. Mandela
is strip stripping from what he

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.510
wears, what he or she wears,
from their sexual preference,

00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:47.050
from their wealthy status,
their appearance, all of that,

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:51.670
their ideology, their religion,
their conviction, all of that,

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:52.240
politics.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.150
Strip the person and connect
with the human being.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.880
And that is what made him
such an effective world leader

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.390
as well is that he always
was able to connect

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:06.110
to the humanity of a
person above ideology.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:08.520
And I think that
speaks of respect.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.930
And if we can all
just try and do that,

00:23:10.930 --> 00:23:14.110
recognizing the human
being behind every person

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:20.300
that we come across, then it
makes the world a better place.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.860
And I bear witness to the fact
that I saw a person waking up

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.720
every morning.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.550
Nelson Mandela, for
19 years, he decided,

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.650
purposefully, every
single morning, he

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:36.630
decided, if I can change, or if
I can touch one person's life

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:38.550
today, I can change the world.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:41.560
He really believed in
that individual action.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.640
And if you now look at
world history, he did.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.410
So it's in our power.

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.180
It wasn't that he was
a super human being.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.820
He was an ordinary human
being like all of us.

00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.450
But he made decisions and
always choosing the right thing.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:57.690
And I think that
kind of respect,

00:23:57.690 --> 00:24:02.550
that kind of self-respect as
well, is the lesson that I

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.632
take away from my experience.

00:24:04.632 --> 00:24:06.090
NATALIE MAYHEW:
That's fascinating.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:07.424
So it's been amazing having you.

00:24:07.424 --> 00:24:10.006
And thank you so much for coming
all the way from South Africa

00:24:10.006 --> 00:24:11.190
to be with us today.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:12.555
The book is available.

00:24:12.555 --> 00:24:13.180
You can buy it.

00:24:13.180 --> 00:24:13.950
It's a great read.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:15.150
I definitely recommend it.

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:17.480
It's available on Google Play.
