NAT DUCA: Everybody wants a nice
smooth web app, a nice

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.630
smooth browsing experience.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.980
But actually doing
that is a really,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.960
really difficult problem.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.650
And so what we're going to be
doing at Chrome summit is both

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.090
listening to the kinds
of problems

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.400
that users are having--

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.660
that's why we want everybody
to come--

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.450
and also showing how to
architect your app to be jank

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.800
free in the first place and also
how to use our tools to

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.620
figure out what's broken when
things do go wrong.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.780
We know that this is hard, but
what we don't know is the

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.110
kinds of looks that people want
to implement and where

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.730
our tooling falls over.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.090
So when you come to us with a
piece of content, we want to

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.300
look at it and see where the
tools work, where the tools

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.620
don't work, and what kinds of
things we should be building

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.500
into Chrome in the future
to make that look

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.580
even better for you.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.280
I'm Nat Duca.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.640
I'm one of Chrome's
graphics hackers.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.650
I look forward to busting jank
with you at the summit.
