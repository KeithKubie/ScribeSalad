00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.200
Nevertheless, let us continue and

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.370
see how else this theory
enables common sense reasoning.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.210
So consider the sentence,
Ashok enjoy eating the frog.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.770
So not just Ashok ate the frog,
Ashok enjoyed it.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.810
How do we make sense of this term?

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.160
Once again, because the word eat, we may
have the primitive action for ingest.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.000
Here is Ashok as the agent, frog as the
object, and this time we'll have under

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.150
the slot called result, which shows
what happens when Ashok eats the frog.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.650
We will call this frame a state-change
frame, where there was some initial

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.340
state and some state at the end of this
particular action, the action of ingest.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.030
So, here there is Ashok's mood,
which is becoming happy.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.670
&gt;&gt; So Ashok, how would the agent
know that in this case,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.380
the verb we're going to key on
first is eating instead of enjoyed?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.590
Good point, David.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.780
So we can imagine
a different action frame for

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.480
feel because of enjoy being a feel.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.660
The agent as Ashok.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.550
Ashok is the one holding the feeling,
and the object, or

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.140
the feeling that is being felt, is joy.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.950
We can still have a frame for eating,
and we can relate those two frames.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.200
So what specific interpretation an agent
will make this particular sentence

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.770
will depend on the precise rules that
we're going to put into this slot so

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.660
that the agent can make either this
interpretation or that interpretation.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.300
We'll see another example of
this situation in just a minute.
