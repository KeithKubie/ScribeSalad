00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.850
Every cell in the
human body needs energy

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.120
to survive and do its
different functions.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.030
If we're talking
about a brain cell,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.880
it needs energy to keep
stimulating other brain cells

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.130
and sending on
signals and messages.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.520
If it's a muscle cell, it
needs energy to contract.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.790
They need energy just to do
the basic functions of a cell.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.120
And the place that they
get that energy from,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.470
or the primary source of
that energy, is from glucose.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.410
Glucose is a simple sugar.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.500
If you were to actually taste
glucose, it would taste sweet.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.460
And glucose gets delivered to
cells through the bloodstream.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.290
So this right here,
I'm drawing some blood

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.630
that's passing by a cell.

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.550
Maybe the blood is going in
that direction over there.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.440
And inside the blood, let
me draw some small glucose

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.530
molecules passing by.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.990
And so in an ideal situation,
when a cell needs energy,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.670
glucose will enter the cell.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.230
Unfortunately, it's not that
simple for the great majority

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.590
of cells in the human body.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.920
The glucose won't
enter by itself.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.860
It needs the assistance
of a hormone or a molecule

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.912
called insulin.

00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:14.120
So let me label all of these.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.800
This right here is the
glucose, and it needs insulin.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.920
So let me draw insulin as
these magenta molecules

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.450
right over here.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.250
That over there,
that is insulin.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.830
And the surface
of the cells, they

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.810
have insulin receptors on them.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.050
And I'm just drawing very
simplified versions of them,

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.250
kind of a place where these
magenta circles can attach,

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.400
can bind.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.300
And what happens is, in
order for the glucose

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.200
to be taken up by
the cell, insulin

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.960
has to attach to
these receptors, which

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.980
unlocks the channels
for glucose.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.000
In order for the
glucose to go in,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.830
insulin has to bind to
the insulin receptors.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.870
And then, once
that happens, then

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.080
the glucose can be
taken up by the cell.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.950
Now, unfortunately, things
don't always work as planned.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.180
So let me draw a couple
of scenarios here.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.700
So, once again, let me draw my
very simple version of a cell

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.520
and let me draw the bloodstream
going by right over here.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.200
And then let me draw the
glucose in the bloodstream.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.260
So I have my
glucose floating by,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.390
and then I have my
insulin receptors

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.730
on the surface of a cell.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.630
Now, the first thing
that could go wrong

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.120
here is what if the body
does not produce insulin?

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.860
Insulin is produced
in the pancreas.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.620
What happens if the pancreas is
not producing insulin properly?

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.480
So no insulin.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.800
Well, in this situation,
since there's nothing to bind

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.080
to these receptors, the glucose
channels won't be opened up,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.360
and the glucose will not be
able to enter into the cell.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:14.550
And this situation
is type 1 diabetes,

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.520
where you've got glucose.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.480
So in theory, you
have energy and you

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.400
have properly-functioning
insulin receptors,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.970
but you just don't have
insulin to unlock the gates

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.370
for the glucose--
for the glucose

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.200
to actually go into the cell.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.680
The other scenario you
could imagine happening--

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.660
let me draw the cell again.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.890
So there is my cell
and let me draw

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.180
the blood flowing past the cell.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.430
And once again, obviously,
this is just one

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.620
of trillions of cells
in the human body.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.150
We have an estimated 10
to 100 trillion cells.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.740
So this is a very
simple diagram,

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.280
but, hopefully, it
gets the point across.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.050
So once again, let me draw
some glucose floating by.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.340
Let me draw some insulin
receptors on the cell.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.990
Insulin receptor there, maybe
an insulin receptor right

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.910
over there.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.170
And let's say we even
have some insulin.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.270
Our pancreas is producing
insulin and putting it

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.940
into our bloodstream.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.670
So it's there to be used.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.730
But a situation can arise
where the receptors are not

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.195
working properly or we become
insensitive or desensitized

00:04:25.195 --> 00:04:25.695
to insulin.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.130
So in this situation--
sometimes maybe it

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.810
might be the insulin is hard to
bind or, even if it does bind,

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.300
it's not working properly.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.180
So the glucose will
not enter the cell.

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.630
I already wrote desensitized.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.171
So in either one of
these scenarios--

00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:54.254
let's just think in
a very broad level.

00:04:54.254 --> 00:04:56.670
I'm not going to go into the
details of the actual therapy

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.630
for these diseases of
how it can be cured.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.874
Oh, and I didn't even
name the second one.

00:05:01.874 --> 00:05:03.790
The second one right
here, as you can imagine,

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.570
if this up here is
type 1 diabetes,

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.625
this down here is
type 2 diabetes.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.690
The simple way
that-- I don't want

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.190
to say that it's
necessarily simple,

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.500
but the way that you could
manage type 1 diabetes

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.780
is you can inject insulin.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.406
The only problem
here-- it's a big one,

00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:29.655
though, is that there's no
insulin in the bloodstream.

00:05:29.655 --> 00:05:31.210
Everything else is
working properly.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:33.620
So over here, we
can inject insulin.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.800
And then you'll have insulin
to attach to the receptors,

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.340
and then the glucose can
be processed properly.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.710
Type 2 diabetes-- there's
multiple lines of attack.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.405
One thing that
you can do-- there

00:05:48.405 --> 00:05:54.140
are actually drugs that attempt
to re-sensitize your insulin

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.990
receptors.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.320
You can also do that with
a combination of lifestyle

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:01.710
changes that makes
your body, I guess,

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.240
more sensitized to sugar.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.020
Or you can even-- if
things get severe enough,

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.020
you can add insulin,
just like you

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.187
would do in type 1 diabetes.

00:06:12.187 --> 00:06:14.311
And you can say, wait, I
already have insulin here.

00:06:14.311 --> 00:06:15.630
Why would I add more insulin?

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:19.790
Well, remember, the cells
can process insulin,

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:21.190
but they're desensitized.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:22.800
They would need more
insulin in order

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.090
to uptake the same
amount of glucose.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:27.440
So if you add insulin,
you could possibly

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.790
have enough of a trigger
that the glucose can actually

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:31.476
be taken up.

00:06:31.476 --> 00:06:33.225
But there's multiple
lines of attack here,

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:35.110
and usually the
first one are giving

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.240
drugs that help, hopefully,
re-sensitize or make

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.465
you less desensitized
to the actual insulin.

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:45.840
So the last thing I just want
to think about a little bit

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.756
is-- well, what happens
if you didn't do this.

00:06:47.756 --> 00:06:49.370
Well, there's two
major problems here.

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.170
Obviously, your
cells can't function

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.070
if it's not taking up glucose.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.920
So your cells will
have no energy.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.000
And another problem--
if you weren't

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.850
to manage either
one of these types

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.770
of diabetes, is
that sugar, if it

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.820
gets to high enough
concentrations in the blood,

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.070
it can actually cause
a lot of damage.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.985
Sugar can cause
damage to the body.

00:07:12.985 --> 00:07:15.110
So you don't want either
of these things happening.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.568
You want your cells
to have energy,

00:07:16.568 --> 00:07:18.890
and you don't want to
have too much sugar

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:23.370
flowing in your blood and
causing damage to your body.
