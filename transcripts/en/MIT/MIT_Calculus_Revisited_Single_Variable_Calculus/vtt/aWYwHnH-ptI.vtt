00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.980
PROFESSOR: Hi.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.220
Today, we're going to learn a
rather powerful technique,

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.020
called the technique of partial
fractions, that's

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.680
particularly applicable for one
special type of integrand.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.950
In particular, it's going to be
applicable to the situation

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.650
where the integral has the form,
the quotient, of two

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:53.400
polynomials.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.140
In other words, suppose we have
integral ''P of x' dx'

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.490
over 'Q of x', where 'P'
and 'Q' are both

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.740
polynomials in 'x'.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.080
And, by the way, for reasons
that will become apparent

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.200
later, we'll assume that the
degree of 'P' is less than the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.300
degree of 'Q'.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.940
In other words, that the
highest exponent in the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.110
numerator is less than the
highest exponent in the

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.920
denominator.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.470
By the way, if that's not the
case, we can always carry out

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.850
long division first and carry
out enough terms until we get

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.800
a term in which this is
the particular case.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.420
You see, I'll make that clearer
as we go along.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.230
But, for the time being, all we
really care about in terms

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:36.660
of outlining this form--

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.900
and, again, as we will often
do in these types of

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.620
techniques--

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.290
the place that we'll pick up
the real fine computational

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.710
points are in the exercises.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.730
We'll use the lectures to just
outline what the technique is

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.760
and how its used.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.160
But suppose, now, that we
have the quotient of two

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.560
polynomials and we want
to integrate it.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.920
Now, the idea is this, there are
two key steps that dictate

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.510
this particular method.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.470
The first thing is, we saw it
in the last lecture, that we

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.419
can handle denominators if they
involve nothing worse

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:13.700
than linear and quadratic
polynomials.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.250
In other words, we know how to
integrate something like

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.740
'dx/x' plus a constant.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.480
We know now how to integrate 'dx
/ ''ax squared' plus 'bx'

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.020
plus 'c'', so we know how
to handle that type, OK?

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.680
And the second important
thing--

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.970
and I'll amplify this,
too, as we go along--

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.560
the second important thing is
that, theoretically, every

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.470
real polynomial can be factored
into linear and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.960
quadratic terms.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.460
Now, this is a little bit
misleading, if you try to read

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.560
more into this than what
it really says.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.640
It doesn't mean that we can
always find a factorization

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.260
quite simply.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.240
In other words, we may,
at best, be able to

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.720
approximate a root.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.290
We'll have to use things like
we've talked about in the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.630
notes so far: Newton's method,
and things like this, linear

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.290
approximations, tangential
approximations.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.260
We may have to approximate
the roots.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.810
But that, theoretically, if
a polynomial with real

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.280
coefficients has degree greater
than 2, it has, at

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.040
least, one real root.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.940
In other words, we can keep
factoring things out this way.

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.950
The only thing we can't do is to
guarantee that, once we get

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.530
down to a quadratic, that we can
get real roots out of this

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.220
particular thing.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.190
In fact, the classic example
is to visualize 'x

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.670
squared plus 1'.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.680
In other words, we can't factor
'x squared plus 1'

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.580
unless we introduce
non-real numbers.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.330
Remember the technique you can
write, that 'x squared plus 1'

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.330
is 'x squared' minus 'i squared'
where 'i' is the

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.890
square root of minus 1.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.265
And this factors into 'x plus
i' times 'x minus i', et

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:48.880
cetera, but these are
non-real numbers.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.130
In other words, you can't always
factor a quadratic to

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.830
get real numbers.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.750
In fact, if you recall the
quadratic formula of this:

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.280
square root of 'b squared' minus
'4 ac', if 'b squared'

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.740
is less than '4 ac', what's
inside the square root sign is

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.320
negative, and that leads
to non-real roots.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.810
So, you see, we can't
always factor

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.160
quadratics into real factors.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.670
By the way, don't identify
things that were difficult to

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.290
factor with things that
can't be factored.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.519
You know, a lot of times, we
think of, say-- here's an

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.380
example I thought you might
enjoy seeing here--

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.070
take, for example, ''x'
to the fourth plus 1'.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.620
That looks something like it
belongs to the family 'x

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.270
squared plus 1'.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.570
And 'x squared plus 1'
can't be factored.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:34.020
You might think that
''x' to the fourth

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.660
plus 1' can't be factored.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.940
Now, again, it's not important
that you understand what made

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.890
me think of these tricks
or what have you.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.920
What I do want to show is that
even situations where the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.660
polynomials might look like a
known factor, they really do.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.870
For example, with ''x' to the
fourth plus 1', we can write

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.980
this in the disguised form ''x
squared plus 1' squared', see?

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.150
That's, what? ''x' to
the fourth plus 1'.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.820
But there's a middle term here
of 2 'x squared', so I

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.970
subtract off the
2 'x squared'.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.500
Now, this has the form, the
sum and difference of 2

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.290
squares, namely, ''x squared
plus 1' squared' and, also,

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.400
the square root of 2
times 'x squared'.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.530
In other words, I can write this
as this plus the square

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.240
root of 2 times 'x' times
this minus the square

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.990
root of '2 times x'.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.710
Observing, that even though
the square root of 2 is an

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.480
irrational number, it is,
nonetheless, a real number.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.420
The important point that I want
to point out, though, as

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.720
far as setting up this technique
called partial

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.020
fractions, is that, whether
it's easy or not easy, the

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.070
fact remains that, when we
have a polynomial in our

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.760
denominator, it can always be
factored into a combination of

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.350
linear and quadratic factors
using real numbers.

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:50.610
Well, it's difficult to factor
some of these things, so, by

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.610
way of illustration,
let me pick out

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.470
one that comes factored.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.000
Let me start with a particular
problem here.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.670
Let's take the integral 'dx/
''x minus 1' times 'x

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:06.010
squared plus 1''.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.120
So, what is the integrand
in this case?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.620
It's 1/ ''x minus 1' times
'x squared plus 1''.

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:13.790
Now, the idea is this.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.490
See, here's a quadratic factor,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.900
here's a linear factor.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.560
What fractions do I have
to add to wind up with

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.380
something like this?

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.220
Well, again-- and this is going
to be another example of

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.190
our old adage that it's easier
to scramble an egg than to

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.540
unscramble one.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:32.430
You see, given two fractions,
it's one thing

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.050
to find their sum.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.130
Given the sum, it's quite
another thing,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.550
computationally, to find what
fractions you had to add to

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.520
get that sum.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.560
The idea is this.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.570
If you wind up with a
denominator that has an 'x

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.210
minus 1' term and an 'x squared
plus 1' term, it

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:52.860
appears that you must have
started with terms, say, what?

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.380
In other words, you must have
had one term which had a

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.640
denominator of 'x minus 1' and a
term which had a denominator

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:59.980
of 'x squared plus 1'.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.800
Because, you see, if I start
with these kind of

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.860
denominators when I
cross-multiply and put things

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.580
over a common denominator, I
will wind up with 'x minus 1'

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.500
times 'x squared plus 1'.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.930
The question that comes up is
what shall our numerators be?

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.970
And here's the main reason why
we picked the degree of the

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.800
numerator to be less than the
degree of the denominator.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.660
Notice, for example, in this
particular case, the numerator

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:26.650
has degree 0, namely, the
highest power of 'x' to the

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.260
peers is the 'x'
to the 0 term.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:32.050
On the other hand, the
denominator has degree 3.

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:35.130
See, there's an 'x cubed'
term in the denominator.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:36.820
You see, if they're doing
'x' to the fourth in the

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.740
numerator, I could have
multiplied out the

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.990
denominator, divided it into the
numerator, and just kept

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.930
carrying out the division long
enough until I wound up with a

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:50.820
remainder which was less than
a degree, less than a cubic.

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:51.780
In other words, less
than a third

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.570
degree polynomial remainder.

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:54.540
That's not the point.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.210
The point is that as long as the
degree of the numerator is

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.850
less than the degree of the
denominator, it means that the

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:02.290
terms that we're adding must
have the degree of the

00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:04.940
numerator less than the degree
of the denominator.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.710
See, it's like adding
fractions.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:09.850
If you start with one fraction
whose numerator is greater

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.900
than the denominator then,
certainly, any sum that you

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.410
get is going to be
bigger than 1.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:18.960
In other words, if you want to
wind-up, dealing with positive

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.640
numbers, and you want to wind-up
with a fraction which

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.470
is less than 1, it stands to
reason that all of the

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.740
fractions that you're adding
must be less than 1.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.740
So, if I'm going to wind-up
adding quotients of

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.570
polynomials to get a sum in
which the degree of the

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.850
numerator is less than the
degree of the denominator, it

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.679
means that every one of the
terms in my sum must have this

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.100
particular property.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:45.180
In other words, with this as
a hint, I say look at, my

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.790
denominator here is 'x minus
1', that's degree one.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.720
That means my numerator can't
be greater than degree 0.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:55.150
But degree 0 means a constant.

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:59.400
So I say OK, that means that
this has to form some constant

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.950
over 'x minus 1'.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:03.910
Now, I look at this
denominator.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.160
It's quadratic.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.500
And I say to myself I'm starting
out with a quadratic,

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.020
the degree of the numerator
can't be greater than the

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.470
degree of the denominator.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.980
Since the degree of the
denominator is 2, that means

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:20.040
the degree of the numerator
can't be more than 1.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:23.300
And the most general first
degree polynomial has the

00:09:23.300 --> 00:09:24.040
form, what?

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.240
Some constant times 'x'
plus a constant.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.290
So what I'm saying is,
OK, to wind-up with

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.690
something of the form--

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.670
well, to wind-up with 1/ ''x
minus 1' times 'x squared plus

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:39.030
1'', I had better start with
something of the form 'A/ 'x

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:44.330
minus 1'' plus ''Bx plus C' over
'x squared plus 1'' where

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:46.650
'A', 'B', and 'C'
are constants.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:49.870
The key point is that if we
weren't sure that the degree

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:51.880
of the numerator were less
than the degree of the

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.380
denominator, we would
not know where

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:55.930
to stop in our numerator.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:59.130
In other words, by this
convention, we're sure that

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:02.090
the degree of the numerator in
any one of these terms can't

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:04.580
be greater than the degree
of the corresponding

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:06.700
denominator, you see?

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:09.280
And by the way, notice, for
example, if it turns out that

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.630
we put too much in--

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.230
for example, suppose it turns
out that this numerator here

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.620
should only be a constant--

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:18.170
there's no law against having
'B' turn out to be 0.

00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:20.660
By the way, again, what these
things are called--

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.540
just to increase our
vocabulary--

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:25.740
what I'm going to do now
is called the method of

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.370
undetermined coefficients.

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:31.060
You see, what I know is that I
must have the form 'A over 'x

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.050
minus 1' plus ''Bx plus C'
over 'x squared plus 1''.

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:37.560
What I don't know is,
specifically, how to choose

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:39.650
the values of 'A',
'B', and 'C'.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:41.620
And the technique works
something like this.

00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:45.730
What we do is we put this over
a common denominator.

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.540
What will the common
denominator be?

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:50.960
It'll be 'x minus 1' times
'x squared plus 1'.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.200
How will I put this over
a common denominator?

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.780
It'll be 'A' times 'x squared
plus 1', plus 'Bx plus C'

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:00.520
times 'x minus 1'.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.130
Now, this is supposed
to be an identity.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.700
Now, if two fractions are
identical and the denominators

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.350
are the same, which is what they
will be after I put this

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.180
over a common denominator, the
only way they can be identical

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.140
is for the numerators
to be identical.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.330
So, you see, what I'm going to
do is to cross-multiply here

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.740
to obtain the numerator of
the right-hand side.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.690
And I will equate that to the
numerator on the left-hand

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.380
side, which is 1.

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:26.820
All right.

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.230
Now, what is the numerator
on the right-hand side?

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.520
It's 'A' times 'x squared
plus 1', that's 'A x

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.240
squared plus A'.

00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.770
Then it's going to be 'x minus
1' times 'Bx plus C'.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:44.610
That's going to be 'B x squared'
minus 'Bx plus C'

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.110
times 'x minus C'.

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:51.170
And now the idea something like
this, and I'll come back

00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.730
to this in a few moments to
hammer this home from a

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:54.780
different point of view.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.720
What is the coefficient of 'x
squared' on the right-hand

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.390
side of the equation?

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.940
The coefficient of 'x squared'
on the right-hand side of the

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.600
equation is 'A plus B'.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.060
What is the coefficient of 'x
squared' on the left-hand side

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:09.160
of the equation?

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.080
And at first glance you say
there is no 'x squared' on the

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.460
left-hand side of
the equation.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.070
What that means, of course, is
that the coefficient of 'x

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.220
squared' on the left-hand side
of the equation is 0.

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:22.080
So what we say is OK, the
coefficients of 'x squared'

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.110
must match up, therefore,
'A plus B', which is a

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.930
coefficient of 'x squared' on
the right-hand side, must

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.780
equal 0, which is the
coefficient of 'x squared' on

00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:32.170
the left-hand side.

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:36.590
In a similar way, the
coefficient of 'x' is 'C minus

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:38.870
B' on the right-hand side.

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:42.410
The coefficient of 'x' on
the left-hand side is 0.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:46.080
Consequently, 'C minus
B' must be 0.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.620
And, finally, the constant term
on the right-hand side is

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.140
given by 'A minus C'.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:55.650
On the left-hand side, the
right-hand term is 1.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.050
Consequently, 'A minus
C' must equal 1.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:01.660
What do I wind-up with?

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.470
Three equations with
three unknowns.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.730
Well, there are a number of ways
of handling these things.

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:09.670
The easiest one I see, off-hand,
is I notice if I add

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:13.750
the first two equations, I
wind-up with 'A plus C' is 0.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:17.720
Knowing that 'A plus C' is 0
and, also, that 'A minus C' is

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.310
1, it's easy for me to conclude
that 'A' must be 1/2

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.260
and 'C' must be minus 1/2.

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.180
And, by the way, now knowing
what 'A' and 'C' are, I can

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.510
use either of these two
equations to determine 'B',

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.430
and 'B' turns out
to be minus 1/2.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.190
In other words, what
does this tell me?

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:39.490
It tells me that if I replace
'A' here by 1/2, and 'B' and

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:44.220
'C' each by minus 1/2, the
right-hand side here will be

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.310
an identity for the left-hand
side, that there'll be two

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.850
different ways of naming
the same number for

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.470
each value of 'x'.

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:54.980
In fact, doing this now out in
more detail, what we've really

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:59.110
shown here, in other words, if
I replace 'A' by 1/2 and 'B'

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.320
and 'C' each by minus 1/2, then
I factor the 1/2 out.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.830
What I've shown is that one over
the quantity 'x minus 1'

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:13.040
times 'x squared plus 1' is
equal to 1/2 times the

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:18.006
quantity '1 over 'x minus 1''
minus the quantity ''x plus 1'

00:14:18.006 --> 00:14:20.870
over 'x squared plus 1''.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:23.670
By the way, I can separate this
into two terms, each of

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.840
which has a denominator
of 'x squared plus

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.420
1', and I get, what?

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:34.220
1/2 times 1/ 'x minus 1' minus
1/ ''2 times x'/ 'x squared

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:41.230
plus 1'' minus 1/2 times '1/
'x squared plus 1''.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:43.110
Now, the key is this.

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:45.460
I didn't really want this,
what I wanted was, what?

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.340
This was to be my integrand.

00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:51.080
What I wanted was to integrate
this with respect to 'x'.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.880
Well, if given this identity
over here, the integral of

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.850
'dx'/ ''x minus 1' times 'x
squared plus 1'', recalling

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:02.410
that the integral of a sum is
a sum of the integrals, et

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:04.940
cetera, can now be
written as, what?

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:11.600
It's 1/2 integral 'dx'/ 'x minus
1' minus 1/2 integral

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:18.680
'x'/ 'x squared plus 1' times
'dx' minus 1/2 integral 1/ 'x

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.050
squared plus 1' times 'dx'.

00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:22.200
Now, here's the point.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.010
Notice that every one of my
denominators, now, is either

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.030
linear or quadratic.

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:30.470
In fact, without going through
the details here again, if I

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:34.830
let 'u' equal 'x minus 1' in
this example, this reduces

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:38.510
this to the form 'du/u',
in other words, a ''u

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.710
to the n' du' form.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:46.330
If I let 'u' equal 'x squared
plus 1' over here, if 'u' is

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.990
'x squared plus 1', notice
that 'du' is '2 xdx'.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.480
So my numerator becomes a
constant multiple of 'du' and,

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.280
again, I have a ''u of
the n' du' form.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.910
And finally, if I look at my
last integral here, notice

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.230
that this is the sum of two
squares, which suggests the

00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:07.280
circular trigonometric functions
that we were talking

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.840
about last time.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.320
Or, if you wish, you can
go to tables and look

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:11.940
these things up.

00:16:11.940 --> 00:16:12.780
They're all in there.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:15.870
But, again, without going
through the details because

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.650
this is the easy part, again,
it turns out that once you

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:22.480
have this relationship here we
can integrate this to obtain

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.400
log absolute value
'x minus 1'.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.080
The integral here is log,
natural log, absolute value of

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.490
'x squared plus 1'.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.170
I can leave the absolute value
signs out because 'x squared

00:16:34.170 --> 00:16:36.380
plus 1' has to be, at
least, as big as 1.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:37.430
It can't be negative.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.330
And finally, either by
trigonometric substitution, or

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:43.610
by memorization, or what have
you, integral of 'dx'/ 'x

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:48.200
squared plus 1' is just the
inverse tangent of 'x'.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:51.810
In other words, by using partial
fractions and reducing

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:56.510
a complicated polynomial
denominator into a sum of

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:01.840
linear and quadratic terms,
I was able, by knowing my

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.670
techniques of last time,
to integrate the given

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:05.839
expression.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:08.460
And, by the way, I would be a
little remiss at the stage of

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:12.780
the game if I did not take the
time to, once again, reinforce

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:16.960
a very important concept, and
that is it may be difficult,

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.819
starting with this,
to get this.

00:17:19.819 --> 00:17:23.980
What should not be difficult is,
starting with this, to be

00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.087
able to differentiate it and
show that you wind-up with 1/

00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:31.200
''x minus 1' times 'x
squared plus 1''.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.200
In other words, as usual, with
the inverse derivative, once

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.460
you find an answer and you
want to see whether your

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.060
answer is correct or not,
all you have to do is

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.070
differentiate the answer and see
if you get the integrand.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.130
But, at any rate, this is how
the technique called partial

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.330
fractions works.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:50.220
It works for the quotient
of two polynomials.

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.820
And to make the undetermined
coefficients technique work

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.170
right, you must assume that the
degree of the numerator is

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:57.900
less than the degree
of the denominator.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.420
And, obviously, in the
exercises, I'll give you some

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.010
where the degree of the
numerator is greater than the

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.570
degree of the denominator.

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:07.110
And, if you don't perform long
division first, you're going

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:08.690
to get into trouble
trying to find the

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:09.690
answer to the problem.

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:12.800
But all I want to emphasize
here is the technique.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.450
And, by the way, what I want to
do before I go any further,

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:20.440
also, is to emphasize a rather
special property of polynomial

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:21.650
identities.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.070
You recall that undetermined
coefficients

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.260
hinged on the following.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.600
And I'll pick a quadratic
to illustrate it with.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.720
Suppose you have two quadratic
expressions in 'x' identically

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.920
equal, in other words, 'a sub-2
'x squared'' plus 'a

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.380
sub-1 x' plus 'a sub-0' was
identically equal to 'b sub-2

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:43.190
'x squared'' plus 'b
sub-1 x' plus 'b0'.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:45.900
Notice the technique that we
used was is we said look at,

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.470
let's compare the coefficients
of 'x squared'.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:51.480
Let's equate the coefficients
of 'x', and let's equate the

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.750
constant terms.

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:57.350
How do we know that you're
allowed to do this?

00:18:57.350 --> 00:19:01.780
Well, let's see if we can show
that this must be the case.

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:04.460
For example, let's do this
without any calculus at all.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.430
Suppose this is an identity.

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:08.830
If this is an identity,
it must be true for

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.240
all values of 'x'.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.980
In particular, it must be
true when 'x' is 0.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:16.750
Notice that, when 'x' is 0,
the left-hand side is 'a

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:21.170
sub-0', the right-hand side is
'B sub-0', and we wind-up with

00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.860
'a sub-0' equals 'b sub-0'.

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.870
See, the constant
terms are equal.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.800
Well, if 'a sub-0' equals 'b
sub-0', we can cancel 'a

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.330
sub-0' and 'b sub-0'
from this equation.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.460
That leaves us with this
equaling this.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.930
From this, we can factor out an
'x', and get to 'x' times

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:43.800
'a sub-2 x' plus 'a1' is
identical with 'x' times 'b

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.630
sub-2 x' plus 'b1'.

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.070
If 'x' is not 0, we can cancel
'x' from both sides of the

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.900
equation, and that
shows, what?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:56.390
That, for any non-zero value of
'x', 'a 2x' plus 'a1' must

00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:00.840
be identically equal to
'b 2x' plus 'b1'.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.460
Once we have this formula
established, let's let 'x'

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:06.850
equal 0 in here, and
we see, what?

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.670
With 'x' equal to 0, then 'a1'
equals 'b1', in other words,

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:13.240
that the coefficient of 'x' on
the left-hand side equals the

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.500
coefficient of 'x' on
the right-hand side.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.410
You can keep on this way, but
a very nice technique to use

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.760
here is a reinforcement
of something that we

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.120
talked about before.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.710
I think it was when we
were doing implicit

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.660
differentiation, and
we talked about

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:27.690
identities verses equations.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:31.790
You see, if this is an identity,
and what I mean by

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.780
an identity, that this--

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.800
we're not saying find
what values of 'x'

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.860
this is true for.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:39.840
By an identity, we're saying
look at, these two expressions

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.880
are the same for all
values of 'x'.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:43.150
They're synonyms.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:45.340
And what we're saying is, if
these two things are synonyms,

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.620
their derivatives must
be synonyms.

00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.400
And all we're saying is look
at, if you want to use

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.320
calculus here, differentiate
both sides of this expression.

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.740
And you wind-up with '2a sub-2
x' plus 'a1' is identically

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:01.330
equal to '2b sub-2
x' plus 'b1'.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.680
Since these two things are
identical, let's equate their

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:05.950
derivatives again.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.240
See, the derivative of
identities are identical, and

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:13.580
we wind-up with '2 a2' is
identically equal to '2 b2'

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.590
and, therefore, 'a2'
must equal 'b2'.

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:20.420
Knowing that 'a2' equals 'b2',
we can come back to this step

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.700
and show that 'a1'
equals 'b1'.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.270
And now, knowing that 'a2'
equals 'b2', and 'a1' equals

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:29.415
'b1', we can come back to the
original equation and show

00:21:29.415 --> 00:21:32.010
that 'a0' must equal 'b0'.

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:37.410
Now, you may wonder why are we
making all of this ado over

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:39.860
what appears to be a
very obvious thing?

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:42.310
And I would like to give
you a caution here.

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:44.200
I'd like you to beware
of something.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.180
It's something which works very
nicely for polynomials,

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.530
but doesn't always have
to work all the time.

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:52.840
In fact, later, when one
studies differential

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:56.330
equations, this becomes a very
important concept, which later

00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:58.910
gets the name linear dependence
and linear

00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:00.020
independence.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.820
We're not going to go
into that now, but

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.180
the key idea is this.

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:08.740
In general, knowing that 'a1 u1'
plus 'a2 u2' is equal to

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:15.750
'b1 u1' plus 'b2 u2', you cannot
say ah, therefore, the

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.950
coefficients of 'u1' must be
equal, and the coefficients of

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:20.890
'u2' must be equal.

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:25.140
Don't get me wrong, if 'a1'
equals 'b1', and 'a2' equals

00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.700
'b2', then, certainly, 'a1 u1'
plus 'a2 u2' is equal to 'b1

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.670
u1' plus 'b2 u2'.

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:33.750
I'm not saying that.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:36.190
What I'm saying is, conversely,
if you start,

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:40.010
knowing that this is true, it
does not follow that they must

00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:43.470
match up coefficient
by coefficient, OK?

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:45.630
And you say well, why doesn't
it have to follow?

00:22:45.630 --> 00:22:47.180
And I think the best
way to do that is

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:48.870
by means of an example.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:51.910
For example, in this general
expression, let 'u1' equal

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.160
'x', and let 'u2' to be 'x/2'.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.360
Look at the expression
'5x' plus '6 times

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.160
x/2', that's, what?

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:03.790
It's '5x' plus '3x' is '8x'.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.280
Look at '3x' plus
'10 times x/2'.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:11.090
That's '3x' plus '5x',
which is also '8x'.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:15.890
In other words, 5 times 'x'
plus 6 times 'x/2' is

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:20.860
identically equal to 3 times
'x' plus 10 times 'x/2'.

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:24.270
Yet, you can't say, therefore,
the coefficients of 'x' must

00:23:24.270 --> 00:23:28.980
be equal, and the coefficients
of 'x/2' must be equal.

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.570
In fact, if you said that,
you'd be saying that 5 is

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:35.670
equal to 3 and 6 is equal
to 10, which, of course,

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:38.620
is not true, OK?

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.030
So, at any rate, I just wanted
to show you here the kind of

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.800
mathematical rigor and cautions
that have to be taken

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.090
if one is going to use a
technique called partial

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:51.420
fractions, what the key
ingredients are.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.590
Now, it turns out that not only
are partial fractions

00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:58.190
important in their own right, it
also turns out that partial

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:03.750
fractions handles a rather
difficult type of integral:

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:10.260
one that uses polynomials in
'sine x' and 'cosine x'.

00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.890
And the reason I wanted to
mention this was not so much

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:14.770
because the technique is nice.

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.130
The technique, by the
way, is in the text.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.620
But there's something very
interesting in the text, the

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.520
way the author introduces
a topic.

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.250
And I thought that
that was worth an

00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:24.680
aside in its own right.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.550
In the section where this thing
appears, it says, "It

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:38.210
has been discovered that." The
author makes no attempt to

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.330
show logically why one would
expect that a certain thing is

00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:42.590
going to work.

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.240
All the author says is, "It has
been discovered that." And

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:50.850
this tells a long story that, in
many cases, we wind up with

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:53.090
an integrand that we don't
know how to handle.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:56.440
We make all sorts of
substitutions in the hope that

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.720
we can reduce the given
integrand to a form that we

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:01.200
know how to handle.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.300
Sometimes we're successful,
sometimes we're not.

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:08.310
In the cases where we're not
successful, somebody, either

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:11.490
by clever intuition or what
have you, maybe it's just

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:14.200
blind luck, stumbles
across a technique

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.040
that happens to work.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.980
And I, sort of, liked this
particular example in the text

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.360
where the author says, "It has
been discovered that,"

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.320
because, to me, it's not at
all self-evident, and yet,

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:26.550
it's a rather pretty result.

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:30.520
The result says this: suppose
you make the substitution 'z'

00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:33.690
equals tangent 'x/2'.

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.920
Now, where do you pull this
out of the hat from?

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.650
'z' equals tangent 'x/2', that's
the ingenuity, the

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.330
experience, the luck.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.850
But the idea is, let's suppose
that we stumbled across this

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.120
one way or the other.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:52.420
If we translate this equation
into a reference triangle, we

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.560
have, what?

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.070
We'll call the angle 'x/2'.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.870
And the tangent is 'z', so we'll
make the side opposite

00:25:58.870 --> 00:26:01.070
'z', the side-adjacent 1.

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:03.280
That makes the hypotenuse
the square root

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.410
of '1 plus z squared'.

00:26:05.410 --> 00:26:07.470
Now, watch what happens
when you do this.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:12.500
See, 'z' is equal to '10x/2',
therefore, 'dz' is the

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:15.180
differential of '10x/2'.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:19.950
Remember, the differential of
'10x', with respect to 'x', is

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:21.500
secant squared.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:24.710
But we also, by the chain rule,
have to multiply by a

00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:26.980
derivative of 'x/2' with
respect to 'x'.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.960
In other words, if 'z' is
'10x/2', 'dz' is not secant

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:37.750
squared 'x/2', it's 1/2 'secant
squared 'x/2' dx'.

00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:40.460
But what's 'secant
squared 'x/2''?

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.540
Let's go back and look
at our diagram.

00:26:43.540 --> 00:26:47.790
The secant of 'x/2' is the
hypotenuse over side-adjacent.

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:52.010
That's the square root of '1
plus 'z squared'' over 1 and,

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:56.990
therefore, the square of the
secant is just '1 plus 'z

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.280
squared'' over 1, see,
'1 plus 'z squared''.

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:03.510
So, with the 1/2 in here, this
becomes '1 plus 'z squared''

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.710
over 2 times 'dx'.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:08.680
And, consequently, if I compare
these two now, notice

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.390
that 'dx' is just twice 'dz'/
'1 plus 'z squared''.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.300
In other words, what's
happened to 'dx'?

00:27:15.300 --> 00:27:18.350
It's been replaced by a
differential in 'z', which

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:21.100
involves the quotient
of two polynomials.

00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:24.140
So, 'dx' comes out very nicely
this way, in terms of, what?

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.680
The quotient of two
polynomials.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.840
How about 'sine x'
and 'cosine x'?

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:32.690
And, again, notice the
dependency on identities.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:37.490
'Sine x' is twice 'sine
'x/2' cosine 'x/2''.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:41.020
But, from my reference triangle,
I can pick off the

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.150
trigonometric functions
of 'x/2' very easily.

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:48.400
Namely, the sine of 'x/2' is
just 'z' over the square root

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:53.300
of '1 plus 'z squared'', and the
cosine of 'x/2' is just 1

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:56.280
over the square root of
'1 plus 'z squared''.

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.390
Plugging that in here, I find
that 'sine x' is twice 'z'

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:03.960
over the square root of '1 plus
'z squared'' times 1 over

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.190
the square root of '1
plus 'z squared''.

00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:08.500
Multiplying this out,
I find, what?

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:12.610
That 'sine x' is twice 'z', and
the square root of '1 plus

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:16.020
'z squared'' times itself is
just '1 plus 'z squared''.

00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:20.420
In other words, 'sine x' is
'2z'/ '1 plus 'z squared''.

00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:22.700
In other words, with the
substitution, what

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.320
happens to 'sine x'?

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:29.870
It becomes '2z'/ '1 plus 'z
squared'', which is also the

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.530
quotient of two polynomials
in 'z', OK?

00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:36.610
Finally, how about 'cosine x'?

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.650
What identity can we use
to reduce 'cosine

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.360
x' in terms of 'x/2'?

00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:45.270
Why do we want the 'x/2'?

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:48.870
Again, notice that even though
we may not have invented this

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.740
substitution by ourself,
once it's invented, the

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.260
relationship to the angle 'x/2'
becomes very apparent.

00:28:56.260 --> 00:28:59.200
At any rate, notice the identity
that says that

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:03.500
'cosine 2x' is 'cosine squared
x' minus 'sine squared x'

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:08.010
translates into 'cosine x' is
cosine squared of half the

00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:11.330
angle minus sine squared
of half the angle.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:17.400
Well, 'cosine squared 'x/2'',
well, 'cosine 'x/2'' is just 1

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.570
over the square root of '1 plus
'c squared'', so 'cosine

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:24.600
squared 'x/2'' is just 1/
'1 plus 'z squared''.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.620
Similarly, 'sine squared 'x/2''
is just 'z squared'

00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:30.630
over '1 plus 'z squared''.

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:34.450
And what we find is that 'cosine
x' is '1 minus 'z

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:38.500
squared'' over '1 plus
'z squared''.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:40.020
And, again, what's happened?

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:43.620
'Cosine x' is now expressable
as the quotient of two

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.520
polynomials in 'z'.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.840
In fact, as an application of
this, let's come back to an

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:51.340
integrand that's been giving
us some trouble for

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:52.800
quite some time now.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.350
Let's look at the integral
'secant x dx' and see if we

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:00.750
can't use this technique that
we've just learned to solve

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.780
this particular problem.

00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:06.750
Notice that secant is 1 over
cosine, therefore, integral

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.020
'secant x dx' is integral
'dx' over 'cosine x'.

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.010
Now, let's come back here
for a moment just

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:14.280
to refresh our memories.

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:20.290
We saw that 'dx' was two 'dz'/
'1 plus 'z squared''.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:26.320
We saw that 'cosine x' was '1
minus 'z squared'' over '1

00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.515
plus 'z squared'', therefore, '1
over cosine x' will just be

00:30:30.515 --> 00:30:31.840
the reciprocal of this.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:35.740
In other words, coming back here
now, we can replace 'dx'

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:40.920
by '2 dz' over '1 plus 'z
squared'' and '1 over cosine

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.950
x' by '1 plus 'z squared''
over '1 minus

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.840
'z squared'', OK?

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.710
Therefore, in terms of this
substitution, integral 'secant

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:57.290
x dx' is just twice integral
'dz'/ '1 minus 'z squared''.

00:30:57.290 --> 00:30:59.010
But, what is this integrand?

00:30:59.010 --> 00:31:04.030
This integrand is the quotient
of two polynomials in 'z',

00:31:04.030 --> 00:31:07.590
therefore, I could use partial
fractions here, write this as

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:13.600
a term: something over '1 plus
z' plus something over '1

00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.270
minus z', et cetera, solve the
problem in terms of 'z', and

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:22.460
then, remembering that 'z' is
'tangent 'x/2'', I can then

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:25.596
replace 'z' by what its equal
to in terms of 'x', and in

00:31:25.596 --> 00:31:27.460
that way solve the problem.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.020
Now, you see, what I want you to
see again, that comes true

00:31:30.020 --> 00:31:33.590
here all the time, is how we
are continually looking for

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:39.650
ways of reducing integrals to
equivalent integrals, but,

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:43.290
hopefully, ones that are more
familiar to us, meaning, what?

00:31:43.290 --> 00:31:45.670
Ones that we are
able to handle.

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:49.000
In the next lesson, we're going
to find a very powerful

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.950
technique, which is far more
general than partial

00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:55.560
fractions, a technique which is
used over, and over, again,

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.920
which is probably the single
most important technique.

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:00.970
But, I won't say any more
about that right now.

00:32:00.970 --> 00:32:03.560
We'll continue with this
discussion next time.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.400
And, until next time,
good bye.
