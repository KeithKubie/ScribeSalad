00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.870
You're going to use Android Studio 
to create the DetailActivity

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.550
from the Blank Activity 
with Fragment template.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.030
The template asks for the
hierarchical parent of DetailActivity,

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.920
which defines the UP button
noted by the app icon,

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.410
and a left-pointing carat here.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.730
But what does "up" mean?

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.630
If you mapped out a hierarchy 
of all screens in the Sunshine app,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.030
the root of the tree 
would be the MainActivity,

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.790
and it's child would be 
the DetailActivity.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.700
So, the UP goes to the MainActivity.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.730
While the BACK button 
can achieve the same effect,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.160
it can also bring you back home,
or to another app,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.140
depending on your history of screens.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.960
UP will always navigate you 
within the same app to the parent,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.650
regardless of how 
you arrived at this screen.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.840
Create the detail activity now,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.910
and look at how the activity is declared
in the Android manifest file.
