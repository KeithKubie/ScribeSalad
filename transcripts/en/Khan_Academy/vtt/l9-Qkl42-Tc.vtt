00:00:00.386 --> 00:00:02.406
- [Voiceover] In this video
we're going to be talking about

00:00:02.406 --> 00:00:04.405
how you make a buffer.

00:00:04.405 --> 00:00:07.509
There are two main situations
where you make a buffer,

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.269
and for lack of a better way to put it,

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:13.929
the first way is when you

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.649
know you want a buffer with a specific pH,

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:21.649
so you're making it on purpose
for a specific application,

00:00:22.265 --> 00:00:25.605
and then the second time
that you might make a buffer,

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:29.040
especially in chemistry
class, is by accident,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.801
which is to say that you're
doing something else,

00:00:31.801 --> 00:00:34.360
you're probably a titration, for example,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.860
and you just happen to have done

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.580
a reaction where it ends up with a buffer

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.400
in your solution.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.700
So we're gonna talk a little bit about

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.901
both of those situations.

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.557
One equation that I'm going to refer to,

00:00:49.557 --> 00:00:51.777
and I'm gonna assume that
you're already familiar with,

00:00:51.777 --> 00:00:53.736
is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation.

00:00:53.736 --> 00:00:57.013
So that is pH

00:00:57.013 --> 00:01:01.173
equals the pKa of the weak acid

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:03.933
plus the natural log

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.592
of our weak base,

00:01:05.592 --> 00:01:07.689
which I will abbreviate as a minus,

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.038
divided by our weak acid concentration.

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.609
So if you're interested
in the derivation of this,

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.469
we won't go through that
in this particular video,

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.869
but we do have other
videos that talk about it.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.914
So let's say we have

00:01:22.914 --> 00:01:25.114
a specific reaction we wanna run at,

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:26.513
say, a pH of four.

00:01:26.513 --> 00:01:28.874
So we wanna make a pH-four buffer.

00:01:28.874 --> 00:01:31.984
In that case, we normally make

00:01:31.984 --> 00:01:35.997
a mixture of a weak acid

00:01:35.997 --> 00:01:39.228
plus a weak base,

00:01:39.228 --> 00:01:41.093
and that weak base might either just be

00:01:41.093 --> 00:01:42.292
a weak base like ammonia,

00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:46.033
or it might be a salt
with the conjugate base

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:48.253
of our weak acid.

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:50.558
So an example would be

00:01:52.248 --> 00:01:53.989
acetic acid,

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.229
CH3COOH,

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.316
and that's our weak acid,

00:01:59.316 --> 00:02:01.672
and we might combine that in solution

00:02:01.672 --> 00:02:03.869
with sodium acetate.

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.724
So sodium

00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:09.615
plus CH3COO-minus.

00:02:11.025 --> 00:02:12.285
And so I'm gonna draw this using the

00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:13.825
molecular structures too,

00:02:13.825 --> 00:02:16.025
because I think that makes
it a little bit easier to see

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:18.865
the relationship between
these two structures.

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:21.721
We have our acetic acid,

00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:24.441
which has a CH3 group here,

00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:27.898
and a carboxylic acid
group with the proton,

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:30.778
and this proton is acidic,

00:02:30.778 --> 00:02:32.578
so it can donate that proton,

00:02:32.578 --> 00:02:35.033
and then you get

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:36.779
the acetate.

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:41.020
So CH3COO-minus,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.559
and then we have a sodium cation.

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:47.124
So if we combine our
acetate and our sodium

00:02:47.124 --> 00:02:49.383
acetate salt and solution,

00:02:49.383 --> 00:02:52.724
what we get is an equilibrium
between these two things,

00:02:52.724 --> 00:02:56.559
and that's how we have something
that acts like a buffer.

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:59.480
We have our weak acid,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.174
our weak acid being acetic acid,

00:03:03.174 --> 00:03:06.235
and what our weak acid does is it,

00:03:06.235 --> 00:03:09.402
let's see, let's do this
in a different color.

00:03:09.402 --> 00:03:13.142
What our weak acid does is it soaks

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:16.716
up any added weak base.

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:18.677
So, sorry,

00:03:18.677 --> 00:03:22.557
it soaks up any added strong base,

00:03:22.557 --> 00:03:24.796
so hydroxide ions.

00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:27.576
So it'll react with your hydroxide ions

00:03:27.576 --> 00:03:30.996
and keep it from changing
the pH as drastically

00:03:30.996 --> 00:03:33.667
as it would if the weak acid wasn't there.

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:36.217
And on the other side of our equilibrium,

00:03:36.217 --> 00:03:38.032
we have our weak base,

00:03:38.032 --> 00:03:41.332
which is the conjugate
base of our weak acid,

00:03:41.332 --> 00:03:43.791
and what that does

00:03:43.791 --> 00:03:47.799
is it soaks up

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.919
any added H-plus ions,

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.179
say, if you added some strong acid.

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:56.528
So that's one very common

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:58.750
scenario where you'll have a buffer.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.770
You want a specific
buffer with a specific pH,

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.950
so you might use the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation,

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.030
and you'll say, "Okay,
I want a pH of four,"

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.689
and then we'll look at

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:09.470
different salts and their pKa,

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.570
and then we'll adjust these concentrations

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.661
to get the pH that we want.

00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:19.097
The second situation where
you might get a buffer,

00:04:19.097 --> 00:04:22.037
and this one is also
really common in chemistry,

00:04:22.037 --> 00:04:24.757
is by accident. (chuckles)

00:04:24.757 --> 00:04:27.437
So what this means is you've made a buffer

00:04:27.437 --> 00:04:31.019
because you combined a weak acid

00:04:32.769 --> 00:04:34.554
with a strong base.

00:04:37.465 --> 00:04:41.281
Or another way you can make a buffer,

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.637
which I will write in parentheses,

00:04:42.637 --> 00:04:45.953
is you combine a weak base

00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.043
with a strong acid.

00:04:49.453 --> 00:04:52.713
And this is very common

00:04:52.713 --> 00:04:55.493
in titrations.

00:04:55.493 --> 00:04:57.733
So anytime you titrate a weak acid

00:04:57.733 --> 00:04:59.883
or a weak base,

00:05:02.612 --> 00:05:05.073
when you titrate it with a
strong base or a strong acid,

00:05:05.073 --> 00:05:08.613
you end up making a buffer
for part of your titration.

00:05:08.613 --> 00:05:11.973
So the example we'll go through here,

00:05:11.973 --> 00:05:14.835
we're gonna start with the weak acid,

00:05:15.885 --> 00:05:17.861
acetic acid,

00:05:17.861 --> 00:05:21.138
like in our other example.

00:05:22.047 --> 00:05:24.428
So we have this acetic acid, but this time

00:05:24.428 --> 00:05:26.824
we're going to react
it with the strong base

00:05:26.824 --> 00:05:28.564
sodium hydroxide.

00:05:28.564 --> 00:05:30.996
So sodium-plus OH-minus

00:05:30.996 --> 00:05:33.107
is how it dissociates.

00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:36.777
And so what happens when you
react these two things together

00:05:36.777 --> 00:05:39.196
is you get a neutralization reaction,

00:05:39.196 --> 00:05:42.803
and this acidic proton,

00:05:44.013 --> 00:05:47.013
so this acidic proton right
here on our acetic acid

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.133
can react with the hydroxide

00:05:49.133 --> 00:05:51.383
and it will make H2O.

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:55.732
And then what that leaves us with here

00:05:55.732 --> 00:05:57.954
is our acetate becomes,

00:05:57.954 --> 00:06:02.424
sorry, our acetic acid becomes acetate.

00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:06.373
And so you can see that if you react

00:06:06.373 --> 00:06:08.734
a strong base with a weak acid,

00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:10.114
which I will label,

00:06:10.114 --> 00:06:12.593
if you react a weak
acid with a strong base,

00:06:12.593 --> 00:06:14.894
you end up making the conjugate base

00:06:14.894 --> 00:06:16.584
of your weak acid.

00:06:18.254 --> 00:06:19.483
And so what this means is that

00:06:19.483 --> 00:06:21.624
even if you didn't combine

00:06:21.624 --> 00:06:24.863
your conjugate base with
your weak acid up front,

00:06:24.863 --> 00:06:26.203
like in example one,

00:06:26.203 --> 00:06:28.144
you actually make it in solution,

00:06:28.144 --> 00:06:30.704
and so you can still end up making a base.

00:06:30.704 --> 00:06:34.644
So the key situation where
you're going to see this

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.563
is in a titration.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:38.989
To be more specific,

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:43.382
you'll see it in the buffer region.

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:47.573
And like I said earlier,

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:50.669
this occurs when,

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:53.184
when you're titrating

00:06:53.184 --> 00:06:55.850
a weak acid or a weak base,

00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:02.702
so a weak acid or base.

00:07:02.702 --> 00:07:05.123
So you don't make a
buffer if you're titrating

00:07:05.123 --> 00:07:07.823
a strong acid or a strong base.

00:07:07.823 --> 00:07:09.363
But what this means is that whenever

00:07:09.363 --> 00:07:10.924
you're doing this kind of reaction

00:07:10.924 --> 00:07:13.544
where you might be making a buffer

00:07:13.544 --> 00:07:15.084
as the reaction goes on,

00:07:15.084 --> 00:07:16.984
that means we can use the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

00:07:16.984 --> 00:07:19.340
right here

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:21.380
to do calculations about the pH

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.120
or the concentrations in our solution.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.561
So these are the two main situations

00:07:26.561 --> 00:07:29.261
where you'll have a buffer,
and in both of these situations

00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:31.220
you'll probaby be using the
Henderson-Hasselbalch equation

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.604
to do different kinds of calculations.
