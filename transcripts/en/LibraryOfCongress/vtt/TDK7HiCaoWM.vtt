&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.960
&gt;&gt; My name is Adam Wittings.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.390
Today we have guest actress,
author, poet, dancer,

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.290
and fine artist Miss
Bernadette Stanis,

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:33.140
Thelma Evans of the television
hit series Good Times.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.940
We welcome her today.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.410
[ Applause ]

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.970
&gt;&gt; I was born and raised
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.750
In the [laugther], in the brown
hood [phonetic] section of Brooklyn

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.220 position:56%
and my mom and dad have five
children at a two bedroom apartment,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.670
you know, a little living
room a little bathroom.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.930
So they raised all seven of
us in that little apartment.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.540
So, I understood when
[laugther] Good Times came around.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.530
I understood it [laugther].

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.910
They picked the right girl.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.620
Right? So, born and raised in
Brownville was very challenging.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.240
I'm sure for my parents
to raise two boys

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.670
and three girls, but they did well.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.560
I'm being the oldest I had
a lot more responsibility.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.990
My father always told me
-- Bernadette, for one,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.270
if you go wrong, if you go bad,

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.500
all of my other children are
going to go bad -- , really?

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.510 position:56%
-- Being the oldest -- , he said, --
you're the leader and they're going

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:40.890
to watch what you do -- .

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.850
So, with that in mind, I always
wanted to be the good girl,

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.270
you know, to live up to what I
had to do as a responsibility

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.560
for my siblings and everything.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.650
I remember my dad, mom, they
being in the projects, you know,

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.510
they wanted us to have
a great education.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.510
So, they put us in parochial
school and I remember --

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:07.040
[ Noise ]

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.640
They put us in parochial
school, all those popping peas,

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.510
I understand that, and [inaudible]
they put us in parochial school

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.510
and it was like 10 blocks
away from the projects, okay.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.030
So, every morning we would have
to walk like 10 blocks to school.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.160
And you know how cold the
winters are in New York.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.400
So, we learned character that way,
but we also learned a lot of things

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.570
about walking ten blocks

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.940
to [inaudible] School --
thank you so much -- .

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.860 position:56%
First of all, we learned about those
junkies, you know, we had junkies

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.740
around the corner of the block.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.760
And, as kids, we didn't understand,
you know, the devastation of that.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.420
They were just very
entertaining to us.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.620
So, while we would go to school,
we would always take bets,

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.700 position:56%
[laughter] because, as you know,
when you are on heroin, on heroin --

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.620
junkies -- their hands
are very big and --

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.490
they nod and they go all
the way down to the floor

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.080
but the amazing thing was that
they never hit the ground.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.700
Did you know that?

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.000
[Crowd laugther].

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.300
Did you know that?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.140
And they would stay in a pose for
a very long time, and then they go

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.440
down and then they pop right up.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.130
I just thought it was
amazing [laugther] a fine art.

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:37.140
But any way, we learned that,
we learned a lot of things

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.090
and my father always
said this to us, "Look,

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.120
what's around you does
not have to be in you",

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.950
he raised us that way, you know.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.630
So, what you see around you is
what is around you but what is

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.130
in you is more important.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.320
And is going to direct
you in certain way.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.580 position:56%
Now, that was a great lesson for me.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.470
I'm going to just share some
of the lessons that I learned

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:05.610
and that impacted me in my
life time from both my parents.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.470
But this one here is something
that I learned from my mom.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.620
Now, when I was about 10
years old, there was a girl,

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.070
there were two girls in my class
called Mary Rose and Caroline --

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:23.150
I'm not going to say the last
names, because they might be

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:24.450
in the audience or
something [crowd laugther].

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:32.210
But any way these two girls were
so beautiful to me and so smart

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:37.570
and they just were everything I
ever wanted to be at 10 years old.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.910
I, on the other hand was not that
smart but I was like okay smart.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.150
I was like a B, C student
but I was hanging in there.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:54.060
And I remember that they would
always get A's and look great

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.910 position:56%
and all this, so I just wanted to
be in that click, that I want to be,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.880
that was my goal in life
to be a part of them.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.890
And they always absolutely
always rejected me

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:09.820
and it was a hurtful thing
ever since the second grade,

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:15.190
now I'm in the fifth grade
and I'm still trying.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.130
But I figured it out; I figured
it out one day, I said "Duh,

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.220
they're A students, I'm not."

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.240
So, what does it take
to be an A student?

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.620
And I studied and I
studied and I studied.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.330
And I became an A student.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.180
I passed this test with a big
[inaudible] A. I was right there

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.700
in their click, in
the elite, you know.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.140
And I remember that day
so happy and I went to --

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:44.020
we had recess and at recess that
we would always play Double Dutch

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.000
or a little things like that and so
they were playing Double Dutch --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.320
You all know about
that a Double Dutch?

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.080
[Crowd laugther] All right,
you're in my category.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.080
So, I went over to them that day
and I said "Okay, can I play?"

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:06.230 position:56%
They looked at me the way the always
looked at me and said, "No", I said,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.220
wait a, you know, "Can I play?"

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.270
You know, I'm now on
the side of begging.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.070
"Can I please play?"

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.550
[Laugther] "No, you can't" And
then they looked at me like,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:18.850
you got to get out of here.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:22.230 position:56%
I was crushed, I was really crushed.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:24.040
That was a big thing for me.

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:28.060
And so, I went home that evening
and I was crying and, you know,

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.420
down and carrying on as I usually
do whenever they do reject me.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.040
And this time it was worse
because I thought I figured it out.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.260
And my mom was there and she
said "What's wrong Bern?"

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.740
I said "Caroline, Mary Rose
they still, still don't want me

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.760
to be their friends, you
know, I don't understand,

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.480
mommy, why is it, why is it?"

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.280
And she believed in having answer
for me but she said this to me,

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.460
she said "Well, Bern, look at it
like this, you know, some people --

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.310
they have talents, you
know, dancing, singing

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.670
and that's what you have, you're
talented, and they're very smart.

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.850 position:56%
So, maybe, they don't see, you know,
your value and your things like"--

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.940 position:56%
I didn't want to hear that, that was
like -- that's not going to work-- .

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.740
I don't want to be
talented right now.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.410
That was my attitude.

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:21.880
Then I moved around for hours
until my mother finally in the end

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:29.670 position:56%
of the evening sat down next to me
and she said this, she said "Bern --

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:33.940
one day the whole world is
going to know your name",

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:39.510
but she didn't tell me it
was going to be [inaudible].

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:44.930
[ Crowd laugther ]

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.360
So, I listened and I said "Okay,
whatever" But you know what?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.030
I didn't understand what she was
doing and what she was saying

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.450
and I realized as an
adult, that, you know,

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:01.990
sometimes a parents are given
certain messages and certain things

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:05.560
to say to their children
in devastating situations,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.050
you know, if they're connected.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.520
I mean to wanting a child
to prosper and she spoke

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.460
into my life something,
it taught me to learn --

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.360
it taught me to speak
into my children's lives,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.750
what I want for them, you know.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.570
And no matter how bad it may be at
the time, I would say, "You know,

00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.940
I don't like what you did
but you know you're smart,

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.390
you know you're going to be great.

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:33.430
So we can't have those bad things
trimming behind you if you're going

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.000
to be a big, great person".

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.830
I don't say those things
anyway [laugther].

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:43.640
That was a lesson for me
because when I look back at it,

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:48.340
my mother spoke prophecy
into my life, didn't she?

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:51.940
So that's why, always when I speak
to students at schools and stuff

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:56.260
like that, I always tell them
"You know, listen to your parents,

00:08:56.260 --> 00:09:00.050
listen to someone that's older
that's trying to help you".

00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:02.270
Because they're nuggets,
they're gone nuggets.

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:06.920
"If you listen you don't have
to go through so much" you know.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.800
And I hope that they hear me,

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.140
because it's very important
to listen.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.140
So, that was one of my lessons,

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.770
and that's something
I love my mother for.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:21.180
And then there was this
other one when I wanted to be

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:24.490 position:56%
in the beauty pageant as a teenager.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:27.330
And I begged my mother -- Mom,
I want to be in this pageant,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:32.030 position:56%
I want to be in this pageant in
this pageant so bad, so bad, so bad,

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.590
my mother said -- you sure
want to be in this pageant?

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:36.600
-- I said -- yes -- now
you know this is going

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.020
to cost a lot of money, right?

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.000
-- You know the gowns, the disk --
the time she got for other kids,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.520 position:56%
you know, she's got to do this whole
thing every week for the summer.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.490
And I'm like -- I want to do it, I
want to do it, I want to be in it--

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:50.550
So, she finally said -- okay.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:51.850
So, we got in it.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.650 position:56%
Now, every Sunday, which [inaudible]
sit down from Brooklyn to Manhattan,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.390
she's got all five of
us, pulling us down to go

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:03.050
to Manhattan to do the rehearsal.

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.800
So, this went on for
about seven weeks.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.440
The eighth week was the day
show, the Sunday of the show.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:14.350
And I got up that morning,
and I looked in the mirror,

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:20.230 position:56%
and I decided I was not going to go.

00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:23.220
I decided that and I meant that.

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.290
And my mother said -- okay, it's
time to get ready, you know,

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:32.050
let's go, you know, let's get
it together now -- I'm like --

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:37.690
mom, I'm not going
-- , my mother looked

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.530
at me [crowd laugther],
she said -- What?

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.840
-- She said -- girl, get
dressed, come on, we've got to go.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.490
She didn't even hear me, I'm like,
"Okay, this is not working" --

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.080
I'm really not going -- So, I'm
like, I'm [inaudible] and alone --

00:10:51.080 --> 00:11:00.710
, she says-- hurry up, we
have to go -- and I'm like --

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:02.010
okay, all right, [complaining
sounds] -- [laughter].

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.260
So, I finally get dressed, we
finally go, we walk into the subway

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:10.810
to go Manhattan, we get on the
train, and I sit far away from her

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:12.110
because you know, I'm
mad [laugther] --

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.310
I'm mad, I got the way to
[inaudible] them very mad.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.040
And my mother is paying
me no attention.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:23.280
She does that sometimes,
pays me no attention.

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:27.990
So, I'm like, "Okay, all right,
she's not even understanding this

00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:34.120
at all", so, I sat on that subway,
and I figured, I have an hour.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.360
So I start now.

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:40.610
And I'll start the
mastering up my asthma attack.

00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:42.970
Simple, simple.

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:44.270
I would start breathing
deeply [whizzing like asthma].

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:50.470
Now, if anybody has asthma, you
know what I'm talking about,

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:56.810
because if you breathe deeply
enough, you'll catch a whizz.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.150
[Crowd laugther] I got my whizz.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.450
[laugther].

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:03.040
So, I'm whizzing now [whizzing].

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.600
We get off the subway and mother
says -- what's wrong with you?

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:15.990
-- I can't do it, mom,
I've got asthma --

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.290
[whizzing like with asthma attack].

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:21.360
You know we know our children.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.660
My mother knew me.

00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:27.200
She looked at me and she said --
Bernadette, there's a drug store

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:29.380
on the corner, we're
going to go over there

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.240
and get a Primatene Mist
[audience and speaker laugther],

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.930
you're going to take it, and
you're going to be okay -- .

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.710
Uhm, I couldn't get around her.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:42.830
But you know back you
could get Primatene Mist,

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.230
you know, you can't get it now.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:45.920
But any way, I took the mist,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.480
I sat around for a few
minutes, and I was fine.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.520
And then I had to go on stage.

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.820
And I did it.

00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.120
I wouldn't let her down, you know.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.460
So, now I'm there.

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.200
So, I was going to do
what I was there to do.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:01.370
She said -- you better do what
you've got to do up there [crowd

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.670
and speaker laugther] -- .

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:03.970
I knew her better.

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:06.640
So, I did my little thing, you
know, whatever I had to do.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:12.470
But it really was an amazing thing
because, it was that Sunday that,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:16.770
there was a manager there
that saw me and told my mom

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.540
that they're looking for a teenager
to be in a television series.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.390
And they thought that I might fit.

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:28.830
So, they gave my mother their
card, so that we could go to CBS

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:33.530
and see Norman there,
you know, the next day.

00:13:33.530 --> 00:13:35.150
The next day we go off there.

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:39.440
I'm like -- Okay, you know -- I
don't know anything about anything.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.580
It's my first audition and
I don't understand the game.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:44.250
I don't know what's what.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.150
I'm just walking and following.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:51.240
So, I get up there with,
at CBS and we open the door

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:53.440
and there were hundreds of girls.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.090
Hundreds. May be not
hundreds [crowd laugther],

00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:58.980
may be about 80 or whatever.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.990
But it looked like thousands.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:05.510
So, I'm sitting there and
I'm like, "Oh my goodness.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:06.810
Oh, my gosh".

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.280 position:56%
This is weird, okay, well, whatever,
and my mom is looking at me and I'm

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:13.090
like -- I gave us such a hard
time yesterday but I won't,

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:15.090
you know, I won't do it today-- .

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:21.380
But I was thinking about what I did
and how I acted, the day before.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:25.560
And what came to me, and I'm
going to share this with you,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.770
was actually the reason
why I was acting that way,

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:33.690
was because I was afraid,
I was afraid,

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.400
and I was afraid again
in the audition.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.700
But I was really afraid.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.290
And I was afraid that
they wouldn't pick me,

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:43.710
that I wouldn't be good enough,
that I wouldn't be pretty enough,

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:46.870
that I wouldn't make it, that my
talent wouldn't be good enough.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.620 position:56%
And I just didn't want to hear "no".

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:53.020 position:56%
I didn't want to hear "no" that day.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.450
So, I figured if I didn't
go, I wouldn't hear "no"

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:00.390
and I would win in my own way.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:04.400
But what a loser I would have been.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:09.020
So, the lesson that I
got out of that was this,

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:13.800
don't let fear stop you from
walking into your destiny.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.670
Because, truly, when
something great is

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:21.140
about to happen, fear
does come over us.

00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:24.340
You know, we doubt ourselves or
we think "I can't really do this

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.610
or what is", and because
of that, all of my life,

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:32.800
whenever that fear came, l
made sure I walked through it.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.180
And I teach my daughters
the same thing --

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.590 position:56%
don't be afraid because when
something is coming for you it seems

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.880
like you'll get most afraid -- .

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.450
So, that was my lesson there.

00:15:42.450 --> 00:15:44.300
Now I'm sitting in this audition.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:47.160
And I'm like "Okay.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.440
I'm afraid again but I'm
not going to tell mom.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.150
I'm just going to do my thing".

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.200
But I kept thinking about
what dad would always say.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.760
And dad would always say
this "What's for you,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.590
no one can take from you".

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.880
And I kept thinking
that and thinking that.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.520
And when they called
me for the audition,

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.830
I was really weddy
[phonetic], because, you know,

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:09.390
I didn't really know
what it was about.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.250
I just knew that I had to do it.

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.100
And I did it, you know, my way.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:14.400
That's just how I did it.

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.910
I would have no fear with that
because it's so big, I mean,

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:19.780
I may go to make it,
I may not, big deal.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:24.370
So, when I walked in there, it was
Norman Lear sitting behind the desk

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:28.040
with his white hat, you
know, how Norman does.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.650
He's the producer of the show.

00:16:29.650 --> 00:16:32.650
And, it was Jimmie
Walker standing there,

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:37.550
with his dumb hat [crowd laugther].

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:39.040
I'm looking at this
guy, I'm like, -- Hewh.

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:44.180
So, any way, they give me a
script, and the script reads

00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:47.570
as if someone wrote it
for a girl in the projects

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:49.760
that knew really nothing
about this girl.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:53.570
So, I'm reading it and it
sounded really not right.

00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.220
And I'm saying -- excuse
me but mister Lear,

00:16:56.220 --> 00:16:59.320
is it okay if I just improvise,
you know, just say what I just,

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.670
you know, just improvise --
I knew about improvising,

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.790
I knew about that [laughter],
I said -- can I just do that?

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.940
Because, see, I have
brothers, I know eheem.

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.580
So, he said -- Ohg, Okay, fine,
do it, we've got lots of girls,

00:17:12.580 --> 00:17:14.540
do it -- , so, I said -- okay.

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.910
So, I got up there and I
said to Jimmie, I said --

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:20.070
Okay, look, you better
clean this house

00:17:20.070 --> 00:17:22.600
or least help me clean this
house, you can do the dishes,

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.900
you can empty the garbage,
do something,

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.750
you're just sitting there
-- so, he said, he said --

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.510
I'm not doing dishes, and
the garbage ain't full.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:33.590 position:56%
So, I'm not doing anything -- I said
-- , oh, yes, you are going to do --

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:36.770
you know, how you do, and then
he said -- , no, I'm not --

00:17:36.770 --> 00:17:38.750
yes, you are -- and I just hit him.

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:40.050
[Crowd laugther].

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.610
Because I do that to my brothers.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:45.050
I just hit him right
on the arm, bang.

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:48.070
And he like -- Huh What?

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:49.700
-- And I'm like -- yeah,
you're going to do it -- .

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.000
And he said -- No, I'm not-- .

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.060
And we just went back and
forth, then back and forth

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.880
and I think Norman was cracking
up, because it was real.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.560
It's just what you do, you know.

00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:01.170
So, that was not audition.

00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:02.470
[Crowd and speaker laugther] So,

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.190
I didn't hear anything
back for about a month.

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:06.340
So, I said, -- hum, I don't
think I did that right --

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:11.530
[inaudible] I should
have read that script.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:16.260
But it turned out that they did
call me a month and a half later

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.350
and they asked for me to go
out to California with my mom.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:23.580
It was three girls and now
it went down to four of us.

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.310
And we had to stay there a week
and we auditioned, we auditioned,

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:31.220
we auditioned and then, I,
about a month after that,

00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.510
I found out that I got Good Times.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:42.300
[ Applause ]

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:49.580
Now, I'm now I'm here on Good
Times and I am doing the show

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:55.890
for about six months and I start
realizing that I wanted to do more.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:19:01.450
It was like all, I did was come
in and say -- hi mom, hi dad.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.830
Shut up J.J., fight
with him a little bit

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.890
and I was back in bathroom.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:08.300
You all know those sounds.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.830
Okay, so, I mean, I'm
sitting there all day long

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:13.800
in rehearsal, doing
these five lines.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.330
You know, that's a little much.

00:19:15.330 --> 00:19:16.630
Everybody else got all these lines.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.220
I'm like -- hugh --
I'm just was bored.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.280
So, Esther and I were like this.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:22.560
I loved her so much
and she adopted me.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.120
She had to.

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.150
She had to take me on
because I wasn't going

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.900
to let her not take me on.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:32.650
I was at her house all the time,
I wasn't bugging her, I loved her.

00:19:32.650 --> 00:19:35.100
And so, one day we are at
her house and I said --

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.960
Mom, you know, I want
to do more lines,

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.730
you know I'm getting
bored -- she says -- What?

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:42.620
-- I said -- I'm getting bored.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.110
She said -- hum -- you know that
-- hum -- [crowd laugther] So,

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.150
I'm going -- No, I really am.

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.900 position:56%
I think I can do more, mom, I think
I can do more -- She said -- Really?

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.980 position:56%
-- I said -- Yes -- She said -- Hum.

00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:58.330
Okay, okay -- Let me handle it.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:02.230
-- That was the best -- thank you.

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:04.070
I said -- Okay, thank you.

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:08.160
So, when we did Friday,
we did our rehearsal.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.060
I'm reading out the next script.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.020
Here I am in rehearsal, you
know, we're reading the script.

00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:15.860
And of course, I had the same
famous lines, you know, --

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:20.870
Hi mom, hi dad, shut up J.J. and
I'm back in the bathroom -- .

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:25.040
So, at the end of the reading,
Esther said to the producers,

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.870
because when we read, we have the
writers, the producers, everybody,

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.170
normally everybody is there.

00:20:29.170 --> 00:20:31.800
And she said -- I'm going
to ask a question --

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.770
she's the star, so they went
-- Oh, yes, Esther, what is it?

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.510
-- She said -- I'm going to ask
a question about my daughter.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.320
They got quiet.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.560
And she said -- Are
you ashamed of her?

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.510
-- They said -- No, we're
not ashamed of her at all.

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:51.670
She said -- Is she retarded?

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:58.360
[Crowd laugther] -- I'm like
-- you went too far, mom -- .

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.840
You know, [laugther] I didn't talk.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.370
I'm like -- please I'm
not, you know, whatever.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.490
So they said -- No,
she's not retarded.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:09.170
And she said -- Okay,
this is what I want.

00:21:09.170 --> 00:21:14.360
My son J.J. has a lot to say, my
son Michael has a lot to say, now,

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.850
I want my daughter to have a voice,
and to have something to say -- .

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:23.390
And from that moment
on, I got some lines.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:24.690
And she looked at me.

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:26.860
She never said another word, she
just looked at me and I said --

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.040 position:56%
Thank you, mom -- , and what I meant
was that I would never let you down.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.680
I will never let you down.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.150
I will get those lines right, I
will be good, I'll do everything.

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.660
And I think she's very
proud of me behind that.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:46.000
She's the one who gave the first
black female teenager her voice,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.440
on television.

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.510
I was the first black female
teenager to ever be on television.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:57.520
[ Applause ]

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.350
Thank you.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:03.770
Now while I'm in the thrills
of Good Times I'm like almost

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:07.030
in the fourth season, no,
it was the third season.

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.500
And, I'm in the swing of things, a
lot of lines, a lot of everything.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:15.670 position:56%
And, I got something called nodules,
because I was taking singing lessons

00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:18.640
and I was stringing, you know,
I wasn't doing that right.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.520
But any way, I developed these
nodules on my vocal chords.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.790
So, in the morning,
I would sound normal

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.520
but by the time evening
came I sounded like a man.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:28.830
And they would hurt.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:33.290
So, I finally had to go to a
specialist and they diagnosed me

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.590
and they told me what
they had to do.

00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:37.290
And they had to, you know, operate

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.950
and that the vocal cords
can go one of two ways.

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.950
I mean you can lose
your voice for ever

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:46.710
or you can get very
well and sound normal.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:50.480
So, they said that the
operation was usually successful.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.790
So, I did the operation.

00:22:51.790 --> 00:22:56.950
But before that I mentioned to
my producers, that I'm going

00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:59.390
to have this operation,
the doctor said

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:04.820
that I'm not supposed
to speak for six months.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:10.500
Six months, I'm going
to be off that show.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.800
I thought about it.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.980
And I went to the producers
and I said -- okay, this is it.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.790
I'm not supposed to
speak for a long time.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:20.560
So, what can you do to
make it work, maybe,

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.120 position:56%
I can speak, you know, a little bit?

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.380
-- So they said -- No, you
don't have to speak only

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:28.710
on tape night we'll
allow you to speak --

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:30.500
My doctor said that was fine.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:35.060
So, therefore, no one really
knew that I had nodules.

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:36.660
I just went right in.

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:39.310
So, I would speak softly, but I
would speak on Thursday nights,

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.770
that was the deal, and
I stayed on Good Times.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:44.660
So, that was wonderful.

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:49.970
In the process, though, of
not speaking, I learned a lot.

00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:54.320
You know, we didn't have texts,
we didn't have all that stuff.

00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.180
So, I had to write out everything.

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:59.200
So, I started writing everything
out and showing people papers

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.480
and showing people, -- but then we
didn't have spell check, either.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:06.190
[laugther] I'm like -- This
isn't going to work out.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.390
They'll think I'm a real dumb.

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:16.550
-- [laugther] so, what I did, so,
what I did was, I prayed a lot

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.170
and I asked -- God what is it?

00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:20.070
Why? Why did it happen to me?

00:24:20.070 --> 00:24:21.370
And stuff like that.

00:24:21.370 --> 00:24:27.710 position:56%
I just prayed a lot, and, you know,
He kind of told me -- just be quiet.

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:32.990
I quieted you down for a
reason -- I'm like -- Really?

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.700
And I, you know, I
phoned all the time.

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:36.090
So, I stopped the phone.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.530
I stopped talking so much
and I started writing.

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:39.830
I just started writing people.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.360
They just knew not to speak to me.

00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:42.660
It was hard.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.960
It was lonely.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.260
It was weird.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.920 position:56%
And, what I started to do was write.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.840
I started by poetry.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:58.250
And the most amazing poetry
came to me, because I was quiet.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:00.300
And I listened.

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.940
And, before that I didn't
have time to write no poetry.

00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:06.500
I was so busy talking.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:10.420
So, sometimes when God
does something in our lives

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:16.370
that may be devastating to us,
but if we ask him why this is?

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:20.160
He'll give you the answer
to why He's done it.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.180
And if you listen,
that's your benefit.

00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.800
So, what I did is this
wonderful poetry

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:28.810
and I started my writing career.

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.040
I started writing all
the time, ideas will come

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.290
to me, just beautiful things.

00:25:34.290 --> 00:25:39.010
And I just thank God for that
because although I lost my voice,

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:43.030
He gave me a voice on paper.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.950
So, something sometimes
we have to just understand

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:48.250
that why did it happen to you?

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:51.770
Why not? Happened for a reason.

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.680
And what I did was gave
birth to my career now.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:26:00.210
I didn't know that I would be a
writer but I knew I loved writing

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.890
and writing was in me
and I was a good writer.

00:26:03.890 --> 00:26:09.050
And so, it gave birth to, later on,

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:13.150
I wrote a book called Situations
101 Relationships The Good the Bad

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:14.450
and the Ugly.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:17.840
Most of you probably do have
that book because I was here

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.070
with that book, first time.

00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:25.490
And that book came about
because, as life went on,

00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:32.120
and I'm a mature lady now, I
learned a lot about relationships.

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.360
And my mom was very instrumental
in that also because being back

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.440
in those days, those ladies got
married, you know, she dated my dad

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:45.190
when she was 16, they got married
when she was 20 and that was it.

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:48.080
No other man, no other
body would do daddy.

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.360
So, I would say -- Mom,
you know, I'm out here --

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.720
You know, I'm Thelma -- I'm out
here and what is it, you know,

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.550 position:56%
how do you get this guy, I mean, the
relationship stuff is not working,

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:00.490
like I thought it should
work -- She says --

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:04.640
Bern, I can't help you
-- Ma, you can't help me?

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.020
You got to help me -- She said --

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:10.120
I can't help you, I don't know the
world, I don't know what's out,

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.420
I don't know how it works -- .

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.210
She said -- but I'm
going to tell you this,

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.900
I want you to read
everything you could read,

00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.040
I want you to ask questions
and study.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.260
Study all you want to study
about relationships --

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.210
Because she felt bad
she couldn't help me.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:26.250
So, she gave me permission to go
into relationships, study them,

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:29.330
learn things, you know,
and I did that.

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:33.040
So, I was pretty equipped on,
you know, helping some people,

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.290
not all people, but some
people about relationships.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.990
I became the girlfriend that
every would call and talk

00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:41.900
about their stuff, you know what I
mean, and because I was out there

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:43.860
with them, you know, they
were just my friends.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:45.190
I didn't know all their friends.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.520
So, I would give them good
advice and they felt safe

00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.590
because I couldn't go and tell
their friends what they said,

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.050
you know, I was like that.

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:58.450
So, I would give them great advice
and they would keep coming back.

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:03.210 position:56%
So, everything that's in the book is
advice that I have given to someone.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.670
So, I did 101 different situations
but there are so many more.

00:28:06.670 --> 00:28:08.840
But this one girl, the reason
why the book came about,

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:14.080
was this one girl kept
asking me about this one guy.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:23.300
So, it was 3 o'clock in the morning
and she was calling me nonstop.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.720
And I said to her --
Wait a minute --

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.170
I picked up the phone and
I said -- What's wrong?

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:35.160
-- She said -- I can't reach him,
I can't, I can't -- I'm like --

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.400
, you can't reach him, it's
3 o'clock in the morning.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:39.700
Could he be sleeping?

00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.000
-- [Crowd laugther] -- No, I
don't think it's like that,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.460
I don't think it's like that.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:47.390
I left him a lot of messages
and you know-- , I said --

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:49.440
well-- I called a few times-- .

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.800
And I go -- okay, how
many times you called?

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.000
-- Well, you know, like 15
-- [crowd laugther] I say --

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.430
Wait, wait, wait, hold on there.

00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:02.730
This is obsession -- .

00:29:02.730 --> 00:29:06.360
I said -- did you leave
a message each time?

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.240
-- Yes, I did.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:12.220
-- I said -- , he might
not ever call you back.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.800
But anyway, I didn't say
that really, I thought that.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:17.730
So, I said to her --
Look, I'll tell you what,

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:22.020
I'm going to write some things out
for you that you can look at look,

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.480
you know, you can put
on your refrigerator.

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.030
So, in the middle of the
night, you know, you don't have

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.660
to call your friends
up, wake them up,

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.600
and tell them you called
somebody by the 15 time.

00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:36.440
And get through it through the
night and then call in the morning,

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.390
you know, we can talk
in the morning -- .

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:41.960
So, she said -- All right -- So,
I started writing these things.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.400
I said -- I want you to put them
on your refrigerator and, you know,

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.020
in the middle of the night,
you get up, you walk around,

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.320
you read it, it's right there.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.300
She said -- Okay -- .

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.070
And I said -- well, if that
doesn't work for you do like I do,

00:29:55.070 --> 00:30:00.390
open the refrigerator and eat
something -- [crowd laugther].

00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:10.940 position:56%
So we do. So, anyway, she would have
laughed with that but, you know,

00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:14.150
I started writing and writing and
that's how the book developed.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:16.150
I felt I was writing
so much, I kept writing

00:30:16.150 --> 00:30:17.450
and writing and the book came.

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:18.940
So, there are always
all little gifts

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.010
and things like that along the way.

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.480
And then there was this,
I thought I was touring

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:27.530
with the book Situations
Relationships,

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:31.930
I realized that people are breaking
up mostly because of finances.

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:38.390 position:56%
So, it came on me to write the book
on simple financing and how you feel

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.810
with your money, relationship with
your own money and how you feel

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:44.550
with sharing your money
with other people.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.160
And people don't address that, they
just go into a relationship and --

00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.280 position:56%
we're not going to talk about money,
we're not going to talk about money.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.580
-- Six months into
the relationship --

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.360
we're not going to
talk about money -- .

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:55.200
Come on. And then when
you say something --

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.770
I want to buy something -- why are
you spending your money on that?

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:01.660
-- You know, you have to
know where your money mind is

00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:03.620
when you're dealing
with people, you know.

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:09.450
First of all, you have to ask
them -- do you have good credit?

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:12.480
-- A lot of times they're
hope you have good credit.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:16.670
So, and vice-versa don't
just go one way [laughter].

00:31:16.670 --> 00:31:23.000
That credit is a big deal,
baby, in relationships.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.290
So, I start writing about
that and talking about that.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:31.450
Then, after that, that was the book
mommy and I were touring together

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:32.750
and that's when I said to her --

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.500
Mommy it would be nice if you
had a book too and you could sit

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:36.170
with me and things like that.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.280
And, you know, that's
when, you know,

00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:42.080
we realized that that
would never happen.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:49.550
But I got my mom in 2006 and I
want to share something with you.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:54.560
While doing all that book signing,
I had an 8-year old daughter

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.200
and an 18-year old daughter.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:02.280
Those are delicate ages, and
I had mommy, and of course,

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.650
I had my husband which
was helping me.

00:32:04.650 --> 00:32:08.580
But you're dealing with a
mother, and daughters and mommy

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:13.840
and the dynamics of that, and my
heart being in different places,

00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:16.900
and I realized that my little
daughter who was 8 years old,

00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:19.900
was very jealous of my
mother, when she came,

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:23.150
because I gave my mother all the
attention because my mom was sick.

00:32:23.150 --> 00:32:26.430
And I'm, oh my God, you know,
and my baby's getting --

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.260 position:56%
Why you have to treat her like that?

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.550
-- Because she was getting,
you know, she was a baby.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:35.640 position:56%
And so, one day my mom said to me --
I don't know why Britney is jealous

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:38.590
of me, who wants to be like this?

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.570
-- I said -- Mom, she's going to
get it together, because, you know,

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:44.470
you're not going to
be like this always.

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:49.860
You know, we're going to solve
this -- My older daughter,

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:52.710
she was watching from the distance

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:56.050
because she was ashamed,
which is okay.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.580
You know, she didn't want
her friends to see her,

00:32:58.580 --> 00:32:59.880
you know the kind of thing.

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.080
I understood that.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:07.390
In the meantime, I'm realizing
that my mom has this Alzheimer's

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.600
and when I first -- when she
was first diagnosed with it,

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.120 position:56%
I looked at the doctor and I said --

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:16.470
Okay, well, what is
it, minerals, vitamins?

00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:18.280
You know, what do we
have to do here?

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.070
-- I said -- Because
we're going to solve this.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:22.690
-- So, the doctor looked
at me and went.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:26.340
And he didn't say anything.

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:30.110
And I thought that was very rude.

00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:31.790
I'm like -- That's ugly.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:33.550
We're going to find another doctor.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.640
This doctor is not right.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:37.250
-- And another doctor.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:39.810
The doctor gave me
the same kind of look.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:43.830
But what they were saying to me is
that -- this chick is in denial.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:45.130
She's ignorant.

00:33:45.130 --> 00:33:46.430
She does not know what
this thing is.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.890
Alzheimer is a death sentence.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:53.600
-- I didn't understand that.

00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.250
I fought like you would never
believe, on the internet,

00:33:57.250 --> 00:34:00.170
finding ways, crying,
praying, going to everybody.

00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:01.900
There's got to be an
answer to this thing.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.260
It was driving me crazy.

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:08.820
It did that for about
three, four years.

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:16.420
In the meantime, as a care
giver, you have got to be careful

00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:22.040
because you could lose yourself,
my pressure went up, my weight went

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.610
out of control, you
know what I mean?

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:28.450
And I'm like -- I can't
be gaining weight,

00:34:28.450 --> 00:34:30.300
I'm an actress, what is this?

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.630
I'm getting weight, oh my God --
You know, I'm going through that

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:36.280
because my mom would
eat, forgets she ate

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.430
and would want me to
eat with her again.

00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:46.270
And I loved her so much
I ate with her again.

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.250
I mean, I was going through
it, you know when I realized

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.280
that I was really, really heavy?

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.400
Was when I went, I was
buying some clothes,

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:55.750
because for some reason my clothes
were getting tight, you know,

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:58.280
and so I had to get
some new clothes.

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.690
So, I went to Galls and Clothes
and I saw the size of the clothes

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:07.480
and I said -- Oh my God, this
doesn't even fit, you know what?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:14.380
They got European clothes
in here [laughter] I was

00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.130
in such a denial of everything.

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:21.120
You know, but I realized
it wasn't the clothes,

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.310
so the doctor told
me I had to calm it

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.280
down because the pressure
was high, it was the weight,

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.660
it was whole life thing so
I started looking like that.

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:32.530 position:56%
But still, my attention wasn't
quite on me, it was still on my mom.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:36.350
But what you do in a situation
like that, you start mourning,

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.360
you don't really you
are realize mourning.

00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.610
I'm mourning the loss of my mother.

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:46.720
I'm mourning the fact that
she was, she was a bookkeeper,

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:50.040
and she started to give her
money away to everybody.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.650
She would hide her money, I
would see in drawers 200 dollars,

00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:56.970
150 dollars -- I went --
Mom, what are you doing?

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.150 position:56%
Then I realized that's what they do.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:04.550
So, what came to me one day,
and this is very major to me,

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:11.260 position:56%
what came to me one day was the fact
that -- I'm going to go to the store

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:18.090 position:56%
and get it play money I'm going take
this chance, I went and I got a pack

00:36:18.090 --> 00:36:21.780
of play money, I took her
money out of the purse

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.890
and I put the play money in it;
and she opened up her purse,

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:27.690
and she said -- Oh, I got
my money, got my money.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:33.150
And I said -- Okay -- she took
the money out and was counting it.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:35.840
She saw the tens, the fives,
the 20s, and count the money.

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.140
She said -- okay.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.970 position:56%
-- She put it back in, she was fine.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:43.560
I went in that bathroom
and I cried like a baby

00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:50.430
that my mother no longer knew
the difference between real money

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:53.810
and play money, you know,
that's very devastating.

00:36:53.810 --> 00:36:58.130
These are the things
that I had to deal with.

00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:02.090
As a caregiver for a
person that has Alzheimer's.

00:37:02.090 --> 00:37:05.800
But I'm going to get to the
end of this now and I'm going

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:10.710
to let you know that the
disease is very devastating,

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.640
and it's very devastating
on the caregiver.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.510
And you have to come
to grips with the fact

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:19.180
that Alzheimer's is now
still a death sentence.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.810
There is no cure, they
can't fight for this.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:27.240
I'm here to fight because
they can't, they can't.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:32.370
And so, it went on where, you know,
at the end of the road she went

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:39.280
through all the stages and
at the end mommy was, mommy,

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:42.410
she got shingles because
she had the shingles,

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:44.560
you know, whatever that was.

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.400
So, I gave her the feeding tube,

00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.290
I let her have the feeding
tube, put the feeding tube in.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:53.450
And my mother was always at
home with me, and they asked me

00:37:53.450 --> 00:37:57.340
to put her in a facility because
she wasn't sick enough to be

00:37:57.340 --> 00:38:00.350
in the hospital and she wasn't
well enough to really come home

00:38:00.350 --> 00:38:02.180
because I didn't know how
to handle feeding tubes.

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.230
For two weeks, I put
her in this facility.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.530
I looked, and looked, and looked

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:08.760
and I found a very nice
facility, I thought.

00:38:08.760 --> 00:38:10.200
And I put her in it.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:13.930
And so, the second week I said --
Okay, well I'm here too, you know,

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:18.480
get all arranged so mom can come
back home and then looked at me

00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:23.460
and they said -- Your
mom can't come back home

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:29.760
because she caught the C. difficile
disease, that's the staff disease

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:35.470
that goes around in a nasty
facility because, I found out,

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:41.590
that it happens because the maids
of the aids that are taking care

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:46.740
of these people, want
to do it quick.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:51.370
And nobody can tell, the
person can't tell on them.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.320
So, what they do is they
get a little basin of water,

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.270 position:56%
they get a little towel and they you
go to each person bring that towel

00:38:58.270 --> 00:39:01.370
over them, and then
they'll wipe them.

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:04.610
That's done but the paper
on them, let them go,

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.940
next one, next one, next one.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:08.240
They don't use soap.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:16.910 position:56%
All it took was some soap, and the
staff disease would not have spread.

00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:18.490
That was very devastating to me.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.560
So, my mother was stuck
in there for a minute,

00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.860
I was trying to get her out.

00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.590
I got her into another facility.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:26.790
And, eventually, she
caught pneumonia, you know.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:28.520
And they had to take
her to the hospital.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:34.950
But I wanted to tell you
about the last night.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:40.400
The day before the last night,
I was literally losing my mind.

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.990
She's in the hospital, she
has tube down her throat,

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:45.630
things like that, she can't speak.

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:51.320
And so, I'm realizing this
is not good, you know,

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.040
I noticed that her food fell,
I noticed certain things

00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:00.040
but she was calm, she was there,
she was there, she's aware.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:03.290
And she would go in and out so, it
wasn't at the end of Alzheimer's.

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:05.200
So, she could still
communicate with me,

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.260
before Alzheimer's she
communicated with me.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.620
So, the day before they put the
tube down, she was in hospital,

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.280
the day before they
put the tube down.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:15.250
She said to me, when I went
to the hospital, and I said --

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.810
Oh, mommy, how are you doing, mom?

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.680
Everything is going to be okay.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.520
-- And she looked at me and she
said, just before I had to leave,

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:29.010
she said -- I want you to take care
of yourself because we all have

00:40:29.010 --> 00:40:31.960
to take care of ourselves now -- .

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:36.550 position:56%
I'm like -- why are you saying that?

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:38.880
-- But I knew why she
was saying that.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:42.880
So, the next day she had this
thing in her throat and everything.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.690
It lasted for about a month.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:48.200
Then the day before the last
night, I was going nuts.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.570
I was calling the doctors,
I was accusing them --

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:56.240
look, you're not do, give her some
yogurt, give her some antibiotics,

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:58.170
give her something,
give her probiotics,

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.470
that's what you ought
to do, you ought to do.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:04.250
-- I called those people every day,
every hour on hour and they said --

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:11.470
Look, your mom is very,
very ill -- I'm like, --

00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:17.920
that's why she's there you know,
fix her, get her right -- .

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:22.770
So, that night, I went to see her
and I told her the next morning

00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:26.360
that I had to do a speech for
the Alzheimer's Association

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:28.070
and I was going to speak about her.

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.400
It was about 11 o'clock,
and I said --

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:33.800
Okay mommy right after that
I'm going to come back here,

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.540
it would be about 10 o'clock,
I'll be back here, okay?

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:37.170
-- And she said -- Okay -- .

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:41.690
I kissed her and that was it.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.730
You know, I went home,
and that night,

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:49.570
about 2.30, my cell phone rang.

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:54.300
Now, I had my daughter,
she's like 16 now,

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.350
and me and my other
daughter was at her apartment

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.430
and my husband was in New York.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:02.200
So, it was just she and I.

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.130
I didn't go to bed,
we laid on the couch.

00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:06.690
She laid on one couch
so I laid on the couch.

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:08.100 position:56%
The phone rang and she looked at it.

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.370
Because I wasn't looking at it.

00:42:10.370 --> 00:42:11.670
She looked at it and she said --

00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:13.650
Mommy, that's the hospital
-- , you know.

00:42:13.650 --> 00:42:16.340
I said -- Yeah, yeah?

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:19.690
-- And I let it go to voice
mail I wouldn't pick it up.

00:42:19.690 --> 00:42:21.330
She said -- Mommy, you
got to call them back.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.450
You got to call them back.

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:24.970
-- I said -- okay.

00:42:24.970 --> 00:42:26.580
So, I called back, and they said --

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:29.450
your mother's vitals are
failing, please, come in now.

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:33.120
-- And I'm like, that moment,

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.230
everything changed,
everything changed.

00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:38.010
It was like, you don't
know at the moment

00:42:38.010 --> 00:42:42.220
of "this is it moment",
what you're going to do.

00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:48.070
I froze. I wouldn't
move, I couldn't move.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:49.370
I was like [breathing hard].

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:54.800 position:56%
And my little daughter said to me --
Mommy, come on, they must waiting,

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.790
you have to come, we have to come.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:58.850
Come on, mom.

00:42:58.850 --> 00:43:00.860
-- She said, -- come on
now, here's your blouse.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:02.490
-- I put my blouse on.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.090
She said, -- here are your pants.

00:43:04.090 --> 00:43:06.880
-- I put the pants on.

00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.680
She said, -- here's your hair.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:21.240
[ Laughter ]

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:24.950
What the hell.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:26.260
I'm glad she said that [laughter].

00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:32.290
The hour we woke up, I
wouldn't have the hair.

00:43:32.290 --> 00:43:36.470
So, I put my shoes on, she gave
me my purse, she gave me my keys

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:38.720
and I'm still looking at them like.

00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.210
And I got Alice say -- Mommy,
put it together because you have

00:43:41.210 --> 00:43:43.420
to drive, I can't drive, ma.

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:45.450
-- So, I said, -- Okay,
call your sister.

00:43:45.450 --> 00:43:46.750
-- So, she called.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.030
The hour, we all met
at the hospital.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.080
I made it to the hospital.

00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:54.880
When I got upstairs in the
room I'm like -- Oh, my God.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:56.400
What is this going to be like?

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.350
What am I going to do,
what am I going to say --

00:43:58.350 --> 00:44:03.190
And at that moment
God gave me grace.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:04.940
He gave me grace.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.400
He said to me, it was like He
just dropped something on my brain

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:15.670
and it went like this, He said
-- This is going to happen.

00:44:15.670 --> 00:44:18.180
It's not about you.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:20.600
So, make it good for her.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:24.650
-- I know exactly what that was.

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.870
So, when I walked in
there, mommy was at peace.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:30.700
It felt like the Holy Spirit
was, like, in the room.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:32.060
It felt so peaceful.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:34.990
And I walked in and I was okay.

00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:36.420
I said -- Okay, ma.

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.720
-- I said, -- Okay, mommy.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:40.240
I'm here. I said, -- me
and the girls are here.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.540
We're going to be with you.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:42.840
-- I said, -- Mommy,
I'm going to lay

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:46.200
down with you until
this happens -- .

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:48.740
I said -- I don't care
if takes a day, a week,

00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:51.100
a month -- , and I meant that.

00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.660
And I told them to move her
over so I could lay down.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.470
They looked at me like -- What?

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.340
She got tubes, you can't move her.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.870
-- I said -- Either you move
her or I'm going to move her.

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:05.470
Because I'm laying down
with my mother -- .

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:08.070
So, they moved her over, they
gave me a little blanket,

00:45:08.070 --> 00:45:09.800
they gave me a little
pillow, because ah --

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:12.630
they knew they couldn't
mess with me that night.

00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:15.730
So, they gave me a little
blanket, a little pillow and I laid

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:18.180
down with mommy, and I
put my foot over mommy

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.200
and I said -- Mommy, I'm here -- .

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.480
And I touched her hand, rubbed
her hand and everything.

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.720
And I wanted to put my hand on her
chest but she had the respirator,

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.330
I couldn't do that, you know,
thoughts, things like that.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:31.020
So I go I can't, can't do that.

00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:32.320
But I'm here, mommy.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.810
And it was so peaceful.

00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:38.560
My two daughters went into the
waiting room and went to sleep.

00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:43.640
And I lay there, and the clock is
right there, and I'm laying there,

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.900
you know, peaceful,
and I went to sleep.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:52.480
I went to sleep for two hours.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.980
And I couldn't believe I did that.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:59.390
And when I woke up, it was like
two hours later, and I was like.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:00.690
And I'm looking at my mom.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:03.800
Oh, God. And mommy
was still breathing.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:05.890
And she was still looking around.

00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:08.560
And I said, -- Oh God,
thank you -- .

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:10.680
And then the priest came in --

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.940
no, the pastor came
in to give her rights

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:18.090
and he said it was very peaceful
in here and that I was brave

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:20.630
and different things like that.

00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:23.240
And then, my daughters came
in, I had them come in.

00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:27.180
And my older daughter was looking
at my mother, she came around,

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:30.710
she was looking at her, and talking
to her, and touching her face

00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:34.540
and she said -- Mommy -- ,
she said -- Mama's eyes --

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.530
they call her mama -- Mama's
eyes don't look right.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:40.930
-- I said -- What do you mean?

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.230
What do you mean?

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:45.290
-- Don't look right, it's just
like she's looking through,

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:47.040
she's looking through, ma -- .

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:50.380
And I'm like, okay, we'll give
her, show her the picture of Jesus.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.910
So, she showed her
the picture of Jesus.

00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:56.140
She said, -- she's not, she's
not focused -- So, I said --

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:57.560
Well, show her a picture of Mary --

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:00.800
, so she showed her a picture
of Mary because she loved Mary.

00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.320
And she still was like, she said --

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.650
Mommy, she's looking like she's
looking right through these papers.

00:47:05.650 --> 00:47:08.770
-- So I said -- Okay,
I knew it was time.

00:47:08.770 --> 00:47:11.680
I went around and I looked at her.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.220
And I looked in her eyes.

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.960
And I realize my God, you know,
I'm looking in the eyes of death.

00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:21.270
Her eyes were yellow
and little tinny,

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.490
little red blood shots were coming.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.860
And I'm like, oh, God.

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.160
I said -- This is it.

00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:29.820
I got to, I got to start talking
to her, I got to tell her now.

00:47:29.820 --> 00:47:35.660
-- So I said -- Mommy, I want
you to know that we had fun.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:42.380
We had a good time, mommy, -- I
said -- I love you, I love you,

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:47.500
I love you, I love you --
I said it so many times.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.780
And I realize she can't
say I love you back.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.350
So, I said -- I know
you love me, mommy.

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:52.770
I know you love me.

00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:55.350
-- I said, -- But we had
fun, we had a good time

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:57.070
but it's not over yet -- .

00:47:57.070 --> 00:48:01.500
I don't know why I said that.

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:04.670
And she left.

00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:08.140
She left. I wouldn't say she died.

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:14.410
I would say she left
because it's a transition.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:20.930
And if you know, if you know the
Spirit of God, let me tell you,

00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:24.600
the body was no longer
any good to her.

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.640
But that woman still lives.

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.010
It's not over.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.310
And that's what I meant.

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.840
And then, of course, they took
me out, brought me in, you know,

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.550
they took me out, you know,
code blue, the whole thing,

00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:39.100
asked me what I, do I
want them bring her back?

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.400
You know, like they ask you.

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.200
And I said -- Yes,
bring my mother back.

00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.990
-- They brought her back
one time, she went again.

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:46.420
They said, -- If she
comes, she leaves again,

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.720
do you want to bring her back?

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:49.020
-- , -- Yes, bring her back -- .

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.900
By this time, my kids had called
my brother who was a pastor.

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:54.610
And he's listening to me
demanding that she comes back.

00:48:54.610 --> 00:48:59.120
And he says -- Bernadette, stop it.

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:01.520
Let her go.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.750
Let her go -- .

00:49:07.410 --> 00:49:10.770
So, I let her go.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:13.360
That was it.

00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:23.380 position:56%
And after that I realized that I had
to write a book, I had to write it

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.110
because I wanted the
world to know who she was,

00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:29.070 position:56%
as a special person, who my dad was.

00:49:29.070 --> 00:49:31.400
Everybody's parents are special.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:34.900
But they are my only two parents.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.200
So, I had to write it.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.620
And I shared a lot of
things in that book.

00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:43.620
It took me five years to
write it, because I would get

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:47.660
to certain points and I had to
let go, I couldn't go any further.

00:49:47.660 --> 00:49:52.290
But I knew I had to write this
book because there's so many people

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:55.210
that are not talking about
Alzheimer's, they're not talking

00:49:55.210 --> 00:50:00.010
about care giving, they're
suffering in silence, like I was.

00:50:00.010 --> 00:50:01.310
I was suffering.

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:02.610
And I wouldn't share a lot,
you know, because, you know,

00:50:02.610 --> 00:50:03.910
you think people want
to know, you know.

00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:05.210
And I feel like there are a lot
of people out there that are going

00:50:05.210 --> 00:50:06.510
through and will go
through what I went through.

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:07.810
And I only wished that I had that
book when I was going through it

00:50:07.810 --> 00:50:09.110
because I wrote it like a
companion book, like a friend.

00:50:09.110 --> 00:50:10.410
Because I could read about
the steps of Alzheimer's,

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:11.710
I could read about this and read
about that but nobody would talk

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:13.010
about the pain or the
compassion or the fact

00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:14.310
that you're mourning your loved
one, as you're taking care of them.

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:15.610
And you could be losing yourself.

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:16.910
A lot of care givers die before
the person they're caring for.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:18.210
You know, I was on my way because
I was, I had forgotten about me.

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:19.510
So, I'm just sharing these things
with you because it's very real

00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:20.810
and one day, we all may be there.

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.110
So, that's why I wrote The Last
Night because it was the last night

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:23.410
that showed me the power of
God and how He can heal us,

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:24.710
and He can make it okay, He can
make you understand, you know,

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:26.010
when you have to understand.

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:28.310 position:56%
So, I thank you for listening to me.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.520
&gt;&gt; Any questions?

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:45.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I have comments and
a testimony [inaudible] So,

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:46.830
I [inaudible] what you said

00:50:46.830 --> 00:50:52.080
about understanding your
relation with elders.

00:50:52.080 --> 00:50:53.960
My grandmother used to [inaudible].

00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:58.090
Walk by the town and
you'll get, you know, free.

00:50:58.090 --> 00:51:02.810
Lie down and [inaudible]
wake up with flees.

00:51:02.810 --> 00:51:06.030
When many times [inaudible]
flies out the window [inaudible].

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:16.460
Hi, grandma, just, just shut
it, you know, and then I got 15

00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:21.600
when my [inaudible]
wouldn't get through.

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:35.180
&gt;&gt; But you were listening,
see, was in your head.

00:51:37.650 --> 00:51:47.030
&gt;&gt; You know, my grandma was
so wise and then suddenly,

00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:56.340 position:56%
what I want to say is I went through
a similar experience with my aunt

00:51:56.340 --> 00:52:03.940
because she was my
aunt, not my mother.

00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:05.240
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:08.100
&gt;&gt; So, she would slide
into dementia, and I,

00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:20.740
at first I was embarrassed, because
I was like, why is she acting

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:25.860
like that and then I realized,
oh, oh, this is serious.

00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:29.280
My aunt got on a plane by
herself to Paris where I was

00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:35.410
and called the hotel phone office
and you have to take this lady

00:52:35.410 --> 00:52:39.860
out of here, she's, you know,
incontinent all over the place,

00:52:39.860 --> 00:52:47.180
and you know, I'm still trying
to get my aunt dignity but I end

00:52:47.180 --> 00:52:54.260
up spending the rest of my
trip to Paris babysitting.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:53:03.630
And I was very resentful, why do
I have to take care of this woman?

00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:08.010
You know, my parent,
my father's sibling,

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:12.360
why do I have to take
care of my aunt.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.660
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:17.330
&gt;&gt; And being the only person who
lived and watched this situation

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.780
with her, just like she kept all
day long, and people call me up,

00:53:19.780 --> 00:53:22.790
your aunt's wandering
on the street, you know,

00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:26.540
she's like her credit cards are
falling out of her purse and stuff.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:30.560
And it was just the
worst thing ever.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:34.250
And, I went to go see Dream
Girls of these images theater

00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:37.300
and I got a call before I
went in, it was somebody

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:41.070
with my aunt's cell phone,
of course, found it there.

00:53:41.070 --> 00:53:42.370
I had my dad to find her.

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:47.240
And it stayed with me years
to come to terms with my aunt.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:50.430
But she was nice, she was nice
till the end [inaudible] fell.

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:53.750
But I had a responsibility
toward her, and I just got

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:56.600
out a horrible thing where
some people were trying to,

00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:00.690
they try to take advantage of
her for her money for years.

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:04.860
And, we had some crooks
doing, infiltrating themselves

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:10.260
into her will etcetera, and I would
say it passed years of they going

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.790
to court, you know, fighting for
my aunt, she lost her sister,

00:54:13.790 --> 00:54:15.530
her older sisters for money.

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:17.490
Her older sister died
April 29 [inaudible].

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:20.850
&gt;&gt; That's so sad.

00:54:20.850 --> 00:54:24.460
&gt;&gt; Over $700,000 [inaudible].

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:25.760
&gt;&gt; That's so sad.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:28.230
&gt;&gt; It was, but you
know, I feel like now

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:30.360
that my aunt's spirit is at rest.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.010
My [inaudible] wasn't
because she was so attached

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.790
to her things, and her money.

00:54:36.790 --> 00:54:39.490
And, now, he finally got
some kind of resolution

00:54:39.490 --> 00:54:43.390
but still very hard to,
first of all, [inaudible].

00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:46.180
It took everything out of
me, taking care of my aunt,

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:49.440
getting calls at work, your
aunt is, you know what --

00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.820
&gt;&gt; But you did it.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:52.120
&gt;&gt; Caring.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.420
&gt;&gt; But you I did it.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.720
&gt;&gt; I did.

00:54:54.720 --> 00:54:56.830
&gt;&gt; I know, I know it's
hard but sometimes we are,

00:54:56.830 --> 00:55:00.930
I'd say blessed with
the responsibility.

00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:04.100
And we learn a lot in the process.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:07.690
And you never know why we
need to know that knowledge,

00:55:07.690 --> 00:55:12.370
and it's okay to be resentful,
it's okay to feel bad,

00:55:12.370 --> 00:55:14.590
it's okay to say, "Why me?"

00:55:14.590 --> 00:55:17.170
Because those are the
things we felt through.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:18.470
It happens.

00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:23.680
Why? You know, I still question
why in certain ways, but, you know,

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.690
if you have faith and you
believe that everything happens

00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:34.090 position:56%
for a reason, you will get over that
in time and you will not feel guilty

00:55:34.090 --> 00:55:37.080
or bad or anything,
because it's human.

00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.380
It's very human.

00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:39.870
I went through the
same thing at first.

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:43.290
I would say -- God,
come on, why my mom?

00:55:43.290 --> 00:55:44.590
-- You know, -- why?

00:55:44.590 --> 00:55:45.890
-- You know.

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:48.490
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] says that when she
was the first [inaudible] and chief

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:51.890
of the nurses and staff of NIH
of veterans administration.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:53.190
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:55:53.190 --> 00:55:54.610
&gt;&gt; I saw her reduced to

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:55.910
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:57.250
That's right.

00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:58.550
That's right.

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:02.800
And that's a very horrible place
but that's what this disease does.

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:08.090
And we need to know why it happens,
and what we can do to prevent it

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:10.520
from happening to us,
especially to me

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:13.430 position:56%
as they say that it's in the family.

00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:15.240
You know, I feel it's
not in the family,

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:18.440
it's in the habits,
it's in the habits.

00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:23.060 position:56%
The things that we do that our
parent did, my mother was a warrior,

00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:27.270
she worried about everybody and
so, you know, maybe the stress

00:56:27.270 --> 00:56:31.600
of it all did too, my father
was murdered when she was 59.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:34.640
And I think that it
threw her into it.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:37.720
She went straight into
Parkinson's in that ten year span.

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.560
By the time she was 72
she was into Alzheimer's.

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:45.620
So, yeah, yeah, it's
rough, it's rough.

00:56:45.620 --> 00:56:46.970
&gt;&gt; Do you have a question?

00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:52.810
&gt;&gt; I don't have a question but I
want to see if the last ten years

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:58.370
into [inaudible] she can walk with
some restrain, maybe, you know,

00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:59.670
[inaudible] this is the whole.

00:56:59.670 --> 00:57:01.240
&gt;&gt; The whole mess.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.790
&gt;&gt; But the road is so
painful [inaudible].

00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:06.090
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:08.820
And the questions that we may
have, you ask the Lord to show you,

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:13.220
reveal it, reveal why this is
happening, reveal why it happens

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:17.100
to me, why I got it, you know,
I mean, we have siblings,

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:23.440
that they say, you
got her [laughter].

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.440
I got my mama.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:29.070
You know, and sometimes they
say, I would [inaudible] say --

00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:33.020
Well, you know, why don't you just
call, you know, a lot, you know,

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.240
send a little card, you know -- .

00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:37.590
But she can't remember anyway.

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:40.220
That's not the point, the
point is -- you are the child,

00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:46.190
you are the grandchild, you
remember her though -- .

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:47.490
Yes.

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:53.770
&gt;&gt; I think it's another thing
with your parents [inaudible].

00:57:53.770 --> 00:57:57.090
He said, [inaudible]
and I couldn't figure

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:02.530
out [inaudible] times why she
was a changed person because,

00:58:02.530 --> 00:58:12.510
and I kept [inaudible] to my arms.

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:17.420
Why it happened, why
[inaudible] this and that.

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:22.400
And [inaudible] you
just have to learn.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.140
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:33.120
&gt;&gt; This is your [inaudible] and
certain things you don't know

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:36.750
about just as you [inaudible].

00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:38.050
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.590
&gt;&gt; But it happen [inaudible]
into her mother

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:42.700
&gt;&gt; So, it's just, but
you see you have

00:58:42.700 --> 00:58:47.760
to understand what
the disease does, see.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:51.170
When, first of all,
they have no filter.

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:54.450
They lose the filter,
they lose the filter

00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:56.820
and they say horrible
things sometimes.

00:58:56.820 --> 00:59:00.870
They say embarrassing things to
you sometimes, but you have to look

00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:04.080
at it and say -- Hum
maybe I am a little fat,

00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:09.070 position:56%
maybe I will to lose a little weight
-- [laughter] You know, but, yeah,

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:13.430
may not like that but it's
a little true, you know.

00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:17.220
There is no filter but then you say
this, you say -- It's not my mama.

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:21.390 position:56%
My mama would never say that to me
-- , you know, -- Mama wouldn't -- .

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:23.830
She would just say -- Bern, you
know there's a little weight

00:59:23.830 --> 00:59:25.130
over there -- Nice.

00:59:25.130 --> 00:59:27.530
But my mother said
it and I'm like, uhm,

00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:31.230
but it's the disease that's
saying it, not your mommy.

00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:32.530
Not your mother.

00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:34.860
And there are different
ways they act.

00:59:34.860 --> 00:59:39.610 position:56%
Like, if they get the disease that's
affecting the back of the brain,

00:59:39.610 --> 00:59:41.150
it goes to different places.

00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:44.020
And in the back of the brain,
they're usually peaceful;

00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:47.060
my mother was very peaceful
anyway, so it was very peaceful,

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:50.130
she was very peaceful, very
agreeable, listen, wonderful.

00:59:50.130 --> 00:59:53.550
Then, you can get it
in the frontal lobe

00:59:53.550 --> 00:59:59.040
which makes you very aggressive,
very mean, and very nasty.

00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:02.580
But it's not them, it's the part
of the brain that's, you know,

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.770
and they get very aggressive.

01:00:04.770 --> 01:00:07.900
So, understand what
you're dealing with.

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.450
It's not -- Oh, she's
nasty, she's mean -- .

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:12.030
You know, you might be
a little nasty and mean

01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:14.890
but you know, it gets worse.

01:00:14.890 --> 01:00:17.420
But understand what that is.

01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:20.890
It's a lot of understanding
in this thing.

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:34.400
&gt;&gt; Next question.

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.700
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible].

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:41.780
It certainly was my uncle,
[inaudible] through the years,

01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:44.350
[inaudible] following years.

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:49.660
He was a very peaceful,
[inaudible] friend.

01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:53.590 position:56%
[Inaudible] And later on, he started
to [inaudible] and [inaudible].

01:00:53.590 --> 01:01:04.240
But he would tell us it must have
happened that he was younger.

01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:07.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do, they go back
to young, their young life.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.880
My mother stopped at 14.

01:01:11.010 --> 01:01:15.650 position:56%
And that was her best time, and
there was a buddy Willis [phonetic],

01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:20.600
buddy Willis, she was like
buddy Willis, in high school.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:23.910
So, every time I wanted to make
her smile and make her happy,

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:27.150
I would say -- Mommy, come on,
let's talk about buddy Willies -- .

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:30.140
And she just smiled, and she
talked about high school and talk

01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.630 position:56%
about her friends then, it was then.

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:35.670
So, you know, she knew I was her
daughter, she knew I was close

01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:40.190
because she loved me, she knew the
connection but I became her mom.

01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:43.370
She called me mom.

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:47.410
Yeah, I became her mom, and
she was my baby some days.

01:01:47.410 --> 01:01:49.730
And she mentioned to
my husband one time --

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:51.210
No, you know I have a husband -- .

01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.510
[Laughter].

01:01:52.510 --> 01:02:02.050
She says I know mom, I know you got
a husband, where's your husband.

01:02:02.050 --> 01:02:10.420
But you see, I don't think she
remembered he died, you know

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:13.690
but she knows, she had a husband.

01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:16.370
So, it's funny, you know,
they go through stuff.

01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:18.670
And you just have to
love them through it.

01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:21.180
And agree, agree, agree.

01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:25.370
I mean, sometimes, it's like,
she would go, the babies are big

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:26.670
in their life, you know,

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.660
they hallucinate a
little bit and see babies.

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:32.330
My mother saw babies and she
would say -- Okay, now, you know,

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:34.880 position:56%
watch the baby over there, watch the
baby over there, and I'm like, --

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.620
Mommy -- at first I went like Mom
-- there's no babies over there.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.530
And then I realized it
-- Okay, we'll watch it.

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:45.000
Okay, so tell me exactly where that
baby is so I won't step on one --

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.890
she said -- okay, it's
right there -- .

01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:49.470
Now, I'd walk around
the imaginary baby.

01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:55.310
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] can
hear them [inaudible].

01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:57.110
&gt;&gt; He did.

01:02:57.110 --> 01:02:58.410
&gt;&gt; Towards the end.

01:02:58.410 --> 01:03:03.180
&gt;&gt; Toward the end.

01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:09.610
&gt;&gt; Spoke very, very nasty
things, you know, it was

01:03:09.610 --> 01:03:10.910
&gt;&gt; Hurtful.

01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:15.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It was really hurtful but
[inaudible] unless he was like that,

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.310
he would [inaudible] to us.

01:03:17.310 --> 01:03:20.250
&gt;&gt; Well, it's not that
they're like that before.

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.400
It's like they know
something is wrong with them

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.990
and they can't get it out.

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:26.960
They know something it's not right,

01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:29.670
they don't have the
language anymore, you know.

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:32.380
Some people treat them differently.

01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:36.050
It becomes like, you know,
a baby senses things.

01:03:36.050 --> 01:03:38.630
So, they can be around a
person and get very violent,

01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:40.650
and very nasty and very stubborn.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:43.350
But the person, you got to know
what that person is saying to them.

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:45.790 position:56%
Or how that person is treating them.

01:03:45.790 --> 01:03:48.300
You see, but if it's a loving,
loving, loving relationship,

01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.820
a lot of times they
don't do that like that.

01:03:50.820 --> 01:03:52.940
Because people think -- Well,
they're not going to remember

01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:54.820
that I disgusted out,
or I kicked them,

01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:56.760
or I pushed them to
the side -- Serious.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.660
And they know -- you
just kicked me --

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:02.940
, but I think they can't
say it, so they get violent.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:04.240
Right

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:05.540
&gt;&gt; You have to really
[inaudible] careful.

01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:06.840
&gt;&gt; You do.

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:09.970
&gt;&gt; And, you know, not do the
triggers that make them angry.

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:11.270
&gt;&gt; Right.

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:17.500
&gt;&gt; Because my aunt, would be like,
if you told my aunt, you know,

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.800
she had a [inaudible] or a cocktail

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:20.680
and so you say [inaudible]
you need that cocktail.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.980
-- What are you telling -- ?

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.280
&gt;&gt; That right, I'm wrong.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:28.190
[Inaudible] telling me I can't have
my cocktail [laughter] and see,

01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:29.900
what she, she meant that.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.430
A cocktail.

01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:34.650
But she's a grown woman
and she wants her cocktail.

01:04:34.650 --> 01:04:38.030
&gt;&gt; I knew it myself she requested
that she may [inaudible].

01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:39.330
&gt;&gt; That's right.

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:40.630
Did you give her the cocktail?

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:41.930
&gt;&gt; Well, what would I do

01:04:41.930 --> 01:04:45.280
if she [inaudible] then she
walked away, and I drank it.

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.070
&gt;&gt; And she didn't know
she didn't drink it?

01:04:47.070 --> 01:04:48.370
&gt;&gt; Maybe she did.

01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:49.670
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, that's how
you have to do, you know.

01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:56.200
&gt;&gt; [Laughter] well,
it didn't go to waste.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:59.250
All right.

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:00.550
&gt;&gt; Miss Bernadette.

01:05:00.550 --> 01:05:01.850
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:05:01.850 --> 01:05:03.920
&gt;&gt; I wanted to make sure
I see you and let you know

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.730
that God makes no mistakes
and you being here

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:11.380
with us today is blessing
each and every one

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:13.460
of us who were able to come.

01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:16.250
I appreciate this intimate talk.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:24.110
And also, I appreciate your talent
and gift as an actress and a writer

01:05:24.110 --> 01:05:26.250
because growing up with
the show Good Times,

01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:29.050
that was our leave it or be.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:32.880
[Laughter].

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:39.580
&gt;&gt; And the content of that
show touched many hearts

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:44.230
with the reality, the
harsh realities of life.

01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.530
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

01:05:45.530 --> 01:05:50.250
&gt;&gt; But the one thing I
can say is to memories,

01:05:50.250 --> 01:05:52.290
you can always remember
the Good Times.

01:05:52.290 --> 01:05:54.490
&gt;&gt; That's right.

01:05:54.490 --> 01:05:59.100
Thank you so much.

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.770
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
