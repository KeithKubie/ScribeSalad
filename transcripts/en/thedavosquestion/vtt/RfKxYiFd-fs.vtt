&gt;&gt;Hello YouTube I'm Rick Aubry. I run a social
enterprise in the United States called Rubicon

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.790
Programs. I teach social entrepreneurship
at the Stanford Patrick School of Business.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.220
I'm here at Davos trying to figure out whether
the environment is going to lose out to the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.859
economy in 2009 in the midst of this whole
global crisis. Just stepped out of a session

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.160
with Al Gore where he's of course making the
very important comment that the economy and

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.160
the environment are bound together,and that
if we are wise and smart it's not a choice

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.990
that has to be made but the two are together.
I'm certainly hopeful myself. One of the things

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.659
that we do at our social enterprise is create
big new businesses that will have huge impacts

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:51.010
in the United States, and we're doing one
in waste management arena, in the recyling

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.470
of mattresses,and we think that significant
investments may in fact flow so that rather

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.500
than landfills getting filled up with such
things mattresses and carpets actually businesses

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.260
can get created for homeless men and women,people
who been out of prisons,and other people who

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.510
are marginal in the economy. Can in fact get
jobs created through environmental innovations

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.270
and through environmental investments in 2009.
So I'm hopeful it's not a choice that needs

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.430
to be made. Thank you very much.
