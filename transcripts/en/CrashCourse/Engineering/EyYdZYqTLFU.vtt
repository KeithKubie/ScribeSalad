00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
The human body is a complex place, and our
immune systems are powerful allies.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.360
If you get sick, doctors can often rely on
strengthening what’s already inside you.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.880
But sometimes you need an assist: technology
that can be put inside the body.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.920
Things like biodevices.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:25.140
[Theme Music]

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.720
We’ve all seen a TV show where someone 
has a heart attack, only to be revived with a
quick shock to the chest.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.820
Defibrillators are powerful tools, but by
the time a patient needs one, they’re already
in a life-or-death situation.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.060
What if it never had to get to that point?

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.880
What if there was a way to catch the problem as it
started and act more quickly than any human could?

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.240
This isn’t science fiction:

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:53.040
millions are walking around right now with exactly
that inside their chest, an incredible tool called the
implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, or ICD.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:01.000
It continuously monitors a person’s heartbeat and
delivers an electrical pulse to restore a normal rhythm
whenever it detects a problem is about to occur.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.740
That’s something a drug, no matter how
sophisticated, could never do.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.710
That’s where medical devices, or biodevices,
come in.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.400
They serve many roles, from rebuilding lost
bodily functions, to managing diseases and
helping you live longer.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.060
It’s a broad category, but some of the most
important are implantable biodevices, like
ICDs and cochlear implants.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.580
A biodevice is implantable if all or part
of it is put inside the body for an extended
period of time.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.340
They might not be easy to spot, but they’re
already in widespread use today.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.750
Around 8% of Americans and 5% of people in developed
countries have used an implantable biodevice of some
sort – that’s millions and millions of people!

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:42.060
Before they could become so common, engineers
had to overcome numerous challenges.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.500
The body’s a complex place, so many biodevices
are, too.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.960
They have to coexist with changing temperatures,
electrical signals, and chemical reactions in a way that
doesn’t disrupt our body’s carefully-balanced systems.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.100
So to design a good biodevice, you need to
acquaint yourself with not only the environment
of the human body,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.660
but also its functionality, structure, and
ongoing processes.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.980
The design process for these devices is similar
to anything else you might make as an engineer.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:11.260
You need a design that doesn’t just work,
but one that can be manufactured in a safe
and cost-effective way.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.420
But the tolerances can be tiny: a needle that’s a
hair too short might not reach where it needs to go.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.220
A joint that’s too large could cause a lifetime
of pain.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.240
There are a few things you’ll need to pay
special attention to, the first being biocompatibility.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:31.280
We’ve already talked about biocompatibility in
a previous episode – it’s the idea that not every
material is at home in a living thing.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:39.760
Not only do you need to use biomaterials, it’s important
to sterilize anything going into the body and you need to
account for the stresses that process demands.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.040
One technique recommended by the CDC is
dry heat sterilization, which bakes the device
at a high heat using moisture-free air.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:56.550
Baking the device at 160°C for around 2 hours
should do the trick, or you can go to 170°C for
about an hour if you want to speed things up.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.200
If your biomaterial can’t survive that kind of heat,
you’ll need to find a different way to get it clean.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:09.040
Many biodevices contain tiny computers, so you’ll
need to include a battery to keep it running and maybe
some wifi to communicate with the outside world.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.620
Engineers call these things power and connectivity.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.060
You don’t want your patients to have to
lug around big battery packs or always need
to be hooked up to a cord in the wall.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.400
If you don’t think about power and connectivity
during the design process,

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.110
it can lead to a device that’s too impractical,
one that doesn’t work, or one that stops working
soon after you implant it.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.900
A great example of this was the first successfully
implanted electronic pacemaker back in 1958.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:40.260
Pacemakers use electrical pulses to help the heart
beat more regularly, so it was a big step forward for
patients with abnormal heart rhythms.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.200
However, as revolutionary as this was, the
first implanted device failed after only three hours,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.200
in part because of electronics that were too
bulky and batteries with short, unreliable lives.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.840
Until the advent of more reliable lithium batteries
in the 1970s, failures like this were inherent in the
design of implantable biodevices.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.640
Not to mention that all that water in the
body is pretty bad for electronics, so you
need appropriate packaging, too.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.140
The device should be airtight and watertight
– what engineers call hermetically sealed.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:16.880
You might be tempted to encase everything in a
metal like titanium, but metal packages don’t just
keep out air and water: they also block radio waves.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.540
If your metal device needs to communicate with
the outside world, it will need an external antenna,
which makes everything more complicated.

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.040
A better bet might be to use a ceramic or
glass enclosure like you’d find in a smartphone.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.020
Wireless connectivity helps not only with
device diagnostics, but also with a patient’s
peace of mind.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.900
People want to know their implant is working properly
and it’s far more accessible to have stats on a device
that patients can take with them,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.880
rather than something that can only be
downloaded by the doctor.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.980
Dropping an external antenna also helps
make the overall structural design of the
system smaller and less invasive.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.000
Remember, at the end of the day, whatever
you design is gonna be placed inside a person.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.320
The same goes for your delivery system, or
any medical procedure that you need to do
to implant the device.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.420
Patients are more likely to recover quickly if you
use the least invasive approach practical.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:09.940
If you can build your device small enough using tools
like nanotechnology, in the future doctors may be able
to deliver it through a simple injection.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:17.760
Larger implants might be deliverable through
a tiny slit using laparoscopic surgery, which often
enables patients to go home the same day.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.060
If your device is too big to go in through a
small hole, you might run into another problem:
finding enough space inside the body.

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.040
If a spot isn’t big enough to fit the whole
thing, or it’s simply better for different parts
of the device to be in different places,

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.380
you can design it so that it’s separated
into multiple components.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.400
Take a cochlear implant, for example.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:43.360
These devices – which can help provide a sense of
sound to people who are profoundly deaf or severely
hard-of-hearing – are often made up of two main parts:

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.200
an external portion that fits behind the ear
and one that is surgically placed under the skin.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:55.860
Even if space wasn’t an issue, it’s much better for
something like a microphone to be on the outside so
that it can more easily pick up sounds from the environment.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.839
Another option might be to remove part of
an organ to make room for your device.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.500
Hip replacements, for instance, replace the
damaged parts of the joint with titanium.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.880
Once you take all of this into account – from
biocompatibility to delivery systems –

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.620
you still need to consider device management
and diagnostics from the day you deliver it, to
the second it’s removed from the patient.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.820
Basically, you want to keep an eye on your
device to make sure it’s working correctly.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.940
This can be rudimentary, like having a patient
come into the office to physically get their
implant checked out,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.100
to more modern options, like giving a doctor
the ability to remotely diagnose any issues.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.420
But what if you didn’t need an external
device at all?

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.419
That’s the promise of smart tattoos!

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:39.860
Researchers are learning how to put flexible
electronic sensors into temporary tattoos that would be
able to withstand all the twists and bends of daily life.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.480
These sensors – which are thinner than
the hairs on your head –

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.580
could monitor the electrical signals
produced by the body, allowing a patient
to monitor heart conditions.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.119
Or, for those with diabetes, the tattoos could
measure blood glucose levels in real time.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.440
The results could appear as a changing color,
right there on the skin!

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.400
Tiny tech like this is just the beginning.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.180
Devices that use Micro-Electro-Mechanical
Systems, or MEMS, are the future for active
implantable drug delivery systems.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.300
MEMS enable delivery systems on the micrometer
scale, which doesn’t just make things more compact,

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.000
but also allows them to accomplish tasks that
wouldn’t be possible at the macroscopic level.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.780
You’ve probably had your blood pressure
checked by one of those inflatable cuffs that
they put around your arm.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:25.800
That may work for a simple checkup, but measuring
someone’s blood pressure in that way isn’t always that
easy, especially for people in intensive care.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.220
That’s where MEMS come in!

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.260
A new MEMS sensor can monitor blood
pressure directly through the IV line,

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:36.160
enabling continuous measurement and removing
the need for daily calibration and sterilization.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.289
And soon, with MEMS, the idea of tiny robots
inside your body could escape science fiction
and make its way into real life!

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:49.400
One day, they might not only deliver drugs,
but help repair DNA and even restore sight
to the blind.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:56.140
Once you’ve solved all the problems of getting a
biodevice working well inside someone, there’s just
one issue left: how do you get it out?

00:07:56.140 --> 00:08:02.580
Some patients might need the device for the
rest of their lives, but for everyone else, it’s usually
a surgical procedure to take it out.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.599
Well, it’s a surgical procedure for now.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:12.340
Researchers are focused on developing metallic
materials made from elements like magnesium,
zinc, and iron that are also biodegradable.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:16.860
These materials could be invaluable in the
electronics of a temporary biodevice.

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:23.180
They’d have the same properties of the devices
made today, but once their job is done, they would
just disappear into the body.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.540
With applications like these, the potential
for biodevices is nearly unlimited.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:32.980
But it’s gonna take the work of dedicated
engineers to continue to bring those ideas to life.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:37.240
So today we talked about biodevices and the
part they play in the healthcare world.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.480
We focused on implantable biodevices and all
of the challenges that they face,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:48.990
including biocompatibility, power and connectivity,
packaging, structural design, delivery systems,
and device management.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:55.480
Finally, we saw some of the latest research,
like smart tattoos, and just what the future
of biodevices might hold.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.600
I’ll see you next time, when we’ll talk
about genetic engineering.
