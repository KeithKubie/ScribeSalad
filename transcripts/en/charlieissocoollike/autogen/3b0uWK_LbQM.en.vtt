or guess what today Pluto is going to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350
or guess what today Pluto is going to

called a planet and not want to go

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
called a planet and not want to go
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270

against science but I am going to try

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280
against science but I am going to try
 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.830

belt just beyond Mars so for all of

these a new category was created the

these a new category was created the
 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.140
these a new category was created the
dwarf planets so no Pluto wasn't demoted

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
dwarf planets so no Pluto wasn't demoted
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.940
dwarf planets so no Pluto wasn't demoted

just because it's small although if it
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.590
just because it's small although if it
was a bit bigger than maybe it would
