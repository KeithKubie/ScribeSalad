00:00:01.134 --> 00:00:02.568
Do you want sound legal advice

00:00:02.601 --> 00:00:03.970
but aren't near a billboard?

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.105
Well, there's only one place
to turn:

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:09.442
Fox News' Justice
 with Judge Jeanine.

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:12.111
Now, this show is hosted
by Jeanine Pirro,

00:00:12.144 --> 00:00:14.047
a former prosecutor, judge,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.050
and the last person you want
to spill red wine on.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:20.053 line:0%
No namby-pamby, bleeding heart,

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:23.256 line:0%
left-wing, socialist,
political whore.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.059
And it's possible
martians were in that room

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.394
peeing on the prostitutes, too.

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:30.329
You lost, he won.

00:00:30.362 --> 00:00:31.998
Karma's a bitch.

00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:33.266
Sorry, Ma.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.601
Whoo-wee!

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.270
I'll tell you, Judge Jeanine.

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:41.207
Like they say,
a little goes all the way.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.010
Her show is 60 minutes
of legal wisdom

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:46.612
smothered in a generous layer
of rage.

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.014
It's can't-miss.

00:00:48.047 --> 00:00:49.949
But sometimes I miss it.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:51.350
It airs on Saturdays,

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:53.352
which is when
my one-man neighborhood watch

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.488
goes on patrol.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:58.825
I started it after the regular
neighborhood watch kicked me out

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:02.161
over the shark blood incident.
(chuckles)

00:01:02.194 --> 00:01:03.629
Bunch of pussies.

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:07.100
Now, luckily, we have
citizen lawyer Laura Grey

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.969
to keep us updated
on all things Jeanine.

00:01:10.002 --> 00:01:12.839
-Laura Grey, everybody. -Thank
you. -(cheering and applause)

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:15.341 line:0%
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Jordan.

00:01:15.374 --> 00:01:18.211 line:0%
Judge Jeanine
is an American institution.

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.813 line:0%
She's like baseball,
if the entire game

00:01:20.846 --> 00:01:24.150 line:0%
was just screaming at the umpire
to arrest Hillary Clinton.

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:28.121
This week, she went all in
on former FBI director,

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:31.090
James Comey,
and his soft-core fantasy novel

00:01:31.123 --> 00:01:32.625
about Donald Trump.

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:33.826
Listen to this heat.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:36.162
Jim, it's so obvious.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.297
You're fired, and you're mad.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.633
You're a liar,
and you're a leaker.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.301
You're pompous.
You're egotistical.

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:43.703
You're condescending.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.038
You're cocky.
You're awkwardly tall.

00:01:46.071 --> 00:01:47.573
You're a bad tipper.

00:01:47.606 --> 00:01:49.442
You think The Wire season five

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.244
was better than season four.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:53.579
You're a monster, James Comey!

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:55.181
And Judge Jeanine gets that.

00:01:55.214 --> 00:01:59.152
Yes! Yes! Now that's, that's the
sound of reasonable discourse

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.887
turned all the way up to 12.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.623
Oh, yeah.
It's the future of news, Jordan.

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:05.424
And it makes me feel powerful,

00:02:05.457 --> 00:02:07.293
like when I go
to the mall food court

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:09.662
to watch teenage couples fight.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.133
Now, Judge Jeanine
is an intellectual bulldog.

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:16.669
She bites down on an idea
and doesn't let go

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:18.404
until she's shot
with a blow dart.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:20.072
Which, coincidentally,

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:23.609
is how her producer ends
her show every week.

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:27.213
But that doesn't mean
she's not sophisticated.

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:30.950
See if you can pick up
on some of the elevated language

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:32.485
she used this weekend.

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:36.355
Jim, you hoisted yourself
on your own petard.

00:02:36.388 --> 00:02:39.358
Don't you love it
when arrogant egomaniacs

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:42.228
are hoisted
on their own petards?

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:46.199
FBI Director James Comey and
Deputy Director Andrew McCabe

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:49.835
now know the pain
of those petards.

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.505
(laughter)

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.241
Did you catch it?

00:02:55.274 --> 00:02:57.176
Petard.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.111
Now, I know
what you're all thinking:

00:02:59.144 --> 00:03:01.380
"I know
exactly what 'petard' means."

00:03:01.413 --> 00:03:05.184
Me, too. It's a French grenade
from the 16th century--

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:08.454
you know, back when
the French military "did stuff."

00:03:08.487 --> 00:03:10.189
What she means here

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:13.326
is that Comey is accidentally
undermining himself,

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.595
getting blown apart
by his own bomb,

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.263
something Jeanine would never do

00:03:17.296 --> 00:03:19.398
because she's too busy going
for the jugular--

00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:21.934
or, as I call them, neck balls.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:25.071
Jim, you've done more damage
to the FBI as an institution

00:03:25.104 --> 00:03:26.472
than J. Edgar Hoover.

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:28.975
The only difference
between you and J. Edgar

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:30.576
is that he wore dresses.

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:32.511
And even if you wanted to,

00:03:32.544 --> 00:03:35.014
you probably couldn't get one
to fit you

00:03:35.047 --> 00:03:37.316
at six feet, eight inches.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.252
Yeah! Good luck shopping

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.187
at Talbots petites,
you too-tall weirdo!

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.989
(laughter)

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.523
Judge Jeanine is a fighter.

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:46.592
She knows
you sting like a butterfly,

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.661
and also, sting like a bee.

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:50.529
And she's been covering Comey
for years

00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:52.565
with total consistency.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.467
Like, here's how she talked

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:58.237
about Lying, Leaking, Crusty
Comey back in December 2015.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.506
There is a hero in Washington.

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.642
His name: Jim Comey.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.543
He is not only brilliant.

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:06.512
He is honest, hard-working,

00:04:06.545 --> 00:04:09.548
and he comes from a long line
of law enforcement.

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:13.519
Politics plays no role
in his decisions.

00:04:13.552 --> 00:04:17.323
He's in it
for all the right reasons.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:19.191
-Uh...
-Yes.

00:04:19.224 --> 00:04:21.560
-Wait. Uh... Laura.
-Yes. -(applause)

00:04:21.593 --> 00:04:23.162
-Right? Right?
-I got... I got to...

00:04:23.195 --> 00:04:24.897
-She knows.
-No, no, I got to say.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.232
-She knows.
-I got to say

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:27.767
-that, actually...
-What? What?

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.535
That seems pretty...
inconsistent.

00:04:29.568 --> 00:04:31.537
-(scoffs, mutters)
-Okay.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:34.006
Okay, only in the ideas.

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.475
The intensity is the same.

00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:40.413
And intensity is the only thing
that matters.

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:43.249
Judge Jeanine knows petards,
because she is one.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:44.850
(laughter)

00:04:44.883 --> 00:04:47.953
She explodes with equal
destruction in every direction.

00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:50.756
Every Saturday night,
she's hoisting America.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.392
And nothing can stop her
from doing what she feels,

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:54.927
which in this case,
is saying,

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.496
"Hey, Comey, you look like shit
in a ball gown,

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:59.799
-you stretched out choir boy!"
-KLEPPER: Yeah.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:02.568
Consider me hoisted.
Laura Grey, everyone.
