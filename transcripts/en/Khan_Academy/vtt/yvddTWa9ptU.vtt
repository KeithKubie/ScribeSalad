00:00:00.342 --> 00:00:02.925
Let's say that we're told that
this sum right over here, where

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:06.100
our index starts at 2 and we
go all the way to infinity,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.570
that this infinite
series is negative 8/5

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.180
plus 16/7 minus 32/9
plus-- and we just

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.130
keep going on and on forever.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.230
And so what I want to do
is to explicitly define

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.979
what a sub n is here.

00:00:18.979 --> 00:00:20.520
So right now we just
say, hey, if you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.000
take the sum of a sub n
from n equals 2 to infinity,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.177
it turns out you get
this sum right over here.

00:00:26.177 --> 00:00:28.510
But let's think about what a
sub n-- how we can actually

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.872
define it in terms of n.

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:33.330
And I encourage you to pause
the video right now and try it

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.580
on your own.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.810
So the first thing
that you might realize

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.390
is, well, this is the number
that we're going to get.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:41.970
Let me write it this way.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.920
a sub 2 is equal
to negative 8/5.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.995
a sub 3 is equal to 16/7.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.540
a sub 4 is equal
to negative 32/9.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.940
And I'm just giving the sign
to the number in the numerator.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.760
Negative 8/5 is the same
thing as negative 8 over 5.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.720
Let me make that a
little bit clearer.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.000
So I'll make that a
little bit clearer.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.027
So this is negative 8/5.

00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:16.402
Obviously, this
is positive, so I

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:18.276
don't have to really
worry about it too much.

00:01:18.276 --> 00:01:20.560
And then here, I'm just
saying negative 32/9,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.850
so it's the same thing
as negative 32 over 9.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.910
So let's see if
we can first find

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.730
a pattern in the numerator.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.840
So when we go from negative
8 to 16, what's happening?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.330
Well, we're multiplying
by negative 2.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.120
Now, to go from
16 to negative 32,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.020
we're multiplying
by negative 2 again.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.640
So you might say,
OK, well, whatever

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.037
we have in the numerator must
be a power of negative 2.

00:01:54.037 --> 00:01:55.870
And, all right, if you
say, well, maybe this

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.710
is negative 2 squared, well,
you know that negative 8

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.850
isn't negative 2 squared.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.610
Negative 2 squared is
equal to positive 4.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.150
Negative 8-- this
right over here.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:10.610
Negative 8, that is equal to
negative 2 to the third power.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.470
16 is equal to negative
2 to the fourth power.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:26.400
Negative 32 is equal to
negative 2 to the fifth power.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.700
So notice, our exponent
on the negative 2

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.960
is always going to be
one more than our index.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.400
Our index is 2,
our exponent is 3.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.670
Our index is 3,
our exponent is 4.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.730
Our index is 4,
our exponent is 5.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.930
So that gives a sense that at
least the numerator is going

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.840
to be-- whatever our index
is, it's going to be-- so let

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.790
me write this down.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.070
So a sub n is equal
to-- well, it's

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.170
going to be negative 2 to
whatever index we're at,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.350
to that index plus 1 power.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.580
So that's a reasonable way
to think about our numerator.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.790
Now let's think about
our denominators.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:10.760
So over-- So we go from 5,
so when n is 2, we're at 5.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.340
When n is 3, we're at 7.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.500
When n is 4, we're at 9.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.785
So notice, 5 is
2 times 2 plus 1.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.400
This right over here
is 2 times 3 plus 1.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.685
This right over here
is 2 times 4 plus 1.

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:39.310
And you should just
kind of play around

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.810
with different
patterns in your head

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.680
until you say, hey,
well, look, this

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.870
is increasing by 2 every time.

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.670
Notice, this increases
by 2 every time.

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.680
But these aren't
exactly multiples of 2.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.045
These seem to be off by one more
than the multiples of 2, which

00:03:55.045 --> 00:03:56.420
is a good sign
that this is going

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.340
to be 2 times our index plus 1.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.665
So we could write this as
2 times our index plus 1.

00:04:05.665 --> 00:04:06.290
And we're done.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:07.420
That's what a sub n is.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.780
And if we wanted to write
this series in sigma notation,

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.630
we would write this
as the sum from n

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.880
equals 2 to infinity
of negative 2

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.269
to the n plus 1
power over 2n plus 1.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.790
And that would equal this
series right over here.
