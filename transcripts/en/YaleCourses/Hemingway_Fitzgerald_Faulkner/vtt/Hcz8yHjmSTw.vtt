1
00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.730
We're moving on to the Fitzgerald stories and I just want to make an

2
00:00:05.731 --> 00:00:06.970
announcement,
um,

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.280
about a possible a field trip to New York City,
uh,

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.270
movie Emrae.
One of the teaching fellows,
um,
is,
uh,

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.720
organizing a trip,
uh,
to see the,
uh,

6
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.580
production,
uh,
of,
uh,
on the sun also rises,

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.800
which is another novel.
I haven't ways by this select in spite of elevated,

8
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.840
uh,
what is,
what is the grip call express elevator service.
Um,
so,

9
00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.430
um,
it's very interesting.
They,
last year did,
did the great Gatsby.
Um,

10
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.900
so it's,
uh,
it was right here,
um,
and at Yale Rep.

11
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.380
So it was a very interesting group and it looks like they're going to keep on

12
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.930
doing this extended readings,

13
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:51.820
but also dramatic readings of the novels.

14
00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:56.100
So if you guys would like to go to see the sun also rises,
just email,

15
00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.300
email,
movie.
Um,
and um,
I should,

16
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.870
I'm just gonna get started on the first year I was stories.
Um,

17
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.020
and we might be under the misimpression,
um,

18
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.450
from reading the short stories that may be a Fisher went to Yale.

19
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.000
He didn't,
uh,

20
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
he was Princeton class of 1917.
Um,

21
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.890
and this was actually a kind of very interesting that I found from the Princeton

22
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.890
Library.
Um,

23
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.910
that's the kind of receipt that he had at the triangle club and because so many

24
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:33.610
who's show stories have to deal with clubs,
the Yale Club and so on.
Um,

25
00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.680
it's interesting just to have this document showing that he was a member of the

26
00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:40.170
triangle club.
Um,

27
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.180
and this is a letter that he wrote to his classmate also Princeton,

28
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.590
uh,
1917,
uh,

29
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.860
last Lowell Fowler who would go on to become a very prominent and a New York

30
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.150
lawyer,
the founder of a very prominent law firm.

31
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.090
This is what he wrote to the follower.

32
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.750
I have written a 15,000 word story about your car.

33
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.680
The rich boy.
It is in a large measure,

34
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.740
the story of your life tuned down here and there and simplified also Manny gabs

35
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:22.911
had to come out of my imagination is frank unsparing the sympathetic and I think

36
00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:26.431
you are like,

37
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:31.431
it is astonishing the huge things of that anyone would as the like this story

38
00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:35.250
that is supposedly based on their lives.
Uh,
but in any case,

39
00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:40.170
this is what Arthur sometimes think about their own work.
Um,

40
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.000
so you know,
I think we know just from our edition in,
in the short stories,

41
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.720
um,

42
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.720
that there were a couple of episodes that are like little follower made,

43
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.230
Fitzgerald tech out there,
reinserted it now in brackets.

44
00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.090
But obviously there was historical proof that little fall,

45
00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.100
it was pretty upset by the story.
Um,
but in any case,

46
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:08.080
Fisher or really thought that this was a story about a friend of his and that

47
00:03:08.081 --> 00:03:12.850
the friendship was as they,
what propelled him into writing the story.
Um,

48
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.880
so he is also in that story that he lays out his theory about fiction and

49
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:25.060
especially the way that characters are to be described in fiction.

50
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.280
So he is hysterical.

51
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.570
Begin with an individual and before you know it you find that you have created a

52
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:38.611
type began with a type and you find that you have created nothing.

53
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.980
They all know types.

54
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.340
No Thoreau's there is a rich boy and this is his and not his brother's story.

55
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.960
All my life I have lived a mom,
his brothers,

56
00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.290
but this one has been my friend.

57
00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.590
So it was still saying in within the story itself that this is about someone,

58
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.760
um,

59
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.200
who he still calls his friend physicists theory.

60
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.230
Let's see what's Fitzgerald does in practice because we know that quite often

61
00:04:14.231 --> 00:04:19.231
there's a distance between what others profess that they're doing and what they

62
00:04:19.961 --> 00:04:23.620
actually end up doing.
So this is his practice right on the next page.

63
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.600
Let me tell you about a very rich,
they are different from you and me.

64
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.360
They processed and enjoy early and it does something to them,

65
00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.660
makes them soft where we are hard and cynical where we are trustful in a way

66
00:04:41.651 --> 00:04:46.180
that unless you were born rich,
it is very difficult to understand.

67
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.930
They think deep in their hearts that they are better than we are because we have

68
00:04:53.561 --> 00:04:58.561
to discover the compensations and refuges of life for ourselves.

69
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.990
Even when they entered deep into our world or sink below us,

70
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.230
they still think that they are better than we are.

71
00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.160
So let's say a couple of things here.

72
00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:17.161
First obviously if that Fitzgerald was using a tight social label is,

73
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.460
is turning a rich boy into a social type and generalizing about this entire

74
00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.870
social type.

75
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.230
So in many ways he is doing exactly what he says.

76
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.810
Writers should never do crusading with a title.

77
00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.970
But I think that we should also say that given the fact that he is using a type

78
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.170
that the rich boy is kind of generic identity,
uh,

79
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.200
the he honors that he recognizes as a reality that even though he is doing that,

80
00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.270
um,
his,
the contents that he attributed to that type,

81
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:58.490
Ashley,
I'm pretty interesting.
Uh,
according to him,

82
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.910
Arish boy or the rich are people who are different from people who are not rich

83
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.470
because of two things,
right?
That they are soft,

84
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.550
where we are hot and that they are cynical.

85
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Where we are trustful those to actually pull in two different directions.

86
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.290
If we were just to take the first one that they are soft,

87
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.900
where we are hard.
That's very,

88
00:06:26.901 --> 00:06:31.040
very understandable that because they didn't have to struggle all that much.

89
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.120
They don't have the kind of Holly Hood that comes to people when they have to

90
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:39.170
struggle a lot just to get the bare essential oils from life.
Um,

91
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.500
so that would be completely understandable.

92
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:48.010
But what is interesting is that right after that comes the statement that

93
00:06:48.111 --> 00:06:53.111
completely is on the other side of the spectrum that whereas the rest of us are

94
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:56.060
trustful,

95
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.290
the ridge actually us cynical.

96
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.410
So how could this be under what circumstances with the rest of us be trustful,

97
00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:10.670
whereas the rich would be cynical.
This is not so self evident.

98
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.340
It is something that Fisher would just throw out.

99
00:07:13.341 --> 00:07:16.520
It's kind of a generalization seemingly,
you know,

100
00:07:16.521 --> 00:07:20.570
just something that he would make a casual point that he would make.
Um,

101
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.100
well actually it's quite puzzling.

102
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:27.110
So we have to figure out in the course of the story of the rich boy why it is

103
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:28.880
that even though there's salt,

104
00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.910
most of the times they are also moments when they are actually harder than we

105
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:39.620
are.
They are more cynical than the rest of us.
Um,
so in any case,

106
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:43.130
so all we can say at this point is that even though yes,

107
00:07:43.131 --> 00:07:48.030
Fitzgerald uses social types in his stories,
um,

108
00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.400
that here's a very interesting understanding of those social types.

109
00:07:52.401 --> 00:07:57.401
So we can say that he's really not so much subscribing to the notion of social

110
00:07:58.011 --> 00:08:02.120
types as playing with them,
putting pressure on them,

111
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.310
uh,
looking at all the possible permutations of social types.

112
00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:09.320
So this is,
um,

113
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.460
something that we've already talked about a little bit last week when we talk

114
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:17.780
about to have and have nots and Hemingway's use of those two types of have and

115
00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:21.930
have not.
So today I want to go back a little bit and give you in many ways the,

116
00:08:21.931 --> 00:08:26.690
so the genealogy to that kind of thinking,
thinking in terms of social types.

117
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:31.750
And it actually goes back to the mid 19th century.
This is a very,
um,

118
00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:35.270
famous texts,
scientific texts,

119
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:40.160
what aspires to be a scientific tags,
uh,
by Dusa not and George Clinton,

120
00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:44.810
uh,
called types of mankind.
And if you guys are fans of Stephen Stephen G.
Good,

121
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.360
you'll see that there's this tax was actually mentioned by Stephen Jay Gould and

122
00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:52.310
his book mismeasure of Mendez where I got my information from.

123
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:56.370
So in 1850,
um,

124
00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:01.140
the understanding there's a clear correlation obviously,
um,

125
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:05.550
between the,
the,
the facial features of a Caucasian person,

126
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.600
very Greek looking person,
classic go profile,
um,

127
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.610
and this kind of very flat,
um,
facial structure,

128
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:20.190
bone structure,
the phase,
um,
the girl corresponds to the facial features.

129
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:25.220
And then obviously the implication is that blacks and gorillas actually have the

130
00:09:27.271 --> 00:09:31.230
same skulls.
I'm Asian,
so you can,
we can see where this is heading.

131
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.370
This is the sort of signs,
um,
that is quite common.
Um,

132
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.400
in the mid 19th century of talking about social types in order to suggest a very

133
00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.560
close kinship between certain types of humans and certain types of animals,

134
00:09:46.590 --> 00:09:51.590
that's the embroiders behind that kind of taxonomic thinking.

135
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.830
Um,
so this was in the mid 19th century.
Um,

136
00:09:56.910 --> 00:10:01.650
and by the 20th century that pretty much has receded into the background.

137
00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:06.360
So let's look at another kind of thinking about types.

138
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:10.770
Um,
and as we can see from this very sober looking,
um,

139
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.000
no thrills,
no nonsense.
Look of the treaters.
Uh,

140
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:19.890
this is a very highly respected sociological treaters by Burgess.

141
00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:24.110
Either you verges and Robin as for the park,
um,

142
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:27.180
introduction to the science of sociology.

143
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.800
And it turns out that social types,

144
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.800
the notion of social types is crucial to the birth of sociology.

145
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:38.400
So this is what Robert E.
Park says.

146
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:44.150
I did not see how we could have anything like scientific research unless we had

147
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:52.011
a system of classification and the frame of reference into wish we could sort

148
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:58.251
out and describe in general terms the things we were attempting to investigate.

149
00:10:59.851 --> 00:11:04.851
So the system of classification and a frame of reference into which we should

150
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.340
sort out and describe in general terms,

151
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:13.820
I was plead as a degree of abstraction going on the degree of generalization

152
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.550
going on.

153
00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:19.170
We need to be able to generalize from individual cases and other to create a

154
00:11:19.171 --> 00:11:20.730
system of classification.

155
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.120
So in many ways that's the very foundation of the sinus car sociology.

156
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.860
Um,
and Fitzgerald is very much,
uh,
and Hemingway as well.

157
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:36.060
They were both very much moving in that kind of,
you know,
um,

158
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.270
very pervasive,
very common intellectual climate.
So,
um,

159
00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:45.060
I wanted to stop here for a brief moment and talk a little about about the

160
00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:49.120
interconnections among the tabs that we've read so far.

161
00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.610
Um,
as you guys recognize,
um,

162
00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:56.680
in last week when we were talking about to have and have not been talking about

163
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:59.050
Harry Morgan,
um,
as a kind of attention,

164
00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.780
the character is attention between type,

165
00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:04.990
between label of generic type,
um,

166
00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:10.050
and deviation from type as we mentioned that in fact it's only when he is

167
00:12:11.831 --> 00:12:15.460
mediated through the presence of other people when he's channeled through Marie

168
00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:18.540
or when his contrasted with Rob Gordon,
um,

169
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.700
that he actually becomes somebody who's not the social type.

170
00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.450
So that's Hemingway thinking about types.

171
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:30.430
I also want to go back a little bit further and refresh your memory about the

172
00:12:30.431 --> 00:12:33.490
sound and the fury.
Um,
and the sound of the fury.

173
00:12:33.491 --> 00:12:38.491
We talk a lot about the relation between today and tomorrow are obviously time

174
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:41.950
is central to the time to sound the fury.
Um,

175
00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:47.010
and we were talking about Benji Quentin's and Jason's tomorrow as one of the

176
00:12:47.321 --> 00:12:50.050
most important things linking the three brothers.

177
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:55.150
So today what I like to do is to combine those two,

178
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:55.930
um,

179
00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:00.930
analytic structure is to create a new structure to talk about Fitzgerald's short

180
00:13:01.211 --> 00:13:05.680
stories.
We'll be talking about tight and variation,

181
00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:11.040
but mapped onto the concept of the relation between today and tomorrow.

182
00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.190
So if you belong to a certain type,

183
00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.340
if you can be labeled by a generic identity while there's the possible future

184
00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:23.560
for you though as the possible tomorrow for you.

185
00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.820
So basically a combination of Hemingway and thought there.
Um,

186
00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.060
but I also want to introduce new layer,

187
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:34.540
a new analytic layer into our discussion,

188
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.400
which is the difference between a story that is dramatic and the story that is

189
00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:42.280
not dramatic.
And the four stories,
um,
that we're,

190
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:47.310
we're reading today represent very interesting permutations on that platform.

191
00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:49.570
So we'll be talking about that too.

192
00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:54.790
And this is just a very quick run through of the argument that I'll try to make

193
00:13:54.791 --> 00:13:55.790
today.
Um,

194
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.890
rich boy is about excessive conformative to type tomorrow.

195
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:02.560
It's going to be exactly like today.
And so it's not dramatic.

196
00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.750
Babylon revisit it is in many ways a kind of rewriting of Richard Roy of rich

197
00:14:07.751 --> 00:14:08.470
boy,
um,

198
00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:13.450
is about someone who conforms to type to a large extent,

199
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.890
but not entirely.
And what happens when that's the case then?

200
00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:20.170
So tomorrow is not quite low today,

201
00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.790
but still is not a dramatic story.
And then we move on to two stories.

202
00:14:24.791 --> 00:14:28.150
They're very dramatic.
Um,
diamond as big as your risk,

203
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.980
as we know from the Tido is large scale dramas,
very,
very dramatic.
Um,

204
00:14:33.010 --> 00:14:37.870
and then Bernie is barbs,
her hair,
small scale drama,
but also dramatic.
So,

205
00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:41.980
um,
but less move,
look,

206
00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:44.980
take a closer look at rich boy.
Um,

207
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:49.960
and even though a Fisher went into Princeton for some reason,
yeah,

208
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:54.390
is the reference point for him.
So the Yale Club,
um,

209
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:58.790
is a social marker and it's very interesting that actually Fitzgerald,
um,

210
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.800
makes the point that,
um,

211
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:05.900
that's a hundred actually was not popular when he was at Yale.

212
00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:10.901
So he Fisher was making a distinction between Yale College in new haven and the

213
00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.890
Yale Club in New York City.

214
00:15:12.891 --> 00:15:16.460
And he's really talking about the Yale Club in New York City and not so much

215
00:15:16.461 --> 00:15:19.900
about college.
Um,
so,
uh,
and,

216
00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:23.480
and is devoted to the Yale Club.
He's always there,

217
00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.420
but there's also the sense that maybe it's too much of a good thing.

218
00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:31.460
And so there's the possibility that excessive conformity to type his,

219
00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:33.530
the Yale Club type,

220
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:37.820
that being too much of that will actually lead to some kind of deviation.

221
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:42.530
So,
but first of all,
this is the diversion to the Yale Club.
Um,

222
00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.670
but he never abandoned the Yale Club.
He was a figure there,

223
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:52.150
a personality and attendancy tendency of his class who are now seven years out

224
00:15:53.021 --> 00:15:56.570
of college to drift away to most solo.

225
00:15:56.571 --> 00:15:59.150
Hans was checked by his presence.

226
00:15:59.151 --> 00:16:02.360
So this is a very unremarkable centers in other ways.
You know,

227
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:03.980
it's not something that we will know.

228
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.360
This is very matter of fact or three neutrally descriptive.
Um,

229
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:11.150
he is a pillar of the owl club.
Um,
and his presence there,

230
00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:17.570
um,
is an anchor for other people,
so they stick around because of him.

231
00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:22.570
So there's really nothing to say one way or another really about this

232
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:27.671
description of ensign hunter other than the fact that it's a little odd to seven

233
00:16:27.951 --> 00:16:32.570
years of college that the owl club is still this very center of his universe.

234
00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.450
Um,
so it's just beginning to look a little art.

235
00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:40.451
But the description in itself is not especially dramatic or noticeable really.

236
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.790
Um,
but

237
00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:51.650
more towards the middle of the story,
in fact,
um,
after some things have happened,

238
00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.930
we know the hints Mrs Chance to marry Holler.
Um,

239
00:16:56.210 --> 00:17:00.040
he misses his challenge to marry Darley.
Um,

240
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.400
his lives seems to be,
um,

241
00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.400
a catalog now of things that are not done.

242
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:12.520
Things that he could have done that he chooses not to do or the WHO perversely

243
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:18.020
allows not to happen,
um,
is beginning to look that way.
Um,

244
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.080
and it is at this moment that the excessive devotion to the Yale club becomes

245
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:30.440
almost a summary of what kind of person he is.

246
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:36.130
It was a hot Friday afternoon in May and as he walked from the pier,

247
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:41.830
he realized there Saturday closing had begun and he was free until Monday

248
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.720
morning go where he asked himself the Yale Club,
of course,

249
00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.410
bridge until dinner,

250
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.720
then four or five Raul cocktails in some of these room at a pleasant,

251
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.190
confused evening

252
00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.010
is still quite neutral.
Um,

253
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:05.970
it's not registering any shock,
um,

254
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.630
about this non turn of events.

255
00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:12.600
Basically nothing happens in adolescence live.
Right.
You know,

256
00:18:12.601 --> 00:18:16.380
so all these things that could have happened that would have been a significant

257
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:19.650
development in his life,
significant turning points,

258
00:18:19.651 --> 00:18:24.651
all those important turning points where rose not taken by Anderson.

259
00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:28.380
Um,
and so he's still going to the Yale Club,

260
00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:33.770
but at this point going to the Yale Club becomes a measure of the poverty of his

261
00:18:35.671 --> 00:18:36.060
life.

262
00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.060
Right before it had been attributed to the fact that he's such an important

263
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:44.560
presence there.
There's a pillar of the Yale Club.
Um,

264
00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:49.670
now he's going there because he doesn't have anything else.

265
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.920
So is a description from being a plus in this life,

266
00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.700
something that he has,
you know,

267
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.590
on his resume that he's such an important figure at the Yale Club from being a

268
00:19:01.591 --> 00:19:06.270
plus on his resume,
it becomes,
um,

269
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:11.630
not exactly a minors but a sign that things are just darling not to go well for

270
00:19:14.011 --> 00:19:18.930
him or that we beginning to take this to see that some things are beginning to

271
00:19:18.931 --> 00:19:22.910
go wrong.
So if the indication,
um,
of,
of,
of,

272
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:27.630
of alive that is not taking shape as it should.
Um,

273
00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:32.640
and the story really is about the possible shapes of one's life.

274
00:19:32.730 --> 00:19:35.850
Um,
F as in Mary,
the hollow,
we're taking them very,

275
00:19:35.851 --> 00:19:40.770
very different shed is the fact that he doesn't allow his life to take that
shed,

276
00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:45.720
that it retains the original shape,
which I guess is good.
In one sense,

277
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:48.330
it wasn't so bad shape to begin with.
Um,

278
00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:53.360
but the fact remains that this absolutely no change in his life that tomorrow is

279
00:19:54.691 --> 00:19:59.370
going to be exactly like yesterday and like today.
So,

280
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.810
um,
this is the very end of the story.
Um,

281
00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:07.770
and this is on the boat.
Um,
and the narrator is,

282
00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:11.260
I'm actually happy that things have,
um,

283
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.800
that this is how things stand for Anderson.

284
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.680
And he told me about the girl in the red town and is the Avengers with her

285
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:24.690
making them are bizarre and amusing as he had a way of doing.

286
00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.630
And I was glad that he was himself again,

287
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:32.310
or at least the south that I knew and book,
which I felt at home.

288
00:20:33.210 --> 00:20:37.140
I don't think he was ever happy unless someone was in love with him,

289
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.460
responding to him,
my filings to amount that,

290
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:45.000
helping him to explain himself,
promising him something,

291
00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:46.890
what it was.
I do not.

292
00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:52.690
Perhaps they promise that there will always be women in the world who has spend

293
00:20:52.691 --> 00:20:57.691
the highest freshers rare is ours to notice that superiority be cherished and

294
00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:05.300
his whole life.
So it is in many ways of poetry,

295
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.770
of a social to hype.
Uh,

296
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.680
the way it comes back to that soup,

297
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:15.010
recognize about social profile.
Um,

298
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:17.080
someone who,
uh,

299
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.550
because he has such a large and guarantee and very,

300
00:21:21.551 --> 00:21:26.260
very secure in companies,
very,
very successful in his firm.
Um,

301
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:29.520
and he's the pillar of is the head of his family.
Um,

302
00:21:29.770 --> 00:21:34.770
because so many things a given in his life where there's also a given,

303
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.320
it's the understanding that there will always be a supply of women who have

304
00:21:41.321 --> 00:21:46.120
gravitate towards him and be bowled over by him.

305
00:21:46.121 --> 00:21:50.590
People are still bowled over by him if they just see him for the first time.

306
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:53.950
Um,
and is that capacity,
that knowledge,

307
00:21:53.951 --> 00:21:58.951
that certainty that there will always be women who will be bowled over by him

308
00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.670
that makes him what he is.
Um,
so Fitzgerald,

309
00:22:03.700 --> 00:22:08.530
his definition of the rich boy extends far beyond the amount of money that adds

310
00:22:08.531 --> 00:22:11.440
and hunter has.
Um,

311
00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:15.760
even though that is not an unimportant consideration,
uh,

312
00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:20.790
but it really is in many ways the stalling point for whole kind of psychological

313
00:22:20.831 --> 00:22:25.831
profile about what it means when someone takes a lot of things for granted.

314
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:28.180
Um,

315
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:33.180
and the ways in which taking so many things for granted can actually be a kind

316
00:22:34.361 --> 00:22:36.890
of psychological liability.
Um,

317
00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:41.170
it's actually not good for us according to a Fitzgerald,
um,

318
00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.030
to be able to take so many things for granted,

319
00:22:43.031 --> 00:22:47.470
especially to be able to take other human beings for granted.
And that is sadly,

320
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:52.260
uh,
the,
the,
the kind of the,
the most fundamental truth,
um,

321
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:57.340
about Edison Hunter.
So it is about social type.
There's no question about it.
Um,

322
00:22:57.370 --> 00:23:00.910
but this,
the paradox,
um,
that,
that he,

323
00:23:00.970 --> 00:23:04.840
that he becomes almost kind of extreme to house keys of the very,

324
00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:08.200
very recognizable social profile.
Um,

325
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.520
just to show what a range,
um,

326
00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.790
Fitzgerald has.
Um,

327
00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.300
and the way that he can start at almost exactly the same

328
00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.810
starting point,
um,
but end up in a different place.
Um,

329
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:28.700
I thought that maybe we should,
uh,
look at Babylon revisited.
Um,

330
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:31.690
it's also about a rich man,
um,

331
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.360
someone who has never eaten in a cheap restaurant in Paris.
Um,
I mean,

332
00:23:36.361 --> 00:23:39.040
I think that that really is the reason why very high rate,
you know,

333
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:42.130
it's not like we go to Paris every day,
um,
but,
uh,
not,

334
00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:46.370
never even in a cheap restaurant in Paris.
So that is the,

335
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.260
that is the fresh hold,
uh,
for,
um,
for Charlie.
Um,

336
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:56.210
and it would be all too easy,
uh,
to,
uh,
suggest.
Okay,

337
00:23:56.211 --> 00:24:00.380
here's another rich boy and this kind of conformity to tight.

338
00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.390
Um,
well there's also interesting about Charlotte is that he has in common with

339
00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.660
[inaudible] in the fact that they both are hot trinkets razor four or five to 10

340
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:12.660
years is really nothing.
It's just the norm.
Just the beginning really.
Um,

341
00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:16.560
so the hot drinking,
they're taking things for granted.
Um,

342
00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.340
the lack of variety and experience,
um,

343
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.380
that all those things they have in common because they are so rich.
Um,

344
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.450
all those things they have in common.

345
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.040
But what is interesting about Charlie is that in fact his life has very,

346
00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.290
very different trajectory from that have answers and it's actually a happy

347
00:24:39.291 --> 00:24:39.770
ending.

348
00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:44.770
So let's see what happens at the very end of,

349
00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.230
um,
of,
of,
of Charlie's story.

350
00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:51.890
Babylon revisited.
He went back to his table,

351
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:56.810
his whiskey glass was irritated,
but he shook his head.

352
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.970
When Alex looked at it.

353
00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:04.330
Questioningly there wasn't much he could do now except sen on area.

354
00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:09.530
Somethings he was send her a lot of things tomorrow.

355
00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:13.580
No.
Numora he said to another way though what,
which I owe you.

356
00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:17.600
He would come back Sunday.
They couldn't make him pay forever.

357
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:22.460
He wanted his child and nothing was much good.
Now besides that fact,

358
00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.820
he wasn't young anymore with a lot of them,

359
00:25:25.821 --> 00:25:28.520
those thoughts and dreams to have by himself.

360
00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:33.530
He was absolutely sure Helen when has wanted him to be sold off.

361
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.430
So right here we can see a lot of very,

362
00:25:37.431 --> 00:25:41.270
very important differences between Charlie and Anson.

363
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:46.730
The first thing we notice is that this is someone who stopped drinking.

364
00:25:46.731 --> 00:25:47.720
Right?
You know,
who has,

365
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:50.880
I mean that is sort of an obvious fact that someone was embarrassing the point

366
00:25:50.881 --> 00:25:51.890
now.
But there it is,

367
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.330
it is very important for Fitzgerald who had a problem with alcohol,
alcoholism,

368
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:58.250
um,
that that should be the case.

369
00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:03.250
That this person has enough self control to say no when it would have been so

370
00:26:05.331 --> 00:26:10.130
easy to say yes.
Um,
but more than that,

371
00:26:10.190 --> 00:26:15.190
that that is actually just the manifestation of something being different is

372
00:26:15.501 --> 00:26:19.880
that he has one very important person in his life.

373
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:25.270
And what is interesting is that this is actually not a romantic interest,

374
00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:25.790
right?

375
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.790
So this is what is missing in ends in Hunter's life as a child.

376
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:36.920
Um,
and we know that Fitzgerald himself had said many things about his daughter,

377
00:26:36.921 --> 00:26:41.770
Scottie,
um,
that it broke his heart to think that when Scotty grew up the,

378
00:26:41.771 --> 00:26:45.290
his novels with no longer be input,
right?
You said that about the great Gatsby.

379
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.550
So we do know that that fist general had a personal knowledge of what it means

380
00:26:50.551 --> 00:26:55.551
to have a child and to think about the future in terms of the future of that

381
00:26:55.891 --> 00:27:00.570
child and wanting to share the future with that child.

382
00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:03.570
I think that that actually is what gives them future.

383
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:08.210
So we actually very close to the world,
Hemingway,
uh,

384
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.230
have to have and have not,

385
00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:15.530
which is the future appearing by virtue of the mediation of someone else.

386
00:27:16.951 --> 00:27:20.520
In this case,
it is not Harry's wife Marie,

387
00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:25.730
who enables that future and an affirmative future to take shape.

388
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:30.530
It is not his wife,
but his daughter on the area.
Um,

389
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:35.600
so his future is defined in terms of today I'm going to give her some things

390
00:27:36.331 --> 00:27:39.030
tomorrow I'm going to give her a lot more things.

391
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:42.960
It's the pleasure of being able to give his daughter a lot of presence.

392
00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.440
That is what makes him work hard.
You know,
he's very,

393
00:27:47.441 --> 00:27:50.810
very good at his job,
was making tons of money,
is very,
very uh,

394
00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.910
trusted by his employers.
Um,

395
00:27:53.970 --> 00:27:58.970
is all that is giving him a certain kind of relation to time.

396
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:03.360
So in that way,

397
00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:06.960
I think that both Hemingway and father,
uh,

398
00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:12.050
sort of implicitly present in a story is how do we get to have to start being a

399
00:28:13.951 --> 00:28:18.951
social type and how do we get to have a personal and a highly interestingly

400
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.330
populated relation to the future.

401
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.830
The future is not any good unless it is populated by something.

402
00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:34.080
And in this case,
child's future is very much populated by his daughter.

403
00:28:34.081 --> 00:28:39.081
And that is because of the way it is popular later that he wants to get to that

404
00:28:39.391 --> 00:28:41.070
future.
Right.
You know,
it's not a hobby leader.

405
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.890
You might not even want to go there and you might want just to stay where you

406
00:28:43.891 --> 00:28:46.820
are,
but it was populated in such an interesting way.

407
00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:51.880
He does want to go there and he wants to go there with her.
So this is the,
the,

408
00:28:51.890 --> 00:28:55.410
the main difference,
um,
between Charlie and ensign.

409
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:59.190
And what is also interesting is that he enables,

410
00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:04.170
it enables him to think about his wife,
Helen,
um,
that who died,
who's,

411
00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:09.150
uh,
in very difficult circumstances when they were reconciled,

412
00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:12.070
but not really,
it was not a good marriage.
Um,

413
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:14.910
it was through the mediation of his daughter.

414
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:18.360
There's able to think about his wife,

415
00:29:18.361 --> 00:29:23.040
whom he had probably brand in some sense,
but she's there now.

416
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:25.890
There's no way for him to write that role.

417
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:30.900
So the only way he can write that wrong that otherwise would have been permanent

418
00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:34.560
is once again through the mediation of his daughter.

419
00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:39.890
So immediated personal identity and then mediated relation to the future.

420
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:46.000
Um,
and,
um,
so these other two stories,
but I should say,

421
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:48.100
um,
that,
um,

422
00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:53.400
they have a lot in common in the sense that in terms of narrows the structure of

423
00:29:53.741 --> 00:29:58.270
the stories,
um,
because even though it's a happy ending for Charlie,

424
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:03.480
because the future is going to happen so slowly is it's a kind of very slow

425
00:30:06.191 --> 00:30:11.010
happening,
slow pace in from mellow emergence of tomorrow,
right?

426
00:30:11.010 --> 00:30:15.940
He's going to give money to his sister in law.
That's the implication.

427
00:30:15.941 --> 00:30:19.780
That's how he would get his daughter back who's gonna pay for everything to get

428
00:30:19.781 --> 00:30:22.900
it started back.
He's going to give his dollar loss and loss of presence.

429
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:26.560
So are those going to happen one day after another?

430
00:30:26.561 --> 00:30:30.250
There's not going to be a kind of dramatic change in his life is strictly

431
00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:34.810
incremental,
but because it is steadily in for Amanda,

432
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:38.710
we know that his distant future without say,

433
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.550
be significantly different from the today.
Um,

434
00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:47.290
but neither of those stories where I say,
um,
you know,
it's really dramatic.

435
00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:53.010
So let's turn now to the other side of the narrative spectrum.

436
00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:56.330
Two stories are very,
very dramatic.
Um,

437
00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.150
and one advertising the drama in the title diamond as big as the risk.

438
00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:02.920
Um,
so we don't,

439
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:07.600
this is probably the most famous short story by Fitzgerald and I will encourage

440
00:31:07.601 --> 00:31:12.190
you to say to discuss in session whether another that is indeed your favorite

441
00:31:12.191 --> 00:31:17.050
story is certainly very,
very unforgettable.

442
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:22.080
So there's off the charts deviation from an extremely tight rich boy,

443
00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.200
um,
and drama and large scale.

444
00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.200
I was thinking the catastrophe at and the story tomorrow is going to be

445
00:31:29.201 --> 00:31:30.040
different from today,

446
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:34.870
but let's just look at the way Fitzgerald proceeds to talk about is very,

447
00:31:34.871 --> 00:31:38.000
very extravagant.
Well,
um,

448
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:42.010
that really truly is nothing like the world as we know it.
Sing.

449
00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:47.020
My school is half an hour from Boston in the rose peers.

450
00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:48.283
My other car,

451
00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:53.790
the actual distance whenever we'd be known for no one except John t Unger had

452
00:31:55.181 --> 00:31:56.410
ever arrived there,

453
00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.090
safe in the rose peers and probably no one will ever again,

454
00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:05.440
this is all on the same page as never having eaten in a cheap restaurant in

455
00:32:05.441 --> 00:32:09.370
Paris.
Um,
but uh,
so that is the norm.

456
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.310
The norm is of it's very,
very,
extremely,

457
00:32:12.311 --> 00:32:16.180
this is a school is the most expensive boarding school in the world,
um,

458
00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.980
and is unheard of for anyone to go there and not owning a rose,
rose,

459
00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.370
rose peers.
Um,
so that is the baseline of very,

460
00:32:24.371 --> 00:32:26.410
very high threshold.

461
00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.010
But even on that very high threshold,

462
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:33.070
Percy is still a deviation.

463
00:32:33.071 --> 00:32:37.900
So it's definitely a deviation from an extreme type.

464
00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.320
And one measure of that deviation is the kind of car opened by the family.

465
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:48.650
Um,
so when they got to Montana,
uh,
John,
uh,

466
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:53.420
sees that this,
this kind of luminous,
this that's coming at him,
um,

467
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:57.560
and has no idea what that is.
Then as they came closer,

468
00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.780
John saw that it was the tail like men's automobile,

469
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:06.800
larger and more magnificent than anything he'd ever seen.

470
00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:12.400
His body was a gleaming matto Richard and they go lighter than silver and they

471
00:33:13.191 --> 00:33:13.431
help.

472
00:33:13.431 --> 00:33:18.170
So the wheels was studded with iridescent and geometric figures of green and

473
00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:23.060
yellow.
John did not dare to guess where they were.
Glass of jewel.

474
00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:28.570
Um,
I just want to stop for a moment and um,
talk about paper.

475
00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:33.200
Possible pay per topic,
um,
that would be perfect for the paper.

476
00:33:33.201 --> 00:33:34.590
That is 10 pages,
uh,

477
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:39.850
which is the automobile and fish Gero and often,

478
00:33:39.861 --> 00:33:41.630
right.
We know that,
um,

479
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:46.280
Jason can smell stand the smell of gasoline,

480
00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:51.340
that he has terrible headaches because of his relation to the gasoline.
Um,

481
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:56.350
so it was very interesting take on cars on flockler spot and we know that uh,

482
00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.860
Fitzgerald,
uh,
selling dramatizes,
uh,

483
00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:04.880
and turns the Gaspe is Rose Rose into a kind of surreal car,

484
00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:08.840
um,
kind of mythic car.

485
00:34:09.140 --> 00:34:13.970
And here he's coming back to that.
So usually the car is a very,

486
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:16.570
very concrete point of entry.

487
00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:19.990
We can actually talk about very large structures,
um,

488
00:34:20.210 --> 00:34:22.190
in both Faulkner and Fitzgerald.

489
00:34:22.191 --> 00:34:27.170
To what extent is the Rolls Royce and animal them of,
um,
of,
of,
of,

490
00:34:27.171 --> 00:34:31.150
of,
of Gatsby.
We also know that they saw another car with,
um,

491
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.050
three black,
um,

492
00:34:34.470 --> 00:34:38.150
black man in a black woman in a car and driven by what the chauffeur.

493
00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.840
That's part of the story as well.
You know,
that's the configuration.

494
00:34:42.110 --> 00:34:47.110
So we can use the very concrete object of very well defined object the car and

495
00:34:49.761 --> 00:34:54.761
talk about this symbolic constellation revolving around that car.

496
00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:57.140
In the case,
uh,
of,
of,

497
00:34:57.141 --> 00:35:01.610
of Fitzgerald definitely it would be a kind of social landscape.
Um,

498
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.410
the jazz age,
um,

499
00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.740
and in the case of flogging actually has to go back to the relation between the

500
00:35:06.741 --> 00:35:08.410
19th century in the 20th century,
right?

501
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:12.580
So the horse as relic of the 19th century being player,
the automobile.

502
00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.600
So using the card you can write a great paper that would be very specific and

503
00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:22.720
that would move from a small focus to a large argument.
Um,

504
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:26.450
so I would encourage you in writing your papers to think of similar structures,

505
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:30.470
stuff from something extremely well defined and then goes on to something
larger.

506
00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:35.360
But in any case,
um,
as we can see,
Ashley,
um,

507
00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:40.110
Race Fisher was fascinated by the relation between because of race.
So,

508
00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:43.600
uh,
the string bother the,

509
00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.630
the car is memorable in here,
uh,
in this story,
diamond as big as the risks.

510
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:53.400
Um,
and it turns out that it also has a very important racial dimension.

511
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:57.140
Um,
we know that,
um,
the,
that the,

512
00:35:57.190 --> 00:36:01.350
the black arrows are still slaves in this story.
Right?
Um,

513
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:04.180
and they were originally broad,
uh,

514
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:08.490
broad from the south and they had always been in the recession of the family.

515
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.360
So this is what happens,
um,
to this,
uh,
black slaves.

516
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.320
All these negros are descendants of the ones my father brought north with him.

517
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:24.090
They are about 250 now.
You know,

518
00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:26.250
there's that they've lived so long,

519
00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.520
a pause from the world that their original dialect has become an almost in this

520
00:36:32.671 --> 00:36:33.980
thing.
Fishbowl told us,

521
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:38.100
and he goes on to say that he actually trains a few of them just to speak

522
00:36:38.101 --> 00:36:40.800
English so that they could communicate with the rest of the world,

523
00:36:40.801 --> 00:36:42.410
but all the rest,

524
00:36:42.430 --> 00:36:47.430
the 250 of them actually speak Patois or a dialogue that has no relation or is

525
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:55.730
so far removed from English that it would not be a recognizable language to

526
00:36:56.070 --> 00:36:57.840
English speakers.
Um,

527
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:02.130
so that in itself is almost like a little vocal,
um,

528
00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:07.080
allegory for the relation of this particular,

529
00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.340
um,
family and,
um,

530
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:15.150
the Washington family.
Um,
and,
um,

531
00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:19.200
the unsustainable relation,
um,

532
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:24.320
between today and tomorrow you can keep on in the middle of the United States

533
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:30.290
speaking a language that is supposedly English but really has no relation to the

534
00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:35.631
English spoken by everyone else is just not a viable way of living in the United

535
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:39.870
States.
Um,
thinking that you were still speaking English when you was,

536
00:37:39.930 --> 00:37:42.080
isn't recognized as English by anyone else.

537
00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:47.190
It's another sustainable then we're sticking relation and it's also an

538
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:52.250
unsustainable relation to train this one close well that wants to remain close

539
00:37:55.350 --> 00:38:00.350
and the rest of the United States that is dynamically expanding and also trying

540
00:38:01.171 --> 00:38:06.171
to integrate or locales into a kind of national grip.

541
00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:12.030
So this is what happens.
Um,
when we know this,

542
00:38:12.031 --> 00:38:17.031
that this one important aspect of the Washington family that is clearly not

543
00:38:18.361 --> 00:38:21.390
going to last forever and it,

544
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:25.950
this pant wise is not going to ask wherever it's going to die out is going to be

545
00:38:25.951 --> 00:38:30.030
contaminated by the living English language.
Um,

546
00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.800
that this is going to die out.
What ours is going to die out about.
The,

547
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:39.460
what else is going to die out by this particular set up,
this close?

548
00:38:39.461 --> 00:38:44.461
Well that fantasizes about being closed forever and we see very soon that in fat

549
00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.690
the n is going to come faster than we think.

550
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:54.260
It only takes a few pages really for the end to arrive.
Um,

551
00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:57.880
and is drama on a very,
very,
very,

552
00:38:57.881 --> 00:39:01.870
very large scale indeed simultaneously and within,

553
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.400
in men's concussion,

554
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.760
the should told newly through itself into the air bursting into flaming

555
00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:13.960
fragments at rose and then tumbling back upon itself and is smoking pile.

556
00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.530
But later projecting half into the water of the lake,

557
00:39:18.070 --> 00:39:20.050
there was no fire or smoke.

558
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:24.850
There was drifted off in England with the sunshine and for a few minutes longer

559
00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:30.090
the powdering dust of marvel drifted from the great futile is pile that had once

560
00:39:31.691 --> 00:39:33.150
been houser jewels.

561
00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:37.570
There was no more sound in the three people will loan in the valley.

562
00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:43.230
So the ending in many ways is not surprising.

563
00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:47.470
Um,
is a very interesting combination.
Um,

564
00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:51.970
on the one hand is highly dramatic.
On the other hand,

565
00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.410
there's the element of predictability to that drama.

566
00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:00.480
We always know without some catastrophe is going to happen.

567
00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.410
And the story,
um,

568
00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.670
and I think that oil is actually very comfortable with that kind of a

569
00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:11.720
combination hydroma with almost no suspense.
Um,

570
00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:16.000
we know almost from the very beginning that probably something very,
very bad.

571
00:40:16.001 --> 00:40:19.630
It's going to happen.
And as story,
um,
so it's,
uh,
the,

572
00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.720
and we also know just from a very desolate landscape at the end of the story,

573
00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:29.440
um,
that the tomorrow is going to be totally different,
uh,

574
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:34.360
from the today within the story.
Um,
so,

575
00:40:34.361 --> 00:40:38.860
um,
I have to confess that I liked the story a lot,

576
00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.890
but I actually like drama on a smaller scale.

577
00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:44.330
So when these bath,

578
00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:49.350
my hair bobbed her hair is actually my favorite story among the Fitzgerald,

579
00:40:50.891 --> 00:40:52.420
the stories.
Um,

580
00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:57.480
and I hope that you see why it's about reversion to the original and type and an

581
00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:01.900
unknown future.
So,
um,
Fitzgerald,
um,

582
00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.260
I think really like the story as well.

583
00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:09.380
So that is the story that is feature in the cover,
uh,

584
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:14.200
on the cover of the collection of short stories.
Um,
flappers and philosophers.

585
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:18.340
And,
um,
if you guys,
if the word flappers,
um,

586
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.980
if that doesn't ring a bell right away,

587
00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:26.100
this is an image of the very famous flappers of the 19th 20th people who've

588
00:41:26.501 --> 00:41:29.860
bought the hair and wear short skirts,

589
00:41:29.861 --> 00:41:34.520
show the legs and so on.
Um,
so the flappers,
um,

590
00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.610
but the,

591
00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:40.350
so you guys know that the story is really about someone who's becoming a flap

592
00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.650
beneath is going to do,
I mean has,
if I cut off all her beautiful hair,
you know,

593
00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:50.660
tons and tons of hair,
it's just cut it off,
has it cut off.
Um,

594
00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:55.050
but I tried to tell her that's exactly the wrong hair do for herself.
She's very,

595
00:41:55.060 --> 00:41:57.110
very ugly after that.
Um,

596
00:41:57.170 --> 00:42:02.170
and who bows stop Bose lose all interest in her.

597
00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.860
Um,
and um,
she was one person to thank and cousin.

598
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:13.150
So this is what happens to the person that she has to think when he's definitely

599
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.570
amputated the other break.
Her cousin Margaret,

600
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:24.920
um,
is sleeping.
And this is what happens to moderate when she's asleep,

601
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:30.080
when he's definitely amputated.
The other Embry pause for an instant.

602
00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:33.050
And then with Lee and silently back to him.

603
00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.960
And after minutes Brisbois,

604
00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.550
she discovered that her left hand still held and two blond braids.

605
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:46.120
She left unexpectedly had to show them of hard to kill from the in and name and

606
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.570
absolute peel.

607
00:42:48.170 --> 00:42:51.710
She was passing Warren's house now and on the empowers,

608
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.950
she sat down her baggage and swinging the brace,

609
00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:59.980
like pieces of rope flung them at a wooden porch when he landed with a slight,

610
00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:04.890
but she laughed again.
No longer streaming yourself,
Huh?

611
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:10.340
She giggled wildly scalp the selfish thing.
So I mean,

612
00:43:10.341 --> 00:43:13.890
you know,
it really is in one sense is no big deal here.
Will grow out,

613
00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.510
his hair will grow out madres hair with also grow out.

614
00:43:17.511 --> 00:43:22.070
So cutting off somebodies brazed is not like the end of the world as it is in

615
00:43:22.071 --> 00:43:24.500
the diamond.
As big as the risk,
but still,
you know,

616
00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.180
it's interesting kind of drama.

617
00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:31.370
And what makes the dramas especially interesting is the fact that monetary,

618
00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.480
that the bunny is actually uses the word scalp,

619
00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:40.220
which is a work not used in the 20 in the 20th century.
Um,

620
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:44.360
it goes all the way back to the 19th century,
18th century,
uh,

621
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:46.910
has to do with native and native American practice.

622
00:43:47.330 --> 00:43:51.550
So in order to understand this odd use of language,
um,

623
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:53.120
I think that we need to,

624
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:58.150
with the help of another sociologists and anthropologists very well known,

625
00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.490
one of the most important thing that was really,
um,

626
00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:05.750
in the 19th century and late 19th century into the 20th century,

627
00:44:05.751 --> 00:44:10.100
many authors or certain new host and Ashley's study were Franz Boas at Columbia.

628
00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:15.440
Um,
so Franz Boas,
um,
had,
um,
of

629
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:21.380
interesting argument about human types as well.

630
00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:26.800
And it turns out that he is turning the notion of type on his hat and this is

631
00:44:27.381 --> 00:44:32.250
what he says in 1911 when for instance,

632
00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:36.240
it is claim the certain types of Europeans,

633
00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:41.730
so Bella mantle endowment than other types of Europeans.

634
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:47.210
The assumption is that these types are stable and cannot undergo far reaching

635
00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:54.260
changes when please in a new social or geographical environment.

636
00:44:55.290 --> 00:45:00.290
And investigation of this problem shows that the assumption of an absolute

637
00:45:01.141 --> 00:45:05.370
stability of human types is not plausible.
Okay.

638
00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.450
So Franz Boas as the,
okay.

639
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.330
It looks like on the face of it looks like there are different types of domains

640
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:14.670
and yes,
when we look at the human faces,
um,
you know,

641
00:45:14.671 --> 00:45:18.210
they really are different human types,
pretty undeniable,

642
00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.860
but he doesn't think that there's any permanent to those types of things.

643
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:27.000
In fact,
even though you might be born into one time,
uh,

644
00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:31.840
when you're put in a different social or geographical environment,
um,

645
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:35.220
you Ashley that type Attic as radically modified.

646
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:40.221
So it's very much in arguing about the importance of environmental input and the

647
00:45:41.071 --> 00:45:46.071
way you can change your initial genetic makeup and to prove his point.

648
00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:53.490
Franz Boas Ashley is in,
became a performance artist.

649
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.360
Um,

650
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:59.360
so this is Franz boas dressed up as an inward at otherwise known as basketball,

651
00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.150
uh,
to uh,
show that yes,

652
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:06.720
a Caucasian man can look just like an into it.

653
00:46:07.350 --> 00:46:12.060
And here he is dressed up,
not dressed up at all.
Um,

654
00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.850
as a native American and proving that yes,

655
00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:19.410
the Caucasian can look like a native American.

656
00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:23.820
There is no permanent social type,

657
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:27.900
no permanent biological or genetic type.
Those,

658
00:46:27.901 --> 00:46:32.901
the constant shifting of boundaries among those types as well as the possibility

659
00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:39.990
of put the person at one time taking on the identity of another type.

660
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:44.690
So I think that that is the context for understanding.
Uh,

661
00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:49.900
the very odd use of the work would scalp on a pilot open ears and it turns out

662
00:46:52.031 --> 00:46:57.031
the first Gero cause actually prepares us for that development much earlier in

663
00:46:59.881 --> 00:47:04.200
the story when they were actually just talking about [inaudible] as being

664
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:07.800
totally Dell and having nothing interesting to say and just sitting around all

665
00:47:07.801 --> 00:47:11.160
day and doing nothing and being totally boring.
Um,

666
00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.940
when they were talking about her in that context,

667
00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:16.613
um,

668
00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:22.160
Marjorie actually has this interesting theory that maybe she's so dow and boring

669
00:47:22.951 --> 00:47:27.951
and submissive because just just like one of the native American women,

670
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:32.810
I think it is that crazy Indian love in beliefs,

671
00:47:33.070 --> 00:47:36.640
continual knowledge.
Right.
So when she was saying that,
making that observation,

672
00:47:36.641 --> 00:47:41.641
that one is that that Bernice is really like the native American women.

673
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.010
But it turns out that yes,

674
00:47:45.130 --> 00:47:49.190
she has them in the blood,
but what's your,

675
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:54.130
with sandals if not the Indian woman by the Indian warrior.

676
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.271
And that is really,

677
00:47:55.271 --> 00:48:00.271
it was coming up in that dramatic a amputation of my xrays,

678
00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:04.180
um,
uh,
braids.

679
00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:09.400
So the language of course is mock heroic.
Um,
it is,

680
00:48:09.490 --> 00:48:14.250
uh,
using the language of high drama,
talk about something that really,
um,

681
00:48:14.380 --> 00:48:17.710
is a very small incident.
But nonetheless,

682
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:22.950
it's very interesting story and it's the only story where we don't know what the

683
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:26.170
future is going to be.
Right.
You know,

684
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:30.130
that night that Bernice has done this thing,
there's al character,

685
00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.660
we just don't know what the future will hold for her,

686
00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:35.950
whether she would keep on,

687
00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:41.160
on this path that this is just the beginning of a new career and a new personal

688
00:48:42.191 --> 00:48:46.420
identity for her.
Whether she would revert Ashley back to a very quiet,

689
00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:49.240
pretty submissive type that she was before.

690
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.480
So this is the only story I think where we truly don't know if I'm,

691
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.550
the tomorrow is going to resemble today.

692
00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:02.640
And I think that it has to do partly with that very unexpected reversion to an

693
00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:05.450
original type.
Um,

694
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:10.710
so the least we can say is that Fitzgerald is someone who really plays on all

695
00:49:12.161 --> 00:49:14.580
the possible permutations of soldiers,
have,

696
00:49:14.590 --> 00:49:18.790
can't think of anybody more inventive,
um,
having war to bring,
you know,

697
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:21.130
to that kind of permutation.
Uh,

698
00:49:21.131 --> 00:49:26.131
so we're done with this girl and a on Thursday we'll move on to father and as I

699
00:49:27.431 --> 00:49:27.940
lay dying.
