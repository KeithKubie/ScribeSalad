00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.981
We just talked about the parent function for a cubic functions, f of x equals

00:00:03.981 --> 00:00:09.286
x-cubed. So I thought I should show you the graph of this function. Here it is,

00:00:09.286 --> 00:00:14.017
this blue, pretty curve. You can see that this has the same overall behavior, as

00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:18.188
the other cubic function that we saw in the last example. That one looked a

00:00:18.188 --> 00:00:23.055
little more like this. You can see that the overall behavior is the same. One

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:27.395
end of the graph is going down to negative infinity, and the other end of the

00:00:27.395 --> 00:00:31.695
graph is going up to positive infinity. In the middle, there's sort of a grey

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:35.660
area of, in this case, going down and then going up again, and in this case,

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.412
sort of leveling out for a bit. Now as I said in the last quiz, this parent

00:00:39.412 --> 00:00:43.072
function looks really different from the parent function for quadratic

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:48.423
functions. Let's just add that on to our graph, so we can compare them more

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:53.142
easily. So here, once again, is the parent function for a quadratic function, f

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:57.701
of x equals x squared. Let's examine the overall behavior of this graph as well.

00:00:57.702 --> 00:01:03.214
We know that the general shape of a parabola is kind of like a u, or if it's

00:01:03.214 --> 00:01:08.622
upside down, like an n. Whether it's opening upward or opening downward, the

00:01:08.622 --> 00:01:13.837
parabola has a vertex, which is either its minimum or its maximum. And then both

00:01:13.837 --> 00:01:18.272
of its ends point in the same direction. And then as x gets further away in

00:01:18.272 --> 00:01:23.230
either the negative direction,or the positive direction, the graph points the

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.278
same way. Either both ends of it go to positive infinity, or both ends go to

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:31.052
negative infinity. We also talked earlier about how a parabola has an axis of

00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:35.094
symmetry running down the middle of it. So that if you fold the graph in half

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:39.868
along that line, it will exactly map to the other side of itself. That's not the

00:01:39.868 --> 00:01:43.998
case over here with x cubed. If we simply fold this graph in half, down the

00:01:43.998 --> 00:01:48.412
y-axis, this right side is not going to end up looking just like the left side.

00:01:48.412 --> 00:01:53.008
It'll look more like this, not the same. This is all really interesting stuff.

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:58.966
Now since we're increasing powers, why don't we just do that one more time. So

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:04.273
I've put both y equals x squared and y equals x cubed on the same coordinate

00:02:04.273 --> 00:02:10.174
plane, then I draw another graph over here for you. My question for you now is

00:02:10.174 --> 00:02:16.020
what function does this graph represent? Now think about what this graph does on

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.364
either side of the y axis. And also think about what points you'd expect each of

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:24.902
these functions to go through. Your choices are y equals x, y equals x squared,

00:02:24.902 --> 00:02:29.590
y equals x cubed, y equals x to the fourth and y equals x to the fifth. So you

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.302
can always make a t chart and plug in some points and see which of those t

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:35.103
charts best matches this graph.
