00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of Congress
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.650
&gt;&gt; Hello, again, everyone.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.380
This is Cheryl Lederle from
the Library of Congress,

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:27.440 position:66%
and welcome to this conference session
provoking inquiry through primary sources.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.200 position:61%
It is my terrific pleasure to introduce
our presenter, Barbara Stripling.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.630 position:66%
Barbara Stripling is a senior associate
dean and assistant professor in the school

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.210 position:72%
of information studies at Syracuse University.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.480 position:59%
In her 35 year library career,
Stripling has been a school librarian,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:54.750 position:69%
a school district director of libraries, a
library program director, and most recently,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.040
director of library services
for the New York City schools.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.100
She was a past president of the
American Library Association.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.740
She received her doctorate from
Syracuse University in May 2011.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.220
Before I turn this over, a
couple of housekeeping bits.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:23.260 position:73%
We are recording this session, and it will be
able for viewing next week at LOC.gov/teachers.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.580
So if you miss anything, or
you have friends who say wow,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.710
I wish I could have heard that,
direct them to that recording.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.490
We're also live Tweeting,
and if you care to follow it,

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.210 position:70%
the information for that is up on the screen.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.830 position:72%
The last thing I need to tell you before I
mute myself and turn it over to Dr. Stripling,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.970 position:67%
is that we will be collecting questions for
a Q and A the last 10 minutes of this time.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.580 position:67%
So if you have questions for Dr. Stripling,
please enter them into the chat box

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.170
and we'll get to those at
the end of the session.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.820
Thank you, so much, and Dr.
Stripling, this is all you now.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.710
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'm so glad to be
with all of you all today.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:18.350 position:66%
What we're talking about today is
provoking inquiry through primary sources,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.270
and I'm not talking about
just supporting inquire.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.750 position:56%
I'm talking about provoking inquiry.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.880 position:59%
But any time we start something that's
this important, we need to ask why.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.030
Why do we do inquiry?

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.460
Certainly inquiry is driven by
our own passion and commitment,

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.610 position:67%
but we need to convey that to our students.

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.340
And I will tell you that I came
by this passion very honestly.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.850 position:61%
Some of you may have heard me talk
about the brown bear is brown syndrome.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.470
When I was a school librarian,
a fledgling school librarian,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.780 position:70%
I noticed that my students had developed what
I called the brown bear is brown syndrome.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:11.470 position:66%
First of all, if they had to do a research
project of any kind, they picked a topic

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.680 position:64%
that they didn't really care a lot about,

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.060
because they didn't want to
invest too much time in it.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.340 position:73%
and they preferred to pick something that they
already knew about, because why would they want

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.670
to go through the effort
of learning anything new.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.470 position:64%
And then they would come into the library

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.440 position:75%
and they would grab the easiest source they
could find, often it was a general encyclopedia.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.920 position:67%
And they would grab the B volume and
unfortunately it was B for brown, not bear.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.930 position:63%
Eventually they would find the brown
bear, and then they would start copying.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.190
The brown bear is brown.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.860
Well, I decided from that moment
that it was not good enough for me

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:04.680
to just let kids copy information,
and this has become my career.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:16.300 position:56%
But I want to build from information
to knowledge and to understanding.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:22.660
But really understanding is
based on gathering information.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:28.810 position:69%
But we have to transform it, and we have to
teach students to build on that information,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.250 position:56%
to bring it into their own knowledge
so that it's internally connected

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.510
to what they already know, and then
to arrive at a deep understanding

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.530
so they can apply it to entirely
different subjects.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.360
I developed a model of inquiry,
which some of you may have seen.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.720
I'm not going to spend a lot of
time on that, but what I find is

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:04.340 position:75%
that most students do much better when they
have an idea of the process that they need to go

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.170 position:67%
through to achieve that deep understanding.

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:13.450 position:61%
We know that any time we learn, we need
to connect to what do we already know?

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.900 position:64%
What is background information that
gives me a context for this new learning?

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.840
And then, what questions do I have?

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.440 position:56%
That's the beauty of inquiry, that
it's based on the student questions.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.460
Certainly investigate is important.

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.540 position:56%
And we know that our job is to teach
thinking skills during investigation

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.080 position:75%
so they're not just grabbing up any information.

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:44.140 position:72%
But then the magical stage of construct, where
students are expected to construct new ideas,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:49.910 position:59%
to pull the evidence together, to find
patterns, to form their own opinions

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.280 position:69%
and base it on the evidence they have found.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.990
Apply that information and express,
in a new way, create a product,

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.100
this is where the creative thinking
is built on the critical thinking.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.900 position:64%
And allow them to make that information
their own and express it to someone else.

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.280 position:66%
And finally, to reflect on their learning.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.250
What do they know now that
they didn't know before?

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:23.350 position:70%
If we can lead students through this process,
we actually can build great understanding

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:29.320
and we have even greater, hmm,
the slide is not coming through,

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.810 position:73%
so I will just tell you what was on this slide.

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:41.050 position:58%
What we find is that students build
great engagement through the inquiry.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:50.240 position:75%
And they understand the content in a way that
they didn't before, that they develop the skills

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:57.850 position:56%
so that they can learn independently
forever, for any subject.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.520
And, so then, next [inaudible]
the final impact is

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:07.300
that inquiry based learning
actually allows our students

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:12.890 position:63%
to engage, to connect and to understand.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.010
So the next big question that
we have to arrive at is why?

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:26.520 position:58%
Why are we saying that we can
provoke inquiry with primary sources?

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.770 position:70%
Why do we use primary sources during inquiry?

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:38.340 position:73%
Now all of us are celebrating the fact that the
Library of Congress, and so many other places,

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:44.940 position:72%
are making valuable primary sources
available at our fingertips in every classroom

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.740 position:63%
across the country and across the world.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:52.330
We have opportunities now
that we have never had before.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:58.030
So let's figure out why we want to
use primary sources during inquiry.

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.470
What's that going to do for us?

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:05.060
Well, I'm going to talk about three
main aspects that make the use

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:09.020
of primary sources so valuable
to provoke inquiry.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:16.820 position:67%
First of all, primary sources create an
intellectual space for student exploration.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:21.890
Students have that room to
grow and think and discover.

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:27.970 position:61%
The second, is that they form an
authentic connection to the real world.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:35.090 position:64%
And then authentic integration of inquiry
skills into the way that they learn.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.370 position:75%
And the third thing that I wanted to mention is,

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:44.840
how the use of primary sources
enables the development of empathy.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.750 position:69%
For me, that's pretty much of a bottom line.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:53.340
I want my students to be able
to empathize with others.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:58.210
And that can be achieved
through primary sources.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:04.570 position:69%
So let's look at the first aspect, that
primary sources create an intellectual space

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:07.320
for student exploration.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:11.630
And I decided to pick an example,
just because it's easier to connect

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.990 position:59%
to something when you have an example.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:19.980
So I decided to pick woman's
suffrage for a number of reasons,

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:23.460
but one is that there are
many perspectives on that.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:28.200 position:66%
And that is actually the skill that I
want to talk about, that we would develop.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:35.120 position:72%
So if I were doing a unit on woman's suffrage,
I often start with the background, you know,

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:38.480 position:63%
the connect, the background information.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:47.300 position:75%
I've condensed it here, but what we need to know
is that women didn't have the right to vote and,

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:56.210 position:72%
but they started this push for enfranchisement
in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:03.640 position:59%
After the Civil War, they increasingly
advocated for the right to vote

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:08.700 position:56%
and became louder and joined forces.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:15.600
But not until August 16, 1920
was the 19th Amendment passed

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.420 position:66%
that granted the ballot to American women.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:24.960
So get the context of the
time and how it was achieved.

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:28.600
And remember, 1920.

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.190
So that's a connection.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:37.640 position:59%
But what we're going to do then, is to
look at a couple of primary sources,

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:41.890
with the idea of thinking
about what inquiry questions?

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.890 position:67%
We're talking about the intellectual space.

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:52.430 position:69%
So how do the primary sources, then, provoke
us to ask interesting inquiry questions.

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:58.790 position:75%
The Library of Congress has provided a wonderful
primary source analysis tool that starts

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:07.450 position:73%
with observation, leads to reflection, and
that's inference, it's what is your own opinion

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:12.010
about that, what does your
observation make you think of?

00:11:12.010 --> 00:11:17.280 position:58%
And finally, to come up with some
questions that you might want to ask.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:22.020 position:70%
So we're going to short circuit this a little
bit, and I'm going to show you a couple

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:29.800 position:66%
of sources on woman's suffrage and we'll
just work through the process a little bit

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.280
to see how it opens up the
space for questioning.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:38.540 position:75%
Because all the information isn't already there.

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:42.620 position:59%
This particular photo comes from 1917.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:49.010
Now remember, woman's suffrage came
through the 19th Amendment in 1920.

00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:57.360 position:72%
So this is part of the campaign that women
conducted across the country for their rights.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:07.160 position:70%
Notice the Kaiser Wilson, just point out that
one observation and think about the context

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:13.670
of World War I and what Kaiser
meant to people at that time.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:18.060
So I'll give you just a moment to
think about what do you see there?

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:22.890 position:72%
And what do you think about when you see that?

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:25.910
And what questions do you have?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:48.880 position:70%
The second primary source on woman's suffrage
that I wanted to show you is from 1925,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.930 position:56%
five years after the 19th Amendment.

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:57.970
We know this is the roaring 20's.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:06.420 position:61%
And, again, what is it that you observe
and what do you think about that

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:10.120
in the context of woman's suffrage?

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:13.970 position:70%
And what questions does it make you think of?

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.550 position:64%
I don't know, let's see, I guess I could.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.620 position:61%
I'm assuming that you all are writing
down questions and thinking about them.

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.380
When we get to the questions,
ah yes, great question,

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:51.030
is that a flask in the back
pocket of the second woman?

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:55.070
And yes, it is, actually.

00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:01.730
But, what kind of a question
does that lead you to?

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:08.550 position:59%
If women have changed and are carrying
flasks around, what does that mean

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:13.320 position:63%
that woman's suffrage caused in society?

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:23.030
What kinds of changes emanated
from this idea of woman's suffrage

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.570
and women having the right to vote.

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:36.940 position:70%
I think you can see that if you offered these
primary sources and you have enough time

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:43.890 position:66%
to have a conversation with your students
about the whole context of the time period

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:47.220 position:56%
and the context of woman's suffrage,

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:53.130
your kids would get pretty excited,
because there's not ext here.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:57.220
They're going to have to
investigate, what's going on here?

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.520
How did women change?

00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:03.000
Is this a typical representation?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.840 position:73%
And what did that mean for the way men reacted?

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:11.310 position:73%
Were they sorry that the 19th Amendment passed?

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:20.310 position:67%
And so, I think, by starting with primary
sources that what you're able to do is fill

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:25.930
in the gaps with student questions.

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:29.360
And ll of the sudden, the
questions are their own.

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.990 position:72%
They're not just asking who, what, when, where
questions that they could capture in text,

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:42.060 position:72%
but they're really asking why and how and yes.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:51.480 position:73%
You all are getting right into point of view,
and the point of view of the cartoonist as well

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.000
as the point of view of people
living at that time.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.980 position:59%
So I think it's extremely interesting
to start and to provoke kid's thinking

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:11.640 position:72%
by giving them just enough information through
a primary source that there is space for them

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:18.790 position:72%
to come up with their own questions, their
own piece that they're interested in pursuing.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:30.660 position:56%
The next piece that I wanted to talk
about is the idea of primary sources

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:40.560 position:69%
as an authentic connection to the real world
and authentic integration of inquiry skills.

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:51.570 position:67%
Now, to me, authentic means that it is real
life, but it also means that it's complex.

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:57.250 position:67%
Because we know real life, there's not just
one right answer, there's not just one way

00:16:57.250 --> 00:17:03.200
to interpret something, not
just one source of information.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:13.340 position:69%
And it's amazingly complex as we live in our
authentic life, and then sometimes history,

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:19.210
for example, gets boiled down to
three causes for the Civil War.

00:17:19.210 --> 00:17:25.350 position:66%
But we know it's much more complex than
that, and we can bring out that complexity

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:32.880 position:59%
by giving a variety of primary sources
showing different perspectives.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:41.210 position:70%
Through primary sources, we can show that it
wasn't bottled down into three bullet points.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:50.770 position:75%
But another piece, which is almost the opposite
side, which drives kids to do even more inquiry,

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:56.370 position:59%
is that they may not understand what's
going on, because they lack a context.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:01.940
And so they are driven to figure
out, well what is going on here?

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:10.980 position:66%
I see this photo, I see this document, but
what's the context that this occurred in?

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:16.930 position:63%
And, of course, the best part of this is
that there's not just one right answer.

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:20.840 position:58%
I will tell you that my experience is

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:27.930 position:56%
that sometimes the best students
need the most practice with inquiry.

00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:35.750 position:58%
Because they are used to finding that
best answer, that one right answer,

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:41.960 position:66%
and they're so good at it that it's very
frustrating to them that we turn it around

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:48.880 position:73%
and say you discover what you think is the best
right answer and defend it with the evidence

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.930
that you'd find and that's
what we want you to do.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:59.150 position:64%
They're so used to getting an A on a test
because they're spouting back the answer

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:02.940 position:61%
that their teacher wanted them to give.

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:08.320 position:61%
There's a, it's a really a
transformation of the learning process.

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:15.290 position:58%
And very much more authentic, because
in real life, they are going to have

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:20.980 position:59%
to discover their own answers and find
evidence to help them form opinions.

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:25.480
Another way that primary
sources bring authenticity is

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:31.250 position:70%
by providing access to multiple perspectives.

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:40.460 position:70%
We know, and our kids understand that the
real world everybody has a slightly different

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.260 position:75%
opinion, and we have reasons for those opinions.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:51.980
Often those opinions are
conflicting with one another.

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:58.980 position:63%
We can determine that people have a
specific point of view and that actually

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:05.820 position:69%
when you have a specific point of view, that
causes you to put a slant on information,

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:08.630 position:66%
to interpret it in a certain way, to leave

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:13.190
out certain information or
to add certain information.

00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:16.550
That is so valuable for our
students to understand.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:24.270 position:72%
And we can do that by presenting them
multiple perspectives through primary sources.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:31.690
So I'm going to give us an example
of that and see how it works.

00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:37.990 position:58%
These are four different perspectives
from the woman's suffrage movement.

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:40.420
And I've bolded the main idea.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:44.790 position:66%
And I think you'll be able to see the four
different points of view pretty easily.

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:52.690 position:72%
This is Reverend Anna H. Shaw, and she said by
perfect equality of opportunities, privileges,

00:20:52.690 --> 00:21:01.360 position:58%
and responsibilities of man, that's
how we conserve the ability of women.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.940
Perfect equality.

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:08.060
The first symbol and seal of
inequality is in franchisement.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.450 position:67%
I think the perspective is very clear here.

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:15.560 position:61%
But then we have Miss Margaret
Dongardner [assumed spelling] who says,

00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:24.530 position:69%
has it occurred to you why man so frequently
breaks the law and women so infrequently?

00:21:24.530 --> 00:21:29.690
It's because the law chiefly
concerns the affairs of men,

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:36.430 position:61%
and that this is an excellent reason
why men should have the making of laws.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:43.470 position:56%
Someone else who lived at that time,
John Macy, let us be done forever

00:21:43.470 --> 00:21:46.800
with this nonsense about
the equality of the sexes.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.870 position:72%
They are not equal in nature and never can be.

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.520
Now, of course, I've excerpted this
and there are longer arguments,

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:58.390 position:66%
but that's the crux of what he was saying.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:05.590 position:59%
And Mrs. Pankhurst said, is this whole
woman's suffrage movement worthwhile?

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:11.490 position:64%
Some of us think it is worth dying for
if it is going to give future generations

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:16.670 position:69%
for all time the right to govern themselves.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:26.200 position:73%
Well, think how interesting it would be to
present excerpts of four different perspectives

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:36.430 position:70%
and allow your students to see the difference
of the effect of those perspectives.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:43.020 position:67%
And one way that I do that, actually, in my
own teaching is to give a graphic organizer

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:49.980 position:69%
where they have to capture the essence of
perspective and why that is the perspective.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:57.060 position:56%
And then a different perspective and
why that's that perspective arose.

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.200 position:58%
I think it really helps students when
they actually have to write down,

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:06.640 position:75%
evaluate and compare the different perspectives.

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:13.110 position:66%
It's a great way to provoke thinking and
to get them to the authentic understanding

00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:17.670 position:64%
of the effects of different perspectives.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:21.480 position:66%
Another graphic organizer that I might use

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:26.320
at this point is how do you draw
conclusions from information?

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:28.380
Certainly there are facts.

00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:34.610 position:69%
But already we saw that primary sources are
a combination of facts, of what you observe,

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:40.990
what you actually see in the text
or the photo or video or whatever,

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:44.120 position:59%
and then the inferences that you make.

00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.630
Both can have value.

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.210 position:66%
Students need to understand the difference

00:23:49.210 --> 00:23:54.180
and how both contribute,
then, to drawing a conclusion.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:24:00.090 position:66%
It's a pretty exciting way to draw them
into the thinking process and then be able

00:24:00.090 --> 00:24:05.400
to see their thinking process
through graphic organizers.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:11.020 position:66%
So whenever we're doing it, we would think
about what other skills would we teach?

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:15.140
Not that you'd have to teach
skills at ever phase of inquiries.

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:20.660 position:63%
Sometimes you scaffold it, sometimes you
just supply sources or whatever else.

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:27.230 position:61%
But picking out two or three
essential skills that you want to focus

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:32.610
on for a particular unit allows
the students to go deeply into it

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:37.940
and to develop those essential
and authentic skills.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:46.550 position:63%
And the last thing that I wanted to talk
about was the development of empathy.

00:24:46.550 --> 00:24:52.960 position:75%
Now I'm particularly interesting in this aspect.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:57.420
I did my doctoral work, as
you heard, I just did it,

00:24:57.420 --> 00:25:02.420
so that's proof that it's never
too late to get your doctorate.

00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:10.560 position:66%
But what I've researched was the use of
primary sources during historical inquiry.

00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:20.380 position:69%
And I had the opportunity to go into
humanities block classrooms in New York City

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:25.230 position:61%
where they were studying slave
narratives in both their social studies

00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:28.690 position:66%
and their English language arts classroom.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:33.660
And so they were related, what
they did in the two classrooms.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.690 position:56%
Now what I told the teachers, as any
time you do research you don't want

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:44.380 position:75%
to tell them what you want to find out at the
beginning, so what I told them was I was looking

00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:49.160
at their use of primary sources
during historical inquiry,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:55.610 position:58%
and indeed I observed the classes for
a month and dug into it very deeply.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:05.620 position:70%
What I was really looking at, though, was did
primary sources enable to develop empathy.

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:13.230 position:61%
Now this was particularly interesting
because most of the kids were of color.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:21.390
There were only three white high
school students in those classes.

00:26:21.390 --> 00:26:30.880 position:75%
And one of them was from Russia, so it wasn't
even from, she was a recent immigrant, actually,

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.990 position:58%
although her English was pretty good.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:40.370 position:73%
So it was interesting, they were studying slave
narratives, could they actually develop empathy

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:44.100 position:67%
for the slave owners as well as the slaves?

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:52.320 position:75%
And it was a good test to see if primary sources
helped leverage the development of empathy.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:27:00.010 position:63%
So let's just go back a little bit and
talk a little bit about what empathy is.

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:05.330 position:56%
Sometimes it's confused with
sympathy, feeling sorry for someone.

00:27:05.330 --> 00:27:11.550
But really, empathy is the ability
to make sense of what someone did,

00:27:11.550 --> 00:27:17.840
a decision that somebody made, a
perspective that somebody held,

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:24.890 position:61%
and action that somebody took, based
on the actual context of the situation.

00:27:24.890 --> 00:27:32.490 position:61%
Can you understand why that person made
that decision or performed that action,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:37.760 position:66%
even though you may not agree with it,
but you understand the pressures that were

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.620 position:72%
on that person and why that decision was made.

00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:54.690 position:69%
It's a very important aspect, I think, of
the dispositional learning for our students.

00:27:54.690 --> 00:28:05.010 position:75%
It is my hope that inquiry will be a way in to
help them develop the attitudes and dispositions

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:11.600 position:63%
that enable them to participate actively
in the world, to understand others,

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:20.120
to keep on learning, to understand
the human connection of learning.

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:29.910 position:67%
And so I'm finding that empathy is even
more important than I ever realized it was,

00:28:29.910 --> 00:28:39.450
when I think about social media and
about connections across the globe.

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:47.590 position:67%
One of the issues with social media is
that our students are reading Twitter feeds

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:57.640 position:66%
and grabbing short blog entries, etcetera,
from places that are beyond the scope

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.520 position:56%
of the context that they understand.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:07.550
And they're making judgments
without understanding the context.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:13.110 position:59%
So this is something we really need to
help students understand what it means

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:19.710
to really empathize and not just
make judgments or sympathize.

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:26.890 position:70%
And I also find important when we have access

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:32.840
to so many other cultures
through our global connections.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:39.870 position:66%
I don't believe we can actually understand
other cultures unless we can empathize,

00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:46.190 position:64%
unless we can develop that deep
understanding that comes through empathy.

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:54.240 position:70%
And so it's not just the primary sources, but
it's understanding how to use primary sources

00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:00.600
to develop empathy that I think
is important for our students.

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:06.720
There's another reason why I
think empathy is so important.

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:15.570 position:63%
Students honestly cannot really know
themselves until they understand others.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:25.330 position:73%
That by stretching themselves to understand why
others made a decision in a particular context,

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:31.980 position:66%
that enables them to understand themselves
and why they make their own decisions.

00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:36.600 position:59%
Now I don't know how many of you all
are working with high school students,

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:43.720 position:73%
but I wold say that middle school and high
school students, that's what they're all about.

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.360
They need to understand themselves.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:56.020 position:61%
And when we can use primary sources and
inquiry to provide a way in for them

00:30:56.020 --> 00:31:02.490
to understand themselves and
others, that's pretty powerful.

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:09.240 position:56%
There are a couple of kinds of
empathy that we need to be aware of.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:16.710 position:72%
And the first is cognitive empathy, and that's
really, largely what I've been talking about,

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.610 position:63%
certainly with the slave narrative unit.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:25.910 position:59%
They had to start out by understanding
what was the economic climate,

00:31:25.910 --> 00:31:33.570 position:73%
what was the political climate, what were the
forces that drove both slaves and slave owners,

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:42.860 position:61%
the facts and the context, the
cognitive pieces that surrounded those,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:46.060 position:56%
the decisions that all of them made.

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:53.220
And our students needed, then, to
find the multiple perspectives.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:58.130
At some point they needed to
read things from slave owners,

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:02.040 position:72%
they needed to not just read slave narratives,

00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:07.520
but to get that other side, or
those other sides, actually.

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:14.130 position:70%
And one of the things that was so interesting
that the teacher did was to pull quotes

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:23.430 position:75%
from Thomas Jefferson over a series of year, and
to see how the perspective of Thomas Jefferson

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:31.760 position:70%
on slavery changed based on the context, the
political climate and the pressures that were

00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:36.100
on him at those different points.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:43.010 position:70%
That cognitive ability to put them into a
time line, to understand all the other pieces

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:49.040
that were in play, was pretty
important for the students.

00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:56.740 position:69%
And they actually did develop empathy for
the slave owners, and it was very much a lot

00:32:56.740 --> 00:33:02.390
of it was based in this cognitive
understanding of the political

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:07.400
and economic climate of the time.

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:13.470
But there, and cognitive empathy is
actually the first type of empathy

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:17.620
that I think we are responsible
for helping our students develop.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:26.860 position:75%
It's so easy to blend that in as we use primary
sources to help our teachers use primary sources

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:33.060
in their units, no matter
what subject they're in.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:40.250
There is another side to empathy,
and some people discount it,

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:45.390
and other people think this is what
empathy means, is that you just,

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.390 position:59%
you understand the feelings of people.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:56.670 position:67%
But really a motive does mean the feelings,
but if you've started with the cognitive,

00:33:56.670 --> 00:34:01.630
you have the facts and the
evidence to start out with,

00:34:01.630 --> 00:34:09.020
and then you can understand
also how that made people feel.

00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:18.530 position:66%
Now I will say that very often, in school,
my experience, what I usually have done

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:27.530 position:66%
when I have used primary sources, is I
have just paid attention to the cognitive.

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:35.990 position:72%
What were people doing, and why did they do
that, and do we understand their perspectives?

00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:40.760 position:61%
I didn't ever really give kids a chance

00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:48.020
to at least imagine what people
were feeling at that time.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:53.080
And there's really a lot for
our students to understand.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:56.050 position:72%
Now we have to be careful that they don't jump

00:34:56.050 --> 00:35:00.780
over into sympathy and oh,
well, I feel so sorry.

00:35:00.780 --> 00:35:03.280 position:56%
That's not what we're talking about.

00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:12.490 position:63%
But if you base it on cognitive first,
you can get students to understand what,

00:35:12.490 --> 00:35:14.890 position:58%
and they're really making inferences.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:19.590 position:61%
Sometimes you can find actual text that
lets you know what people are feeling,

00:35:19.590 --> 00:35:26.630 position:67%
but sometimes students are making inference
based on the evidence that they see.

00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:34.770 position:75%
But it adds a whole other layer to
understanding why people made certain decisions.

00:35:34.770 --> 00:35:37.040
I think it's worthwhile to do this.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:45.430 position:69%
I think it's also very useful for students
to understand that they need to have reasons

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:51.130
for decisions that they make
themselves, but also to recognize

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:55.710
that they have emotional reactions
to things and to recognize

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.970
that that also impacts the
way that we all behave.

00:36:02.170 --> 00:36:09.370 position:58%
One of the examples that is recent,
that shows the importance of context,

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:15.690 position:59%
of understanding what was going on
for the development of empathy, arose,

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:22.960 position:66%
it really hit home with me when I saw some
of the early videos about the common core,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:32.670 position:75%
where the example was that we would use Martin
Luther King Jr.'s letter from a Birmingham jail.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:39.960 position:56%
And what was stressed in all of the
videos I saw, and the model lessons,

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:45.820
was that students needed to do
close reading of this letter

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:49.130 position:61%
and not pay attention to anything else.

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:55.540 position:63%
That the meaning was held in the text
and we needed to hold them to that text.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:04.780 position:72%
Well, my librarian brain immediately went, um,
no, because I know how important context is.

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:11.030 position:73%
And I started thinking about all the things
that our kids would need to understand in order

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:19.280
to understand the impact and the
whole rationale for this letter.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:25.440 position:63%
They would need to understand the lunch
counter sit ins, and not only the facts,

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:30.680
but also what were those young
people thinking and feeling

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.380 position:69%
when they were sitting at the lunch counter?

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.730
They need to understand the
whole realm of the 1960s.

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:39.090
What was going on?

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:43.700 position:58%
Very different time, and our students
won't understand that necessarily,

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.650 position:59%
unless we help them have that context.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:51.040
If they don't know anything
about the Civil Rights Movement,

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:58.440 position:59%
there's no way that they can actually
understand anything about this letter.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:03.390
The Mississippi Freedom Summer,
the Montgomery Bus Boycott.

00:38:03.390 --> 00:38:11.280 position:70%
Now you can't do everything, but I would
pick some of the pivotal context jewel items,

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:18.150 position:56%
and make sure that students could
understand this primary source based

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:20.940 position:59%
on their understanding of the context.

00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:28.020 position:70%
And what we'll find is that they then develop
a much deeper sense of what was going on.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:33.590 position:66%
And they develop empathy for all the
players here, not just Martin Luther King,

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:43.510 position:64%
but some of these other clergy men, maybe
even the police who put him in jail.

00:38:45.730 --> 00:38:52.400
We have a role to mediate
this development of empathy.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:58.580
And I've listed some of the
strategies that we can use.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:06.460 position:72%
You all have your own strategies and we
develop those over time, certainly questioning

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.800 position:66%
where we probe, what students are thinking

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:17.270
and help them ask critical
questions of the text or the photo.

00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:22.890 position:63%
One of the pieces that I wanted to point
out that turns out to be very important,

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:29.110 position:58%
a lot of times we poo poo the idea of
vocabulary and how important it is,

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:32.940 position:59%
but I encountered some primary sources

00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:39.280
that have what you might call
politically incorrect vocabulary.

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:47.200 position:70%
And one of them was available, it was a photo
available through the New York Public Library

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:57.030 position:58%
and the caption of the photo of
people in the photo was Idiot Asylum.

00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:59.600
And I find that very offensive.

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:07.540 position:75%
However, what I had to recognize is that was the
common vocabulary that was used at that time.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:16.470
And it was not meant to inflict
horrible political incorrectness.

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:22.310 position:56%
Our students need to understand that
language changes over time and that

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:27.900
when they're encountering
primary sources from other eras,

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:34.500 position:59%
they may actually encounter something,
and that's part of developing empathy,

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:40.240 position:58%
is understanding the context of the
time and how that vocabulary was used

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.670 position:72%
in that time, and what was really meant by it.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:47.170
So that's just one of the
mediation things that we may find

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:51.480 position:70%
that we really have to help students develop.

00:40:52.890 --> 00:40:59.940
So we need to probably end with
so why, why do we provoke inquiry

00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:06.060 position:73%
with primary sources and use secondary sources?

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.770 position:64%
And the answer, I think, is in all of us.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:12.620
I think we all develop a passion.

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.040 position:70%
The passion is, of course, based on students.

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:23.970 position:66%
It is enabling and empowering our students
to reach the highest levels that they can

00:41:23.970 --> 00:41:28.580 position:70%
through their own independent investigations.

00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:36.180 position:64%
I have one example that I wanted to share
that was so profound for me that I just,

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:43.400 position:67%
I can't put it aside, because to me it
encapsulated every reason why we would want

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:50.060 position:61%
to provoke inquiry and enable our kids.

00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:57.220 position:70%
I was in an elementary library in New York
City that had been renovated through a grant,

00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:02.550
sitting next to a second grade boy
who was there for the celebration.

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:08.270 position:63%
We were making small talk before the
celebration started and he turned to me,

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.370 position:67%
I said hi or something, and he turned to me

00:42:11.370 --> 00:42:16.370
and he said ask me anything
about American presidents.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.350
And I went uh, okay.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.840
It took me aback a little.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.960
And he said, I've read every book
in the library on U.S. Presidents.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.600 position:61%
You can ask me anything, I'm an expert.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.310
And I thought, that's it.

00:42:32.310 --> 00:42:35.630
That's exactly why I do inquiry.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:42.360
I want every one of my students to
feel like he or she is an expert.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.810 position:66%
So I think we now have time for questions.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:54.590 position:73%
I would, oh, I just wanted to give you one link
of, we have developed a continuum of skills

00:42:54.590 --> 00:43:01.320
in New York that has a lot of these
inquiry skills, and it's organized

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:05.810 position:75%
by inquiry phases, that you may want to go into.

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:09.810
There are graphic organizers
already done in Word

00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:12.740 position:69%
for the priority skills at each grade level.

00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:18.720
And you should feel free to come in
and adapt or adopt or pick anything

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.140 position:66%
that you want and use it however you want.

00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.960
So now we have time for questions.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.560
&gt;&gt; Thanks so much, Barbara.

00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:30.760
This is Cheryl again.

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.250
I have been harvesting questions.

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:40.730 position:66%
And Margaret asked if you can identify any
resources, particularly charts or tables,

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:47.820 position:70%
that show developmentally, what would inquiry
look like as students moved from kindergarten

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:51.360
through fifth grade, so looking at
the inquiry in the lower grades.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:56.120 position:69%
I'm going to mute myself and let you answer.

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:04.250 position:72%
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think we wall struggle with it,
and the idea is that we don't put off inquiry,

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:07.920 position:58%
that you can start it in first grade.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:15.890 position:56%
I recommend that information fluency
continuum that I just showed you

00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:19.060
at that link, it is K through 12.

00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:23.300 position:72%
And so we tried to define the specific skills.

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:30.510 position:66%
But I'll give you an example of, first
grader, and I was working with a librarian

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:35.780 position:73%
who was doing an authored unit with the
students, and they were talking about the books

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:40.780
and one of them was, one of the
authors was Patricia Polacco.

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.250 position:61%
So she had read for two or three weeks,

00:44:44.250 --> 00:44:48.870
a book by Patricia Polacco,
and they would talk about it.

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:52.470
And about the third week,
shes tarted reading the story

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:58.330 position:72%
and one little first grader said wait a
minute, and he went running over to the shelf,

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:02.500 position:58%
pulled off the book they had read the
week before, went through the book

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:08.470 position:61%
and he said, here, it's the same quilt.

00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:11.360
And she said well, yes, great.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:19.970
And he said why is this quilt
faded and the other one isn't.

00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:25.480
Now that's an example of inquiry
in action, at first grade.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:31.030
And so she kind of waited,
and he said, I know why.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:38.190 position:56%
She's trying to tell us that we need
to tell the stories of our families

00:45:38.190 --> 00:45:41.830
or they will fade like the quilt.

00:45:41.830 --> 00:45:49.590 position:66%
Now that's a first grader who's been given
permission to ask questions and to think

00:45:49.590 --> 00:45:56.330 position:64%
and it was provoked, actually, by a piece
of literature and by an author study.

00:45:56.330 --> 00:46:00.180 position:67%
So we don't always have to do inquiry units

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:05.230
to provoke the thinking that
is so valuable in inquiry.

00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:07.910 position:58%
And I think we build it up over time.

00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:13.390 position:58%
Certainly the idea of what do you see
and what does it make you think fits

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:17.350
with picture books all the way
through elementary schools.

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:22.460
So it doesn't just have to
be around academic subjects.

00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:27.820 position:66%
&gt;&gt; We have time for just one more
question before we need to wrap things up.

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:34.930 position:75%
There is a survey on the slide, because I ask
the question, if you are really needing to dash,

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:39.420 position:56%
if you would take a moment to answer
the three questions on this survey.

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:45.420
We have a special survey for each
session, so take a moment to answer

00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:49.030 position:70%
for this what you learned from Dr. Stripling.

00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:57.090 position:67%
And the last question that we have time for
today asks how, if you've given any thought

00:46:57.090 --> 00:47:04.230 position:66%
to how Carol [Inaudible] and others guided
inquiry model fits with your approach?

00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:06.560
&gt;&gt; It fits very well.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.230
Carol and I have talked a lot.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:09.610
We've talked for years.

00:47:09.610 --> 00:47:15.150
We've been colleagues for, I don't
know, I don't want to say how long.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.670
Yes. It's very much the same.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:24.410 position:67%
One of the pieces that Carol adds that I
actually have come to very much appreciate,

00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:27.500
is the emotional aspect to inquiry.

00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:30.040
And I think it's really important
that we think about that.

00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:37.340 position:73%
There are pieces during the inquiry cycle when
students get really down, they get overwhelmed,

00:47:37.340 --> 00:47:41.040
and we need to pay attention
to that and to support them.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:47.150 position:67%
But also, the whole guided inquiry approach
means that we're working with teachers

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:52.540 position:63%
and we are developing this together,
and you don't just throw it at somebody,

00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:57.320
but that you can build this over
time, and build a whole program

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.820 position:70%
that integrates inquiry throughout the school

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:05.230
and supports the collaboration
between teachers and librarians.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.460
I think it's a wonderful model.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.990
&gt;&gt; One last time, I think
I've said this a dozen times.

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:12.040
Thank you so much.

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:16.340
Thanks to the participants, for the
lengthy participation in the chat.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:20.520
Thank you, Dr. Stripling,
for sharing your wisdom.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:26.200 position:75%
And the last thing I need to say to you to wrap
this up, is again, a plea that you take a minute

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.230 position:58%
to answer this three question survey.

00:48:29.230 --> 00:48:33.870
We have a special survey
monkey link for each session

00:48:33.870 --> 00:48:38.040
and it does help us shape future
programmings, to get your input.

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:43.350 position:73%
Also, for completing this session, you have
earned a certificate for one instructional hour

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:50.110 position:75%
and you will receive an email within 5 business
days with directions to access that certificate.

00:48:50.110 --> 00:48:52.140
So, thank you very much.

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:55.880
I am going to end this meeting now.

00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.920
Again, thank you so much.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.980
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
