00:00:00.423 --> 00:00:02.060
- [Voiceover] The polynomial expression,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:07.060
36 y to the third minus
100y can be factored as

00:00:07.494 --> 00:00:10.373
4y times all of this,

00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:13.519
My plus g, times My minus g,

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.016
where M and g are integers.

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:18.419
Sally wrote that g could be equal to 3.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.821
Brandon wrote that g could be equal to 10.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.317
Which student is correct?

00:00:24.317 --> 00:00:26.325
Now, when you look at this,
it seems really daunting,

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:27.951
all this M's and g's here,

00:00:27.951 --> 00:00:30.516
but we just need to realize
that they're factoring out,

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:33.419
first they factored out a
4y from the 36y to the third

00:00:33.419 --> 00:00:35.857
minus 100y, and it looks
like whatever's left

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:38.260
is a difference of squares,
which they then factor

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.386
even further.

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:41.720
So I encourage you to pause
the video and just factor

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.986
this out as much as you can.

00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:44.820
First factoring out a 4y,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.782
and then we can think
about what g is going to be

00:00:46.782 --> 00:00:50.985
equal to, or whether Sally
or Brandon is correct.

00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:53.725
So, then now let's work
through this together.

00:00:53.725 --> 00:00:55.722
So, if we look at,

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.521
if we look at this
expression right over here,

00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:00.087
we want to factor out a 4y,

00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:04.510
so 36y to the third

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.250
minus 100y,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.887
that's the same thing as,

00:01:08.887 --> 00:01:12.289
36y to the third is the same thing as 4y

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:14.356
times, let's see,

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:19.127
4y times 9y squared,

00:01:19.127 --> 00:01:20.428
right?

00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:22.587
Because 4 times 9 is 36,

00:01:22.587 --> 00:01:25.455
and y times y squared is y to the third,

00:01:25.455 --> 00:01:27.788
so all I did to get the
9y squared is I divided

00:01:27.788 --> 00:01:31.887
36 by 4 to get the 9, and
I divided y to the third

00:01:31.887 --> 00:01:34.580
by the y to get y squared,

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.494
so if you factor out a 4y,
you're left with 9y squared

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:39.991
for that first term, and then,

00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:42.173
for the second term, let's see,

00:01:42.173 --> 00:01:43.857
if we, we're going to subtract,

00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:46.724
if we factor out a 4y again,

00:01:46.724 --> 00:01:49.290
what's left over?

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.448
100 divided by 4 is 25,

00:01:52.448 --> 00:01:57.448
and then y divided by y

00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:00.993
is just 1, so we're left with a 25 here.

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:03.454
So just to be clear what's going on,

00:02:03.454 --> 00:02:05.393
this 36y to the third,

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:09.190
I just rewrote it as 4y times 9y squared.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.523
One way to think about it
is I wrote it with the 4y

00:02:11.523 --> 00:02:14.553
factored out, and then,

00:02:14.553 --> 00:02:16.725
the 100y, right over here,

00:02:16.725 --> 00:02:19.627
I wrote it with the 4y factored out,

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:22.053
so it's 4y times 25,

00:02:22.053 --> 00:02:24.294
and now it's very clear
that we can factor out 4y

00:02:24.294 --> 00:02:26.291
from this entire thing,

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:28.160
so we can factor out,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.179
you can think of it as
undistributing the 4y,

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:33.559
so this is going to be equal to

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:38.319
4y and what is left over?

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:40.560
Well, if you factor out a
4y out of this first term,

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.381
you're going to have a 9y squared,

00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:48.381
9y squared, and then minus 25,

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.424
and then we're going to
be left with minus 25,

00:02:53.424 --> 00:02:54.387
and when we write it like this,

00:02:54.387 --> 00:02:56.187
we see what we have in parentheses here.

00:02:56.187 --> 00:03:00.157
This is a difference of squares, and,

00:03:00.157 --> 00:03:02.120
we could skip a step, but
let me just rewrite it,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.360
so we could rewrite it as, literally,

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.788
a difference of squares.

00:03:05.788 --> 00:03:10.225
9y squared, that is the same thing as,

00:03:10.225 --> 00:03:14.660
that is the same thing as

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.619
3y, that whole thing to the 2nd power,

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.057
3 squared is 9, y squared is y squared,

00:03:21.057 --> 00:03:24.018
and then we have

00:03:24.018 --> 00:03:28.325
minus 25, we can rewrite as 5 squared,

00:03:28.325 --> 00:03:30.392
so you see, we have a
difference of squares,

00:03:30.392 --> 00:03:32.052
and we've seen this
pattern multiple times.

00:03:32.052 --> 00:03:33.724
If this is the first time you're
seeing it, I encourage you

00:03:33.724 --> 00:03:35.186
to watch the videos on Khan Academy

00:03:35.186 --> 00:03:39.552
on difference of squares, but
we know anything of the form,

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:44.552
anything of the form a
squared minus b squared,

00:03:44.887 --> 00:03:48.347
let me do it in that color,

00:03:48.347 --> 00:03:53.347
minus b squared can be
factored as being equal to,

00:03:53.387 --> 00:03:55.825
this is equal to, if I were
to write it as a product

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:58.054
of two binomials,

00:03:58.054 --> 00:03:59.958
this is going to be equal to

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:04.958
a plus b

00:04:06.448 --> 00:04:10.524
times a minus b,

00:04:10.524 --> 00:04:12.288
and you can verify that that works,

00:04:12.288 --> 00:04:13.925
if you've never seen this before,

00:04:13.925 --> 00:04:15.922
or you can watch those videos for review.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:18.790
So this right over here
can be rewritten as

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.228
4y, which we factored
out at the beginning,

00:04:21.228 --> 00:04:24.850
it's going to be times the
product of two binomials

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.522
for this part right over here,

00:04:26.522 --> 00:04:28.751
and so in this case, a is 3y,

00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:31.921
so it's going to be 3y
plus 5, times 3y minus 5,

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:33.651
so let me write that down.

00:04:33.651 --> 00:04:38.492
So 3y plus 5

00:04:38.492 --> 00:04:42.660
times 3y minus 5.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.660
3y minus 5.

00:04:49.556 --> 00:04:51.785
So now that we factored
this, let's go back to what

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:56.151
they originally told
us, so then we have 4y,

00:04:56.151 --> 00:05:00.853
so this 4y corresponds to
that 4y, right over there,

00:05:00.853 --> 00:05:04.684
and then you have My plus g,

00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:06.855
and then you have My minus g,

00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:09.792
so you could view the My,

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:11.592
the My's right over there,

00:05:11.592 --> 00:05:14.286
that's the 3y right over there,

00:05:14.286 --> 00:05:17.223
so we could say that M is equal to 3,

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:19.591
M is equal to 3,

00:05:19.591 --> 00:05:21.658
and then we do plus 5 and minus 5,

00:05:21.658 --> 00:05:24.990
plus g and minus g, so,

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.148
g, if we're pattern
matching right over here,

00:05:28.148 --> 00:05:30.957
g is going to be equal to 5.

00:05:30.957 --> 00:05:33.651
So g is equal to 5.

00:05:33.651 --> 00:05:35.520
So what's interesting about this problem

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.455
is that neither one of them

00:05:38.455 --> 00:05:42.117
are correct, so, I could write,

00:05:42.117 --> 00:05:44.184
neither is correct.

00:05:44.184 --> 00:05:47.260
G is equal to 5.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.706
That was a tricky one.
