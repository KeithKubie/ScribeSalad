00:00:00.005 --> 00:00:04.168
Here is our filled out table. Now, of course we don't want to be dependent on

00:00:04.168 --> 00:00:07.752
calculators for everything, but they certainly do come in handy when we have

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:13.233
calculations that end up giving us huge numbers, like 3,125. You can see this

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:18.190
only at a value of x equals 5. Imagine if I had given you even higher x values.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.251
Our numbers for h of x would have been huge. Some of these numbers you

00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:24.820
definitely could have figured out by hand or in your head. In fact, you

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.858
probably did. Though there might be some on this list you could have done that

00:00:27.858 --> 00:00:32.426
way, that you didn't realize. For example, when x equals negative 3, h of x is

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:39.202
5 to the negative 3. This is just equal to 1 over 5 to the 3rd. Five to the

00:00:39.202 --> 00:00:44.652
3rd, is 125. So, that's 1 over 125. So this is the fractional of this decimal

00:00:44.652 --> 00:00:48.853
over here. This answer is perfectly acceptable, as well. Although, it's

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:51.518
probably not what a calculator will give you, depending on what sort of device

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:56.152
you're using. We can see something similar happening for 5 to the negative 2.

00:00:56.152 --> 00:00:59.742
That's just 1 over 5 squared, or 1 over 25.
