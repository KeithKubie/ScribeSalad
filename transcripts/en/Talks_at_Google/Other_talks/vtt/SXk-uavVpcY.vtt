00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.790
GRACE: Awesome.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.810
I'm Grace.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.070
I just want to say thank
you so much for coming.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.430
We are so honored that
you guys are joining us.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.940
For obvious reasons,
we're really excited.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.360
I just wanted to
introduce myself.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.304
I am part of a Google
Christian Fellowship here.

00:00:24.304 --> 00:00:25.970
And this is actually
the very first time

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.410
we are ever co-hosting an event
with the Asian Google Network,

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.332
which Tiffany is a part of.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:33.930
TIFFANY SIU: Hi, everyone.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.840
I'm Tiffany.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm chair for the
Asian Google Network.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.100
Thank you so much for
joining us here today.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.240
We're really excited.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.380
I'm a product marketing manager
here on the Platforms Marketing

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.650
Team.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.350
So before we get
started, I just wanted

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.500
to let you guys know we will
have time at the end for a Q&amp;A.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.630
So you guys are welcome
to ask your questions.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.890
But just to be
respectful of time,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.520
please don't ask to take selfies
or anything just so we can

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.050
have everyone ask questions.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.430
We are running on a
really tight schedule.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.300
So thank you so much for
your cooperation on this.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.230
And so today interviewing
Jeremy, we have Marvin Chow.

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.690
Marvin is our VP
of Marketing here.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.783
So let's give them both a hand.

00:01:16.783 --> 00:01:19.248
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:23.574 --> 00:01:24.740
MARVIN CHOW: Thanks so much.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.410
Welcome, Jeremy.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.080
We're really excited
to have you here

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.510
as a part of the Google
Christian Fellowship,

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.829
and our focus on empowering
faith for groups at Google,

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.370
and as well, as
Tiffany talked about,

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.210
the Asian Googler's Network.

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.945
And kicking off-- it's
going great so far--

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:44.030
kicking off our week-long
program about what does

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.821
it mean to be an
Asian-American and Pacific

00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:48.440
Islander to really jump start
conversations around race

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.260
and stereotypes.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.120
And I think a lot
of those things

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.369
are very near and dear to
you, so we'll get into that.

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.390
But welcome to Google.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.810
It's great to have you
here for the first time.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.750
I think we'll start off with
just a little bit of you

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.833
telling us about yourself.

00:01:57.833 --> 00:02:00.167
You won the state championship
at Palo Alto High School.

00:02:00.167 --> 00:02:02.041
You were named All-Ivy
first team at Harvard.

00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.130
You played seven years
with the NBA with the Nets.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.110
Tell us a little bit
about your journey

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.420
and what that's all been like
for you just as Jeremy Lin.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.030
JEREMY LIN: I grew up right
down the street, so to get here

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.080
was like five minutes.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.330
It was really convenient.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.930
I just love being in the area.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.288
I was trying to go to
Stanford, but they--

00:02:27.288 --> 00:02:29.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.530
But they didn't recruit me.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.140
So actually,
legitimately, I really

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.330
didn't want to go to
Harvard because I just

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.670
didn't hear good things
about the east coast.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.035
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:42.197
I never-- I had--

00:02:42.197 --> 00:02:43.780
MARVIN CHOW: You
live in Brooklyn now.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.560
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.330
I'm talking about
when I was like--

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.690
MARVIN CHOW: Back in the day.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.814
JEREMY LIN: --you know, 17.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.290
The winters were supposed
to be really daunting.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.730
And there was no
In-N-Out Burger,

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.780
so I was really anti-east coast.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.600
But obviously my journey
over the last 10 years

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.540
has brought me everywhere
across the world.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.050
And I guess my
life experiences--

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.790
sometimes I feel like
I'm 28 inside of like a--

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.490
I don't want to offend
anybody-- but just like an older

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.990
person's--

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.240
--experience.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.180
I just have seen a lot,
been through a lot.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.890
And I feel like as I get older--

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.990
now I'm going into my
eighth year in the league--

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.390
I've become more
opinionated about stuff

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.530
because I've seen more
and become more educated

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.430
about certain things.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.150
And so now I feel
like I have more

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.510
of a conviction and a passion
about what I want to speak on,

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.370
or what I feel should change,
or what is right, what is wrong.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.850
And that's maybe why I've
signed up for something

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:49.780
like Talks at Google.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.060
It's just a great
opportunity to do that.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.450
MARVIN CHOW: That's great.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.940
I mean, you talked, obviously,
very openly about this journey

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.606
you've been on, and
being more educated.

00:03:56.606 --> 00:03:58.190
And part of that, as kind of--

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.950
very rare to see
an Asian-American

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.175
in sports in your
position and of influence.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:05.980
Talk about some of the things,
the challenges you had,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.870
the things you've
had to face in terms

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.970
of getting there along the way.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.800
What are some of
those challenges?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.920
JEREMY LIN: I would
say actually it's

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.670
probably a lot like college.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:18.250
The hard part is getting there.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.910
Once you get in, it
actually becomes a lot--

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:22.970
it becomes easier.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.960
But the hard part for
me was really just,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.100
at the end of the day
there's a million,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.670
billion people
playing basketball,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.110
so there's 450 spots.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.230
And for an owner
or whatever to take

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.120
a chance on one
of their 15 spots,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.320
you really have to wow them.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.710
And it was hard for me to
make enough of an impression

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.062
where people would
want to take that risk,

00:04:45.062 --> 00:04:47.270
especially because I didn't
look like everybody else.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.811
So that was probably
the hardest part

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:50.980
was feeling like I
proved myself enough,

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:52.510
and then it not being enough.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.690
And having to do that over and
over again until one person--

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.370
thank you, Joe Lacob--

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.580
was like I want to
give him a shot.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:02.560
I think that was
probably the hardest

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.990
part about the whole thing.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.890
And then once you get there,
once you get to that spot,

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.619
once you get in the NBA, it's
really just about consistency.

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:15.160
The people, your teammates, they
see it in practice every day

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.860
or whatever, and they start
to believe he's a player.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.920
I think once you get
there, it becomes easier.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.889
MARVIN CHOW: And so once you're
there, it kind of goes away

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:24.430
a little bit?

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.470
Is that more just in
the family of the team,

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.880
or do you still experience
it in the greater world,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.000
obviously, when you go to games
or when you're out in public?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.708
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:05:31.708 --> 00:05:34.510
I was speaking more just
like for my own team.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.030
If I play well in
training camp, I

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.710
feel like I have their respect.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.790
Across the league it
took a little bit longer.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.270
But now that I'm going
into my eighth year,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.340
I don't feel like I
really deal with as much

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:46.840
as what I used to deal with.

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.370
What I used to
deal with was like,

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.860
oh, we'd better not let
this Asian kid score on us--

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:54.100
--really is what it was like.

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.820
It was like, man, like, dude.

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:57.460
I remember I did
like a crossover

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.950
and scored a layup
against the Pistons.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:02.320
And they were like,
oh, it's like,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.210
you crossed up Tayshaun Prince.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:09.886
But if I was black, then it
wouldn't matter, you know?

00:06:09.886 --> 00:06:11.010
No one would talk about it.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:12.770
It would just be
like, he scored.

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.420
But for me, because it was like,
dude, the Asian kid scored.

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:18.130
It's like, him.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.650
So I felt like I had
a target on my back.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.640
And then after Linsanity, I felt
like the target grew 30 times

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.140
where I felt like
people were really

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.850
excited to play against me.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:35.410
They wanted to be the person
to outplay me by a lot.

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:36.880
I felt a lot of that.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.970
And as I've gotten
older, I actually

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.846
built a lot of
relationships with people,

00:06:41.846 --> 00:06:42.970
kind of word of mouth, too.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.260
Without meeting
every NBA player,

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.290
I pretty much know at least two
or three things about every NBA

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.991
player, just word of mouth.

00:06:51.991 --> 00:06:52.990
It's a small community--

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.110
450 of us.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:57.970
And so I feel like through
that it's become a lot easier

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.747
now to be more accepted
within the NBA circle.

00:07:01.747 --> 00:07:02.830
MARVIN CHOW: That's great.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.620
So beyond obviously being
just an Asian-American,

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.430
you identify very publicly in
social media as a Christian.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.030
You speak a lot about that.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.890
So similarly, how do you deal
with stereotypes or things

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.640
like that about being
a Christian, or such

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.190
an outspoken Christian
in the mainstream?

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.550
JEREMY LIN: I think
for me there's

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:24.200
some things that I know
are so important to me

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:26.690
that I actually don't
care what people think.

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.130
I think that's probably the
best way to describe it.

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.080
I know what my
faith means to me.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.010
And I know how many times I've
had my back against the wall

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.630
and there was
literally a miracle--

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.240
sometimes me playing well,
but sometimes a miracle

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.360
was running into
somebody, a random phone

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.860
call that somebody
had, or something

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.800
that happened outside
of my control,

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.840
or outside of my ability
to play basketball

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.140
that created an opportunity for
me to get to the next level,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.790
get on this team.

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:58.220
And so I know that faith has
been such an integral part

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.820
of who I am, it would be crazy
for me to get to this point

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.040
and not talk about my faith.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.130
And I don't really care too
much what everybody else thinks.

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:10.281
It's kind of like how I
talk about my family, too.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.780
My family is so
near and dear to me,

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.238
I know what they
mean to me, I know

00:08:13.238 --> 00:08:16.052
what they've done to help me.

00:08:16.052 --> 00:08:18.260
The only thing is, family
isn't really controversial,

00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:21.159
so you should talk
about your family.

00:08:21.159 --> 00:08:22.700
But with faith,
sometimes that can be

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.900
sensitive for certain people.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.700
But I just felt like I
had to share who I am.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.710
I have to share how I got here.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.679
And I want to stay
true to the path

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.440
that I felt like I
was meant to walk.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.539
MARVIN CHOW: It just seems
like, for you, it fuels you.

00:08:39.539 --> 00:08:42.020
Defining the stereotype, or
redefining-- whether it's

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.700
being Asian, being Christian.

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.080
Is it something that drives you?

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.663
Is it something
that's natural to you,

00:08:46.663 --> 00:08:50.850
or do you have to really focus
on overcoming in that sense?

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.760
JEREMY LIN: I think it's
more than just personality.

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.360
I'm hyper-competitive,
and I love challenges,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.445
and I love crazy dreams.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.410
If you ever told me no
one's ever done something,

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:06.690
I'd be the type of person to
be like, yeah, let's do it.

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:08.670
I'm not talking about
drugs or something.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:09.975
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.730
I'm talking about--

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.602
MARVIN CHOW: He's talking
Brooklyn Nets championship.

00:09:15.602 --> 00:09:16.310
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:18.460
I'm talking about
healthier stuff.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.024
MARVIN CHOW: Exactly.

00:09:20.024 --> 00:09:20.690
Christian stuff.

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.960
It's cool.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.430
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.630
MARVIN CHOW: We got it.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:21.840
We got it.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:22.340
It's good.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:24.319
JEREMY LIN: So I feel
like it was natural.

00:09:24.319 --> 00:09:26.110
Like, it's never been
done before, it makes

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.770
me want to do it even more.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:28.754
MARVIN CHOW: Right.

00:09:28.754 --> 00:09:30.170
So on that cleaner
stuff, when you

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.003
think about the stuff
that's never been done

00:09:32.003 --> 00:09:34.700
and when you think
about just your journey,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.650
talk about some times where--

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.207
obviously, you're a role
model to so many people.

00:09:39.207 --> 00:09:40.790
Is there a memorable
time where you've

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.719
had such a visible or emotional
impact on another group

00:09:43.719 --> 00:09:46.010
of people, a community, or
an individual person because

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.140
of your position that you
can maybe share about?

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:58.960
JEREMY LIN: I guess just one of
the crazy things that I never

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.910
really thought would
happen is just--

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.910
a lot of people reach out where
they're in a situation in life

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.290
where they're ill.

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:11.230
They're sick, and they really
wanted to meet me or something

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.550
like that.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:15.925
Actually, those experiences are
really humbling and sobering.

00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:21.550
I posted a lot about
this girl named Ava

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.609
last year when she passed.

00:10:24.609 --> 00:10:26.650
But I had this relationship
with her for a while.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.200
And she was the most
adorable little girl,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.430
and I got to meet her family.

00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:31.930
And I keep in touch
with her family.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:34.150
Every time we go
to play the Bulls,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:36.320
I make sure to
catch up with them,

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.760
bring into the game and stuff.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:41.050
But I think those
experiences where

00:10:41.050 --> 00:10:43.810
on a day-to-day when
a fan wants a picture,

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:47.270
it really doesn't
feel real to me.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.590
It feels like I'm a zoo animal.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:54.650
You ever feel like, if you're
in the zoo, the monkey you see

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:55.690
or the panda?

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.960
It's like all these people
come by and then they leave.

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.235
They're just like, whatever.

00:11:00.235 --> 00:11:02.030
They get what they
want and they leave.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:05.140
That's kind of how I
feel, like, a fan to--

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.770
if I were to be real, not to
say that I don't appreciate it,

00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:11.110
but after a while it
actually feels like that.

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:18.722
But with these interactions
where she was only five, six.

00:11:18.722 --> 00:11:19.930
When I met her, she was five.

00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:23.530
So there's no awe,
there's no any of that.

00:11:23.530 --> 00:11:27.640
It's just like a pure,
human-to-human interaction.

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:30.912
And those interactions,
to me, are probably

00:11:30.912 --> 00:11:31.870
the most powerful ones.

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:32.800
MARVIN CHOW: It's
just very genuine.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.508
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:11:33.508 --> 00:11:35.040
MARVIN CHOW: That makes sense.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.160
Yeah, I think we feel
like zoo animals,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.100
too, working at Google, with
the amount of tourists coming

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:39.660
on campus and just looking at.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.660
It like, it's an office.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:41.160
Go away.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.270
I'm just kidding.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:47.590
So talking about role
models, obviously you've

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:49.720
broken so many barriers
for Asian-Americans.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.760
You're a huge role model to so
many people around the world.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.510
You've just come
back from China.

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.490
When you were growing
up, obviously I

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.080
would imagine that there were
very few Asian-American role

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.580
models.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.980
But how did you deal with that?

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:00.040
Who did you look to?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.490
Who inspired you when
you were growing up?

00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:07.360
JEREMY LIN: I would say in
terms of Asian role models,

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:09.970
my biggest role model was
probably my big brother,

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.820
just in terms of
I wanted to be who

00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:16.780
he was in terms of how
he took care of me,

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.670
or the type of
person that he was.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.670
So it was very helpful
to have somebody

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.740
who was three years older.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.690
I was the one who was
always in trouble,

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.655
and he was always
very responsible.

00:12:28.655 --> 00:12:31.030
He took care of a lot of
things, so it was helpful for me

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.660
to see that.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.300
And as we got older, he taught
me what it means to be a man.

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:37.600
Because people think
to be a man you

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.700
have to have big pecs,
and flex and stuff.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:40.990
And it's like, no--

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:43.230
being a man is
really like learning

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:44.800
to love and serve other people.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.130
How do you take care of people?

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:48.734
How do you take care
of everything, really?

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.650
And a lot of that comes
from the Bible for me.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:53.140
And so he kind of taught me
a lot of these deeper aspects

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:54.700
of what it means to be a man.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.300
But then in terms of straight
role models, it was Jordan.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.550
And he's not Asian, obviously.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:01.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.522
MARVIN CHOW: He's not?

00:13:02.522 --> 00:13:05.900
JEREMY LIN: But
he was a minority.

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.810
And I actually
gravitate towards--

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.225
I drew a lot from minorities.

00:13:09.225 --> 00:13:11.350
It didn't have to be Asian,
because I didn't really

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:14.680
have one in basketball that
was Asian until Yao got there.

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.390
But even with Yao
it was still hard,

00:13:16.390 --> 00:13:17.935
because I was never
going to be 7'6".

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.280
But once Yao got there,
it definitely helped.

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:26.220
I remember telling
my mom I'm going

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.350
to be the first Chinese
player in the NBA.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.720
And obviously I was
very uneducated,

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.880
because there were
Chinese players before me

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.130
that made the NBA.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.680
But I didn't know
it at the time,

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.388
so I was like, I'm
going to be the first.

00:13:38.388 --> 00:13:40.990
And then Yao came, and
I was like, all right,

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:41.946
this is for real.

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:42.820
It's going to happen.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.817
I can do it, because
I see him, I saw him.

00:13:46.817 --> 00:13:48.400
So there was definitely
an inspiration

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.110
that I drew from
him, but there wasn't

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:54.089
like the "I'm going to
be exactly like him,"

00:13:54.089 --> 00:13:56.380
because I always knew I was
never going to be a center.

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.290
MARVIN CHOW: Did you have
the Jordan wings poster--

00:13:58.290 --> 00:13:58.450
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:13:59.550
MARVIN CHOW: --in the bedroom?

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.490
JEREMY LIN: I had it all, yeah.

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:01.490
MARVIN CHOW: Had it all?

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.085
JEREMY LIN: Space
Jam was the ish.

00:14:03.085 --> 00:14:04.335
MARVIN CHOW: It's coming back.

00:14:04.335 --> 00:14:05.300
It's coming back.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:06.859
Favorite Jordan moment?

00:14:06.859 --> 00:14:08.900
JEREMY LIN: Favorite Jordan
moment was definitely

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:12.310
the game 6 against Utah.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:15.750
That solidified it.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.570
But there was a lot of moments.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:20.390
I used to watch his
games from the backyard.

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:22.760
So he would do a move and
then I would go and do it.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.597
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:23.597 --> 00:14:25.430
I wasn't really much
into defense back then.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.940
So when they were playing
defense, I would go do the move

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:31.050
and I would run back and try to
catch Jordan's next offensive

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.880
possession.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.235
MARVIN CHOW: That's awesome.

00:14:33.235 --> 00:14:35.360
You talked a little about
your brother teaching you

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:37.069
about being a man
and the big pecs,

00:14:37.069 --> 00:14:38.360
and that's not what it's about.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.820
And I think you talk a
lot about how in the US,

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.039
Asian men are viewed
unfairly in that--

00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:45.080
not only when it comes to
sports, but also things

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.160
like dating, and social.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.665
And I wonder if you
could talk about that,

00:14:49.665 --> 00:14:52.040
and how do you envision changing
some of that stereotype,

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.536
or how can all of us
change that stereotype?

00:14:54.536 --> 00:14:56.285
JEREMY LIN: I think
it's happening slowly.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.740
From an Asian-American
masculinity standpoint,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:11.350
it's like for us to be really
unashamed of everything

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:13.030
we are, who we are.

00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:15.700
I think-- one of
the things I really

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.640
enjoy following is
e-sports, because I

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:23.410
feel like back then it
was like, you're a gamer?

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:27.400
You're such a nerd would be
the word that they would say.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.200
And now it's actually
becoming something

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.280
that people appreciate.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.810
I just came back from
the Internationals,

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:33.726
where there was $24
million-- yeah, what's up?

00:15:33.726 --> 00:15:35.299
The International.

00:15:35.299 --> 00:15:36.340
MARVIN CHOW: $24 million?

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.140
JEREMY LIN: $24 million
dollar cash prize.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.070
It's becoming something that
people really appreciate.

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.330
And so I think for
Asian-American males,

00:15:43.330 --> 00:15:45.400
it's just like keep
doing what you're doing

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.250
and eventually people
will come to appreciate.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.860
We're starting to see
certain breakthroughs

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.170
in the entertainment
industry, and Hollywood.

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:58.720
And we see a lot of
junk that comes with it.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:01.900
Like what Daniel
Dae Kim did, that's

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.020
awesome because you have to be
able to stand up for yourself.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.480
Be great at what you are.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.170
Be respectful.

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:12.160
Be polite, because that's
what Asian culture teaches.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.730
Even in the public eye,
almost passive and safe,

00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:18.790
but I think there's a way
to be strong and polite

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.630
at the same time.

00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:22.750
To be confident and
humble at the same time.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:26.200
And I think that's what we need
more of-- just people being

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.900
great at what they do, and then
staying strong to who they are

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.840
and being proud to represent
Asian-American males.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.170
And I think people used to
talk about "yellow fever."

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.680
Really, yellow fever
was just Asian girls.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.820
It wasn't like we saw everybody
being like, Asian dudes!

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.731
Everyone go find
yourself an Asian guy!

00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:46.230
Right?

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:47.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:49.744
That wasn't yellow fever.

00:16:49.744 --> 00:16:51.160
MARVIN CHOW: It's
more like a flu.

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:54.422
JEREMY LIN: We're going
to redefine yellow fever.

00:16:54.422 --> 00:16:55.380
MARVIN CHOW: I love it.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:59.029
Right here-- it started right
here, the new yellow fever.

00:16:59.029 --> 00:17:00.570
Now we're getting
a little off track.

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:02.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.250
Totally forgot where I am.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:10.560
I think when you
talk about that,

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.470
standing up for who you are,
maybe some examples from you.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:16.680
But the need to, or
the desire to conform,

00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:19.020
to try to be a part of
a bigger group-- and I'm

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:23.069
sure that's true in sports and
a team, versus being who you are

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:24.761
and standing up.

00:17:24.761 --> 00:17:26.010
I've seen your YouTube videos.

00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:27.801
You've got such an
interesting personality.

00:17:27.801 --> 00:17:29.430
How do you balance
that need to conform

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.888
to the culture of a team that
maybe is obviously not Asian,

00:17:31.888 --> 00:17:34.236
but still be proud of
your Asian heritage?

00:17:34.236 --> 00:17:35.610
JEREMY LIN: Yeah,
that's probably

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:37.693
something that was really
tricky in the beginning.

00:17:37.693 --> 00:17:42.120
I remember I had a teammate who
was like, wait, I don't get it.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.250
How can you be
Chinese and Asian?

00:17:44.250 --> 00:17:45.150
You can only be one.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.986
And I was like--

00:17:45.986 --> 00:17:47.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:49.272
MARVIN CHOW: African-American.

00:17:49.272 --> 00:17:50.980
JEREMY LIN: I'm like,
are you kidding me?

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:53.700
I decided to explain
to him I could actually

00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:57.300
be Japanese and Asian, too.

00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:03.270
Or you could be any
country in Africa

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:07.620
and be African, or
whatever, European.

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:08.550
So I had to explain.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.160
And that was literally,
like, they knew nothing.

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.320
Some of my teammates
knew nothing.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.152
They were like, so you're like
really into samurais and stuff?

00:18:18.152 --> 00:18:21.690
I'm like, that's
not even remotely--

00:18:21.690 --> 00:18:24.292
but that was just how far.

00:18:24.292 --> 00:18:25.250
And I don't blame them.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:28.642
Because I've gone back to some
of my teammates' hometowns,

00:18:28.642 --> 00:18:30.600
and where they came from,
and their upbringing,

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.760
and I meet their parents.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:34.040
It's like they literally
have no interaction

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.060
with any Asian people.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:41.380
And so at first I was
just really shocked

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:43.190
at a lot of stuff.

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:47.820
And when people think
Asians, it's really just--

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:51.870
at least in the NBA-- it's Bruce
Lee, Jet Li, and Jackie Chan.

00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:52.657
That's it.

00:18:52.657 --> 00:18:53.350
And Yao.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.850
And Yao.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:55.320
But it's those
four, and that's it.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.040
That's a thing I
love about sports

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:06.530
is, by being a certain person
or acting a certain way,

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:08.510
you develop team chemistry.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:10.300
They gravitate towards you.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.050
You build that
relationship, and then they

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.630
start to care about who you
are, where you came from.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.840
And recently what we've seen
is a ton of my teammates

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.870
are asking me to
take them to Asia.

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:23.210
They want to come with
me to my camps in Taiwan.

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.550
They want to come with
me to my camps in China.

00:19:25.550 --> 00:19:28.415
I brought Caris LeVert this
past year and other teammates

00:19:28.415 --> 00:19:30.290
were like, I can't
believe you brought Caris.

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:31.289
Why didn't you bring me?

00:19:31.289 --> 00:19:33.550
So it's cool, man.

00:19:33.550 --> 00:19:35.430
It's cool to see
people are loving.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:38.170
And also it's helpful,
because the game is growing.

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:38.810
MARVIN CHOW: Yeah,
the game [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:40.393
JEREMY LIN: The NBA
is going to China,

00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:43.460
so people are naturally becoming
more and more exposed to it.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.840
But it's a day-by-day,
inch-by-inch, brick-by-brick

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:52.145
process mentality where it's
like, slowly, hopefully,

00:19:52.145 --> 00:19:54.020
people will start to
see more and more of it,

00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.904
become more educated
about who I am

00:19:55.904 --> 00:19:57.320
or what this culture
is all about.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:57.716
Yeah.

00:19:57.716 --> 00:19:58.510
MARVIN CHOW: That's cool.

00:19:58.510 --> 00:19:59.745
All right, enough
about basketball.

00:19:59.745 --> 00:20:00.530
Let's talk About the future.

00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:01.238
JEREMY LIN: Cool.

00:20:01.238 --> 00:20:02.810
MARVIN CHOW: Esports.

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:04.370
I know nothing about
esports, so this

00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.630
is the question they gave me.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:08.630
So you're an avid
esports player.

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:10.430
You just launched
a team on Dota,

00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:13.280
and then you're soon becoming
a correspondent for ELEAGUE.

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.364
How did you get into this?

00:20:14.364 --> 00:20:15.446
How do you think about it?

00:20:15.446 --> 00:20:16.200
Where is it going?

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.960
What companies should
we buy stock in?

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.050
What is it?

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:22.400
JEREMY LIN: I just love "Dota."

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.810
I played for 15 years.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:27.195
And basically when I have no
energy to play basketball,

00:20:27.195 --> 00:20:28.070
I go and play "Dota."

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:30.200
It's kind of like I
just have those two

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.810
strong passions that I
always kind of go towards.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:38.530
And I always felt like gaming
is one thing that people think

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:42.800
is like, if I just played
video games all day,

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.440
I would be as good as them.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.190
It's like, no.

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.950
No, you wouldn't--
not even close.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:51.260
Because it takes talent
to make decisions

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:54.280
in the brain and
the coordination

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.920
that it takes to make these
split-second decisions.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.300
Just like sports.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.580
Just like being great
at other things.

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.190
Some people just have a
different level of talent,

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:05.767
and I think that is the
part that is becoming

00:21:05.767 --> 00:21:06.850
more and more appreciated.

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:10.120
But I still see in the esports
industry a lot of these players

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.460
are getting exploited.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.380
They have one-year deals.

00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:16.300
You see in the NBA
right now people signing

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.850
for $200 and something million.

00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:20.440
There's a lot more
stability in that,

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:24.730
and I hope to see esports
develop into the sports

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:29.500
industry where players and
owners, the whole industry

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.580
grows, but everybody
benefits equally from it.

00:21:31.580 --> 00:21:32.830
MARVIN CHOW: Yeah, definitely.

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:35.371
I think it's early, early days,
so hopefully we'll get there.

00:21:35.371 --> 00:21:37.742
I saw-- I don't remember
if it's the Nets,

00:21:37.742 --> 00:21:39.200
but a lot of your
teammates and you

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.259
were playing "Clash of Clans."

00:21:41.259 --> 00:21:43.300
JEREMY LIN: Except they
play differently than me.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:44.784
They spend like $10,000 each.

00:21:44.784 --> 00:21:46.450
MARVIN CHOW: They
just buy their way in?

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:47.730
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:49.480
MARVIN CHOW: But did
you get them into it,

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:52.060
or were they already into
it before you got there?

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:54.490
Is it a bridge?

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.190
JEREMY LIN: I
remember the Rockets,

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:58.504
we all played together.

00:21:58.504 --> 00:21:59.920
We were all in the
same clan, too.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:01.870 --> 00:22:06.730
And I think Dwight
had started before,

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:09.010
and then I got a
couple of people.

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.420
I got Omri into it.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:14.440
I got Ronnie Brewer into it.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.060
And I'm obviously
doing the right thing--

00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.750
just slowly chipping
away, playing the game.

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:22.570
Maybe buy a couple
gems here and there.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.390
But I look, and their base is
better than mine in three days.

00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.490
And I'm like, how
much did you spend?

00:22:27.490 --> 00:22:29.610
And they're like, I don't
know, probably like--

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:30.870
it was a few thousand.

00:22:30.870 --> 00:22:31.420
MARVIN CHOW: I'm sure.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.590
JEREMY LIN: They just
spent a few thousand

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:33.606
and upgraded everything.

00:22:33.606 --> 00:22:34.480
And I was just like--

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.825
I was like, dude, this is--

00:22:37.825 --> 00:22:39.950
MARVIN CHOW: It's not a
shopping site, it's a game.

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:40.330
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:41.440
But then I was
like, you know what?

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.610
We're all in the same clan.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:44.026
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:44.970 --> 00:22:45.840
Keep spending.

00:22:49.724 --> 00:22:50.890
MARVIN CHOW: That's awesome.

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:52.240
A couple of quick
questions for you.

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.220
And then we'll get to some
Dory questions, which people

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:55.880
submitted, and then we'll take
some live questions in a couple

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.380
minutes.

00:22:56.380 --> 00:23:00.420
So, hairstyles-- YouTube.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:01.390
We got the braids.

00:23:01.390 --> 00:23:03.220
We got the Mohawk,
I personally like.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.500
We got the man bun today.

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:06.890
What's your favorite?

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:08.740
How do you decide?

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:12.790
JEREMY LIN: My favorite is the
Mohawk, but not the really high

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.300
Mohawk.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:15.550
It was probably when the
Mohawk was first starting,

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:18.340
that's probably the
one I like the most.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:21.190
But really-- I'll just explain.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.830
There was seven of us
who decided to grow a man

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.490
bun together two years ago.

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:26.110
So it was me--

00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:27.450
MARVIN CHOW: Players or friends?

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.900
JEREMY LIN: Me and my brother,
my cousin, my trainer,

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:33.150
my agent, my bodyguard in
China, and my masseuse.

00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:34.271
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:34.592 --> 00:23:35.800
MARVIN CHOW: The cupping guy?

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.049
He doesn't even have any hair.

00:23:39.299 --> 00:23:41.590
JEREMY LIN: I have one in
Cali, one in Europe, one in--

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:44.646
MARVIN CHOW: I was like,
the guy here has no hair.

00:23:44.646 --> 00:23:47.020
JEREMY LIN: So we were all
sitting there, and we're like,

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:47.920
we're going to do it together.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.160
It was on our Asia
trip, so there was

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.170
seven of us sitting in a room.

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.350
We're like, we're going
to do it together.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.330
That's how it spawned.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:55.510
And then from there,
I thought I would

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:57.230
have a man bun in three months.

00:23:57.230 --> 00:23:58.730
I've never grown
my hair out before.

00:23:58.730 --> 00:24:01.420
It actually took like a
year, year and a half.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.380
But in between there's
always awkward phases,

00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.600
so I was forced to
improvise and come up

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.290
with different hairstyles
that would look OK.

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:14.110
And so that's where you got
the slick back, and the side,

00:24:14.110 --> 00:24:15.212
and the Mohawk.

00:24:15.212 --> 00:24:17.170
The Mohawk was never
supposed to be the Mohawk.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:18.529
The Mohawk was just--

00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:19.820
it's too short to be a man bun.

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:22.340
MARVIN CHOW: It's the
beginning of the man bun.

00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:26.180
JEREMY LIN: And then
once I got the man bun,

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:28.140
the whole hair thing
took a life of its own.

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.089
And so my friends
were texting me like,

00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:31.130
you should do this style.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.171
You should do this style.

00:24:32.171 --> 00:24:36.847
And people started texting me
braids, and box braids, and--

00:24:36.847 --> 00:24:37.680
what else do I have?

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.934
I don't even know--

00:24:39.934 --> 00:24:40.730
random stuff.

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:43.112
And then people
were challenging me.

00:24:43.112 --> 00:24:45.320
One of them was like, you
won't do a double ponytail.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.882
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:46.882 --> 00:24:48.840
MARVIN CHOW: Now they're
just messing with you.

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:52.220
JEREMY LIN: And I was
like, bet you I will.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.540
So I did it.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.210
But I felt like, for
me, that was also

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:59.390
a turning point in
my life, because that

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:01.250
was the first time
where I stopped caring

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:02.480
about what everyone thought.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.110
Before that, I would read
Twitter mentions and Facebook

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:09.980
comments and I'd be really
hurt by a lot of things

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.500
that people would say, legit.

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:16.040
Because I pour my blood, sweat,
and tears into a lot of things

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.050
I do, and for someone
to just be like, well,

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:20.133
you suck, we blah, blah,
blah, this is your fault,

00:25:20.133 --> 00:25:23.327
or we don't want you, that's
like if some random person came

00:25:23.327 --> 00:25:24.035
into your office.

00:25:24.035 --> 00:25:27.740
And people don't realize
we have emotions, too.

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:31.395
When people hate--
a lot of athletes

00:25:31.395 --> 00:25:33.770
actually are even more sensitive
than the average person,

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:36.090
because we're so used
to everyone loving us.

00:25:36.090 --> 00:25:37.340
MARVIN CHOW: Loving you, yeah.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:41.840
JEREMY LIN: And so I
had to go beyond that.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.460
My faith was a
huge part of that,

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.370
where it's I'm living,
playing, breathing, for God,

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:48.260
and I need his approval.

00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.810
And when I got to that point
where God became so much

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:55.010
more a bigger part of who
I was and my identity,

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.500
a lot of what everyone else
was saying kind of just

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.375
went in one ear and
went out the other.

00:25:59.375 --> 00:26:01.000
I didn't really care
that much anymore.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.022
So the hair was kind of like--

00:26:04.022 --> 00:26:06.230
even though it's playful
from the outside looking in,

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:10.520
from the inside out it was
a very real manifestation

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.860
of how I was growing
as an individual.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:17.460
Now I'll do anything.

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:19.450
I don't care what anyone thinks.

00:26:19.450 --> 00:26:20.220
I'll do braids.

00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:20.930
I had braids.

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.210
I had all these crazy designs.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.810
And if I like it, I'll do
it, and if I don't, I won't.

00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:31.070
And that's pretty much
my philosophy on that.

00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:35.240
I didn't mean to go deeper in
this very humorous question,

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.170
but I had to share.

00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:38.210
MARVIN CHOW: Do you
travel with a hairstylist?

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:38.835
JEREMY LIN: No.

00:26:38.835 --> 00:26:40.070
I don't travel--

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:41.805
I don't even know, like, no.

00:26:41.805 --> 00:26:43.786
I don't even know what
a hairstylist does.

00:26:43.786 --> 00:26:44.660
What does that even--

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.250
MARVIN CHOW: They do hair.

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:48.230
JEREMY LIN: No, if
I want it braided,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:51.560
I'll be like, hey,
anybody in Shanghai--

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.970
MARVIN CHOW: Just like,
Weibo out, can I get a braid?

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.178
JEREMY LIN: Well, usually
my agent will just help me.

00:26:56.178 --> 00:27:00.140
But for example in Cali, I
don't know any good braiders.

00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.820
So I never braid my
hair here, I just

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:02.750
wait till I go to New York.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:03.680
MARVIN CHOW: Back to New
York, because that's where

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.460
all the good braiders are.

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.168
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:27:05.168 --> 00:27:09.650
So if anyone's hella good at
braiding, just let me know.

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:12.671
MARVIN CHOW: Jeremy Lin at
Google.com, just email him.

00:27:12.671 --> 00:27:14.665
So you were talking
about things you're

00:27:14.665 --> 00:27:15.790
good at, what you're doing.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:17.810
So if you weren't playing
in the NBA today--

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.650
obviously, no one would
want to think about that--

00:27:19.650 --> 00:27:21.350
but if for some chance you
weren't playing basketball,

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:23.126
what do you think
you'd be doing?

00:27:23.126 --> 00:27:24.500
JEREMY LIN: I
would definitely be

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.410
doing some type of
philanthropic, nonprofit work.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:28.440
I love kids.

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.890
I love helping people
who are in need.

00:27:30.890 --> 00:27:33.710
Actually, a lot of that
came from my experiences

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:36.830
with my teammates who grew
up in East Palo Alto, which

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.140
10-15 years ago was the
highest crime per capita

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:40.820
of any city in the US.

00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:43.054
And I remember going
to pick up my teammates

00:27:43.054 --> 00:27:44.720
and they'd be like,
I didn't sleep well.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.190
There was gunshots last night.

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:49.310
Things like that,
that's where it started.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.500
And then I lived in East
Palo Alto for three weeks

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.090
during my high school--

00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.362
just as part of a trip to
try to spend time with them.

00:27:56.362 --> 00:27:57.320
MARVIN CHOW: Immersion.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.611
JEREMY LIN: Yeah, kind of
like a community service type

00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:01.940
thing with my church.

00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:03.572
And that was an
amazing experience.

00:28:03.572 --> 00:28:05.030
And that kind of
set the tone where

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:08.090
I was like, man, if I
ever get the chance,

00:28:08.090 --> 00:28:09.530
I'm going to have a foundation.

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.570
I'm going to do this.

00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:17.350
And that's what I would love
to do when I'm done playing

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:21.410
is play with kids, after
school tutoring, teaching them

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.820
basketball, these things.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:25.050
I feel like there's a
lot of purpose in that.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:29.120
I feel really like it's very
impactful-- not just to them,

00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:32.720
but it's extremely impactful
to me, and meaningful to me.

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:34.910
I learn a lot from the kids.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:37.070
I learn a lot from
the interactions.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:40.800
And I think I get changed
more sometimes than they do,

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.567
which I think is
something that maybe

00:28:42.567 --> 00:28:44.900
is a little bit under-rated
or not talked about when you

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.360
think about philanthropic work.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:48.459
MARVIN CHOW: Definitely.

00:28:48.459 --> 00:28:50.000
So switching gears
a little bit more,

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.290
you have a pretty
epic YouTube channel.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:55.830
It's pretty impressive I have
to say, as a professional.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:57.992
Obviously you've got
a ton of other players

00:28:57.992 --> 00:28:59.700
in your videos, which
I think is amazing.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.575
I don't know how it
takes to coordinate that,

00:29:01.575 --> 00:29:02.700
but how does that work?

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:04.984
How do you get other
players to be in the videos?

00:29:04.984 --> 00:29:05.900
Are they your friends?

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.370
Who are you good friends
with in the league?

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:08.840
What is that whole
dynamic of, like, hey,

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:10.006
come be in my YouTube video?

00:29:13.884 --> 00:29:15.550
JEREMY LIN: I love
the finished product,

00:29:15.550 --> 00:29:19.250
but the filming
process is the worst.

00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:22.310
Because NBA players, we
have the attention span

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:24.380
of a grasshopper.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.547
I don't even know if they
have good attention spans.

00:29:26.547 --> 00:29:27.838
MARVIN CHOW: A bad grasshopper.

00:29:27.838 --> 00:29:30.190
JEREMY LIN: Literally, we
had to film in two minutes,

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:35.610
otherwise a lot of NBA players
were like, bro, I got to go.

00:29:35.610 --> 00:29:38.270
Come on.

00:29:38.270 --> 00:29:41.810
I'm hungry, you know?

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:44.840
That's how we all are in the
NBA because we're so catered to.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.520
So it's like,
literally we're trying

00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.310
to get all our takes
done and our time span

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:51.830
is two to five minutes for
every-- the "How to Fit

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:54.440
In to the NBA,"
everything that we filmed

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.200
was like five minutes
with each player.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:56.950
MARVIN CHOW: Yeah.

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.990
JEREMY LIN: And then
sometimes, like when

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:04.899
I was trying to get Steph, I
texted him early in the summer.

00:30:04.899 --> 00:30:05.690
He's like, I can't.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:06.900
And he texted me
the day before, he's

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.870
like, actually I leave
for China tomorrow

00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:10.520
but I could do it
in the afternoon.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:14.250
And I was in LA,
so I was like, OK.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:16.900
And we had just
filmed with DeAndre,

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.790
and I had never met DeAndre.

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:20.482
So I was like, hey--

00:30:20.482 --> 00:30:22.690
the Clippers have this
pick-up thing-- so I was like,

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:24.190
hey, DeAndre, do
you think it's cool

00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:27.400
if we film something
for my YouTube channel?

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:33.010
And of course, we had never had
person-to-person interaction

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.795
aside from playing on the court.

00:30:35.795 --> 00:30:36.670
He was really polite.

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.380
He was like, yeah, of course.

00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:39.970
I'm like, I mean,
like right now.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.810
He's like, right now?

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.180
I'm like, yeah.

00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:46.120
So we went-- and if you
guys know the video,

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.930
we had to do it outside
and there's cars going by.

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:51.709
And the audio was so
bad that we actually--

00:30:51.709 --> 00:30:53.500
the voice that's in
there is not his voice.

00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:53.600
MARVIN CHOW: Oh, really?

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:54.474
You had to re-record?

00:30:54.474 --> 00:30:57.280
JEREMY LIN: We couldn't hear
it, so we had to do a voiceover.

00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.910
And I had one of my
high school teammates

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.730
just listening to DeAndre
Jordan's voice over and over

00:31:03.730 --> 00:31:05.550
and over again.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:10.330
And he was like, na,
na, na, na, practicing,

00:31:10.330 --> 00:31:12.880
trying to get DeAndre's voice.

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:16.900
So it was just very
rushed, very chaotic.

00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.200
I never want another player
to feel like I'm using them.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.125
Because a lot of people come
at all of us for things.

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:29.150
I never want to be that one guy
who's trying to get something,

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.240
so I try to make it easy.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.480
But that's why I haven't
really done as many recently.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:36.800
It's just too hectic.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.520
We were flying back and forth.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.301
And I'm not that passionate
about making funny YouTube

00:31:41.301 --> 00:31:41.800
videos.

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.030
I'd rather play really
well on the court.

00:31:44.030 --> 00:31:46.180
MARVIN CHOW: That's a good
call, but they're good.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.130
JEREMY LIN: So I was training,
and at the end of training

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:49.750
it's like, all right,
put these high socks on.

00:31:49.750 --> 00:31:51.640
Put this headband on
and say these lines.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.130
It just felt like it
was too hard for me,

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:57.027
and so I've taken
a little step back.

00:31:57.027 --> 00:31:58.360
MARVIN CHOW: Well, they're good.

00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.850
JEREMY LIN: I appreciate it.

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:02.800
MARVIN CHOW: OK, so there's
a girl on my team named Mary,

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.271
and she has a
question on her mind

00:32:04.271 --> 00:32:06.520
which I'm sure is on half
the audience's mind in terms

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:09.340
of what's the
personal situation?

00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:10.970
Are you dating somebody?

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:17.560
As a role model of Asian men
and the new yellow fever,

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.890
where are we on this thing?

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.910
JEREMY LIN: Yeah,
I'm not right now.

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.690
I'm probably not
going to go too much

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.730
into the rest of my personal
life, but yeah, that's a no.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:30.292
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:30.292 --> 00:32:31.750
MARVIN CHOW: Hit
him up on Twitter.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.870
It's good.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:34.270
All right, we're going to
get into some Dory questions.

00:32:34.270 --> 00:32:35.710
These are questions, like I
said, that everyone submitted.

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:37.950
I think we'll do a Dory, and
then we'll do live questions.

00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:39.520
So I don't know if we
have a mic in the middle,

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.630
or how we're doing that, but if
anyone wants to ask a question,

00:32:41.630 --> 00:32:42.550
please line up.

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:44.290
So first, some of the
questions-- people

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:45.580
vote them up, so
they're the questions

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.330
that are most popular.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.829
So the first question
is, how do you

00:32:47.829 --> 00:32:53.190
share your faith with your
peers and fellow teammates?

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:57.360
JEREMY LIN: I think the first
thing to anything, really,

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.610
it's not just if it's religion,
but anything is really

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.610
just by earning their
respect and showing

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:07.980
that you live the way that
you say people should.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.340
So I think a lot of it
really is just lifestyle.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.980
In the NBA, obviously
the athlete lifestyle

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.505
is the athlete lifestyle.

00:33:16.505 --> 00:33:18.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.350
So to be different--

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.840
makes an impression.

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:25.110
And then I don't
try to walk around

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:29.130
with my Bible, like, hey,
I'm reading the Bible.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:31.547
But just like on the plane,
on the bus, we travel so much.

00:33:31.547 --> 00:33:32.880
We're in the hotel all the time.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.171
We're always around each other.

00:33:37.014 --> 00:33:39.180
One time I was reading it,
and my team was like, yo,

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:40.305
what is that, Harry Potter?

00:33:40.305 --> 00:33:41.482
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:41.482 --> 00:33:42.440
Because it was like a--

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.868
MARVIN CHOW: It's
a big book, yeah.

00:33:43.868 --> 00:33:45.620
JEREMY LIN: --footnoted
edition, so it's a bigger book.

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.536
He's like, what are you
reading, Harry Potter?

00:33:47.536 --> 00:33:51.180
And I was like, no,
actually, this is the Bible.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.310
And then that opened
up a conversation.

00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:54.935
Also, we have chapel
before every game.

00:33:54.935 --> 00:33:56.184
MARVIN CHOW: Oh, that's right.

00:33:56.184 --> 00:33:58.770
JEREMY LIN: So it's like a
15-minute, NBA-mandated--

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:03.120
if you want, you can get a five-
to seven-minute, short sermon

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.130
type thing before
every NBA game.

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:07.215
And that's a very easy
way to, like, hey,

00:34:07.215 --> 00:34:08.340
you want to come to chapel?

00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.199
Sure.

00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:11.460
We've had small groups.

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:15.600
Bible studies on all the teams
for the last four or five years

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.150
that I've been on.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.300
The Hornets was awesome.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:22.830
We had 12 out of 15
players attending.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:25.139
It was amazing.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:31.290
And actually, I
thought that athletes

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:35.655
would be really opposed to
anything to do with religion

00:34:35.655 --> 00:34:36.780
or Christianity in general.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:41.340
But I think if you get an
athlete outside of their whole

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:43.539
"I have to be this
alpha male" facade--

00:34:43.539 --> 00:34:44.330
MARVIN CHOW: Right.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:44.829
Yeah.

00:34:44.829 --> 00:34:47.460
JEREMY LIN: I think
you'll see that there's

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.440
a lot of uncertainty
in every athlete,

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.230
because injury could
be around the corner.

00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:55.139
There's so many life
situations, pressure situations.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:56.400
So-and-so wants money from me.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.650
I have to choose between
this brother and this cousin,

00:34:58.650 --> 00:35:02.250
or my mom and my dad, or
someone stole this from me.

00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:06.060
How do you deal with pressure?

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:09.540
Everyone's looking to
me to raise my fam--

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:11.350
there's so many situations.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:14.340
And I think that drives
a lot of NBA players

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.460
to actually be open to--

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:22.350
because we realize we're
not capable of everything

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:23.610
that we have.

00:35:23.610 --> 00:35:28.380
And I know that for sure, and
a lot of other players do, too.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.760
If you go to an NBA locker
room before the game,

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:35.010
you'll see players like
you've never seen them before.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:36.510
Some of them are really rattled.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.240
Some of them are really nervous.

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:43.470
And then some of them
obviously don't deal with that.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:49.190
But even the ones who are
very arrogant and confident,

00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:52.110
there are still very
many moments of weakness

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.820
that we all have.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:55.940
MARVIN CHOW: That
sounds really special.

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:56.690
Audience question?

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:03.750
SPEAKER 5: OK, so my
question was, sometimes

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.590
when the fans see some
treatment that you'd

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:10.130
receive from the team,
like either Ronnie Price

00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:13.170
is going to start over Jeremy
Lin, those kind of things,

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.725
we automatically attach this
to maybe this is racism.

00:36:16.725 --> 00:36:18.150
Maybe this is--

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:21.720
I think one thing the
fans want to know is,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.510
according to your
own perspective, how

00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:27.540
frequent is this
that maybe the race

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:31.040
card is played a little bit?

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:35.430
JEREMY LIN: Yeah,
that's a great question.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:42.190
I think that race is so deeply
embedded and intertwined

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:46.570
to everything that everybody
says or thinks subconsciously,

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:50.695
that it is a huge
part of the NBA.

00:36:56.490 --> 00:36:57.840
There's pros and cons to it.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.650
So the pros is, if I scored
20 points, they're like,

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:03.430
he went off.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.402
Linsanity.

00:37:05.402 --> 00:37:06.610
It's like, dude, I scored 20.

00:37:06.610 --> 00:37:09.760
Some people average 30 a game.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:15.100
So my successes get heightened,
but then also my failures

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.840
get heightened as well.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:19.190
So everything
becomes polarizing.

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:20.720
So there's no middle
ground with me.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.970
It's either he's the best,
he's the worst, he's great,

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:23.710
he sucks.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:27.040
It's racism, it's not.

00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:29.740
It's very extreme, two
ends of the spectrum,

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.800
and that's the controversy
that I've been caught up

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:34.000
in the middle of.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.350
And I think that to
answer your question,

00:37:37.350 --> 00:37:39.040
yeah, I think that's
part of it, but I

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:41.342
think it's not everything.

00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:42.550
I needed to grow as a player.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.530
There were times where
I was not good enough

00:37:44.530 --> 00:37:47.830
to deliver to the team
what they needed from me,

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:49.360
and I was replaced.

00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.720
And I think does it make it
a little bit easier for them

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:56.907
to maybe say because I'm Asian?

00:37:56.907 --> 00:37:58.740
Do I have to prove
myself a little bit more?

00:37:58.740 --> 00:37:59.790
Yes.

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:03.420
But if you look at Yao's
career, aside from his first two

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.510
years when he was constantly
doubted by everybody

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.960
and openly made fun of by a
lot of players, after that,

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.470
because he was so good,
no one said anything.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.310
Yao was Yao.

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:17.460
For me, I have not reached
the pinnacle of success

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:19.950
that Yao has had, so I've
had to deal with more

00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:21.630
of this influx of role.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.210
And that's where
maybe race won't

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:27.750
affect somebody who is clearly
above and beyond better.

00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:31.272
For me sometimes it's been a
little bit more on the margins.

00:38:31.272 --> 00:38:32.730
And that's where
race, I would say,

00:38:32.730 --> 00:38:35.210
plays more of a factor,
which for me has been

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:37.782
a big motivation to
become even better

00:38:37.782 --> 00:38:39.240
and to get even
better to the point

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.850
where there is no argument here.

00:38:41.850 --> 00:38:46.810
There is no reason to have
race play any part of it.

00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:49.140
Also one thing I've learned
is also not only race,

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.280
but personality and culture.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.620
Asians are taught to--

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:57.320
it's not taught for me to go
into the head coach's office

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:01.760
and cuss him out, but
that happens a lot, like,

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.230
with other people.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:06.830
And so I had to learn how to
stand up for myself by having

00:39:06.830 --> 00:39:08.847
serious conversations
at the right time

00:39:08.847 --> 00:39:11.180
and putting my foot down and
saying, hey, that's not OK.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.470
You can't talk to me that way.

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.360
Or, I feel like I'm
better than this player,

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:17.870
or I feel like I can
bring this to the team.

00:39:17.870 --> 00:39:21.050
And I didn't do that very
much earlier in my career.

00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:26.420
And I've learned that
in an alpha male man

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.530
society like the NBA, you have
to earn their respect by doing

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:31.190
that sometimes.

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:34.440
And that's what I've learned,
which is why I say be humble,

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.220
but be strong at the same time.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.080
They aren't mutually exclusive.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.690
Whereas I used to think,
hey, I'm going to be humble.

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:44.750
I won't say anything.

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.450
And it got to the point where
I was getting stepped on.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:49.646
So that had something
to do with it.

00:39:49.646 --> 00:39:51.020
Race had something
to do with it.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.150
Me not being good enough
at that time had something

00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:54.330
to do with it.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.587
It was all those put together.

00:39:56.587 --> 00:39:58.670
MARVIN CHOW: We'll go to
the second Dory question,

00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:00.170
and then go back
to a live question.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.050
So the second question is,
how was the recent Asian trip,

00:40:03.050 --> 00:40:05.060
and did you see any
differences in impact

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:07.590
compared to the past few years?

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:12.530
JEREMY LIN: Yeah, this one
was really, really successful.

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:17.000
We had a celebrity
all-star game,

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.856
and we had over 10 million
people watching online

00:40:20.856 --> 00:40:22.230
during just the
livestream alone,

00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:24.350
not even people who came
back later to watch it.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:26.390
So it was an amazing event.

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:31.322
And I launched a basketball
league slash schools.

00:40:31.322 --> 00:40:33.280
We're going to open
schools in different cities

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.740
and they're going to be kind
of like recreational leagues

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.850
where you can also
go for training.

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:40.910
So that was the primary
focus of this trip,

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:42.485
along with a lot
of my endorsements.

00:40:42.485 --> 00:40:44.610
MARVIN CHOW: Have you seen
the level of ball go up?

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:46.820
You've been going for,
like, seven years now.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:49.010
JEREMY LIN: Yeah, it
gets crazier and crazier.

00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:52.740
I feel like the fans
over there are like--

00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:54.690
there have been times
where it's actually

00:40:54.690 --> 00:40:59.340
dangerous, like
legitimately life dangerous,

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.600
to be in the middle of
some of the mobs or crowds.

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.243
They're really
fanatical, enthusiastic.

00:41:06.243 --> 00:41:09.187
MARVIN CHOW: It's the man bun.

00:41:09.187 --> 00:41:11.270
JEREMY LIN: I didn't have
the man bun at the time.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.197
I had the full hawk.

00:41:14.197 --> 00:41:15.780
MARVIN CHOW: Let's
do a live question.

00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:16.260
SPEAKER 6: Hey, Jeremy.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:17.770
Thank you so much for coming.

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:18.990
My name is George.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:22.329
I was the only Asian guy on the
basketball team in high school.

00:41:22.329 --> 00:41:23.370
JEREMY LIN: There you go.

00:41:23.370 --> 00:41:23.965
Nice.

00:41:23.965 --> 00:41:24.465
Respect.

00:41:24.465 --> 00:41:28.080
SPEAKER 6: And Yao was
playing at the time,

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.960
and all the kids at the
school called me Yao.

00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:33.630
Then you came out, Linsanity.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:36.270
And the other kids
called me, oh man, that's

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.437
Jeremy Lin on the
basketball team.

00:41:38.437 --> 00:41:40.020
I didn't think about
race at the time.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.120
I was like, man,
that's a compliment.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:43.860
They're comparing
me to Jeremy, man.

00:41:43.860 --> 00:41:45.480
That's love right there.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:48.420
I must have some game.

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:50.040
And I'm not going
to lie, I watch

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.850
a lot of your
highlights on YouTube

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:57.780
and think about
your top 10 plays.

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:59.790
So I have a question for you.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:03.167
What's your most
memorable play of yours?

00:42:03.167 --> 00:42:04.500
JEREMY LIN: Most memorable play?

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:13.950
I would say the
obvious answer is

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:18.500
the game winner against
Toronto, because that

00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.990
was pretty surreal.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:23.150
But actually the one moment
that I maybe remember even more

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:25.880
vividly was when we were
playing the Lakers when

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:32.990
I was with New York, and I hit
a three from the left baseline.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.210
And I remember after that
they called a time out,

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:38.640
but that was a dagger
to put the game away.

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:44.150
And I remember I had never
heard a crowd that loud.

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:47.570
And I can't really
fully describe it well,

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:50.675
but it felt like I was
like three inches off--

00:42:50.675 --> 00:42:52.550
it felt like I was
levitating, like hovering,

00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:57.410
because the noise was
so crazy that I felt

00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:58.940
like I was like in the air.

00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.050
It was the weirdest thing.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:02.370
That's why I remember it
so vividly is I was like,

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:03.530
what's going on right now?

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:06.170
This is so crazy.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:09.180
I think a lot of it
was adrenaline, too.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:12.500
But, yeah, that's the loudest
I've ever heard a gym,

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:16.190
and it was a pretty
special moment for me.

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:17.450
MARVIN CHOW: That's great.

00:43:17.450 --> 00:43:19.321
You talked earlier--
go back to Dory--

00:43:19.321 --> 00:43:21.320
about the role that your
family and your parents

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.622
play in your success.

00:43:22.622 --> 00:43:24.080
So the question
is, for those of us

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.840
who are parents, any advice on
how to encourage and support

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.302
our kids without being too
much of a "tiger" parent?

00:43:30.302 --> 00:43:31.010
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.760
My mom definitely has a
tiger mom personality.

00:43:41.690 --> 00:43:43.250
I'm glad that I
experienced that,

00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:52.010
because I feel like it gave
me a lot more perspective.

00:43:52.010 --> 00:43:56.000
I'm obviously not a parent, so
I don't have personal expertise.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.640
But as a kid growing up,
if I could say one thing,

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.870
it'd probably be guide your
kids instead of do everything

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:04.776
for them.

00:44:04.776 --> 00:44:06.150
And then, never
let your kid feel

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:09.700
like their success or
their accomplishments

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:14.890
define how the
parent loves the kid.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:17.740
I think that's super important.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:23.999
Because for me, I feel like
I'm very results oriented.

00:44:23.999 --> 00:44:25.540
You want to work
hard, go and get it.

00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:28.980
But the reality of the
situation is, especially

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:31.499
with Christianity, a lot
of it is grace given.

00:44:31.499 --> 00:44:32.790
It's not because I deserved it.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.373
It's not because I
can go and earn it.

00:44:34.373 --> 00:44:35.800
I can't go and
earn my salvation.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.230
I can't go and work
my way to heaven.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.210
It just comes with
accepting grace.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:43.940
And I think that's a concept
that I really struggle with,

00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:47.435
because my whole life I've
had to earn, work, out-work,

00:44:47.435 --> 00:44:48.560
and blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:51.770
And even in life it's
like you do these things,

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:52.710
you climb the ranks.

00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:55.610
But at some point, you're
going to find yourself actually

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:56.960
pretty empty.

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.880
In the height of Linsanity,
I remember feeling

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.044
like this is very fleeting.

00:45:00.044 --> 00:45:01.460
When I won the
state championship,

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.670
I remember thinking,
wow, it was awesome,

00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:06.850
but it left super fast.

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.200
There's a need for more.

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:10.967
There's always
something else that you

00:45:10.967 --> 00:45:12.050
want to go and accomplish.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:13.520
There's always another goal.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.860
You could have the
best individual career,

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:17.950
and then you start a
family and now it's

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.550
for my kids, the
same exact path.

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:21.470
So it's a rat race
that never ends.

00:45:24.650 --> 00:45:28.130
I feel like having the
parents teach the kids who

00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:31.760
you are as a person, aside from
everything that the Silicon

00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:34.830
Valley or the culture that
we live in will tell you

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:38.060
you need to go and do,
it's very important.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.780
And obviously
ambition is important.

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.420
Teaching your kids
to be motivated,

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:44.720
but allowing them to
grow through failure.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:48.290
My greatest moments in my
life, the turning points,

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:51.650
most often were
failures, not successes.

00:45:51.650 --> 00:45:54.680
It was really the failures
that taught me the most.

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.600
And I think I would let my kids
fail at times if they're not

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.000
listening to the advice.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.240
Be OK with letting them fail,
because I think when something

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.690
clicks in their mind and they
take more ownership over it,

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:10.520
that's when I feel
like real parenting has

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.295
been accomplished.

00:46:12.295 --> 00:46:13.570
MARVIN CHOW: Makes sense.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:15.740
We'll go live question.

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.660
SPEAKER 7: Hi, Jeremy.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.410
Thanks for coming.

00:46:17.410 --> 00:46:20.259
And congratulations on
your successful China trip.

00:46:20.259 --> 00:46:21.050
JEREMY LIN: Thanks.

00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:23.299
SPEAKER 7: We know that you
just come back from China.

00:46:23.299 --> 00:46:26.330
And then thanks for sharing a
lot of your inspiring stories

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:27.750
today.

00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:31.640
Here there is the
invitation from SVCBA--

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.706
it's actually Silicon Valley
Chinese Basketball Association,

00:46:35.706 --> 00:46:40.430
and it's an invitation for the
next opening in September 10th.

00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:42.260
We don't know whether
you have the time,

00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.780
but it would be great if I can
give this invitation letter

00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.380
for you.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:49.270
So SVCBA started more
than six years ago.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:51.740
It started with three
basketball teams.

00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.794
Right now, it has
more than 32 teams.

00:46:53.794 --> 00:46:54.585
JEREMY LIN: Gotcha.

00:46:54.585 --> 00:46:55.084
Very cool.

00:46:55.084 --> 00:46:57.680
SPEAKER 7: I have seen some
of the players in this room,

00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:58.930
including a player down there.

00:46:58.930 --> 00:47:00.860
JEREMY LIN: Nice.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:01.540
I appreciate it.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:08.060
I'll be in Brooklyn, because
I leave the end of this week

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:08.810
to go and train.

00:47:08.810 --> 00:47:10.110
SPEAKER 7: Got it.

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:12.500
JEREMY LIN: But I'm thankful
that you brought it up.

00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.370
It's a league that I'll
keep an eye out for.

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:17.180
And if in the future I'm
in the area or something,

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.580
maybe show some type of support.

00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:20.480
But I appreciate it.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:21.220
Thank you very much.

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:23.370
Yeah, I won't be here
September 10th, unfortunately.

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:23.953
SPEAKER 7: OK.

00:47:23.953 --> 00:47:24.560
Thanks a lot.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:25.665
JEREMY LIN: No problem.

00:47:25.665 --> 00:47:28.123
MARVIN CHOW: All right, we'll
go to the last Dory question.

00:47:28.123 --> 00:47:30.980
How many years of basketball
do you see left in you,

00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.990
and do you still want to
be-- it's not my question.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:40.415
Do you still want to be a pastor
after retiring from basketball?

00:47:40.415 --> 00:47:43.400
Someone's recruiting
for God, I think.

00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:46.700
JEREMY LIN: I don't know how
many years left I want to play.

00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:49.880
I always told
myself I don't want

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.020
to be the type of player
who plays until I'm 40

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.270
and is just a shell of myself.

00:47:55.950 --> 00:47:58.500
But I also really love
the game, so I don't know.

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.660
I feel like as the
time approaches

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:02.940
I'll probably realistically
play until around 35,

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:05.496
God willing that my body
holds up until then.

00:48:05.496 --> 00:48:07.120
And then I used to
want to be a pastor,

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.460
but now I've done a
lot of business stuff.

00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:15.060
And one thing I really cannot
see myself ever doing is going

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.520
back to school.

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:21.600
Like lectures,
books, essays, tests,

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.854
I don't think I can
do it ever again.

00:48:23.854 --> 00:48:25.770
So I don't think I'm
going to do that anymore,

00:48:25.770 --> 00:48:27.620
because seminary--

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:29.370
I think I would probably
do more the route

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:31.770
of spending a lot of time
working with my foundation

00:48:31.770 --> 00:48:32.280
and kids.

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.130
And then I would do some
public speaking type stuff

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:39.150
to share my experiences where I
could share, for example, this.

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:41.130
I'm sharing about who
I am, my faith, and all

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:44.070
these different things without
having to go to school, and--

00:48:44.070 --> 00:48:45.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:47.262
--really just having
to go to school.

00:48:47.262 --> 00:48:49.678
MARVIN CHOW: You're really
looking for the honorary pastor

00:48:49.678 --> 00:48:50.250
[INAUDIBLE].

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:52.372
JEREMY LIN: Pretty much, yeah.

00:48:52.372 --> 00:48:54.080
MARVIN CHOW: All right,
we'll do a couple

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.550
live questions to close it out.

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:56.508
SPEAKER 8: Hey, Jeremy.

00:48:56.508 --> 00:48:57.460
My name is Michael.

00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:59.730
First and foremost, I
want to say your story

00:48:59.730 --> 00:49:01.320
in NBA is very inspiring.

00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:04.380
In some way I say my journey
to Google is similar.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.230
Not as tough.

00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:09.240
But I think going
through those troubles

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.600
and never listening to
the talk and just keep

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:14.880
pursuing your dreams,
I think that's amazing.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.120
My question revolves around
being a good representation

00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.710
of the community.

00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:21.210
Growing up in high
school, I was one

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:26.250
of 20 Asians out of 3,000
kids, one of the only Asians

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.610
in the history of that school
to play basketball and football.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:30.670
And at the time--

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:34.060
I resonate when you say you feel
like you're kind of in a zoo

00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:35.310
and people are looking to you.

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:37.101
Oh, I've never seen an
Asian person before.

00:49:37.101 --> 00:49:40.590
I want to see if the
stereotypes are true.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:43.330
About the time, especially
with 9/11 and all that,

00:49:43.330 --> 00:49:45.270
I was just focused
on being an American.

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:48.330
So you in the NBA now,
I was curious to see

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:51.810
if you could describe the
pressure of being a model,

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:54.630
or being a good representation
of our community.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:56.730
How do you go about
that, day to day?

00:49:56.730 --> 00:49:58.890
I'm sure in the NBA you
have a lot of eyes on you,

00:49:58.890 --> 00:50:01.980
so I'm curious to see what
you do to go about that.

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.810
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:09.340
I always felt consistency and
authenticity are the things

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:12.130
that when I'm done
with it, I want

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.930
to be able to be those things.

00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:19.360
And I think I'm actually a
very controversial player,

00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:21.610
but I'm not controversial
for the reasons

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:22.870
that every other player.

00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:26.080
Any other player who is
as controversial as me,

00:50:26.080 --> 00:50:28.720
it's usually because like they
might have had some cheating

00:50:28.720 --> 00:50:32.922
scandal, or some performance
enhancing, or the dogfighting,

00:50:32.922 --> 00:50:34.130
or the gambling, or whatever.

00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:37.637
There's usually some
off-the-court issue, or the way

00:50:37.637 --> 00:50:39.720
that they handled something,
or them being a diva,

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:41.530
or them fighting
with a teammate.

00:50:41.530 --> 00:50:44.020
That usually creates
the controversy.

00:50:44.020 --> 00:50:46.960
For me it was just
purely because

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.080
of what happened in New York,
and because I was Asian.

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:56.020
At first I didn't want
anything to do with it,

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.360
because every time
people would be like,

00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:00.790
man, you're playing
well and you're Asian.

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:02.080
Tell me about being Asian.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:05.080
It's like, why can't you talk
about me just playing well?

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:07.550
Why can't I just be
like everybody else?

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:10.150
But now I wear it like a badge.

00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.360
It's like, yeah, I am Asian.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:16.420
Like, I love being
Asian, and I'm

00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.037
going to represent
us the right way.

00:51:18.037 --> 00:51:19.370
I'm going to play the right way.

00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:21.910
I'm going to work
as hard as I can.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.010
I'm going to treat my
teammates the right way.

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:27.670
And then hopefully, when
it's all said and done,

00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:29.350
hopefully after
this season, people

00:51:29.350 --> 00:51:31.090
will be able to
say, hey, you know

00:51:31.090 --> 00:51:32.770
what, we slept on him again.

00:51:32.770 --> 00:51:35.320
Because I feel like, for
me, the last few seasons

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:37.584
have been really
difficult with my role,

00:51:37.584 --> 00:51:39.250
or different things
I was going through,

00:51:39.250 --> 00:51:40.416
and last year with injuries.

00:51:40.416 --> 00:51:42.820
And I feel like I've been
waiting for one chance

00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.667
to really knock the
door down again.

00:51:46.667 --> 00:51:48.250
So I'm just trying
to stay consistent.

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:49.720
If the opportunity
ever comes and I

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:54.835
can break the door down again
and have a breakout year

00:51:54.835 --> 00:51:57.550
or lead a team to do
something amazing,

00:51:57.550 --> 00:52:00.010
I feel like that would
be the best thing I

00:52:00.010 --> 00:52:01.870
could do to represent Asians--

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:06.930
not saying a bunch of
stuff, or whatever.

00:52:06.930 --> 00:52:09.260
It's just like, just
do it the right way,

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:12.220
and I feel like eventually
success will come.

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:14.140
People will recognize
it, respect it,

00:52:14.140 --> 00:52:16.660
and then hopefully
I'll make everybody

00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:18.099
who supports me really proud.

00:52:18.099 --> 00:52:19.140
SPEAKER 8: Appreciate it.

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.895
By the way, it really hurt
me when you left the Lakers.

00:52:20.895 --> 00:52:22.650
But I'm going to
support you 100% man.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.950
JEREMY LIN: They didn't want me.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:26.250
I didn't have a choice.

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:28.290
MARVIN CHOW: Not
his choice, yeah.

00:52:28.290 --> 00:52:30.760
All right, we'll do one last
question from the audience

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:32.580
and then we're going
to have to wrap it up.

00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:33.760
SPEAKER 9: Hi, Jeremy.

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.810
Thank you so much for
coming to Google today.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:40.230
And I have a question about
the Chinese player, Zhou Qi.

00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:43.112
So you know Zhou Qi
joins Houston Rockets.

00:52:43.112 --> 00:52:43.820
JEREMY LIN: Yeah.

00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:46.740
SPEAKER 9: Do you have
any suggestions to him?

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:51.330
JEREMY LIN: Yeah,
obviously he needs

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:54.530
to get bigger, stronger,
all that, which

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:58.590
is pretty much one of the
issues of every young player.

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:03.120
But then my advice would
be believe you belong.

00:53:03.120 --> 00:53:06.600
When I played for the
Warriors, I didn't believe it,

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:08.220
and that's why I sucked.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:11.130
And when I got to
New York, that's

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:13.620
when I actually
believed I could do it.

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:16.140
So if I missed my
first five shots,

00:53:16.140 --> 00:53:19.980
I didn't really care, because
I knew I was good enough.

00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:21.480
When I played pick-up
in the summer,

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.855
if I missed my first five
shots I don't even think.

00:53:23.855 --> 00:53:25.230
I'm shooting the
next 20, I don't

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.390
care, because it's pick-up.

00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:29.640
But I had to take
that mindset of I

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.880
believe I'm a great player.

00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.130
I believe I'm the best player.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:35.230
I believe I need whatever, that
self-confidence, taking that

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:38.520
to an NBA floor, which
honestly took me a lot longer.

00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:41.970
And I didn't realize
it, but again, that's

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:45.380
one of the subconscious
ways where race affects me.

00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:48.920
I didn't really
understand how hard

00:53:48.920 --> 00:53:50.919
it was for me to
believe that I belonged,

00:53:50.919 --> 00:53:52.460
because when I looked
around I didn't

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.279
see anybody who looked like me.

00:53:54.279 --> 00:53:56.570
And so if Zhou Qi can get to
the point where he's like,

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:57.236
well, it's cool.

00:53:57.236 --> 00:53:58.000
I'm not in China.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.440
I'm not in the CBA, but
I'm as good or better

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:01.520
than these guys--

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:06.230
that will do more for
his game than any skill.

00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:07.105
SPEAKER 9: Thank you.

00:54:07.105 --> 00:54:08.271
MARVIN CHOW: Thanks so much.

00:54:08.271 --> 00:54:10.170
Well, Jeremy, I mean,
you are an inspiration.

00:54:10.170 --> 00:54:11.071
You're a trailblazer.

00:54:11.071 --> 00:54:13.070
I think we really appreciate
you spending time--

00:54:13.070 --> 00:54:15.089
the honesty, the genuineness.

00:54:15.089 --> 00:54:16.130
Hope you come back again.

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:18.110
So everyone, please give
it up for Jeremy Lin.

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:19.026
JEREMY LIN: Thank you.

00:54:19.026 --> 00:54:21.160
[APPLAUSE]
