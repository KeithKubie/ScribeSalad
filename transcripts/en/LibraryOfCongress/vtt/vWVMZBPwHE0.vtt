00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.710
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Hello.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.010
My name is Betsy Peterson.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.070
I'm the Director of the
American Folklife Center here

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.370
at the library.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.770
And I'm pleased to welcome
you today to the latest

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.520
in our Benjamin Botkin lecture
series here at the library.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.550
The Botkin series allows
the American Folklife Center

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.440
to present the work of
leading scholars in folklore

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.710
at the musicology, oral
history, cultural studies,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.050
while also enhancing
the collections here

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.190
at the American Folklife Center.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.070
For the center and for the
library the lecture series forms

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.780
an important facet of our
acquisitions activities.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.760
Each lecture is videotaped
and becomes part

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.910
of the permanent collection
here at the Folklife Center.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:08.160
And in addition, the lectures
are also posted as webcasts

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.270
on the library's website.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.640
So they are available

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.680
to internet patrons
throughout the world

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.810
and for future generations.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.290
So with that said, please
turn off any cellphones

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.580
or any electronic devices
that you might have.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.500
That would be terrific.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.990
Now, today I have
the wonderful honor

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.390
of introducing the distinguished
musicologist, theorist

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.420
and ethnomusicologist;
Nancy Yunhwa Rao.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.290
Doctor Rao is Associate
Director of Academic Studies,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.530
head of the Composition
Program and head

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.250
of the Music Theory Program
in the Mason Gross School

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.490
of the Arts at New
Jersey's Rutgers University.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.810
That's a mouth full.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.640
[laughter] She is has also
produced award winning research

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.660
on a range of topics including;
gender in music, sketch studies,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.220
music modernism,
cultural fusion in music,

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.280
racial representations,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.630
the music of early Chinese
Americans, and the life

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.930
and contributions

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.060
of the American composer
Ruth Crawford Seeger --

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.320
whose collection is
here at the library.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.260
Her publications have
provided innovative,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.160
analytical approaches
to cross-cultural music

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.410
and enhanced public discussions

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.070
about cultural encounters
in music.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.900
Through her scholarship as well

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.240
as through her teaching she
has also promoted diversity

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.920
and advanced knowledge and
dialogue about the complexity

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.210
of diversity issues
in music scholarship.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.710
Clearly Nancy Rao is one
of the leading scholars

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.090
in Chinese American
music studies.

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.960
And as a music theorist, Rao
has explored intersections

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.260
between China and the West, in
particular global perspectives

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.640
in contemporary Chinese music.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.190
She's also published, on the use
of music; gestures, vocal style,

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.110
and percussion patterns
of Beijing opera

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.130
in contemporary music by
composers of Chinese origin.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.860
So today Professors Rao --

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.920
[laughing] Professor
Rao's latest book,

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.710
"Chinese Opera Theater in North
America," which is the basis

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.010
of today's talk,
was just published

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.140
by the University
of Illinois Press.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.570
It highlights the
colorful, the complex

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.840
and previously neglected
musical history

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.330
of Chinese theater
in North America.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.620
In preparing the book she
received an MEH Research

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.270
Fellowship and an ACLS Scholar

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.840
in China Fellowship
for this project.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.390
And I must add, she also
received an American Folklife

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.300
Center Parson's Award to do some

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.110
of her research here
at the library.

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.510
Following the lecture Doctor
Rao will be signing copies

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.980
of her book out in the foyer.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.000
So please I want to encourage
you to go out and buy a copy,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.010
talk with Professor Rao.

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.300
Today she'll be speaking
on the fantastic worlds

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.770
of Chinese opera
theater in North America.

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.510
So please join me in
welcoming Nancy Rao.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:20.470
[ Applause ]

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:21.770
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao:
Thank you Betsy

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.070
for that wonderful introduction.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.220
I'm very humbled by it.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.000
It is a great pleasure
and honor to be here.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.500
This is truly a wonderful
occasion for me

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.520
to visit the Library
of Congress again.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.740
Last time I came here
was five years ago.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.750
I came as a Parson's
Fellow and had a great time.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.320
[laughter] I'm happy
today to share

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.990
with you the little
known history

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:46.830
of Chinatown Opera Theater in
North America around the 1920s.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.130
The little known history

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.190
of Chinatown Opera
Theater is actually a world

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.270
of fantastic spectacle,
music and magic.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.160
I would like to take
the opportunity also

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.050
to thank Nancy Gross
for the invitation

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.460
and for arrangement
of the logistics.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.220
Today I'm going to first map
out a brief history and network

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.640
of Chinatown Theaters.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.270
Then I will introduce
their repertoire,

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.740
production, music and actresses.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:16.660
And then I will discuss their
relationship with the community.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.610
And finally, to provide a
few observations to elucidate

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.130
or define the impact of
Chinatown Opera Theaters.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.400
I like to start my lecture today

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.070
with a composite
picture of eight images.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.980
There is no reason that you
should recognize them all,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.500
but you might know a few.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.440
I think collecting them here
allowed us to enter this world

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.930
of Chinese opera
in North America

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.320
in its historical context.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.050
You probably recognize
Anna May Wong on the top,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.460
the famous Chinese American
actress who came to fame in 1924

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:56.760
when she performed
with Douglas Fairbanks

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.900
in "The Thief of Baghdad."

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.140
She also is shown here in
a costume for a production

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.440
of "Petunias Toronto."

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.070
You may also recognize Milan
Fong [phonetic] next to her.

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.400
She was a famous Peking opera
singer performing female roles.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.080
Regarded the most famous
Peking opera singer

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.110
of the twentieth century, Milan
Fong had a three month visit

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.750
to the United States in 1930s.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.630
These pictures came from
that particular tour.

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:31.160
On the second row
is Alisha Fong,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.240
[phonetic] the most celebrated
Cantonese opera actress in China

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.020
around the 1910s and 20s.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.820
In 1927 she came to North
America for two years,

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.520
performing in Chinatown
Theaters of many cities.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.270
And then here is Wang Indian,

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:52.820
[phonetic] a Cantonese opera
star who began performing

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:56.290
in North America in
Vancouver in 1921.

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.450
She also came to the
United States in 1923.

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:01.360
She travelled across
the Pacific many times

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.920
in the following three
decades and eventually returned

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:08.340
to America again in 1961
to settle in San Francisco

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.820
until she died in 1979.

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.140
Then we have Modan Su,

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.620
[phonetic] a very popular
Cantonese opera singers

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.930
who perform both male
and female roles.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.340
Arriving first in 1926 in San
Francisco, she reigned later

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.600
in New York City's theater until
the theater burned down in 1929.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.500
She eventually also
settled in New York City.

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.610
These are all iconic figures
with different contingents

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:42.480
of American society
around 1920s and 30s.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.160
For audiences of that era
these images invoke certain

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.950
imaginations about the
world of Chinese opera.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.030
Today however, I would like
to tell the story of one.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.470
Of course Anna May Wong
found success in Hollywood

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.270
when her appearance in silent
films brought spotlight to her.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.200
And Milan Fong captivated a
New York with each performance

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.650
on Broadway and went
on to six other cities,

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:10.220
receiving even an
honored doctorate degree

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.750
from Pomona College.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:16.640
But an even more spectacular
world of Chinese opera existed,

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.140
fully and daily in American
cities from the early 1920s

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.900
and well into the 1930s.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.710
Six Chinese Theaters were
established in a very short span

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.270
of three years starting in 1922,

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.770
mobilizing an active
performing network

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.730
like the ones I show here.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.640
English newspapers greeted
the arrival of the theaters

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:46.200
and troupes with enthusiasm.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:50.720
The first one you see is the San
Francisco and the Toronto Star

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:58.470
as well as a New York
Times showing of these.

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:01.220
The cities had strong support
for Cantonese opera performance,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.910
as reflected on the
playbills as well.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.000
So this one is from Vancouver.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.520
I'm so happy to show all of this

00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.110
because I couldn't include
all of them in my book.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.160
[laughter] So this one is from
Vancouver, as you can see.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.260
And this one's from
Victoria, British Columbia.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.300
And this one's from Portland.

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:20.880
They have similar
ones from Portland.

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:22.430
This is one of them.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.750
And this is from Seattle, and
we'll talk about this later.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:29.450
This one from San Francisco,
which is a Mandarin theater.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:32.330
And this one is also
from San Francisco,

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.120
it's Great China Theater.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.960
And we also have here
from New York City,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.500
I particularly show
one that's actually

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:43.210
from a celebrated
festival, so it's in red,

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.510
which is quite uncommon.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:47.090
And then we have
one from Honolulu.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.710
And last, but not
least is from Havana.

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.630
And this one is the
only one that exists

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:55.160
that I could find
that's from Havana.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.400
So, as you can see, performers
were correct by these playbills,

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.560
some of which were
actually printed daily

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.980
for many many years.

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:07.020
So the 1920s was in fact
the second golden period

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:09.340
of Chinese opera in
the United States.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.240
The first was in 1870s.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.060
As early as in 1852 Cantonese
opera troupe came to perform

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.380
in the United States,
following in the footsteps

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:22.310
of the Chinese migration.

00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:24.280
Many more trips soon followed.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.770
Their performance became popular
entertainment in the frontiers.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:31.210
By the late 1870s, their
first golden period,

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.210
there were four Chinese
theaters running concurrently

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.470
in San Francisco.

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:40.080
Yet, after the US Congress
passed the Chinese Seclusion Act

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:43.190
in 1882, the government
tightened the boarder

00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.190
and literally closed
down the pipeline

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.870
for Chinese actors
and troupes to come.

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:53.380
After 1906 earthquake and the
fire in San Francisco burned

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.900
down the last existing theaters,

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:57.230
there would be no
professional Chinese theaters

00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:59.840
in that city for 18 years.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.770
Our turning point came in
the late 1910s however,

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:07.740
when entertainment
impresario intervened

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.380
and seek the admission
of Chinese actors

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:13.870
to the United States to
perform -- guess where --

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:16.470
in Vaudeville Circus [laughter]

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:19.560
or other theatrical
entertainment.

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.380
Indeed, Chinese acts

00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.990
in acrobatic shows
were extremely popular,

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:27.660
so somewhat ironically,
through the effort of circuses

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.180
such as Barnum and Bailey
or Ringling Brothers,

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.530
Chinese actors were
again allowed

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:37.770
to enter the United States under
a bond for 1,000 dollars each,

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:39.580
for a length of stay
of six months

00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:42.180
and renewable up to three years.

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:46.130
With that Cantonese opera
returned to the United States.

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:51.770
In 1922, October, the first
troupe to return performed

00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:55.890
at Vaudeville Burlesque Theater,
the Crescent, in San Francisco.

00:11:55.890 --> 00:12:00.620
The second troupe performed in
Orpheum Theatre, in Seattle.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.350
And at Portland the
Casino Theater hosted

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.600
to Cantonese opera troupe.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.960
In New York the immigrant
theater, Bowery,

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.740
became the home to
Cantonese opera.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:17.250
Even more significantly
though, new theaters were built.

00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:20.760
A beautiful, brand new Mandarin
theater opened in Grant Avenue

00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.050
in San Francisco in 1924.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:27.550
You can see this is a
postcard of that theater.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.190
And from here you can
see the people looking

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:33.530
at pictures hanging on
the wall at the entrance.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:37.080
So I hope that you can see
this is actually a rendition

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:39.280
of this corner.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.170
And then, a year later,

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.310
the Great China Theater
opened on Jackson Street.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:47.160
They both had around 800 seats

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.500
and offered daily
performances with playbills.

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:52.160
The theater players
was distributed

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.200
at lunchtime every day to the
stores throughout Chinatown

00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.200
and at three o'clock the
box office would open.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.500
Margaret Leonne,
[assumed spelling] one

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:06.740
of the persons I interviewed,
she was a daughter of a tailor

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:08.680
in San Francisco China Town.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.980
She remembered her dad --

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.100
she and her sisters found
out about what shows

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.230
and performers would be
featured that evening

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:20.110
from playbills delivered to
their tailor shop every day.

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:23.300
Opera theaters were woven into
daily life of community again

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.650
and became a cultural
institution.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:31.580
In fact, because it was so woven
into the daily life from public

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:37.000
to private to even personal and
legal status, today we are able

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.810
to construct this lively history
from a variety of sources.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.810
So here are some sources
I'd like to share with you.

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:46.770
The first is immigration papers.

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.370
This is the card that they
carry from the moment it arrives

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:52.160
and these are the bond papers.

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.250
And what's really wonderful
for a researchers is

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.030
that on this bond paper
there's Chinese names.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:59.840
So we can finally
realize who had come.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.710
And this is the situation that
newspapers and advertisement --

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.770
this is the China Youth --

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:10.640
Youth China and this is the
advertisement on that newspaper.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:15.270
This is a playbill, much better
preserved with synopsis, casts.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:19.720
And this is also another one
from Great China Theaters.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:21.210
This is the Mashigen,
[phonetic] one

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:23.450
of the most famous
Cantonese opera.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:25.340
This is Gwen India,
[phonetic] whose picture we have

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.640
seen before.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.710
These are both stage pictures.

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:32.570
Print, as you can see,

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:34.980
and [unintelligible] culture
played an important role.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.590
With the advancement of print
media many Chinese newspapers

00:14:38.590 --> 00:14:40.450
were published in North America.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.710
They contributed to the
success of the theaters both

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.130
by dissemination of the
content, the daily advertisement

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.820
of the theater programs,
and the opera recordings,

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.800
and by the fact that
their printing facility --

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.380
equipped with Chinese
character blocks --

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.100
also produced daily
playbills and thin pamphlets.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.370
A steady production of
photographs of the performers

00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:05.720
in stages helped shape
the beautiful culture

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:09.050
of Cantonese opera as well.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:12.630
Photography story reels,
such as the Mace Studio,

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.590
[assumed spelling] of San
Francisco, became partners

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.350
with Chinese Theaters.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.980
Today you can see several
studies of main studio

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:23.940
in Chinese American
art collections.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.140
The theaters produced
different opera every evening.

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.550
That's their tradition.

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.800
Performing both classical
repertoire,

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:39.420
such as the heart-wrenching
story of Madam Wiselink,

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.770
[phonetic] lovelorn in the red
chamber or the famous battle

00:15:43.770 --> 00:15:45.640
of the quintessential
warrior, Gwangon,

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.430
[phonetic] which you
can see over here.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.030
He looks very fearsome,
isn't he?

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:52.520
[laughter] And more
recent, trendy,

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.150
and contemporary aura bring
innovation and a sense

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:59.020
of modernity to the stage,
either combining current events

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:02.050
or stories with the traditional
opera practice or weaving

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.690
in stories of European
and American characters.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:09.610
So you can see in this
picture we have this figure.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.150
I have no idea what he's doing
there, but obviously he's able

00:16:13.150 --> 00:16:17.530
to play a role in this
particular traditional

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:19.910
period clothes.

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.900
People who dress in those.

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.890
And these -- you may
not be able to tell --

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:27.700
but it is not typical for
Cantonese opera theater stage

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:34.120
because it actually is a
cinema kind of a picture.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:38.270
You have a square over here
and she's obviously singing

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.770
about something that she
missed, someone she's --

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:45.440
you know wanted to
see or dream about.

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:49.460
And that person's going to be
shown here through projection

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.450
from behind the stage.

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:58.090
So you can see that the cinema
technique is also being adopted

00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:00.350
in these things.

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.810
So, regardless of their stories,

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:05.610
the theaters were heavily
invested in an apparatus

00:17:05.610 --> 00:17:08.410
for producing theatrical
illusions,

00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.920
creating a variety
of magical affect.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.030
When taking part in the new
scene of American entertainment,

00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:17.400
Chinatown Theaters were well
aware of possible consumption

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.460
of Chinese opera as
entertainment for everyone.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.110
They prepared for the
mainstream society

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:25.950
as a cultural interlocutor.

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:29.040
The earliest troupes
wrote bilingual playbills

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.520
for a mixed audience.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.820
So here's an example.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:33.890
We saw this in Seattle, right?

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:37.340
And now you see that on
the front page is this

00:17:37.340 --> 00:17:40.690
and then you have
on the back is this.

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:41.990
And here's another one.

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:44.910
On the front page
is this one and then

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:49.190
on the back you have
the English version.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.820
The stage was decided with
a contemporary sensibility

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:56.280
of realism, in many ways if the
troupe adapted its performance

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.960
for the consumption
of mainstream America.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.050
It was often serious and often
grand presentation of opera --

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:08.550
the opera with some of the best
performers in the profession.

00:18:08.550 --> 00:18:11.950
Now, here's some time
that we will be thinking

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:13.870
about this sound.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:17.810
An opera aria, like this
one from Madam Wise Make,

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.200
[phonetic] were performed
at a theater,

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.650
played on a record,
and sung by fans.

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:24.090
So I thought I'll give
you a little glimpse

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:25.800
of what it sounds like.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.080
This is one couplet and
this is, you know the first

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.440
and the second verse
of that couplet.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.810
So the aria has 10
couplets like that.

00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:38.490
And, as you can see, on
the right is the Chinese.

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:41.000
Chinese -- classical
Chinese in particular --

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.300
is very condensed, right?

00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:45.240
[laughing] So just three
words takes this many words

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.350
to [laughter] explain.

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.080
So by counting you
can see the structure

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.190
of the verse is three,
three, two, two.

00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:55.450
So it's 10 character
verse, right?

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:57.110
Next one is a little bit tricky

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.740
because you have two
[unintelligible] word there.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.890
So take my word for
it again, you have to.

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:03.700
So we're going to listen to
this and I hope it will work.

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:05.000
Let's see.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.820
So what we will have
time to listen

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:11.400
to is only the first verse
of this first couplet.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.210
And the first words will
take about three minutes.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:18.230
So 10 words for 10 -- for that.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.650
So let's see, okay.

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:22.950
[singing] [laughter] Thank you.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:28.510
[singing] Okay, now
you're hearing this.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:36.080
[ Singing ]

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.510
So that's the first word
and now the second word.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:48.080
[ Singing ]

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:50.690
So that's the third
word being elaborated.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.510
A little asthmatic, right?

00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:56.330
[ Singing ]

00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:58.020
Now we're the second line.

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.820
So the second three words.

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:10.350
[ Singing ]

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.510
Second word of the
second three words.

00:20:13.510 --> 00:20:39.040
[ Singing ]

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.840
So we are in these
two words now.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:49.050
[ Singing ]

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:50.850
The last two words.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:21:00.040
[ Singing ]

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.340
So this is the last word.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.140
It will take about a minute.

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:48.420
[ Singing ]

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.880
So that's --

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.040
[ Singing ]

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:59.040
So that was the first
verse for the aria

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.310
that will last about 25 minutes.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.360
And Alisha found the person
whose singing was known

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.040
for holding the whole
theater quiet

00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.510
for such long performance
of an aria.

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.960
Because her voice -- aria
-- was very beautiful.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.860
And she has a new style of
singing that's very different

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.720
from the female impersonator
that was before her.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.000
And so I always love
to listen to her.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.990
So the theater relies
on all these stars.

00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:33.260
And from the beginning
the community marvels

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:38.110
at star actresses such as
this one; Chung Futeen.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:40.900
[phonetic] Every one
of them brought in --

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.140
and she was one of the
first ones that came

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:48.290
with mentoring theater
when it first opened.

00:22:48.290 --> 00:22:51.910
Any one of them brought
trunks full of elaborate

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:54.990
and expensive costumes -- and
by the way, the best selection

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.760
of costumes is in UPC,
Museum for Anthropology.

00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.810
They preserved it
very, very well.

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:06.710
And this is a warrior, a
general, of a female character.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.820
And you can't see it, but
she's wearing stilts as well

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:13.200
and the stilts make
her tall like this.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.460
And a performer performing with
stilts can do a lot of jumping,

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.430
bending, and all sorts
of wonderful things.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.510
And those are the
general women --

00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:26.270
women of general roles in the
traditional Chinese opera,

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:31.460
which appear in many different
genre of Chinese opera.

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:33.730
And they were greeted,
these actresses,

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:35.980
with enthusiasm across
the continent.

00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.410
Their presence in Chinatown
Theaters had indelible impact

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.570
on North American and
Chinese community.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.990
And they would argue they
were key to the shaping

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:49.160
of collective social
memory as well.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.370
The reason are manifold.

00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:54.450
The vibrant performing
circuit of North America

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:57.990
in 1920s attracted most
of the top actresses

00:23:57.990 --> 00:24:02.990
from Southern China to embark
on the cross-Pacific voyage.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.510
Being at the highest
level in the profession,

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.830
the artistic presence
defined the level

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.710
of performance at
these theaters.

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.800
Many were recording
artists as well

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.250
and their records were
advertised daily on more

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:19.560
than a dozen Chinese newspapers
published in North America.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:23.520
The wide circulation of their
records ensured many listening

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.420
context outside the
theaters; at home, stores,

00:24:27.420 --> 00:24:31.450
family associations, or just
the streets, and even places

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:36.630
where there were no
Chinese Theaters nearby.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:39.180
Their pictures were also
disseminated through newspapers,

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.630
playbills and even for
sale at the general stores.

00:24:43.630 --> 00:24:46.980
Just as important however,
the daily performances

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.510
and their exalted statute

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:53.850
in the communities these opera
actresses stage persona took

00:24:53.850 --> 00:24:57.180
on the significance
of cultural icon.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.290
The actresses embodied
voice, style and fashion

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:04.820
of a famous female
characters, legendary heroines

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:09.360
such as Mulan Chun Ool,
[phonetic] or Madam White Snake,

00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.010
[assumed spelling] and so on.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:13.950
In other words, the opera
actresses were not merely

00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:17.780
individuals or singers,
they became the icon

00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:21.570
or cultural signs
representing Chinese female.

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:26.010
As a result they contributed
to the internal construction

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:28.790
of identity for Chinese
American community.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.440
A large number of
portraits, stage photos,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:36.400
and scrapbook pages tell the
manifestation of these theaters

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.150
in both the interior world

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:41.790
and the public face
of the community.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:46.610
So here's a scrapbook
of Mudan Soo.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:50.960
[phonetic] This was collected by
Margaret Leonne and her sisters.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.620
And these are pages
that I could find

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:57.140
in that book about one actress.

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:01.020
You can see that they're
the plays -- repertoire --

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.970
that she had and they're the
stage that she's involved in --

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:09.890
all elaborate -- and these
are the individual portraits.

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.510
So with these,

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:17.970
the [unintelligible]
experiences were offered;

00:26:17.970 --> 00:26:20.460
the stories themselves,
the visual image,

00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:25.150
the instrumental sonorities,
the singing voice, the lyrics,

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:29.100
the characters, and moral
principle in different mediums

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:32.120
such that operatic
culture permeated

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:36.780
through the Chinese community
and formed their social memory.

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.220
Chinese American
youths' emulation

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.540
of these performers
were an important part

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:46.130
of how they took control
of their identity as well.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.220
These operatic bodies
were constituted

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:53.690
by stylized performance,
fashion-forward personal attire,

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:57.760
elaborate opera costume,
routine symbolism.

00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.840
Let's take a look
at several example.

00:26:59.840 --> 00:27:01.680
Here's Lucia Fong, [assumed
spelling] that we talk about,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.160
whose voice you just heard.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.620
Here are two appearances
in traditional roles.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:14.360
So in this traditional roles she
represents the quintessential

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:18.240
female model in a traditional
world; a filial daughter,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.490
stately aristocratic
lady, loyal lover or wife,

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.830
or courageous female warrior.

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:31.330
And in this one you see that she
also presents something else,

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.110
and that is clad in
fur and high heels.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.840
She also embodies
contemporary sensibility.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:44.610
However, the two are
woven into each other.

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:48.290
Her warrior costume includes
Chinese [unintelligible]

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:54.620
characteristic armor-like
wardrobe, and pants and sleeves.

00:27:54.620 --> 00:27:57.530
See how they taper to
narrow at wrist and ankles

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.290
for the convenience
of fast movement

00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:02.320
and fighting required
of such character?

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.820
Yet notice the traditional
costume is complimented

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.350
by high heels rather than
the traditional flat feet,

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.240
flower decorated shoes,
like the one on the left,

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:18.000
or this one which is the
stilts -- a pair of stilts.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.430
These stilts, which is
currently collected in a museum

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:23.730
of anthropology near BC.

00:28:23.730 --> 00:28:27.760
You can see that it
actually required the players

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.730
to fit the front of the feet
into the specialized shoes,

00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:35.930
like a stilts to move
basically tiptoes.

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.770
They resulted in slightly
longer legs and the lifting

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:40.700
of the body weight
to higher center

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.550
to immolate certain female gait.

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:45.170
Does that sound familiar

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:48.270
to [laughter] the
high heels tradition?

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:51.440
[laughter] And so the high
heels immolated a set of stilts,

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.890
but at the same time symbolized
a sense of urban modernity.

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:58.000
I'm sure high heels are more
comfortable than stilts.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.300
[laughter] I've seen
one of those.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:01.610
It's really hard.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:06.530
But it is a fascinating
way of performing.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:09.870
I saw one just last
month in Vancouver.

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:13.300
The actress put this
on and was doing a lot

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:15.630
of fantastic operatic movement.

00:29:15.630 --> 00:29:18.240
And here's a quick
comparison as well.

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.450
This is a traditional cape
worn by aristocratic lady

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:25.340
and when she goes
outdoors or representing

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:26.640
that they are going outdoors.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.230
So the typical one
has no trains.

00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:30.500
And you see Alisha
Fung was wearing one

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.200
that has this, right?

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.980
And this obviously
is something else.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:36.580
And this is a headdress.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.790
I say that she has
some traditional one,

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:40.990
but actually much more
traditional would look something

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.480
more like this around her time.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.300
But now she's, you know
obviously echoing back

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:51.400
to the much more extravagant
art deco kind of tradition.

00:29:52.790 --> 00:29:56.700
So as showing an
example of wardrobe,

00:29:56.700 --> 00:29:59.940
the Chinatown Opera Theaters
meticulously went together

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:02.230
diverging styles and fashion.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:05.130
The opera actresses navigated

00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:11.300
and helped her audience navigate
contemporary and traditional,

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.380
social and personal,
and a variety

00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:16.790
of kind of transformation.

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:19.140
Their star quality broadcasted

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:22.330
to these images well
beyond the theater wall.

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:28.350
Exploring the golden era of
Chinatown Theaters in 1920s

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:33.080
with an eye to where it was
projected in iconic images,

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:36.510
brings to light important
social functions fulfilled

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.430
by these performers
and their theaters.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:44.500
Alisha Fung was by far the most
famous Cantonese opera actress

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.740
to have made the residency
in Chinatown Theaters.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:49.270
Her itinerary indicates

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.910
that within two years
she had performed

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:55.910
in at least five cities; San
Francisco, New York, Havana,

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:58.810
Los Angeles, Mexicali.

00:30:58.810 --> 00:31:03.070
However, her itinerary
was typical of actresses

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:06.190
that perform in Cantonese opera
network of North America during

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:11.020
that time, who would typically
graze the stage of many cities,

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:15.700
zigzagged across both
northern and southern borders.

00:31:15.700 --> 00:31:18.740
In addition to their grace
and glamour and vocal beauty,

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.950
Cantonese opera actresses also
symbolized a certain erudite

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.080
in literal -- literary ideal.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.470
Well versed in numerous
classical operas

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:31.580
with beautiful lyrics of
classical Chinese texts,

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:35.740
it is little wonder that they
came to represent the educated.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.310
So as we see in this
[unintelligible] picture

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:43.900
of them singing earlier, she's
holding a book in her hand.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:47.200
And that's very similar
to this advertisement

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:55.060
in a newspaper published in
New York City around 1928.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.030
This is the advertisement
for Opera Record

00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.800
and this is the [unintelligible]
that she's showing in her hand.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.000
And not to mention there
were actually anthologies

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.230
of booklet -- anthology
of lyrics that's published

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:12.700
by the theaters in
North America.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:16.930
Above all of course, the
emotional transcendence,

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:20.020
the opera's ability to
transport its audience,

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:25.370
was key to the significance and
success of these performances,

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:29.430
whether it be the little
boy who was so mesmerized

00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.530
by the triumphant
warrior on stage

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:35.080
that he forgot the
melting candy in his hand,

00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:38.800
or the little girl whose
face was wet with tears

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.730
from watching the
moving performance

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:44.440
of a familiar legend on stage.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:48.840
The theater tradition
had indelible influence

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.520
on their daily life
including many --

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:56.300
and these include many
novelists and dramatists.

00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.790
We will find a proper type
of Cantonese opera figures

00:33:00.790 --> 00:33:03.760
in Mexing Hong Kingston's
[phonetic] "A Woman Warrior,"

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.810
which is based on Mulan.

00:33:07.810 --> 00:33:11.540
By considering the historical
performance and performances

00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:16.280
in Chinatown Opera Theaters
of the 1920s I call attention

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.060
to a golden era of Cantonese
opera in North America,

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:24.690
one that came to shape many
dimensions of American life.

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:28.400
For a very long time
the theaters and objects

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:31.790
that were used to facilitate
the wonderful performances,

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:37.070
such as [unintelligible] plot
or lines, music, costume, set,

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:41.040
stage props, and so on
disappeared into obscurity

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:44.240
and gathered dust in
forgotten corners.

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.380
Yet they are everywhere
in Chinese communities all

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:50.650
over different American cities.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:54.070
It was a shear operatic
world and sonnet culture

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:59.500
which Chinese communities
and large net family kinship

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:02.490
in North America were
connected despite being

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:05.630
geographically dispersed.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.760
Indeed, Cantonese opera
set root in North America

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.060
as a theater core
and entertainment,

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:13.570
much like other immigrant
theaters in the United States,

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.340
as the only prominent,
public entertainment

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:19.170
in Chinese communities in 1920s.

00:34:19.170 --> 00:34:22.430
Cantonese opera performance
did not just attract immigrants

00:34:22.430 --> 00:34:25.720
who attend out of nostalgia.

00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.190
With their popularity
and stellar performance,

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:33.660
Chinatown Theaters attracted
new audiences to Cantonese opera

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:37.560
as well, those who attend
because they were the talk

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.640
of the town -- a
famous celebrity --

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.480
those who attend for the Chinese
identity it symbolized --

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:48.210
which the Chinese
teacher encouraged --

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:49.660
and last, but not least,

00:34:49.660 --> 00:34:53.360
the second generation
Chinese American also came

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.990
because the theaters
were, for them,

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:59.310
everything from playground
to education.

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:04.300
Therefore, from dealmakers,
merchants, store owners,

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:08.990
to laborers, and from woman to
children audiences of all ages

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:13.040
and professions formed the
base of theater's audience.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.250
With an ordinary glamour,

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:17.590
by the end of the 1920s
Chinatown Theaters

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:21.290
in North America have
become a well-oiled machine

00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:26.090
of trans-Pacific operation,
incorporating the steady flow

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:28.490
of professional talent
from China

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:31.580
into the local social milieu.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.230
Their talent, glamour
and skills were key

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.370
to the community's
loyalty to the theaters.

00:35:38.370 --> 00:35:40.570
Regardless of the
length of their stay,

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:44.380
their rigorous marshalling
of singing, acting, dancing,

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:47.290
and other skills established
a practice in theaters

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:51.290
and formed a large
repository of theater music.

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:55.170
Greater variety of a repertoire
resulted from the growth

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:58.500
of new titles and decrease
in classical repertoire,

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.290
a mixture of modern, hybrid
of classic and modern,

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:06.540
and of another novel production
were frequent and popular.

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:12.780
In 1930s and 40s these same
well-oiled machine worked

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:18.530
to generate the earliest Chinese
American cinema, like this one.

00:36:18.530 --> 00:36:23.600
And this opera was actually
about Chinese theaters.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:27.320
These Chinatown Opera Theaters
also influenced American

00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:30.400
modernism in a variety
of performing arts,

00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:34.180
from dance theater
to music and so on.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.360
Growing up near Chinese
theaters,

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:39.550
American ultima modernist
composer Henry Cowell was

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.830
attracted to a type of
sliding tone in Chinese opera,

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:47.460
which he used as the theoretical
foundation to apply to pitch,

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:50.900
rhythm and dynamic
in fascinating ways.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:53.940
And that theory became
an important aesthetic

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:59.270
in later part of modern
composition in the century.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:02.740
His two students, John
Cage and Lou Harrison,

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:06.030
frequented the Mandarin
Theater in San Francisco,

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:09.240
which experience inspired
their collaborated work,

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:13.910
"Double Music" in 1941 that
became a pioneering work

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:16.780
in the new percussion
repertoire.

00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.560
In addition, in 1920s jazz
musicians adopt Cantonese opera

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:23.920
drum as their percussion
instrument,

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:28.600
such that you can find them sold
-- on sale in the magazine --

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.010
the trade magazine
around that time.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.270
Well we considered a long and
rich history of Cantonese opera

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:40.610
in North America, its social
significance becomes apparent.

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:43.640
The opera theater accompanied
Chinese migration to take part

00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:46.950
in a nation building,
constructed the railroad,

00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:49.620
establishing every
cultural and salon.

00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:52.300
And the trans-Pacific music
culture has long been part

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.650
of American music landscape.

00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:58.370
And Chinatown Opera Theater
is a splendid chapter

00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:00.610
of American music history.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:04.340
To understand this history of
Chinatown Theater, its legends,

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:07.430
styles, practice,
and audiences is

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:10.620
to understand an important part
of American cultural space.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:12.420
Thank you.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:21.250
[ Applause ]

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:22.550
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: Would
you take some questions?

00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:23.850
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Sure.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:25.650
Yes.

00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:33.410
[ Inaudible Exchange ]

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:34.710
Sure. [inaudible] Okay.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.220
&gt;&gt; You said at the
beginning and the end

00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:39.660
that it was Cantonese opera.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:42.230
Was that the case with
all the Chinatowns?

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:45.330
Even the ones that were named,
you know Mandarin Theater?

00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:47.950
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Oh!

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:50.020
[laughing] [inaudible questions]
Yes, Mandarin Theater has --

00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:56.210
The question was; were all these
theaters performing Cantonese

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:59.340
opera, even the theater was
named the Mandarin Theater?

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.640
Yes, indeed.

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:02.880
The Mandarin Theater
is just a name.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.150
It has nothing to do
with Mandarin Chinese.

00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:09.320
And there were Peking
Opera performed all over

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:15.820
but in much more -- there
-- let me put it this way;

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.430
Peking Opera was
performed by some immature

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:23.170
around different parts
of the Chinese community,

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:26.190
but not so much by professional,

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.730
and certainly not
establishing theater --

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.060
professional theaters.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.300
And the reason I
say that is because,

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.870
for example in New York City,
we have Columbia University,

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:40.340
which attracted a group of
Chinese intellectuals coming

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:42.300
from another part of China.

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:46.150
And we have in Chinatown,
which has a long tradition

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.320
of immigrants coming
from Southern China,

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:52.490
who spoke you know Cantonese.

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:56.540
So they enjoyed different
kind of music in some ways.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.230
So the people in uptown would
be performing Peking Opera

00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:04.930
and they were the people
who facilitate the visit

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:08.360
of May Long Fung, the
famous Peking Opera singer.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:14.170
But you know when he came
to perform actually it was

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.760
through the help of Cantonese
Opera Theater people.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:20.590
[laughing] Because guess what;
for each of these performers

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:23.280
to come in it needs to be
sponsored by a theater.

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.390
So who sponsored him?

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:26.830
The Cantonese Opera Theater.

00:40:26.830 --> 00:40:30.860
So it's kind of connected,
but not very --

00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:32.940
not the same audience.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:34.240
Yes.

00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:39.640
&gt;&gt; I wondered, how much did
the [unintelligible] adopt the

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.320
American stage, vaudeville
at the time

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:44.790
or other Broadway performances?

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:50.530
Did they I guess adopt
some of the methods?

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:54.750
[unintelligible] or stick
to these stage performances?

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.050
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Yeah.

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.840
So; how much of the
Chinese Opera Theaters

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.030
in the United States
adopted vaudeville

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.740
and Broadway type of stage?

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:05.210
And I would say that's a
really complicated question.

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:11.230
The complicated question in --
because of historical moment.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.010
To begin with, what you see,

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:16.810
these are fantastic
stage productions, right?

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:19.140
More fantastic than one
can possibly imagine.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.660
Now, I mentioned that
traditional Chinese stage was

00:41:22.660 --> 00:41:25.880
like no backdrop of any kind.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:29.780
No stage prop of --
one stick is enough

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:31.890
to represent a horse, right?

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.680
[laughing] So it's very,
very symbolic that way.

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:40.810
Abstract. But the move to
a more realism and stage,

00:41:40.810 --> 00:41:46.680
you know machinery to have
fancy lightbulb and that kind

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.230
of stuff did not start
in North America.

00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:52.730
So they started in Shanghai.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.670
So when they started in
Shanghai, from what I read,

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:00.070
Shanghai newspapers said
it came from Hong Kong.

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:01.610
And I have not gone to Hong Kong

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:07.350
to study what Hong Kong
newspapers say, but it's --

00:42:07.350 --> 00:42:10.740
suffice to say, when
these opera singers came

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.950
to the United States
they brought with them,

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:17.090
not only the tradition,
you know?

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:18.390
Stage production.

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:22.220
But also the new one
that's already popular

00:42:22.220 --> 00:42:26.580
in the cosmopolitan cities
like Shanghai and Hong Kong.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:31.570
However, I must say the
thing in America being

00:42:31.570 --> 00:42:35.150
around the Roaring 20s when
Broadway production was

00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:37.050
at its height you know,

00:42:37.050 --> 00:42:41.720
it's obviously something
that's going to have an impact.

00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:46.500
So I would say, "Yes, I think
they have adopted a lot more."

00:42:46.500 --> 00:42:49.390
And I didn't show you
more of this scrapbook.

00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:53.050
The scrapbook is full of
fantastic pictures of stage

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.710
and some you just scratch
your head and think,

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:58.930
"What on earth could
the story be?"

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:00.820
[laughter] It looks so crazy.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:06.020
So I think there is a kind
of extravagant, you know --

00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:11.930
that I do not, or I suspect, is
not existent yet in Shanghai.

00:43:11.930 --> 00:43:16.140
But I think it is a complicated
situation like that, yeah.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:18.940
So -- Yes.

00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:26.000
&gt;&gt; I was just wondering, you
know the shoes with the stilts,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:32.100
it looked like it's
shoes for flat feet.

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.400
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Yes.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.370
Yeah. Definitely.

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:37.010
It looks very much like so.

00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.960
And in fact, those still shoes
I think it's even more difficult

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.930
than ballet shoes because
they are both the toe

00:43:45.930 --> 00:43:49.750
and then a little bit
of ball of the foot.

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.030
It looks so excruciatingly
difficult to wear them.

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:56.600
So yeah. It may be bound foot.

00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:05.010
&gt;&gt; So some of them
maybe had bound feet?

00:44:05.010 --> 00:44:08.550
Still? They -- I'm old enough

00:44:08.550 --> 00:44:12.820
to have seen people
with bound feet.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.120
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Oh, okay.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.540
&gt;&gt; That's why I recognized them.

00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.200
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Oh, I see.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:23.060
&gt;&gt; Although I didn't think this
time period [unintelligible]

00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:26.210
Chinese have found
[unintelligible].

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:27.510
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Right.

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.510
I suspect it's not the case
because I've seen those --

00:44:31.510 --> 00:44:36.370
how you put one of those on
and you put a natural feet

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:37.890
in those stilts actually.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:39.190
It has a way --

00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:40.490
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.

00:44:40.490 --> 00:44:41.790
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: So,
you actually put the wood --

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:43.090
so your foot was like this.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:44.390
The foot was like this.

00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:49.030
So -- and they used
cloth to wrap around it.

00:44:49.030 --> 00:44:51.240
And only the person
who's wearing can wrap

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:54.310
that because no one else can
wrap it in exactly the same,

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:58.590
you know tightness that
would be comfortable.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:01.130
So, yeah. It's related I
think, but I think it's --

00:45:01.130 --> 00:45:03.890
I have a colleague who's
going to do a study on that.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:06.560
And on top of that, another
thing that's very interesting is

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:13.630
that the stilts are actually
only for female warriors.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.630
&gt;&gt; Well they have -- they'd
have to be for females.

00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:19.930
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Yes,

00:45:19.930 --> 00:45:23.370
but the interesting thing
is not for aristocratic.

00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:24.780
[inaudible] It's
actually for warriors.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.970
So one of the things that's
limiting for those performers is

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:33.220
that once they become the people
who wear stilts, specializing,

00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:37.170
they specialized also
in warrior roles.

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:39.630
And I think it's the
difficulty of that

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:42.140
that makes it so exciting.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:43.440
[laughing] Yes.

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:47.270
&gt;&gt; Yeah, do the 19 --
especially the 1920s,

00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:50.370
European Americans were sort
of into the exoticism in say,

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:53.390
especially going to
African American [inaudible]

00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:57.980
to see African jazz band.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:45:59.550
Can you talk a little bit

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:05.280
about European Americans
going to Chinese Theater?

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Yes.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:11.070
I think they were people
like, you know John Cage

00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:14.590
and Harry Carter that I was
talking about, that went.

00:46:14.590 --> 00:46:18.360
But at the same time I
think there is also people

00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:23.680
who were really into art in
San Francisco that would go.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.170
And I'll talk about
that a little bit.

00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:28.870
And there were also people
who were -- many tourists.

00:46:28.870 --> 00:46:31.580
So it's a thing to
see in Chinatown.

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.710
And you go to Chinatown there
are two things you need to see;

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:35.910
is the jazz house,
it's Chinese Theaters.

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:39.960
Right? So that was the case
since nineteenth century.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:41.600
But the important thing is

00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:47.230
that in San Francisco there
is a club -- a secret club --

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:48.590
called the Bohemian Club.

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:55.050
So the Bohemian had a lot of
theaters and their theaters,

00:46:55.050 --> 00:46:58.540
I would say, is much
influenced by Chinese Theaters

00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:03.260
because there is a -- there's
an opera called, "Fay Yen Fa,"

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.320
[phonetic] come out
of a Bohemian club.

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:09.330
And he has a great deal of
Chinese Theater influence,

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.380
even including Chinese
characters.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:14.250
So yeah, it's related.

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:15.550
Yes.

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:18.320
&gt;&gt; As far as the impresarios
[inaudible] support the

00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:21.580
productions, particularly
through ticket sales

00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:27.070
or through people who had a
successful or lucrative business

00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:29.600
in some other area like
groceries or textiles

00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.950
or some kind of import.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:35.390
I mean, were they
self-sustaining financially

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.390
or were they requiring cash
from some other source?

00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:40.580
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao:
Yeah, I think it's both.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:43.470
I think anyway these
are business people.

00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:46.040
So it's part of their business.

00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:48.010
Theater is a good business.

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:52.350
And, for example when
Mandarin Theater first opened,

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:55.420
even that first month,
it made something

00:47:55.420 --> 00:48:01.550
like 250,000 dollars in our day.

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:03.140
Right? Even today, right?

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.130
So our -- today's 250,000 or so.

00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:08.120
So it was good business for them

00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:10.220
and that's why they
went into it.

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:14.220
But for a merchant like If
Seng, [phonetic] in Vancouver,

00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:18.340
he also built one just near his
compound -- family compound.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:21.120
So for him it's also
the cultural aspect

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.490
of entertainment.

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:26.260
And that's -- remember the
time when there's nothing other

00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:27.660
than live performance.

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:32.120
Right? So it was the
thing to have around,

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:35.040
and also very much a
kind of public face.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.780
So when they interact
with the outside --

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:41.690
people who are non-Chinese, you
know non-Cantonese speaking,

00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:44.320
they like to think that
this public face is the one

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.730
that is represented in
this cultural symbolism

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.620
that I was talking
about, the opera you know?

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.110
Are able to, you know represent.

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:54.660
So I think it's both.

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:57.030
Yeah. But on top of
that I just want to say,

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:59.480
the theater has 800 seats or so.

00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:05.270
So without the people coming in
every day you cannot sustain it.

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:09.170
So there is definitely a
demand in society for it.

00:49:09.170 --> 00:49:10.470
&gt;&gt; I have another question.

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:11.770
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Okay.

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:13.410
&gt;&gt; I have a lot of questions.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:17.790
I think -- I don't know about
you [inaudible] but I read

00:49:17.790 --> 00:49:22.840
that usually men
played women's roles.

00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.140
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Right.

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.050
&gt;&gt; So there were
only a few women

00:49:28.050 --> 00:49:30.970
who played their own roles.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:32.270
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Right.

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:33.570
So this I did talk
about in my book.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:41.270
And that is to say the Cantonese
Opera was basically male troupes

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:44.520
all the way until
the 1910 or so.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:47.670
So in 1910 was when
female troupes,

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:49.810
you know were allowed on stage.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:54.310
And -- however they need to
be performing separately.

00:49:54.310 --> 00:49:56.920
[laughing] So they cannot
be onstage at the same time.

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.380
So even though we are seeing all
these female and male onstage

00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:03.830
in North America playing
together, in China

00:50:03.830 --> 00:50:11.430
and Hong Kong they were banned
until 1933 and 34, respectively.

00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:13.470
So yeah, you are right.

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:16.890
They were performed by men,
but up until around that time,

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:19.680
the 1910 is when it changed.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:20.980
Okay, thank you.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:24.000
&gt;&gt; Elizabeth Peterson: I want to
think Miss Rao for coming today

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.760
and that was a wonderful
lecture.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.820
And she will be out
signing books afterwards.

00:50:28.820 --> 00:50:30.190
Let's give her a
round of applause.

00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:31.490
[applause]

00:50:31.490 --> 00:50:32.790
&gt;&gt; Nancy Yunhwa Rao: Thank you.

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:34.300
[applause] Thank you.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.510
[ Applause ]

00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:40.140
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
