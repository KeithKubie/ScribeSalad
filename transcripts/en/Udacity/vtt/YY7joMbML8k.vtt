We also had questions about other ways to host your web app.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Right now we're using Google AppEngine, but there are plenty of other alternatives,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and some of them are Amazon AWS, Linode, Rackspace--

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
if you Google web application hosting services, you should probably find

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
many, many options.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Amazon AWS is what Steve uses for Hipmunk.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I believe it's what he used for Reddit as well,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and he really likes AWS, and he would recommend it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
There are plenty of other options, though,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and plenty of other options where you can use Python.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Migrating it from one service to another can be a little bit complicated.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And depending on the size of your web application, it can be worth it,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
or it can be something that you really don't want to do

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
just because it would take your application offline,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
or it'd just be too much complication to deal with at the time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We're going to be talking about that a lot more in Unit 7.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Unit 7 is basically going to be about the problems that Steve has run into himself

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in building web applications and the solutions he came up with,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the solutions he wished he came up with, and things like that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
There were a lot of questions related to that:

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
how to migrate from one service to another,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
how to come up with an idea and pitch it to people,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
how to make sure that lots of people see your site and can find your site.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So we'll be going over all those kinds of questions in Unit 7.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So stick around!
