it did but you know with the UM because

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:33.789
it did but you know with the UM because
 

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:35.610
it did but you know with the UM because
like you said people get sucked into

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:35.620
like you said people get sucked into
 

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:38.760
like you said people get sucked into
books there's been tons of you know the

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:38.770
books there's been tons of you know the
 

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.440
books there's been tons of you know the
stories or whatever people game sucked

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:40.450
stories or whatever people game sucked
 

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:43.350
stories or whatever people game sucked
into you know fiction before the

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360
into you know fiction before the
 

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.050
into you know fiction before the
internet before these but I think there

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:46.060
internet before these but I think there
 

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.860
internet before these but I think there
is something to it's much easier to

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:49.870
is something to it's much easier to
 

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.199
is something to it's much easier to
happen at it's much more available and

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:52.209
happen at it's much more available and
 

00:08:52.209 --> 00:08:55.050
happen at it's much more available and
accessible and even bigger to make these

00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.060
accessible and even bigger to make these
 

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.690
accessible and even bigger to make these
realities seem like realities so I think

00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:57.700
realities seem like realities so I think
 

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.310
realities seem like realities so I think
that's why there's even more attention

00:08:59.310 --> 00:08:59.320
that's why there's even more attention
 

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.560
that's why there's even more attention
now and they're drawing even more focus

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:01.570
now and they're drawing even more focus
 

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:03.000
now and they're drawing even more focus
on it it's because even though this

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.010
on it it's because even though this
 

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.710
on it it's because even though this
stuff did happen before I think it was

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:04.720
stuff did happen before I think it was
 

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.150
stuff did happen before I think it was
with probably a smaller group and now

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160
with probably a smaller group and now
 

00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.370
with probably a smaller group and now
because it's much more accessible and

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:08.380
because it's much more accessible and
 

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.560
because it's much more accessible and
