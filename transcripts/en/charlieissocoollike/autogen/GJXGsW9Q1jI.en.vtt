yeah let's start with a concur now in

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989
yeah let's start with a concur now in
 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.170
yeah let's start with a concur now in
order to spin a concur round and round

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
order to spin a concur round and round
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.729
order to spin a concur round and round
like this you have to hold the string

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
like this you have to hold the string
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.220
like this you have to hold the string
tightly or else it will fly away not

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230
tightly or else it will fly away not
 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.630
tightly or else it will fly away not
only then but the quicker you want to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640
only then but the quicker you want to
 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340
only then but the quicker you want to
spin it the tighter you have to hold the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
spin it the tighter you have to hold the
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.209
spin it the tighter you have to hold the
string sorry makes sense right or you

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219
string sorry makes sense right or you
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.069

could apply this same basic logic to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079
could apply this same basic logic to
 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.069
could apply this same basic logic to
galaxies too for example our galaxy the

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
galaxies too for example our galaxy the
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.399

Milky Way spins around 600,000 miles an
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.380
Milky Way spins around 600,000 miles an
hour so it needs to have an awful lot of

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
hour so it needs to have an awful lot of
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.630
hour so it needs to have an awful lot of
gravitational force at its center to

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
gravitational force at its center to
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.300
gravitational force at its center to
stop it's 100 billion stars from flying

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
stop it's 100 billion stars from flying
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.460
stop it's 100 billion stars from flying
away however here's where things start

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470

to get weird the Milky Way actually

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960
to get weird the Milky Way actually
 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.140
to get weird the Milky Way actually
doesn't have enough gravitational force

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
doesn't have enough gravitational force
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.719
doesn't have enough gravitational force
to hold its stars in orbit in fact and

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729
to hold its stars in orbit in fact and
 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.980
to hold its stars in orbit in fact and
this is true for all of the other

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
this is true for all of the other
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.300
this is true for all of the other
galaxies in the universe

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310
galaxies in the universe
 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.060
galaxies in the universe
the Milky Way only has about 10% of the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
the Milky Way only has about 10% of the
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.819
the Milky Way only has about 10% of the
force it needs to hold itself together

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829
force it needs to hold itself together
 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:33.959
force it needs to hold itself together
so what is holding it together

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:33.969
 
 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.330
 
hey hazel you can still trying to solve

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340
hey hazel you can still trying to solve
 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.800
hey hazel you can still trying to solve
that galaxy problem why are you smiling

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810
that galaxy problem why are you smiling
 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.090
that galaxy problem why are you smiling
you want to know the answer don't try

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100
you want to know the answer don't try
 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.130
you want to know the answer don't try
and fool me jack this is proper science

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140
and fool me jack this is proper science
 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.880
and fool me jack this is proper science
we're doing here

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890
we're doing here
 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.609
we're doing here
yeah I know I'm a proper science person

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619
yeah I know I'm a proper science person
 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.450
yeah I know I'm a proper science person
just like you go and then try me okay

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460
just like you go and then try me okay
 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.520
just like you go and then try me okay
what if the reason we can't detect

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530
what if the reason we can't detect
 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.230
what if the reason we can't detect
what's holding the galaxies together is

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240
what's holding the galaxies together is
 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.969
what's holding the galaxies together is
because the thing that's holding them

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979
because the thing that's holding them
 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.690
because the thing that's holding them
together is get this undetectable

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700
together is get this undetectable
 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.149
together is get this undetectable
particles Wow

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159

undetectable particles you don't like it

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549
undetectable particles you don't like it
 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:08.339
undetectable particles you don't like it
what doesn't it sound a bit like a cough

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:08.349
what doesn't it sound a bit like a cough
 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:09.839
what doesn't it sound a bit like a cough
oh okay yeah maybe it does sound a bit

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849
oh okay yeah maybe it does sound a bit
 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.420
oh okay yeah maybe it does sound a bit
like a cop-out but if we're wrong who's

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430
like a cop-out but if we're wrong who's
 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.710
like a cop-out but if we're wrong who's
gonna know because they're undetectable

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720
gonna know because they're undetectable
 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.949
gonna know because they're undetectable
science and that is dark matter yes it

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959
science and that is dark matter yes it
 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.509
science and that is dark matter yes it
sounds like something that scientists

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519
sounds like something that scientists
 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.360
sounds like something that scientists
made up because they got stuck but these

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
made up because they got stuck but these
 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.559
made up because they got stuck but these
undetectable particles really do exist

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569
undetectable particles really do exist
 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.690
undetectable particles really do exist
which we know because although we can't

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700
which we know because although we can't
 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.240
which we know because although we can't
see them we can see their gravitational

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250
see them we can see their gravitational

kind of a mean name for scientists to

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670
kind of a mean name for scientists to
 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.220
kind of a mean name for scientists to
give the particles just because they

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230
give the particles just because they
 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.020
give the particles just because they
haven't been able to detect the bits but

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030
haven't been able to detect the bits but
 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.780
haven't been able to detect the bits but
then the question becomes will we ever

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790
then the question becomes will we ever
 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.879
then the question becomes will we ever
be able to find this stuff well we're

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889
be able to find this stuff well we're

far they've come up short estimates are
 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.150
far they've come up short estimates are
that we should probably be able to find

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160
that we should probably be able to find
 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.550
that we should probably be able to find
them sometime in the next ten years but

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560
them sometime in the next ten years but
 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.809
them sometime in the next ten years but
if we don't

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819
if we don't
 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.729
if we don't
well the scarier prospect is that we

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739
well the scarier prospect is that we
 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.710
well the scarier prospect is that we
might just have been wrong about how

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720
might just have been wrong about how
 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.930
might just have been wrong about how
gravity works this whole time

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940
gravity works this whole time
 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.390
gravity works this whole time
sounds like a scientific midlife crisis

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400
sounds like a scientific midlife crisis
 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.520
sounds like a scientific midlife crisis
waiting to happen so all of that is dark

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530
waiting to happen so all of that is dark

universe compared to normal matter which
 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.620
universe compared to normal matter which
as I said is only 5% which leaves a

as I said is only 5% which leaves a
 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.289
as I said is only 5% which leaves a
whole 68 percent still unaccounted for

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180
so what is it losing the title now maybe

so what is it losing the title now maybe
you're already aware of this but right

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739
you're already aware of this but right
 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.130
you're already aware of this but right
now the universe is expanding this

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140
now the universe is expanding this
 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.720
now the universe is expanding this
expansion started with the Big Bang

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730
expansion started with the Big Bang
 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.940
expansion started with the Big Bang
13.8 billion years ago and it's just

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950
13.8 billion years ago and it's just
 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.979
13.8 billion years ago and it's just
kept on going ever since now what you

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:46.989
kept on going ever since now what you
 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:48.690
kept on going ever since now what you
might expect to happen here is for the

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700
might expect to happen here is for the
 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.640
might expect to happen here is for the
universe to keep expanding at the same

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650
universe to keep expanding at the same
 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.649
universe to keep expanding at the same
rate forever and ever or for it to

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659
rate forever and ever or for it to
 

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:54.690
rate forever and ever or for it to
eventually come to a stop but in fact

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700
eventually come to a stop but in fact
 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.280
eventually come to a stop but in fact
what's happening is the universe is

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290
what's happening is the universe is
 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.940
what's happening is the universe is
expanding faster and faster and just

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950
expanding faster and faster and just
 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.619
expanding faster and faster and just
like how galaxies don't have enough

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629
like how galaxies don't have enough
 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.600
like how galaxies don't have enough
gravitational force on their own this

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610
gravitational force on their own this
 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.729
gravitational force on their own this
accelerated expansion of the universe

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739
accelerated expansion of the universe
 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.190
accelerated expansion of the universe
just doesn't make any sense there has to

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200
just doesn't make any sense there has to
 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.470
just doesn't make any sense there has to
be some kind of energy causing it but

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480
be some kind of energy causing it but
 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.330
be some kind of energy causing it but

any so what did they do you guessed it
 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.920
any so what did they do you guessed it
they decided the cause was some kind of

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930
they decided the cause was some kind of
 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.170
they decided the cause was some kind of
undetectable energy and they named it

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:19.180
undetectable energy and they named it
 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.010
undetectable energy and they named it
the slight dark energy so what do we

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020
the slight dark energy so what do we
 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.439
