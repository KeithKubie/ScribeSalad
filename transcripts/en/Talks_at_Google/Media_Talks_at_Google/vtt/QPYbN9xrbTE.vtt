00:00:01.776 --> 00:00:03.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: Well,
welcome everyone.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.650
We were super thrilled
to have Ezra Klein here.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.545
As you all know, he's the
Editor-in-Chief of Vox.com,

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:12.910
and he's here in a conversation
with Richard Gingras, who

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.690
is our Senior Director of
Google News and Social Products.

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:18.704
And our team is
really, really excited

00:00:18.704 --> 00:00:21.120
to see that you guys are so
interested in the intersection

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.600
of technology and media.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.380
And I just know we're going to
learn a ton from today's talk

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.010
with Ezra.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.870
His Vox and numerous other
web-only media organizations

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.030
are really disrupting the
industry and building something

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.844
really special
from the ground up.

00:00:36.844 --> 00:00:38.260
And so if you guys
have questions,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.370
we have a Dory, go/ezraklein.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.810
You have your own go link.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.351
It's easier to
isolate the questions.

00:00:44.351 --> 00:00:46.740
EZRA KLEIN: I'm going to nod
like I know what that means.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.260
Sounds great.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:48.390
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
just a Democratic way

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.040
of asking questions
at the very end.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.456
We'll also be
passing a microphone

00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:54.540
if you guys want to ask
the questions live as well.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.120
And with that,
Richard, take it away.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.540
RICHARD GINGRAS: Great.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.581
Thank you for being here.

00:00:57.581 --> 00:00:59.140
We've got another good crowd.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.970
We've been doing
a series of these,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.140
and we'll continue to do so
with a large focus of sort

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.950
of looking behind the news.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.120
And talking to
people, particularly

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.950
those who are really working
on the cutting edge of trying

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.340
to move every
dimension of journalism

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.920
forward into this exciting
and challenging new ecosystem

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.307
that we all consume
information through today.

00:01:25.307 --> 00:01:26.890
So let's talk a
little bit about Ezra.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.050
For those who aren't
aware of his background,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.780
over the last decade, he has
actually a stellar and long

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.940
career, even though
you're 30 years old.

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.310
There's a kind of a multiple
in there with regard to me,

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.500
but we won't go there.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.950
But over the last decade
you built a great reputation

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.020
as a political reporter,
columnist, blogger.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.620
In 2009 Ezra joined "The
Washington Post," where

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.090
he managed the "wonk"
blog, being a policy

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.410
wonk as you are-- card carrying
policy wonk, I believe.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:04.520
EZRA KLEIN: We do
give out cards, yeah.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.771
RICHARD GINGRAS: It's
important we do so.

00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:08.479
Which included the
work not only of Ezra,

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.720
but other political writers
at the "Post" as well,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.900
and it very quickly became
the most popular blog

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.470
at "The Post."

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.380
In 2010, not long
thereafter, "The Week"

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.490
named him Blogger of the Year.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.080
I've known Ezra for a bit.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.500
He's attended at least one of
our Newsgeist unconferences,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.540
and we've talked a lot
about the future of news

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.640
and how that ecosystem
needs to evolve.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.980
And I think what was clear
is as Ezra's work evolved

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.740
over the last decade, I think
he became increasingly intrigued

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.660
with that notion of how should
approaches to journalism

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.860
and political coverage
change to meet the needs

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.780
and differences of the times.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.290
He tried to do
that at "The Post,"

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.740
but I think had limited
ability to do that

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.680
within the confines of "The
Post," at least at that time.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.280
We'll see how Jeff Bezos
evolves the culture

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.900
of that organization to
drive further innovation.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.886
But given that he
really couldn't

00:03:14.886 --> 00:03:16.510
have the kind of
license that he wanted

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.100
at "The Post," in
January last year

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.170
he joined Vox Media to
create and launch Vox.com.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.520
Vox Media, as many of you
know, is the media company

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.940
that started SB Nation and The
Verge, headed by Jim Bankoff,

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.690
and they've been doing
interesting things.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.310
His expressed
objective with Vox was

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.610
to, with Vox.com specifically--
Ezra's objective-- was

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.560
to focus more on providing
not just the day-to-day inside

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.380
the beltway back and forth
of the political sphere,

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.900
but really tried to get in
and provide more context, more

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.910
background, explainers
to give people a better

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.850
sense of the issues and how
they should look at them,

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:03.090
think about them.

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:04.354
So Ezra, welcome to Google.

00:04:04.354 --> 00:04:05.270
EZRA KLEIN: Thank you.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.190
RICHARD GINGRAS: Thank
you for being here.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.620
As you know, I've been a very
strong and vocal proponent

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.079
in the industry regarding both
the need and the opportunity

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:22.110
to rethink the models
from the ground, up.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:24.760
Not because everything's broken,
but simply because everything

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.705
is different.

00:04:25.705 --> 00:04:28.080
Some of the things are broken,
but everything is, indeed,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.400
different from how
people consume media,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.300
how they interact with media,
how they interact with sources

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.500
of media, the tools you have,
the different workflows.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.240
The very nature that the
definition of a news product

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.940
can be dramatically
different from what

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.960
we've seen in the past.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.700
And I know that's been very much
part of your thinking with Vox.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.690
So why don't we just start
off with the big question

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.140
of what's your vision
with Vox, and then

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:57.100
we can kind of probe
further into the details.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.000
EZRA KLEIN: Sure.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.650
So thank you, guys,
for having me.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.270
It's exciting to be here.

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.400
I'm excited to see
somebody with a Vox shirt.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.842
I'm excited to see a
menorah on the window.

00:05:05.842 --> 00:05:07.050
Things are going well for me.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.030
So as Richard said, I
covered policy and politics

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:17.860
at "The Post" for five years.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.180
Before that, I was at
"The American Prospect."

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.610
And the focus of my work
has always been policy,

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.600
particularly health care
policy, economic policy

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.540
from roughly 2008 to 2012, the
complete and utter collapse

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.020
of the global financial system.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.210
It's been a good ride of things
going terribly for the world.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.980
And that has been, on the
one hand a lot of fun,

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.220
because I came into all
this through a back door.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.870
I didn't want to
be a journalist.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.745
I had never thought
about being a journalist.

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:49.000
I started a blog
and things kind of

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.820
took on some momentum from
there when I was in college.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.440
But what I learned in
blogging was that actually you

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:00.770
had this incredible ability
to develop audiences and dig

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.430
into topics that
simply didn't work that

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.630
well in traditional
news formats.

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.060
When you're covering
something like Obamacare,

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.560
the sort of really thorny,
big, complex systems.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.320
Writing about it once
isn't good enough.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.960
I came up through magazines.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.589
I went to "The
American Prospect."

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:20.380
And I interned at "The
Washington Monthly."

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.111
I remember we'd always be
in these editorial meetings,

00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:25.110
and you would always have
to convince the editor

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.080
that whatever you were
going to say was new.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.509
And so we'd say,
well, I got this idea.

00:06:29.509 --> 00:06:30.550
I think it's a good idea.

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:31.240
And everybody would agree.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.448
And then they'd be like,
yeah, but "The New Republic"

00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:35.750
did that in June of 2004.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.847
And it's like, so?

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:39.930
Nobody read "The New
Republic" doing that in 2004,

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.950
and if they did, they
don't remember it.

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.180
I've probably written 7,000
articles on Obamacare.

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.110
And what frustrated me
about that experience

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.865
was that I was
building something

00:06:52.865 --> 00:06:54.740
that I thought had value
to the reader, which

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:56.420
was a body of knowledge
about Obamacare.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.630
I actually have
read the dam Bill.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.840
And I don't recommend
it, by the way.

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.650
If you want to do
something, I recommended

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.060
doing something other than
reading the Obamacare bill.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.860
But I would get every
day these emails

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.050
from readers who, what
they needed to know

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.994
were the basics of
what was going on,

00:07:17.994 --> 00:07:20.160
what were the exchanges,
how did the subsidies work,

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.120
how did the mandate work.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:27.050
But the news does
not prize the basics.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.140
The basics get locked in
actually pretty early.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.550
The news prize are parts of
it that will change, And then

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.050
the parts of it that are
in conflict every day.

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:37.529
And so those are the parts
within the news pegs,

00:07:37.529 --> 00:07:39.070
the things that your
editors actually

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:40.780
want from you, the
things that feel new.

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:43.550
You can actually say, well,
look, a politician said x.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.560
I'm writing a thing about x.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.110
They're not the thing that
the reader needs the most.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.900
So one thing I recognized
while doing this coverage

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.990
was that as much as myself,
and then later Sarah Cliffe,

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:56.020
who's by far I think
the best health care

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.515
reporter in the
country, were really

00:07:58.515 --> 00:08:00.640
I think doing a pretty good
job covering Obamacare,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.100
certainly trying to.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.810
We were not building the
thing our readers needed.

00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:08.010
We were building an incredibly
fractured knowledge base

00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:09.920
that you couldn't
get to unless you

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.710
had just incredible Google-fu.

00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:16.650
This is what got me thinking a
lot about whether we were doing

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.880
the news right in
the digital age.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.750
And the more I
gave this thought,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:24.280
I sort of came to think there
were three, and arguably four,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.230
but for me, three
relevant differences

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.850
between doing print
journalism, which

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.846
structured even digital
journals to a greater degree

00:08:31.846 --> 00:08:33.429
than I think people
realize, and doing

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.330
purely digital journalism.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.169
The first difference is speed.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:40.251
And we as an industry
figured out how to do that.

00:08:40.251 --> 00:08:42.000
We probably figured
that one out too well.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.820
I think if anything, we're
a little bit too fast.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.310
But we figured out that you
could be much faster online

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:48.720
than you ever could be in print.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.490
So speed, you can put
the check in that box.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:58.830
The second was length, and
I'd give us a C- on length.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:00.552
An economist will
always tell you

00:09:00.552 --> 00:09:02.580
in any industry,
what you want to look

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.244
for is the relevant scarcity.

00:09:04.244 --> 00:09:06.535
You want to look for the
thing people don't have enough

00:09:06.535 --> 00:09:09.060
of because that is going
to drive what they do.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.300
In journalism, the
fundamental scarcity

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.035
has always been the
number of pages.

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:16.870
You have 64 in a magazine, you
have whatever number you had,

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.510
given the advertising you
had in that day's newspaper.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:23.240
And everything was shaped
by this incredibly ruthless

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.430
competition for column inches.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.560
At "The Washington Post,"
at "The New York Times,"

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.601
you don't talk about how
many words with stories,

00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:32.870
you literally talk
about it in inches.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.525
This was very
confusing to me when

00:09:35.525 --> 00:09:37.150
they would say, how
long is your story?

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.274
And I would say, 800 words.

00:09:38.274 --> 00:09:39.860
And they would say,
how many inches?

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.130
And I would say,
it's the internet.

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:44.601
It doesn't have inches.

00:09:44.601 --> 00:09:46.100
But that was the
right way to think.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.224
You had to lay out a paper.

00:09:47.224 --> 00:09:48.500
It is about inches.

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.310
So an enormous amount
of how we did our work

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:54.630
was about how do we give people
the absolute most information

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:56.240
in the least amount of space.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.270
And we made, as an industry, an
enormous number of decisions,

00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:05.860
and compromises, and concessions
to the tyranny of page length.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:08.260
The way we write articles,
reverse pyramid style,

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:11.640
is a mixture of dealing with
the problems of the telegraph,

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.790
because if you
get cut off, well,

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.070
the parts that got cut off
can just be lopped off.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.890
It doesn't matter.

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.626
And then secondarily,
it is about getting

00:10:20.626 --> 00:10:22.000
the maximum amount
of information

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.920
into the minimum
amount of space.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.940
You don't have that
problem on the internet.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.510
Do any of y'all read ClickHole?

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.010
Good.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:34.230
It's a future of news.

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:36.805
ClickHole had a piece
recently that said--

00:10:36.805 --> 00:10:38.680
I'm going to maybe mangle
the headline a bit,

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.330
but I went on this whaling
trip and it completely

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:42.587
changed my life.

00:10:42.587 --> 00:10:45.170
And you clicked it, and it was
the entire text of "Moby Dick."

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.270
Which was a great joke,
because you all laughed.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.640
But it's also a profound
thing to think about.

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:56.510
They put up the entire
text of "Moby Dick," which

00:10:56.510 --> 00:11:00.277
is even longer than Obamacare
I think on a per word level--

00:11:00.277 --> 00:11:01.610
although I haven't checked that.

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:05.427
And then they just published
a bunch of other articles.

00:11:05.427 --> 00:11:08.010
A world in which you can put up
the entire text of "Moby Dick"

00:11:08.010 --> 00:11:11.010
and then anything else you want
is a really different world.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.130
It is a really different world.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.600
And in journals I think
we're only just beginning

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.670
to figure out what being
unleashed from length means.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:22.430
I think we are very,
very young at that.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:25.810
I mean even in my experience
at all kinds of magazines

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.660
and newspapers,
you'll have people

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:30.100
do these incredible
pieces that we

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.960
get sent all over
the world to do.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.630
And the piece really
should be 10,000 words.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.470
But it'll get locked down to
1,600 or 2,300 for the magazine

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:39.640
or for the paper.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.860
And then we won't-- not
because we think it's better,

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.526
just because that's
what we need to do--

00:11:43.526 --> 00:11:45.880
then we won't put the
real version online.

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:48.740
We somehow bring the
constraint of print online.

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:52.085
So there are times when we're
getting past that now and times

00:11:52.085 --> 00:11:52.710
when we aren't.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.397
So I'd give us a
partial pass on that.

00:11:55.397 --> 00:11:56.980
The third thing, and
the thing I think

00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.420
people don't think enough
about, is persistence.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.040
The web is persistent
in a way print is not.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:06.030
If you don't ever throw out
your newspapers and magazines,

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:09.910
they will eventually grow mold
and you will inhale it and die.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:15.740
It is very important to
throw out print news.

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:18.490
That is a really
profound way of thinking,

00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.120
that the articles you do
every day or every week

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.950
or every month are
going to be trash.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.010
They're going to be
a first approximation

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:26.930
inaccessible to readership.

00:12:26.930 --> 00:12:29.700
Fundamentally, the publishing
tools built for the web,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.240
and the way we do
news on the web

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.970
actually apes that, even though
it really doesn't need to.

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.130
We structure our home
pages by the newest stuff,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.096
the stuff that is
happening right now.

00:12:39.096 --> 00:12:40.720
The other stuff goes
into the archives.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.860
It's not very findable.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:43.030
You can go click and search.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.530
I mean there are
things you can do.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.540
And everyone has a search
product for their own website

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.620
that is just wildly
inferior to Google's.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.050
So there are things you
guys do particularly.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:55.020
But in general, those archives
become radically less valuable

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.250
with every passing day.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.030
The thing that I
am obsessed with,

00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.260
and the thing that
Vox is obsessed with

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.090
is persistence,
because that, to me,

00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:07.430
is the answer for the
problem I had with Obamacare.

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:12.810
Persistence allows me to write
7,000 Obamacare articles.

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.660
Filter the relevant and
changing information.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:20.810
Pull the body of knowledge
in those articles

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:24.480
out into something coherent,
continuously update it.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.160
And instead of
constantly creating

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.460
new things where we redo the
work, simply update the thing

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:30.740
we have.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:34.960
And instead of redoing 90% of
the work or 95% of the work,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.700
change 5% of the work.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.640
And I can give you guys
a slew of examples,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.556
ranging from with have
these card stacks which

00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:42.790
are kind of the body
of knowledge solution.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:45.430
Not that we have figured that
out, but we are working on it.

00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:48.900
And that is where we sort
of take ongoing new stories

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.250
and build out a sort of modular,
continuously updated topic

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:56.040
resource on them that we can
always attach to articles.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.284
So that anybody coming
into the news midstream,

00:13:58.284 --> 00:13:59.950
you're coming into
Obamacare nine months

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.470
after the discussion
has started.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.680
You're looking into what's
going on in Syria years

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.202
after the Civil War has begun.

00:14:05.202 --> 00:14:06.660
We have the thing
where we can say,

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:07.951
here's where you get caught up.

00:14:07.951 --> 00:14:09.485
Here's where we
can give you what

00:14:09.485 --> 00:14:11.860
you need to know to understand
all the other news stories

00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.790
we're writing.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.010
But in other ways, too.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.070
We did a feature.

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.510
We sent Sarah Cliffe to Vermont
to report on their effort

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:19.130
to do single payer.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.970
She did an incredible
feature from Vermont.

00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.730
Six months later, Vermont's
single payer collapsed,

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.240
their effort collapsed.

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.470
So she did another feature.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.430
What that feature did was
it was 40% or 50% new work,

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.910
and then 50% the contextual
parts of her original piece

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:36.430
that were still relevant.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:38.850
That gave us the ability
to be much more efficient.

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.560
What single payer is.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.150
What Vermont had been trying
to do had not changed.

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.990
All that work was relevant.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.920
A lot of it is just getting
past the discomfort we feel.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:52.010
A discomfort that I think is
born of the lessons and habits

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.640
we learned from print with
simply reusing our work

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.790
efficiently.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.110
So for me, what we
need to figure out

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.176
is really speed, which I
think we're pretty far on.

00:15:01.176 --> 00:15:03.800
Length, which I think we've done
some work on this in industry,

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:04.550
but are not there.

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:07.900
And persistence, which I
think we are nowhere on.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.000
And if you were building
a news organization,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.350
if the news was invented today
as opposed to in the past,

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.160
I think the way those
three things interacted

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:19.370
with it would just be
tremendously different.

00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.230
And it's going to
take us a while

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:22.600
to figure out how to do that.

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.130
But for me, what Vox is about,
what measures our success to

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:31.750
me is not just unique visitors
a month, or page views,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:33.761
or any of these sort
of other raw metrics.

00:15:33.761 --> 00:15:35.260
In the long run,
it's whether or not

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:39.720
we are actually building a sort
of truly digital, genuinely

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.700
more efficient
newsroom that allows

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.070
us to serve our readers
better and do better work more

00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:47.249
efficiently.

00:15:47.249 --> 00:15:49.040
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
let's talk a little bit

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.200
further about persistence,
because as you point out,

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:56.260
I think it's an absolutely
crucial dimension to how

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.130
journalists think
about the future.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:00.130
And to your point
about inches, it's

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.930
always-- because in the prior
era it was edition-oriented

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.200
and yesterday's stuff went away.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.244
Yesterday's stuff went into the
archive, went into the morgue.

00:16:10.244 --> 00:16:11.660
I mean that's what
they called it.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.060
Where content went to die.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.450
And obviously, in
this realm it doesn't.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:21.970
Persistence is a key attribute
of the web in general.

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:25.510
Wikipedia proves that every day.

00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.000
Persistent links have value.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.230
Build value over time.

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:32.850
You have approached this
with the card stacks.

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:36.300
So talk a little bit more
about the card stacks.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.380
How they working?

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.559
How are users
responding to them?

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:41.100
What do you think
is good about them?

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.516
Where would you
like to take them?

00:16:42.516 --> 00:16:43.350
EZRA KLEIN: Sure.

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:44.710
Am I allowed to curse at Google?

00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:45.410
RICHARD GINGRAS: Oh, gosh yeah.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.600
EZRA KLEIN: Oh, good.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.990
RICHARD GINGRAS: Gosh, darn it.

00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:50.560
EZRA KLEIN: The card
stacks are fucking hard.

00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.250
They are, by far, the
hardest thing we do.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:57.700
So for those of you who don't
have Vox shirts, the card

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:01.590
stacks are we built this
metaphor around the index cards

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:04.780
that some of us
used in high school.

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.250
Sort of the initial
idea of Vox was

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.000
could we create this giant--
these topic guides continuously

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.180
updated that would appear
under every article.

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.660
Somebody correctly noted
that would be very long.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.099
So the brilliant
UX designers at Vox

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:19.829
came up with this cards
concept where-- so Obamacare,

00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:21.200
for instance, is a card stack.

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.980
I think it's roughly 30 cards.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.730
The first one would
be what is Obamacare?

00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:27.140
Another one will be what is
a health insurance exchange?

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.610
Another one will be how to
see individual mandate work?

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:31.465
Another one will be
is Obamacare popular?

00:17:31.465 --> 00:17:35.410
A third will be-- we're
not at third of that point.

00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:40.380
Anyway, point is, that
they are very detailed.

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:43.225
The idea is that we do
our daily news reporting

00:17:43.225 --> 00:17:44.850
and we filter that
reporting into them.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.100
The cards themselves
can be pulled apart.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:50.050
We can attach any
individual one to a story.

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:53.622
They take a tremendous amount
of work to do at the front end.

00:17:53.622 --> 00:17:55.830
If we'd been doing this for
years it would be easier.

00:17:55.830 --> 00:17:59.260
It would be more of a flywheel,
to use the metaphor that

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:00.910
seems so dominant out here.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:04.570
But to just start one
up from the beginning

00:18:04.570 --> 00:18:06.240
is just a lot of work.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:11.390
We have roughly 120
of them now, roughly.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.769
We have learned
a lot of lessons.

00:18:13.769 --> 00:18:15.060
I'll walk through some of them.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.812
We are actually doing
a big editorial sort

00:18:18.812 --> 00:18:21.020
of V2 on card stacks right
now that we're rolling out

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.370
internally in the
next week or so.

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.160
And we're in the midst
of a huge product

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.400
redesign on card stacks.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.830
I mean card stacks are something
we really hacked together.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:32.960
And so I think they're
going to improve rapidly.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.210
But we've been learning a lot.

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:36.335
We had didn't know how to
do this before we did it.

00:18:36.335 --> 00:18:38.420
And one of the reasons
it's been so hard

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.129
is that there aren't actually
examples for us to follow.

00:18:41.129 --> 00:18:42.920
Everything else, there's
so much great work

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.660
being done on the
web by so many people

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:48.990
that you can do really rapid
best practices discovery.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.810
On card stacks, not at all.

00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:53.720
So the initial
theory of card stacks

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:55.930
conceived of them as
a reference material.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:57.360
I think we really
thought of them

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.980
in terms of the article format.

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:01.750
So you would have an
article, and articles

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.792
almost by necessity have
a lot of jargon in them.

00:19:03.792 --> 00:19:05.958
I'm going to keep using
Obamacare here as an example

00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.210
here, if people don't mind.

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:09.220
You have to talk about
insurance exchanges,

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.620
the individual mandate,
subsidies, the medical loss

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.580
ratio.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.871
These are things that you
actually don't-- there is not

00:19:16.871 --> 00:19:19.260
a more precise term
out there for them.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:20.940
Those are just the terms.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:25.740
So what we imagined
was these cards

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.290
that would actually have
really detailed explanations

00:19:28.290 --> 00:19:30.980
of the core concepts
in a news story.

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.480
So we designed a discovery
mechanism for them

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.080
that was really
based on the article.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:37.579
So you have this
yellow highlighting

00:19:37.579 --> 00:19:39.700
in articles that
signifies a card is here.

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.110
We can attach the
card into the article.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:43.640
And we write them,
and initially we

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.680
wrote them as
reference materials.

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.780
So we kind of thought about
what is each piece of the story

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.570
that we might need to
refer back to a lot.

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.750
As we watched the user
behavior on the cards,

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.370
that is not how people use them.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.360
They did go from the
articles occassionally--

00:19:58.360 --> 00:19:59.950
I mean it's not that
it didn't happen.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:01.830
But the really big
wins in card stacks,

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:03.621
and what we really
found that surprised us,

00:20:03.621 --> 00:20:06.300
when people went into a card,
they read about eight cards.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.500
That is a tremendous
number on the internet.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:12.061
Our bounce rate was in
the single digits, which

00:20:12.061 --> 00:20:13.560
for every news story
I've ever seen,

00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:18.260
it's usually
between 70% to 100%.

00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.290
So people were going in and
they were going in deep.

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.700
And the way people were
finding them primarily,

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.534
for the ones that
really worked, was

00:20:25.534 --> 00:20:26.950
that they were
searching them out.

00:20:26.950 --> 00:20:30.670
It was not somebody coming and
reading an article and saying,

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.350
oh, I don't
understand that word.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.850
It was somebody
coming and saying,

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:35.610
I don't understand Obamacare.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.760
I don't understand the
Israel-Palestine conflict.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.425
I don't understand bitcoin.

00:20:39.425 --> 00:20:41.250
The answer is nobody
understands bitcoin.

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.890
So this forced a real overhaul.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.670
We had not even designed
discovery mechanisms

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.189
that were consonant to that.

00:20:52.189 --> 00:20:54.230
There is actually not a
home for the card stacks.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:55.540
We build a home for
the cards stacks,

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:57.330
we build a search
for the card stacks.

00:20:57.330 --> 00:20:59.680
But the real challenge was
how we were writing them.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.680
We were writing them as
reference materials that

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.610
were meant to be, in many ways,
broken up and disaggregated.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:06.380
We've moved much more
towards writing them

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.040
as full topic guides
that are meant

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.550
to be consumed by
somebody really

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:14.010
sort of trying to dig deep.

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:15.930
So we're doing a lot
of editorial revision

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.830
on what are the best
ways to do a card stack

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.780
and how to think about
the writing of it.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.130
But it is much more-- we
almost look at it much more

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:24.290
like writing a feature
now than we think of it

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:27.840
like writing Wikipedia
or an encyclopedia entry.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.810
And there's going to be a lot
of product changes in the coming

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:36.195
months that will be aligned to
that, which, unfortunately, I

00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:37.320
can't talk about yet.

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.070
But we are sort of
overall, I would

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.610
say that we've actually
moved very dramatically.

00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:45.957
Now, you also asked how
are they performing.

00:21:45.957 --> 00:21:47.790
The answer is there's
incredible variability

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:48.914
in how are they performing.

00:21:48.914 --> 00:21:51.155
A lot of it has to
do with you people.

00:21:51.155 --> 00:21:52.696
They perform really
well when they're

00:21:52.696 --> 00:21:55.290
at the top of the
Google results.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.730
So we had a card stack
on ISIS, which is just

00:21:58.730 --> 00:22:02.110
an exceptional piece of work by
a writer named Zack Beauchamp.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:05.520
And that card stack on
ISIS was very, very early

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.472
in the conflict with ISIS
very early and their rise.

00:22:09.472 --> 00:22:11.430
The structure is one of
our sort of normal ones

00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:13.270
which we call Xfacts.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:16.425
I think it's at this point,
17 facts about ISIS and Iraq

00:22:16.425 --> 00:22:18.050
you should know.

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:21.500
Each card, it begins with ISIS
used to be al-Qaeda in Iraq.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:24.760
Each card is sort of organized
around some crucial idea

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.220
in the conflict.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:29.220
That card stack generated
a tremendous amount

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.340
of inbound linking, which led
to a sharp rise in the Google

00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.220
rankings.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.590
It's been read--
I can't remember

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.590
if this is the page number
or the reader number.

00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:40.960
But it's been somethinged more
than 12 million or 15 million

00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.800
times at this point.

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:43.937
So that's a huge success.

00:22:43.937 --> 00:22:45.020
That's one of our biggest.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.720
And we've had others
that are like that.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:48.580
That's our highest
ranked one, but we've

00:22:48.580 --> 00:22:50.430
had others that have
been huge successes.

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:53.130
Then we've had a number that
have just done nothing at all.

00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:57.840
So one thing we're
trying to figure out

00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.339
is how to deal a little bit
with the variability better.

00:23:00.339 --> 00:23:02.130
One thing we're trying
to understand better

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:05.320
is the beautiful
mysteries of Google.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.220
But in general, what we are
trying to figure out how to do

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.990
is, because we, to be honest,
don't know it ourselves,

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:14.140
is how do we tell people
about these things?

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:15.710
How do we let them
know this is there

00:23:15.710 --> 00:23:17.352
for them when they need it?

00:23:17.352 --> 00:23:19.060
Because the people
who most need the card

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:23.010
stack are the people who
don't know to look for it.

00:23:23.010 --> 00:23:25.064
And so the thing that
we are struggling with,

00:23:25.064 --> 00:23:26.980
I think have some cool
ideas on, but the thing

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.410
we are dealing with and
trying to figure out

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:30.950
is really about
the distribution.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.680
Like I'm pretty
confident at this point,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.880
particularly in the newer
versions of the product.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:37.310
We just released one on
the European debt crisis,

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:39.360
which I think is
just exceptional,

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.810
by Matthew Yglesias.

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:43.070
But I don't know yet.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:45.020
I have theories,
but I don't know yet

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.304
how to match the
card stack itself

00:23:48.304 --> 00:23:49.470
with the people who need it.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:52.136
Because the people coming to Vox
to read about the European debt

00:23:52.136 --> 00:23:53.610
crisis, well, they
might, in fact,

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:55.360
be interested in
reading the card stack.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.430
They're actually
almost the opposite

00:23:57.430 --> 00:23:58.944
of the intended audience.

00:23:58.944 --> 00:24:01.110
And so trying to figure out
that match up better is,

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.955
I think, our big challenge here.

00:24:02.955 --> 00:24:05.330
When they work it is just the
most beautiful thing to me.

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:08.040
It's the thing I'm
happiest about at Vox.

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.910
But I want to get the number
of them working up higher.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:13.300
So I'd say they've
been successful.

00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:14.920
We've gotten good
traffic off of them.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:16.610
I'd say that we've
learned a ton, which

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.110
is the point of the
first eight months of it.

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:24.255
But we have a long way to go to
build the accessible resource

00:24:24.255 --> 00:24:26.035
that we want people to have.

00:24:26.035 --> 00:24:26.993
RICHARD GINGRAS: Great.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.380
We want to open this up a bit.

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.700
As I mentioned, we've got people
who have been putting questions

00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:37.601
into the Dory today.

00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:39.100
The one that's been
voted to the top

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.060
is going to play right
to the deepest, deepest

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.704
heart of your
policy walk nature--

00:24:43.704 --> 00:24:44.620
EZRA KLEIN: All right.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.661
RICHARD GINGRAS: --with
a massively open question

00:24:46.661 --> 00:24:49.770
that I'll be very interesting
to see what your answer is.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:54.240
"If you could pass one
constitutional amendment, what

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.180
would it be?"

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:59.580
EZRA KLEIN:
Constitutional amendments.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:02.357
That's good, because
they're scary things,

00:25:02.357 --> 00:25:03.440
constitutional amendments.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.356
RICHARD GINGRAS: This
is like stump the chump.

00:25:05.356 --> 00:25:07.060
EZRA KLEIN: No, I like it.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.560
All right.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.250
So my biggest concern
in American politics

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:13.640
is the interaction
between party polarization

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:20.290
and a disaggregated checks
and balance-oriented system.

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:21.850
So when I think
about what you need

00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:24.650
to change in American
politics, basically my argument

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:28.950
is party polarization is
not a transient phenomenon.

00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:33.210
It is the equilibrium of
a multiparty democracy.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:38.120
And what is seen as
the sort of golden age

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.380
of American politics,
sort of mid-20th century

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.030
period in which the parties were
non-polarized, where you could

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.930
have a hardcore
conservative like Strom

00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:47.370
Thurmond, the Democratic
Party, and a hardcore liberal

00:25:47.370 --> 00:25:51.670
like, hey, George Romney
in the Republican Party,

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:52.730
that is the aberration.

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.550
That is the thing that
didn't make sense.

00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:56.466
The problem is we have
a political system that

00:25:56.466 --> 00:25:58.510
does not work with polarization.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:59.920
The aberration was about race.

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.780
When race receded from the
front of American politics,

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:05.090
the aberration began
to resolve itself.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.540
And now we are in
a position where

00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:09.960
we have essentially
parliamentary style

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.600
parties without
parliamentary style rules.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.400
So if I were going to start
amending the Constitution,

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.380
and I want to be very clear
that if left to my own devices,

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.060
I would not.

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:20.768
Because I think
constitutional amendments

00:26:20.768 --> 00:26:22.050
are very tough things.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.990
But within the context
of the question,

00:26:24.990 --> 00:26:26.870
I would be looking
to move America

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.140
closer to a parliamentary
style political system,

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:33.990
where in the president
and the majority

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:36.960
and Congress are
matched in a clearer way

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.770
than is currently the case.

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:43.240
It is a troubling fact, if
think about it long enough,

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:47.410
that America is the only
constitutional presidential

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:51.780
democracy of its kind to last
for an extremely long time.

00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.360
Virtually every other
system constructed like ours

00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.270
has collapsed for a
very simple reason.

00:26:57.270 --> 00:26:59.820
That there is no
constitutional way

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.980
to resolve disputes between
the executive, which

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.690
has democratic legitimacy,
and the legislature, which

00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:07.700
also has democratic legitimacy.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.140
So when you get into something
like congressional Republic

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.890
and say they won't
raise the debt ceiling,

00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:14.280
and Barack Obama says you
gotta raise the debt ceiling,

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.865
we don't actually have an
answer to that, except for well,

00:27:16.865 --> 00:27:18.800
we better come up with one.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:23.130
Now, maybe we always will,
but I'm not confident in that.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:26.860
So I would be looking to move
us toward something where there

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.740
are clearer lines
of accountability

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:33.310
and less possibility of
catastrophic breakdown.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:35.030
It's, by the way, a
very notable thing

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:38.809
that we have helped a
number of other countries

00:27:38.809 --> 00:27:40.100
develop their political system.

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.550
You think of the countries we
occupied after World War II,

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:46.472
like Japan, we have not
pushed them towards ours.

00:27:46.472 --> 00:27:48.430
And the reason is is
actually pretty well known

00:27:48.430 --> 00:27:50.880
in the literature that this
kind of system is unstable.

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.950
It's worked in America
because we've had-- one,

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:55.540
we're just fucking awesome.

00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:58.710
But two, we've
had, traditionally,

00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:59.605
very diffuse parties.

00:27:59.605 --> 00:28:01.490
It's really unusual.

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:06.260
But I think the specific unique
qualities of our democracy

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.840
and our party system that
have allowed it to work

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.860
are slowly vanishing,
and I think

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:14.280
it's putting us in a
position that lends itself

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.120
to very dangerous crises.

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:18.470
RICHARD GINGRAS: Great answer.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:20.011
Let's turn to the
people in the room.

00:28:20.011 --> 00:28:21.790
Question?

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:22.290
Yes.

00:28:26.231 --> 00:28:27.980
AUDIENCE: So in talking
about card stacks,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:31.007
you make a distinction between
Wikipedia style and featured.

00:28:31.007 --> 00:28:32.090
Can you elaborate on that?

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:33.006
EZRA KLEIN: Of course.

00:28:33.006 --> 00:28:36.230
So for those-- I'm not
sure that we heard.

00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:40.160
So he was saying that I make
a distinction between writing

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:43.010
these card stacks the way
you'd write a Wikipedia article

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.093
and saying that we think
of them a little bit more

00:28:45.093 --> 00:28:46.470
like a feature article.

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.820
In journalism, features
have a kind of fuzzy meaning

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:51.450
that makes sense
internally, and I'll

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.710
try to make it make
sense externally.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:55.650
But it's a meaning
that has come to be

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:58.320
used in the word long form.

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.670
Feature stories
are lengthy, deep,

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.580
detailed, heavily reported,
although not always,

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:07.240
pieces that are meant to be
read through from the beginning

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.580
to the end.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.246
Whereas in Wikipedia, one
of its great strengths is it

00:29:11.246 --> 00:29:13.960
is a reference material
that is not actually

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.710
meant to be read through
beginning to end.

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.700
It is episodic.

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.545
It is, in many ways, modular.

00:29:18.545 --> 00:29:20.170
I don't know how you
all use Wikipedia,

00:29:20.170 --> 00:29:22.565
but I go and I go
to the little box

00:29:22.565 --> 00:29:24.330
and I click on the
part of the box I need

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:28.640
and then I go down to that
anchor tag in the story.

00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:34.250
So as opposed to trying
to write these stacks

00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:38.260
in this kind of context,
where what we are doing

00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:40.690
is fundamentally
defining the terms

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:43.730
and giving relevant
information about the topic.

00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:46.074
We are moving it more
towards a style, which

00:29:46.074 --> 00:29:47.490
we think a lot
about when we think

00:29:47.490 --> 00:29:51.710
about the word "explaining,"
which has influences coverage

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:53.270
much beyond card stacks.

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:55.380
We are trying to give
people a sense of the bigger

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.620
picture and the context.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:29:59.640
We talk a lot internally
about the difference

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.940
between offering a definition
and offering an explanation.

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.240
And I think that too much of
our early work, our early card

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.280
stacks, pushed
towards definitions.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.300
This is what
insurance exchange is

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.730
in words that are not
insurance exchange.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:18.550
As opposed to trying to
explain, like listen,

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.570
we've been working
with this topic a lot.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.130
We've done a lot
of reporting on it.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.450
We've done a lot
of research on it.

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:24.908
We've done a lot
of thinking on it.

00:30:24.908 --> 00:30:27.370
This is what we think is kind
of the bigger picture here.

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:29.369
This is what we think you
need to understand it.

00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:31.240
And I'll give a
specific example on this

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.880
because I know that's
a little fuzzy.

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:35.060
The European debt crisis.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:37.030
One way to approach
the first card in that

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:39.030
is to say what is the
European debt crisis,

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:41.460
or what is the
European currency zone,

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.850
or whatever you
might want to do.

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.340
And to sort of very tightly
try to answer that question.

00:30:46.340 --> 00:30:48.170
The European debt
crisis is a situation

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.860
in which a number of
European countries

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:54.540
have seen their risk level
rise up in the markets,

00:30:54.540 --> 00:30:58.120
and as such, they're
unable to issue new debt.

00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.496
They are trying to get it from
the European Central Bank,

00:31:00.496 --> 00:31:02.078
but the European
Central Bank does not

00:31:02.078 --> 00:31:03.290
want to print money for them.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.860
You can describe the economics.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:08.230
The way we did it is-- Matthew
Yglesias has covered this

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:11.120
a lot, says basically,
the fundamental thing

00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:14.760
you need to understand
is that the Eurozone

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.496
is a political union that
is also a currency union.

00:31:18.496 --> 00:31:21.120
The reason they are doing all of
these things, all these things

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.150
that do not make economic
sense and are leading

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:27.310
to persistent economic
crisis is that achieving

00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:30.270
the political objective
of furthering integration

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:32.200
between the various
countries of Europe

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.950
has trumped the economic
objectives of the Eurozone,

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.630
at least temporarily.

00:31:37.630 --> 00:31:42.390
And so trying, in that way,
to not just sort of say here

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.070
is everything you
kind of need to know

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.610
to understand the words
used in an article about it.

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.880
But to try to say, as you
would in a feature piece,

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.450
where you'd gone and reported
in Europe for a month

00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:56.120
to really try and say,
here's what we think

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:56.980
is really going on.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.350
Here's what you need to know,
not just to follow along,

00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:02.232
but to understand it.

00:32:02.232 --> 00:32:02.940
But that's fuzzy.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:06.560
I would like to be able to
draw that line more precisely

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:07.752
than I'm able to.

00:32:07.752 --> 00:32:09.710
AUDIENCE: It sounded like
you were saying that,

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.870
if I understood you
correctly, that your audience

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:15.980
for the cards is different from
your audience for the news?

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:16.757
Is that correct?

00:32:16.757 --> 00:32:18.090
EZRA KLEIN: No, there's overlap.

00:32:18.090 --> 00:32:19.770
There is some difference.

00:32:19.770 --> 00:32:24.510
So cards are likely to be found,
for instance, by Google search,

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:27.580
which is not untrue
for news articles.

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.300
But a lot more of our, say,
daily news audiences were

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:33.090
current people who like coming
to the Vox.com home page,

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:35.179
or follow us on Twitter,
or follow us on Facebook.

00:32:35.179 --> 00:32:37.220
Whereas a greater percentage
of the card audience

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:40.830
is people searching for a
specific topic knowledge, who

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.260
never intended to come
specifically to Vox.

00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.880
AUDIENCE: So my question
is, are you doing anything

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.720
to try to bring those audiences
more together, so to pull one

00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.077
over to the other side,
pull the card audiences

00:32:51.077 --> 00:32:52.660
more into your news
side, and the news

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:54.230
side more into the card?

00:32:54.230 --> 00:33:01.090
And then related to that, a
lot of what you've been saying

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.680
goes against a lot of
the assumptions in news

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:07.100
organizations that people
who are reading things online

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.475
have a very short
attention span,

00:33:08.475 --> 00:33:10.016
so everything needs
to be very short.

00:33:12.810 --> 00:33:14.640
But you have a very
different take on that.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.380
So if you could answer
both those questions,

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:16.780
I think they're reall--

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.350
EZRA KLEIN: Definitely.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.960
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.335
EZRA KLEIN: So in
terms of trying

00:33:19.335 --> 00:33:22.160
to convert the card stack
audience to a daily Vox

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:26.230
audience, there are different
things you can do there.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.630
We have some level of
links into the content.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.170
We have, at the
end of the cards,

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:32.010
you can explore other cards.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.990
I think our idea is that we
want to build something that

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:38.150
is more like an
internet utility.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.560
And that the best way
to build the audience

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:43.030
for the cards, which is
fundamentally the aim there,

00:33:43.030 --> 00:33:46.880
is to just make that
experience as good as we can.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.650
Without saying too
much about our plans,

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.190
I would say we're actually
moving further away

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:58.160
from trying to push people in
the cards to other Vox content,

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:01.010
and moving more towards
us making the cards,

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:03.830
the experience we think they
should be, and as useful

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:05.170
an experience as they can be.

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:06.920
Ultimately, I think
the best thing for Vox

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.860
is that people across the
vast acreage of the internet

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:16.699
come to rely on and find
useful the card stacks,

00:34:16.699 --> 00:34:18.834
and I think that
the rest of the site

00:34:18.834 --> 00:34:21.659
will benefit
dramatically from that.

00:34:21.659 --> 00:34:23.639
But I'm not trying
to use one as sort

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:26.050
of a selling point
for the other.

00:34:26.050 --> 00:34:28.300
To your other
question about length.

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:30.550
In some ways I think I'd
give other news organizations

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:32.030
a little bit more credit.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:34.530
I think that something we've
all discovered in recent years

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:36.550
is that long form works
really well on the web.

00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:37.949
That people's
attention spans are

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:39.668
way beyond what we
give them credit for.

00:34:39.668 --> 00:34:41.709
Now, a lot of short stuff
works really well, too,

00:34:41.709 --> 00:34:43.699
and Vox has a
combination of both.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:45.780
We do all kinds of stuff.

00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:49.449
But it just is not my experience
that readers punish you

00:34:49.449 --> 00:34:53.320
for going into detail.

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:56.510
The majority of the stuff
we do that does best

00:34:56.510 --> 00:34:58.610
is actually pretty
detailed, pretty long.

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:02.240
And the truth is, if you even
think about other organizations

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.610
and outlets, it's often true.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:07.610
To use a player who a lot
of people would imagine

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.340
is like the apotheosis of
short on the internet, which

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:11.140
is BuzzFeed.

00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.700
If you really look
at what they do,

00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:17.140
for instance, they are
very intent on signaling

00:35:17.140 --> 00:35:19.430
how long things are going to be.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.550
They do not have
lists of seven things,

00:35:21.550 --> 00:35:23.820
or three things, or nine things.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.240
It's 42 things only children
from 1993 will understand.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.970
It's about showing
that there's going

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.550
to be a level of
comprehensiveness and length

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:34.140
in here.

00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:37.110
In general, I think the
internet rewards work.

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:40.577
I think that it rewards stuff
that people find valuable.

00:35:40.577 --> 00:35:42.910
A lot of the short stuff that
works well on the internet

00:35:42.910 --> 00:35:44.550
tends to not actually be short.

00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:48.640
What it tends to be is an
embed of something long.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:51.590
So people, I think, will
often say like a John Oliver

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:54.030
video does really well across
a number of news sites.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:55.200
That's short.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:58.160
But actually, it's a 17-minute
video about state legislatures

00:35:58.160 --> 00:35:59.160
and why they're corrupt.

00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:01.570
So to the reader it's very long.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:04.610
So to some degree I
think we underestimate

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:07.140
the internet audience
a lot on this stuff.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.390
I think there is a really
significant audience

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.720
of people who want good content.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:15.780
The big polarization, I think,
in terms of online news is

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:18.557
between people who want
it and people who don't.

00:36:18.557 --> 00:36:20.140
But once you're
bought in, once you're

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.764
one of the people who've decided
as a hobby in your life you're

00:36:22.764 --> 00:36:27.702
going to read the news, you tend
to be into a lot of good stuff.

00:36:27.702 --> 00:36:29.160
RICHARD GINGRAS:
I think the term--

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:31.640
I'm going to go to
the crowd in the cloud

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.097
again for a second here.

00:36:33.097 --> 00:36:34.180
I think the term utility--

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:35.070
EZRA KLEIN: It's
weird interacting

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.450
with all these real
people at Google.

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:37.450
RICHARD GINGRAS: I know.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:38.072
It's true.

00:36:38.072 --> 00:36:39.280
They're actually projections.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:44.620
I think the word
utility's a good one.

00:36:44.620 --> 00:36:47.160
A phrase that I've often
used is knowledge utility.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.760
And we had a panel
here recently,

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.010
part of the same series,
with investigative journalist

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:54.950
from ProPublica Center of
Investigative Journalism.

00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:57.410
ProPublica has been
creating knowledge utilities

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.220
off of data.

00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:01.474
How can I find a
dialysis treatment center

00:37:01.474 --> 00:37:03.390
and understand whether
they're better or worse

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:04.860
than the one two miles away.

00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:05.360
EZRA KLEIN: They do
incredible jobs with that.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.526
RICHARD GINGRAS: Great work.

00:37:06.526 --> 00:37:07.610
EZRA KLEIN: Great work.

00:37:07.610 --> 00:37:09.359
RICHARD GINGRAS: Their
newsrooms right now

00:37:09.359 --> 00:37:13.680
are in the area of
20% data journalists.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.340
So I'm curious at Vox, what's
your view on data journalism?

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:19.570
How much of it is a part
of what you're doing?

00:37:19.570 --> 00:37:20.970
What you want to do?

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:23.011
EZRA KLEIN: We have some
exciting data journalist

00:37:23.011 --> 00:37:24.050
announcements coming.

00:37:24.050 --> 00:37:27.070
OK, I have complicated
ideas on this.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.224
So enjoy your long answer.

00:37:29.224 --> 00:37:31.640
Also, was that a cloud question
or was that your question?

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.660
RICHARD GINGRAS: That
was a cloud question.

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.470
EZRA KLEIN: OK.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:38.910
You spoke it so eloquently.

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.030
OK, data journalism.

00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.860
We have often been grouped
as a data journalist outlet

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:47.160
with a bunch of others like
FiveThirtyEight and The Upshot,

00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.320
and other things like
that that started roughly

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.590
around the time we did.

00:37:50.590 --> 00:37:53.800
I have not thought of us
as a data journalism shop

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.970
just because we have not really
built out that capacity yet.

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.010
Now, our journals have
to be data literate.

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:04.640
We have a very high
premium on knowing

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.090
how to do the basic work of
working with spreadsheets,

00:38:07.090 --> 00:38:09.910
of working with graphs,
charts, tables, maps.

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:12.140
We have a lot of people
who can do regressions.

00:38:12.140 --> 00:38:16.620
It's not like some mysterious
other language in the newsroom.

00:38:16.620 --> 00:38:20.680
So I've tried very hard
to integrate those skills.

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.786
But we've not built too
big of a separate team,

00:38:22.786 --> 00:38:24.910
although we're going to be
making some hires pretty

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.160
shortly in that area, or
announcing some hires pretty

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.034
shortly in that area.

00:38:28.034 --> 00:38:30.409
But let me talk for minute
just about what I think it is,

00:38:30.409 --> 00:38:32.159
because this is where
we're going with it,

00:38:32.159 --> 00:38:34.660
and it's one reason it's taken
us some time to get there.

00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:39.760
I think that data journalism
has frequently been conflated,

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.760
not by ProPublica, but by the
sort of media conversation

00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.860
with the data visualization.

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.890
You put up a graph and
people are like ah-ha!

00:38:48.890 --> 00:38:49.910
Data journalism.

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:50.800
No.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.720
That's a graph.

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.110
It's a chart.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:56.006
That's why I put in
one chart as opposed

00:38:56.006 --> 00:38:58.130
to in one piece of data
journalism in the headline.

00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:04.340
There is a lot of performance
of data on the internet

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:08.011
right now, much of which I have
been a big part in pushing.

00:39:08.011 --> 00:39:08.510
It's great.

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:10.200
I hope you all share
it on Facebook.

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.779
But that is not data journalism.

00:39:12.779 --> 00:39:14.820
To me, what is interesting
about data journalism,

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.470
to me, what makes data
journalism journalism is what

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:25.340
you are doing is you
are figuring out ways

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:30.180
to create data information
sources that you are then

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.930
using to find and
report stories.

00:39:33.930 --> 00:39:39.120
So to talk about Nate Silver
for a minute, what was amazing

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.470
about Nate's work on
the election is that--

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:44.510
and I think it was
often misunderstood,

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:48.740
because people get
very, oh, my god, math.

00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:54.360
Nate had created a model that
was feeding a spreadsheet.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.970
And every day that
spreadsheet was giving Nate

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.200
a story about the election.

00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.801
Nate was the chief correspondent
of Nate Silver spreadsheet.

00:40:02.801 --> 00:40:04.550
That was an amazing
thing to be because he

00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:06.216
had a monopoly
over those stories.

00:40:06.216 --> 00:40:08.590
And the stories are better
than most of the other stories

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.320
people were writing.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:12.450
So to me, that was
data journalism.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:17.220
Nate had found a way
to pull data sources

00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:21.840
into a comprehensible usable
format that could then

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.970
inform a stream of
ongoing stories.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:30.990
Data journalism to me is
doing journalism off of data.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:33.140
And so when I think about
how we're going to do it,

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.410
and when I think about
how it needs to be done,

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:38.530
I think that there's been
too much and too much

00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.780
talking about pretty
interactives and graphics,

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:44.410
and too little about the actual
data side of journalism, which

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:45.970
is what information sources
are you going to use.

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.970
How are you going to make
them into something that's

00:40:47.970 --> 00:40:49.720
telling you true
facts about the world,

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.050
or at least leading
you towards ways

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:53.800
of finding true facts
about the world.

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.320
And how you make
that information

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.430
accessible to your
journals, and then how will

00:40:57.430 --> 00:41:00.410
you make it accessible and
transparent to your readers.

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:02.240
So we're going to be
pushing into that.

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.320
I think we have some
cool ideas there.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.030
But I think that
for me, we've had

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:07.680
a lot of data
visualization at Vox.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.380
We're reasonably good at that.

00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:11.800
But data journalism is
a much harder thing--

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.970
ProPublica is really
one of leaders in it.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:15.030
And it is--

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:17.860
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Making money from it.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:18.680
EZRA KLEIN: Yes.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:19.680
I can't speak to their--

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.763
RICHARD GINGRAS: They are.

00:41:20.763 --> 00:41:22.010
EZRA KLEIN: So that's great.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:25.324
I'm a big fan of journalism
that makes money.

00:41:25.324 --> 00:41:26.740
So if it turns out
data journalism

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:29.010
is money journalism,
that's even better.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:33.620
That's my favorite kind
of journalism data.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.760
So to me, I don't think Vox
has pushed far on that yet.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.590
We've done a lot of
data visualization,

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.390
but we are building
out the capacity

00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:44.620
and building out a
number of things required

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:47.490
for us to do the sort
of separate thing

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.010
that I think of as
data journalism,

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:52.557
not just my reporter knows
how to use a spreadsheet.

00:41:52.557 --> 00:41:54.390
RICHARD GINGRAS: I want
to shift, if we can,

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:58.720
to another dimension of
the architecture of news.

00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:04.340
And this deals, to me, with
the facet of credibility.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.670
I mean the internet is
an extraordinary thing.

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:11.847
It's broadened
expression tremendously.

00:42:11.847 --> 00:42:13.930
Of course, there's more
wheat, there's more chaff.

00:42:13.930 --> 00:42:15.990
It's a maelstrom of expression.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.880
And anyone with a
thought can do so.

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.780
And as we know, it's also
great at amplifying untruths,

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.010
as well as it is truths.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:30.570
Unfortunately, in this era, it
becomes increasingly hard right

00:42:30.570 --> 00:42:34.890
now to differentiate between
the good and the bad.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:37.120
We've started a project--
we-- Sally Lehrman

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.570
is here who's also an
esteemed journalist

00:42:39.570 --> 00:42:43.260
and a Fellow at the
Markkula Center for Ethics.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.720
And we've started an initiative
within the industry called

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:51.340
The Trust Project, which really
pokes at the notion of how

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:56.840
can we, in the industry,
evolve the model of journalism

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:59.860
such that more
dimensions that support

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.390
the credibility of
the work are there.

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:04.360
And the interesting thing
is that quality news

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:07.160
organizations, and
I put yours in that,

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.890
are doing the necessary
things to support this.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:13.220
You have expertise.

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:18.090
You do deep work that
supports your conclusions.

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:21.200
You have editorial
workflows where

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:24.240
people double check your
work and sign off on it.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:29.070
Yet most of this is not
exposed to the audience at all.

00:43:29.070 --> 00:43:32.720
I don't know that Adam Ellick's
story at "The New York Times"

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.140
went through three weeks
of vetting with editors

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.490
and lawyers before he put it
up on the web where it was then

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:42.240
rewritten 500 times by others
who did not have expertise

00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:44.140
and didn't do his work.

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:46.300
So I'd really love
to get your thoughts

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:50.700
as you think about Vox's
evolution of its models

00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:55.160
as to what you think you
might do to really buttress

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.010
the notion that you do
have that credibility

00:43:58.010 --> 00:44:00.510
and expertise to get
me to be comfortable

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:02.800
trusting what you say.

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.800
EZRA KLEIN: So this is
a really hard problem.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.709
And it is a harder
problem now than it's even

00:44:08.709 --> 00:44:10.750
been at any other time
when I've been doing this,

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.440
because so many people
who come to your site

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.455
are coming through social media.

00:44:16.455 --> 00:44:18.746
You're getting so many people--
or even through search.

00:44:18.746 --> 00:44:20.287
So you're getting
so many people just

00:44:20.287 --> 00:44:22.560
like they have found
the link or the headline

00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.351
and they're coming in
and they don't really

00:44:24.351 --> 00:44:26.500
know what they're getting.

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:30.050
I remember back in the days
of yore when I started a blog,

00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.350
and the way you
got traffic was you

00:44:32.350 --> 00:44:35.050
got direct links
from other people.

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:36.830
And so you were
getting traffic based

00:44:36.830 --> 00:44:39.910
on an implicit endorsement, or
at times, an anti-endorsement--

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:41.660
this guy's the stupidest
idiot on the face

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:44.860
of the earth--
from someone else.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:47.415
And so the readership came
with some understanding

00:44:47.415 --> 00:44:48.290
of what was going on.

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.020
If you guys have not read
Richard and his colleagues'

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:57.042
work on the idea of The
Trust Project on Medium,

00:44:57.042 --> 00:44:57.750
it's worth doing.

00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.840
It's very thought provoking.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.173
And I know that's sort of
what we're talking about here.

00:45:01.173 --> 00:45:04.060
So I've been thinking
about that a lot today,

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.310
and since you sent it to me.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.930
And let me tell you what
worries me about all this stuff,

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:11.096
because I really do want
to find an answer to this

00:45:11.096 --> 00:45:11.970
and I don't know how.

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:19.450
So we invest a lot
at Vox on things

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:21.970
that I think do increase
the quality of the product.

00:45:21.970 --> 00:45:23.130
We have a lot of editors.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:24.280
Everything gets edited.

00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.220
Everything now over 800
words gets copy edited.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:30.740
It gets a secondary copy
edit before it goes up.

00:45:30.740 --> 00:45:35.490
When we do data visualization,
that has a separate look

00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:37.220
and run through.

00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:40.220
We have a very tight
corrections policy,

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:44.250
where we will correct-- in
some ways maybe too tight.

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:47.060
But we really try to be, like
if we get anything wrong.

00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:50.640
Like I wrote 2005 rather than
'06-- that's a correction.

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:54.480
We put up a chart from the
US Department of Agriculture.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.990
Their chart was wrong.

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:58.080
We got them to
correct their chart.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.260
We corrected our story.

00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:04.440
We're doing a lot that is
meant to really build up

00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:08.090
transparency and credibility
with the audience.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:12.200
Here's where I get
scared of what we know

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.190
and what we don't know about
how we'll end up interacting.

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.700
Two things.

00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.930
One is formalism,
trust formalism.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:20.482
So I think of
"Bloomberg News" here,

00:46:20.482 --> 00:46:21.940
which I've done a
lot of work with.

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:23.682
I was a columnist
for "Bloomberg View."

00:46:23.682 --> 00:46:24.390
Everything there.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:25.910
You have the name
of the editor, you

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:26.960
have the name of
the copy editor.

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.400
Medium actually does a nice
job of this on their long form

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.466
stories-- who was the
illustrator, who was the--

00:46:31.466 --> 00:46:32.841
and it's really
showing you there

00:46:32.841 --> 00:46:34.920
were a lot of people who
worked on this piece.

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.410
On features we
actually do it too.

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:38.446
We show on features
who is the editor, who

00:46:38.446 --> 00:46:40.070
is the designer, who
is the writer, who

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:42.320
is the-- all the
different players that

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.750
were involved to make the piece.

00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.190
The only thing I
would say is that

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:51.250
in my experience of the internet
and of journalism in general,

00:46:51.250 --> 00:46:54.040
that is actually
not what separates

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.436
good work and bad work.

00:46:55.436 --> 00:46:56.810
It is not what
separates things I

00:46:56.810 --> 00:46:59.470
think you should trust from
things I think you should not.

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:01.240
Editing is an incredibly
important thing.

00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.680
It makes work so much better.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.952
It really is critical.

00:47:03.952 --> 00:47:05.410
And we are hiring
a lot of editors.

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.930
If any of you would like to
be our deputy culture editor,

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:10.060
let me know.

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:16.430
But a lot of the true lies
on the internet are edited.

00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:18.750
And a lot of them
aren't even factually

00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.850
wrong, they're just
completely incorrect.

00:47:21.850 --> 00:47:29.920
And I think there are a lot of
ways to-- if we all just start

00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.930
writing down our editors
and our copy editors

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:36.930
and creating a sort of map
of how much we did on it,

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:40.890
I worry that's going to get
gamed, because that's a model.

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:42.050
It's like a clear thing.

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:45.179
It's a clear-- and stuff
like that, it begins to work.

00:47:45.179 --> 00:47:46.970
If Google began to put
it in the algorithm,

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:48.830
it will get gamed rapidly.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.830
I've just seen this before.

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:51.850
So that worries me.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:53.391
And then the other
thing that worries

00:47:53.391 --> 00:47:59.570
me is somehow making
trust too much of a stand

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:01.540
in for resources.

00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:03.550
A lot of the really
important thinking

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:06.100
and a lot of the really
true things on the internet

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:09.560
come from people outside
of the mainstream

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.920
for all kinds of, in some ways
obvious, reasons, I think.

00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.230
I think back to
the Iraq War, when

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:19.770
Juan Cole, who is a Middle
Eastern history professor-- I

00:48:19.770 --> 00:48:21.770
believe he was out at U
Michigan at that point--

00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.340
was one of the
really best guides.

00:48:23.340 --> 00:48:24.810
Not literally everything
he said was right,

00:48:24.810 --> 00:48:27.460
but compared to what you were
getting out of the main papers,

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.730
this blogger, who was
just a history professor,

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:34.927
was way better, and he was
a way truer guide to it.

00:48:34.927 --> 00:48:37.260
But he would have been destroyed
by something like this,

00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.450
because he had no editors,
he had no copy editors.

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:40.700
He just had his own expertise.

00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:45.730
So when I think about this,
I think of two things,

00:48:45.730 --> 00:48:47.100
and they're fuzzy
and I don't like it,

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:49.250
because I want people to
know the work we're putting

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:50.625
into what we're
doing, and I just

00:48:50.625 --> 00:48:53.540
have not figured
out a good solution.

00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:56.720
But one, I do think of the
card stacks as being part of it

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.150
for us, because I think that
if you can show that you've

00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:02.210
been really working
on this story a lot,

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:05.390
you've been diving deep into
it, you've been doing the job,

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:07.340
then at least you
can show your reader

00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:09.020
why they should trust you.

00:49:09.020 --> 00:49:11.800
You can show them you didn't
just come to this today

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:14.570
because you noticed
on CrowdTangle it

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:16.110
was popping on Facebook.

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:18.950
You've been covering, say, the
Bill Cosby sexual harassment

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:20.710
things for six months now.

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:22.430
You've written 200 stories.

00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:23.640
You've done a full timeline.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.270
You really know what's going on.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:30.400
Another thing there, which
this one isn't as helpful,

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.500
but is really just--
and it's an old blogging

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.310
thing is showing your work,
is linking to your work.

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:37.560
I'll tell you a place where
I really worry about this.

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.470
We talked about the performance
of data a few minutes ago.

00:49:41.470 --> 00:49:44.680
There is a bad habit journalists
have, and we've done it too--

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.780
I'm not exempting
us-- to treat whatever

00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.590
is in an abstract
of a working paper

00:49:50.590 --> 00:49:52.660
as a true fact about the world.

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:56.680
We use academic papers,
we use academic research

00:49:56.680 --> 00:50:00.886
as some kind of synonym
for this is correct.

00:50:00.886 --> 00:50:02.260
These people are
at a university,

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:06.500
so this is a true estimate
of the macroeconomic impact

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:08.410
of blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:11.947
Whereas, that's very rarely--
it's very rarely that simple.

00:50:11.947 --> 00:50:13.780
So something that we're
thinking about a lot

00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:18.610
on this particular piece
of it is how not just

00:50:18.610 --> 00:50:23.030
to show the readers we're
being not just data informed,

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:24.590
but data skeptical.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:26.370
But actually make
sure we have processes

00:50:26.370 --> 00:50:32.774
that force our writers to know
what the actual data says too.

00:50:32.774 --> 00:50:34.940
And I've thought a lot about
it, and we may actually

00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:38.300
do something like this of
having annotations in which it's

00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:41.260
boring to explain the
methodology of things

00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.920
in a piece because you might
have to do it six times

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:45.420
and it's not that interesting.

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.182
But if you have a
strong annotation system

00:50:47.182 --> 00:50:48.390
maybe you do want to do that.

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:50.380
Maybe particularly when you're
relying heavily on a study,

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:53.010
you do want to be saying here
is how the study was done.

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:54.650
Here's what the sample size was.

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.900
You don't need to roll over
that if you don't want it,

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:57.975
but it's there if you want it.

00:50:57.975 --> 00:50:59.750
And then at least you
know and the reader

00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:02.990
knows that the writer at least
knows how the study was done.

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:05.100
So I'm trying to think
about things like that

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:10.010
where we can somehow show not
that we had the resources to do

00:51:10.010 --> 00:51:12.260
the work, or not even
what our process was,

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:15.550
but in a very specific way
on this particular article.

00:51:15.550 --> 00:51:18.910
Like we went deeper even
than what you see here.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:22.420
We made sure we understood
the underpinnings of it.

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:24.369
But I'll just be
flatly honest with you

00:51:24.369 --> 00:51:25.910
because I don't want
to bullshit you.

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:27.368
I have not come to
anything on this

00:51:27.368 --> 00:51:29.740
that I feel super good about.

00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:31.700
I do not know how to
say to someone, how

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.730
to show someone clearly.

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:38.546
We have, for years
before this, been

00:51:38.546 --> 00:51:40.420
talking to the relevant
experts in this space

00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:43.110
and have come to the story
with a body of knowledge.

00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:45.620
And when we tell
you what's going on,

00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:48.090
even though our take maybe
was less interesting than some

00:51:48.090 --> 00:51:50.080
of the hot takes by people who
have not been following this

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:52.080
in any clear way and
parachuted in today,

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.080
it's a more trustworthy one.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:56.040
I've not figured
out how to do that.

00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.040
I'm hoping you will
figure it out for me.

00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:58.940
RICHARD GINGRAS: It's
a complex problem,

00:51:58.940 --> 00:52:01.530
and I wouldn't pretend that
there are silver bullets,

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:03.800
and there's a lot
more to discuss there.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.400
We're almost out of
time, but maybe we

00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:08.734
have time for one more fast
question and a fast answer.

00:52:08.734 --> 00:52:09.400
Anyone want to--

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:09.680
EZRA KLEIN: I make no promises.

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.310
RICHARD GINGRAS:
--volunteer with one?

00:52:11.310 --> 00:52:12.393
Who's got a fast question?

00:52:15.390 --> 00:52:17.830
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any advice for Google?

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:22.360
What could we do to help users
benefit from good journalism

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.450
that we aren't doing?

00:52:23.450 --> 00:52:25.830
EZRA KLEIN: Aside from lifting
Vox in the search rank,

00:52:25.830 --> 00:52:27.955
and this is just a matter
of algorithmic precision.

00:52:30.954 --> 00:52:32.870
I'll go back to persistence
here for a minute.

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.379
I think the thing that Google
should be thinking about,

00:52:35.379 --> 00:52:36.920
Google News should
be thinking about,

00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:38.794
maybe that Facebook
should be thinking about,

00:52:38.794 --> 00:52:41.330
that others should be thinking
about is to what degree

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:44.300
the algorithms that
y'all use right now,

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:50.310
end up prizing iterative, brand
new reporting all the time.

00:52:50.310 --> 00:52:55.500
To what degree recency is
a measure that is actually

00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:58.920
forcing us to do things in
a way that is not the best

00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:01.080
way for our readers,
or that we're

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:04.199
capable of in
digital journalism.

00:53:04.199 --> 00:53:06.490
I'll use Facebook as the
example here because honestly,

00:53:06.490 --> 00:53:08.698
I know a little bit less
about how your search works.

00:53:08.698 --> 00:53:12.570
But you actually get downgraded
for putting the same URL

00:53:12.570 --> 00:53:15.420
into Facebook repeatedly.

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:19.290
But if I want to do an explainer
on, say, something fast moving,

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:20.960
instead of rewriting
it all the time,

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.610
I want to keep updating that
and making that the very best it

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:24.110
can be.

00:53:24.110 --> 00:53:26.484
And I can make that piece
into something much richer

00:53:26.484 --> 00:53:28.650
than I could if I were
having to constantly split it

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:29.810
into new pieces.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:32.257
But I'm going to get
penalized for doing that.

00:53:32.257 --> 00:53:34.340
And so I think that something
that you guys should

00:53:34.340 --> 00:53:39.110
be thinking about is how
much-- moving journalism

00:53:39.110 --> 00:53:42.060
onto the internet does not
make it digital journalism.

00:53:42.060 --> 00:53:43.910
Just the fact that it's
hosted on a web page

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:45.120
does not get you there.

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:49.450
And so a lot of us have built
our workflows, our processes,

00:53:49.450 --> 00:53:52.100
all kinds of things, in
journalism and outside of it,

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:56.810
based upon what we intuitively
understand as journalism,

00:53:56.810 --> 00:53:59.160
what our habits
are in journalism.

00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.400
And there's a lot more pressure
keeping us in old workflows

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:03.240
than people realize.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.050
The way the publishing
tools are made.

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:07.170
The way the social
algorithms work.

00:54:07.170 --> 00:54:09.030
All kinds of things
push us to do things

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:10.730
kind of like they've
always been done,

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:12.440
just published on the internet.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.550
So if I were you
guys, I'd be thinking

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:17.702
long-term about how to
make sure that-- I'm not

00:54:17.702 --> 00:54:20.160
saying you should push away
from how things have been done,

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.460
but how to make sure that
you are not penalizing

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:27.190
non-traditional approaches
to telling these stories

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:28.524
and delivering this information.

00:54:28.524 --> 00:54:29.898
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Very good point,

00:54:29.898 --> 00:54:32.450
and I think everyone here
would agree with that.

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:35.190
I want to thank you very much,
Ezra, for being here with us.

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:43.030
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:43.030 --> 00:54:45.230
RICHARD GINGRAS: For
your thoughtfulness,

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:47.800
and most importantly, for
your efforts to continue

00:54:47.800 --> 00:54:50.300
to move the ball forward, and
rethinking the future of news.

00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:52.258
EZRA KLEIN: Well, thank
you all for coming out.

00:54:52.258 --> 00:54:53.960
RICHARD GINGRAS: Thank you.
