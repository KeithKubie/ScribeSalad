00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.470
- [Instructor] We have
already introduced ourselves

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.470
to the idea of price
discrimination in other videos,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.160
and in this video, we're
gonna try to classify

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.360
the different ways that
a firm might engage

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.140
in price discrimination.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.750
So first of all, just as
a review of what it is,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.100
this is when a firm
charges different prices

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.870
to different consumers in order to capture

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.820
as much of the consumer
surplus as possible.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.500
In other videos, we visualize that

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.130
by showing the consumer surplus

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.014
and showing how a firm might visually

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:33.850
try to eat into that consumer surplus.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.170
But let's talk about the different types.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.750
So the first type of price discrimination

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.330
is known as first degree.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.790
First degree price discrimination,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.250
often known as perfect
price discrimination,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.240
and this is really the most theoretical

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.320
of all the ones we're gonna talk about.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.840
In first degree, or perfect
price discrimination,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.150
the firm is able to essentially capture

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.150
the entire consumer surplus
by charging each individual

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.830
exactly what they are willing to pay.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.510
Now, in order to pull this off,

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.480
you would have to
magically be able to know

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.840
what someone is willing to pay.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.240
When they show up, you say
oh, I'm gonna charge you $5

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.100
'cause you can read their mind

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.547
that they're willing to pay exactly $5,

00:01:16.547 --> 00:01:17.874
and the next person to walk in,

00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:19.270
you say I'm gonna charge you $4

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.170
'cause you know that's exactly
what they're willing to pay.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.860
Now in the real world, we
can't get to that level

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.870
of precision, but firms
can try to get there.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.270
Now, a general principle that's
true, that needs to be true

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.780
to do first degree price discrimination,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.940
or really any type of
price discrimination,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.170
is the different users
shouldn't be able to know

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.370
what the other person is getting it for

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.220
and they shouldn't be able
to trade between them.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.860
So there's one principle
when we're talking about

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.950
price discrimination where
there is no arbitrage.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.481
Arbitrage.

00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:54.830
Arbitrage is just a fancy word for

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.830
if I know something is, I
can buy it for $5 over here

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.400
and if I can sell it for $7 over here,

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:04.670
well then it would be very natural

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.580
for someone to buy it for
five and sell for seven.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.700
And so if someone, if there were a firm

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.420
that were out there doing first
degree price discrimination,

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.240
but if people knew about it,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.280
well then, they could
say hey, you over there,

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.530
you're willing to pay five

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.300
and that's what the firm is charging you,

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.380
but I know a place,
'cause the firm's willing

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.430
to sell it to me for three,

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.110
so I'll buy it for three
and sell it to you for five.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.840
So in order for price
discrimination in general to happen,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.080
especially something like perfect

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.620
or first degree price discrimination,

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.960
you need to have no arbitrage.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.160
Now the next type of price discrimination

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.870
is known as, and this is
no surprise, second degree.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.980
Second degree price discrimination,

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.840
and this is a situation where a firm

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.290
is going to charge different
folks different prices

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.720
based on quantity that
they are going to buy.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.750
And you might have seen this,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.020
where you might have
things like bulk discounts.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.420
Bulk discounts.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.360
And so it's a way of
differentiating to some degree.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.690
It's unlikely that that the firm

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.300
is able to capture the
entire consumer surplus,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.590
but you could say hey, the big contractor

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.420
that needs to buy a lot of wood,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.540
they might have a lower
willingness to pay,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.200
so let's give them a lower
price based on volume,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.980
while the hobbyist, who just need to buy

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.500
a little bit of wood, we can
charge them a higher price

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.610
based on their lower volume.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.830
So here, you're talking
about price versus quantity.

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:30.970
And then you could go to,
and once again, no surprise,

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.000
third degree price discrimination.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.290
And third degree price discrimination,

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.280
this is when you are
looking at characteristics

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.040
of the consumer.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.830
So consumer, or I should say maybe buyer.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.820
So this is based on buyer characteristics.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.290
Characteristics.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.460
So the classic example

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.000
of third degree price discrimination is

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.220
when you go to a museum, they
might have a different price

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.940
for seniors or for young
children versus for adults.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.850
And the reason why they do that

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.660
is they might say, hey, seniors might have

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.735
a lower willingness to pay,

00:04:09.735 --> 00:04:11.840
but we want them to come anyway.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.520
They might do it for
other reasons as well,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.320
just for good social
values, whatever else,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.770
but it could also be,
it is, by definition,

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.610
a form of price discrimination.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.890
You're giving a different
price to different people

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.201
based on who they are.

00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:28.560
Now in the real world,
what firms try to do

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.800
is some combination of various types

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.730
of price discrimination

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.810
and they could also vary the
actual products a little bit

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.810
so that they aren't perfectly identical.
