00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.390
PROFESSOR: So we will have
weekly quiz tomorrow.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.100
There's been a lot of coverage,
and so to focus you

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.170
a bit, I'm going to confine the
weekly quiz to glasses and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.100
chemical kinetics.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.040
So you don't have to worry
about diffusion.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.300
We'll catch up on that,
but I know there's so

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.140
much material there.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.270
Let's keep it confined to
glasses and chemical kinetics.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.860
And I'll be available
today 4:30 to 5:30.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.730
If you can't be at that time,
send me a note, and I'm sure

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.480
we can figure out a time
to get together.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.100
So what I want to do today
is to start a new unit.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.810
We're going to start talking
today about solutions, and do

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.690
some solution chemistry, OK?

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.180
Today we talk about solutions.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.330
And you might initially
say, why are we

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.410
talking about solutions?

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.430
This is solid-state chemistry.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.250
I think up until now, you've
seen that it's pretty rare

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.990
that we use solids in
their pure form.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.000
We usually have mixtures.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.050
So for example, when we studied
glasses, we modified

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.620
the glasses with an alkaline
earth oxide.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.250
Well we, in fact, were
making a solution of

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.170
more than one component.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.800
So it's to get certain
properties

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.950
that we study solutions.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.380
Secondly, coming out of liquid
phase is a way to make solids.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.870
So in terms of processing, we
need to understand something

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.510
about solutions.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.800
And then lastly, we're going
to be studying, towards the

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.140
end of the semester, a big
unit on biochemistry.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.850
And biochemistry, why, you
say, biochemistry?

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.950
Why is he doing biochemistry?

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.760
I thought this was solid-state
chemistry.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.570
We are solid-state devices, but
we're made of soft matter.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.640
At least the exoskeleton
is soft matter.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.740
The endoskeleton is
ceramic, right?

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.800
Our bone structure is ceramic.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.370
Hydroxyapatite, calcium
hydroxyapatite, and the

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.370
outside is a polymer.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.830
So look at this.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.860
Confirmational changes
in polymer.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.560
But the chemistry, the
biochemistry, so much of it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.140
takes place in aqueous
solution.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.060
So hence, we better
know something

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.960
about aqueous solution.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.430
So to this, we go almost right
back to the first day.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.160
You remember, was the second
lecture, and we showed this

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.720
figure, and all the different
categories of matter.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.480
And we started over here with
elements, and we moved into

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.560
some pure substance compounds,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.500
Now we're going to move
over to here.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.600
So homogeneous mixture
containing uniform composition

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.650
and properties, as opposed
to a heterogeneous mix.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.910
So we're now over here.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.220
We're working our way
through the diagram.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.570
All right.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.540
So let's get a couple of
basic definitions up.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.240
So the solution is really
a mix of at least two

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.130
constituents.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.450
One, the majority constituent
is called the solvent, and

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.330
then we can have one
or more solutes.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.190
So the solvent, this is the
majority constituent, and then

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.095
the solutes are the minority
constituents.

00:03:25.095 --> 00:03:27.090
And in some instances,
it's pretty hard to

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.640
tell which is which.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.870
And as far as types
of solutions, I

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.950
want to broaden this.

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.150
You know, when I say solution,
you're probably thinking about

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.540
aqueous solution.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.660
But I want to take a minute and
work through this chart.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.780
And this is all posted,
so you don't have to

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:41.540
write it all down.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.480
Just follow with me.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.080
So most of the general chemistry
subjects will just

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.840
stop at the end of
the first line.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.870
They'll treat solutions
as aqueous solutions.

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.740
But in material science, we
think of things broadly.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.000
So a good example of a simple
aqueous solution is sodium

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.870
chloride and water.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.030
Sodium chloride is the solute
and water is the solvent.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.840
But you can have a
liquid solute.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.870
So wine--

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.030
in case you've ever encountered
this beverage,

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.650
it's primarily water, but it
can contain up to about 14%

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.130
ethyl alcohol, and there are
other constituents that give

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.040
the color and the flavor
and so on.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.490
And you can have a gas in a
liquid, and that would be

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.050
seltzer, where CO2
is dissolved.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.955
It's actually dissolved.

00:04:26.955 --> 00:04:31.820
If you take a look at a bottle
of bubbly water on the shelf,

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:32.950
you don't see the bubbles.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.220
The carbon dioxide is
actually dissolved.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.720
You can have a gas as a solvent,
and air would be an

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.840
example of that, where the
solvent is nitrogen.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.230
And then we have as solutes
oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.740
if you live next to a power
plant, it's sulfur dioxide, if

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.640
you live next to an aluminum
smelter, it's

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.692
tetrafluoromethane, and so on.

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:56.160
So we have all kinds of
solutes in the air.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.320
And then we can have
solid solutions.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.580
And OK, as soon as you see the
word solid, you know, that

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.870
means you're 3.091.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.460
So what do we see for solids?

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.380
Metal alloys.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.110
We saw carbon dissolved
in iron.

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.640
Well, that's a solution.

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.250
It's homogeneous, single phase,
just as the definition

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.070
on that chart 1.11 said.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.550
Semiconductor, boron doping into
silicon, the boron sits

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.950
on a silicon lattice site.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.740
So this is a true solution.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.530
The boron is the solute, and
silicon is the solvent.

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.800
We can have the ceramic.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.450
We talked about the
oxygen sensor.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.950
The oxygen sensor is zirconia,
which has been stabilized with

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.390
the addition of calcium oxide.

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.320
As one example.

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.720
In contemporary work, they
might use another oxide.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.170
But what's the purpose
of the calcium oxide?

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:47.250
Well, I told you that it's
to increase the vacancy

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:49.190
population, give you
a rapid response

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.330
on your oxygen sensor.

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.740
And as we're going to learn
later, that's true, and

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.900
there's a second value in
putting in the calcium oxide.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.960
And it stabilizes, that's why
they use the term stabilize,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.440
it stabilizes the cubic
form of zirconia.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.400
Zirconia has a different
crystallographic

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.340
modifications.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.970
The cubic one is the one that
gives us the best ability to

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.690
transfer oxygen, and the
addition of calcium oxide as a

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.430
solute, the calcium ions
actually sit on the zirconium

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.480
lattice, that's a true
solid solution.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.960
It also makes the cubic zirconia
stable, and with

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.950
Christmas coming, you know, it's
the poor man's diamond,

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.610
and that's the same
material there.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.630
And to modify a glass, as I
mentioned earlier, adding a

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.360
alkaline earth oxide breaks
the silicate network.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.640
That's a solution.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.220
Now here's an inverse one,
where the solid is the

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.040
solvent, and the liquid
is the solute.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.370
So this was dentist's office
practice going back to the

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.830
time when I was your age.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.390
If you had a feeling, the
dentist had silver and mercury

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.110
in the dentist's office, and
would add liquid mercury to

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:00.630
silver and make up this amalgam,
and then jam that

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:01.390
into the tooth.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:03.560
Actually, that was the B
part of the operation.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.870
There was this dentist here in
the United States, and if I

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.530
could find him, I would like
to have a word with him.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:10.730
But he had this theory.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.720
You see, the amalgam is
a metallic alloy.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.110
And so obviously, it has
metallic bonding.

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.080
And the tooth is--

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:21.230
it's a ceramic.

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:24.280
So what kind of bonds are going
to form between a metal

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.270
and a ceramic?

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:28.050
They're not very good.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:32.640
So this dentist had the theory
that the way to increase the

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.890
bonding capability of the
amalgam to the tooth was to

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.960
maximize contact areas.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.210
So when you went in with a tiny,
tiny little cavity, the

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:49.530
dentist would drill the tooth
out, removing about 75% of the

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.700
volume of the tooth, and then
they would make this amalgam

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.390
and shove that in.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.070
And you'd wear that for about
20 years, until one day you

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:02.680
bite into a muffin that's got a
little piece of walnut shell

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.760
in it, and the amalgam
flexes, and your

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.610
thin-walled tooth goes bang!

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:07.760
Like that.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.010
And now you get to go back to
the dentist's office for yet

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.730
some more medieval treatment.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.510
Actually, things have
improved somewhat.

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.840
Thanks to material science.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.080
But they're not using this
amalgam anymore.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.920
But there are a number of us who
are still walking around

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.530
with silver and mercury
in our mouths, and--

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:25.850
yeah.

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:27.290
Enough about my dental
problems.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:29.570
Now let's go on to
intercalation.

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:31.300
You can put a gas
into a solid.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.820
And I told you about this one,
where if you want to store

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.740
hydrogen, and this is a big
problem, if we're going to

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:37.830
talk about hydrogen-powered
vehicles.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.385
A problem as big as, how to
get the fuel cell cheap

00:08:43.385 --> 00:08:45.550
enough, is where are you going
to store the hydrogen on the

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.840
car, and one of the materials
that's been proposed is this

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.030
alloy of lanthanum and nickel
that can intercalate huge

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.990
amounts of hydrogen.

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:54.900
So that forms a solid
solution.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.230
So those are examples of
solutions, and we're going to

00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.300
go back and make sure that we
cover the basic Gen Chem at

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.950
the top here.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.690
But I want you know
that solution

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:04.990
chemistry is very broad.

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.100
Now when you dissolve something,
you actually have

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.680
things down at the
atomic level.

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.330
So for example, in brine, you
actually have below two

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:17.910
nanometers as particle size.

00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.680
You actually have sodium ions
and chloride ions dissolved

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.070
completely, which means that
the solution is clear,

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:29.240
colorless, and transparent
to visible light.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.780
Water is clear, colorless,
transparent to visible light.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.810
If you had sodium chloride, it
remains clear, colorless,

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.150
transparent to visible light.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.590
You can't filter, and you can't
wait for the sodium

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:43.030
chloride to settle out, because
it's bonded within the

00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:44.710
structure of the liquid water.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:46.550
And this has implications.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.340
There's so much water on the
planet, but there's not so

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.470
much fresh water
on the planet.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.570
And desalination can't be
accomplished by filtration.

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.800
A filter that had a pore size
small enough to trap sodium

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.390
ions, the pore size would be
so small, water molecules

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:04.170
couldn't go through.

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:06.380
So this is the concept.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.560
At the other end, you can get
something called a suspension,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.670
where the particle size is
greater than about 1,000

00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:15.680
nanometers, and blood is a good
example of that, where

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.390
it's opaque.

00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:20.450
Visible light doesn't go
through, but you can filter

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.650
out some of the matter
in blood.

00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:25.080
And if you let it sit for a
while, it'll settle in it

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.450
gravitational field.

00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.860
And in between, you have this
whole zone of colloids.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:32.540
And so between colloids and
suspensions, the only

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.640
difference is particle size.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.150
And this whole thing we would
just call a dispersion of

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:40.230
another phase, either another
solid phase, or

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.860
another liquid phase.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:44.890
And it's kind of an interesting
physical chemistry

00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:49.070
about the dispersion,
what makes it work.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.660
For example, in milk, milk
is a good example of a

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:52.610
dispersion.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:56.650
You have a fatty phase, and
you have an aqueous phase.

00:10:56.650 --> 00:10:58.470
The aqueous phase, where
all the minerals are.

00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.800
Why?

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.510
Because the minerals are--

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:01.810
what kind of compound?

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:04.850
They're not metallic, they're
not covalent.

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:06.030
They're ionic.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.235
The ionic compounds dissolve in
the aqueous phase, and then

00:11:09.235 --> 00:11:10.940
in the fatty phase, that's
where you have the

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.600
protein and so on.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.700
But the fatty phase is clear and
colorless, and the aqueous

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.820
phase is clear and colorless.

00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:20.320
And yet milk is white.

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.750
It's, as the term implies,
it's milky.

00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:24.900
Why?

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.130
What's going on?

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.670
You have a second phase here.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:34.360
This could be the fatty phase,
and this is the aqueous phase.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.510
They're both clear and
colorless, but they have

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.870
different indices
of refraction.

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.380
And since this has n fatty
phase, and this has n aqueous

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.200
phase, this interface
scatters the light.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.370
So if you want to start a
business, if you want to try

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:57.640
to tailor the index so that the
index of the aqueous phase

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.790
matches the index of refraction
of the fatty phase,

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.520
you'd have the two dissolve,
one and the other, and it

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.060
would be transparent,
divisible light.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:08.160
So you would have milk
that isn't milky.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:14.960
I mean, the public would
be very confused.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.300
But anyways.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:17.100
So that's what you do.

00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.200
So why does this thing
not settle?

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.240
Because they do have a density
difference, and again, going

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.510
back to the days when I was not
a college student but a

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:30.650
youngster, there was still
this form of milk called

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:31.790
pasteurized milk.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:34.810
Well, all milk is pasteurized,
but this milk was not

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:35.770
homogenized.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.390
And what would happen is, there
was this person that

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.930
would deliver milk.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:45.140
This was a borosilicate
glass bottle.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.790
And here would be the cream.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.220
The cream would rise
to the top.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:52.120
We have all these expressions
in our language.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.970
And then this would be the milk
here, and you could skim

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.240
this off for coffee or sugar,
and then this would be a

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:58.600
low-fat milk.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.530
But people wanted this all
mixed, so then they went to

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:04.320
homogenized milk.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.850
So what is homogenized milk?

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.330
This is your red cap, now.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:10.570
All the milk is homogenized.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.360
This was a big thing.

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.610
This was simply called
pasteurized.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:16.820
I'm going to get to the physical
chemistry here.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.750
It's very interesting.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:21.100
Because this is lower density,
and yet in homogenized milk it

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:23.060
doesn't rise.

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:26.410
So let's take a look at what
goes on in the physical

00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:30.030
chemistry of homogenized milk,
because it's all about these

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:33.820
various systems. So I'm going
to take this particle here,

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.835
and its sum insoluble cluster.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:43.550
And I'm not specifying
the cluster size.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:47.610
It's probably greater than
about two nanometers.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.690
So there are two forces
acting on this.

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:56.170
There's a settling force and
there's a buoyancy force.

00:13:56.170 --> 00:13:57.920
Obviously, otherwise
it wouldn't float.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.570
So there's some kind of
a buoyancy force.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:03.300
Settling force and
a buoyancy force.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.920
Well, the settling force, this
is just the gravity.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.490
Right?

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.620
This is the force of gravity.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.400
And we know the force
of gravity.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.560
That goes with the mass.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.420
Come on, get that cell
phone out of here.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.720
This force of gravity goes as
the mass, and the mass, we

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.220
know, goes as the volume.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.070
And the volume goes as the
cube of the radius.

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:27.120
I'm assuming this is a spherical
particle, all right?

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.410
Now, the buoyancy force.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:30.570
The buoyancy force is
the interfacial

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.240
force between the two.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.790
There's some binding
across here.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:38.430
Maybe weak van der Waals, or
if this fatty phase has

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.070
molecules in it that are polar,
then there could be

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.290
dipole-dipole interaction.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:45.020
But in any case, there's
some kind of an

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.470
interfacial force here.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:52.880
And this is all chemical
bonding

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.870
between solute and solvent.

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.440
But you see, the force
is a weak force.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.050
If it were a really strong
force, it would

00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:04.110
dissolve this thing.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.240
It won't quite dissolve it,
but there is some kind of

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.480
dipole-dipole weak force.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:14.840
And this one here is operating
across the surface area.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.810
That's the contact.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:19.790
So this force goes as the area,
and area goes as the

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.570
square of the radius,
whereas mass goes as

00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:24.690
the cube of the radius.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:29.570
So you know, from your math,
that r cubed dominates r

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:33.830
squared, but only at large r.

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:35.860
It's not always the
case, is it?

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:37.570
Maybe before you got here,
you thought that.

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.190
But now that you've been at
MIT a few months, you know

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:44.860
that r squared can dominate
r cubed at small r.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.400
Interfacial forces dominate.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.650
And that's exactly what happens
in these dispersions,

00:15:52.650 --> 00:15:54.520
and that's why they
don't settle out.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.770
Now, homogenized milk is simply
milk that has been

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:03.610
agitated in such a way as to
reduce the fat globule size

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:08.570
below a critical value so that
these interfacial forces hold

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:10.670
the fat globules
in suspension.

00:16:10.670 --> 00:16:13.310
If you waited long enough, they
would agglomerate and

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:17.660
settle, but that time is
probably longer than the shelf

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:18.300
life of the milk.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.150
So the milk probably spoils
before stuff settles out.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:26.620
So this is all very important
to understand.

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:31.030
The range that exists between
insolubility and this sort of

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.730
clustering, and suspension,
and so on.

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:37.565
By the way, a lot of
pharmaceuticals are like this.

00:16:37.565 --> 00:16:39.030
A lot of pharmaceuticals.

00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:40.670
So when it says, shake
well before

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.690
using, they're not kidding.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:46.610
Because the active ingredient
will settle.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:50.210
And you're drinking just the
solvent, just the vehicle.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:54.400
And all of the potency is on
the bottom of the bottle.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.660
Shake that thing up!

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.760
I can't say what it does
to the taste, but

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.540
that's another problem.

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.140
Actually, I threw in
this slide here.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.200
We're not going to spend any
time on it, but you can look

00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.260
at it at some point.

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:10.130
This is a whole taxonomy
of colloids.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:16.090
Solid-liquid emulsions,
aerosols, they're all part of

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:21.170
this magic zone between
solubility and

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.280
just brick, all right?

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.310
There's this whole fine,
pardon the pun,

00:17:26.310 --> 00:17:28.610
the whole fine structure.

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:31.480
OK, So let's get to
the chemistry.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.300
Obviously there's something to
do with bonding here, right?

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:37.960
So here's a simple experiment,
and this is taken right from

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.380
the reading.

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.850
So I've just taken this episode
that is written up in

00:17:41.850 --> 00:17:42.280
the reading.

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.490
So we've got two beakers
here, and in each

00:17:44.490 --> 00:17:45.940
beaker, we have a bilayer.

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:51.090
We've poured in some carbon
tetrachloride, liquid, and

00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.410
we've poured in some water.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:55.990
And these two are immiscible,
because carbon tetrachloride

00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:59.820
is obviously a non-polar liquid,
and water is a polar

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.350
liquid with hydrogen
bonding capability.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:06.350
And in one beaker, we introduce
crystals of iodine.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.140
In the other beaker, we
introduce crystals of

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:09.600
potassium permanganate.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.690
And then we shake them
up, and we wait.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:17.950
And eventually we see that on
the left, the iodine dissolves

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:19.350
in the carbon tetrachloride.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.830
And we're using the purple
color as an indicator.

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.890
And this is kind of cute,
because both potassium

00:18:23.890 --> 00:18:28.160
permanganate and iodine will
render things purple.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.770
So you're comparing
purple to purple.

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:31.780
They could have chosen something
else, but this is

00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.710
kind of cute.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:33.030
All right.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.580
So here you end up with a
solution of iodine and carbon

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:38.340
tetrachloride, whereas on the
right side, you end up with a

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.900
solution of potassium
permanganate and water, and

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.490
nothing in the carbon
tetrachloride.

00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:47.840
So what can we infer
from this?

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.130
Well, let's take a look at the
possible interactions.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:53.950
So first of all let's
categorize H2O.

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:59.410
This is polar, it's a polar
liquid, with hydrogen bonding

00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:00.660
capability.

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:06.990
Carbon tetrachloride
is non-polar.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:08.010
It's very toxic.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.790
When I was a child, we had this
in the medicine cabinet.

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:13.005
It's a non-polar solvent.

00:19:13.005 --> 00:19:16.040
It's fantastic for getting
grease stains off.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:17.050
Every man had this.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.757
With a little handkerchief,
you'd take a little grease

00:19:19.757 --> 00:19:21.260
stain off your tie.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.240
You can't buy this stuff.

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.560
You can't even guy it for
research anymore.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.310
It's too bad.

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.620
It's great stuff.

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.620
Highly toxic, though.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:31.690
But you know, there's
a time and a place.

00:19:31.690 --> 00:19:32.030
All right.

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:33.430
So then here's iodine.

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.640
Iodine, we know, is non-polar.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.450
It's a homonuclear molecule,
it has to be non-polar.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.330
And so what holds iodine
together in the crystal?

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:46.320
There's only one bond, and
that's van der Waals, right?

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:52.190
It's a van der Waals solid,
whereas potassium permanganate

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:53.960
is an ionic solid.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.420
Potassium permanganate is ionic,
and it consists of

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:01.830
potassium cations and
permanganate anions.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:06.280
And what we find is that the
non-polar solute dissolves in

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.630
the non-polar solvent, and the
ionic solute dissolves in the

00:20:11.630 --> 00:20:16.220
polar solvent with hydrogen
bonding capability.

00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:23.000
So from this, we can infer the
general rule, which is

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.850
encapsulated in the language
used in chemistry textbooks.

00:20:27.850 --> 00:20:30.125
Like dissolves like.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.340
And what they're really saying
here, is that like solutes

00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:40.570
dissolve in like solvents.

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:43.410
Solute-solvent is like
dissolves like.

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:43.700
OK.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.010
It's a good place to
start, but it's

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.380
an incomplete picture.

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:49.230
So I want to show you
that there's some

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:50.460
sophistication here.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:52.680
This is taken from one
of the other books.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.410
And it shows just the rules for
ionic compounds in water.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:59.540
And I just showed you, from this
example, that the ionic

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.640
compound dissolved in water.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:05.070
And what you see here is that
some ionic compounds dissolve

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:07.160
in water, but there's
a whole set or

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.340
insoluble ionic compounds.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.500
So it's not straightforward.

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.340
But we know from 3.091, we know
that we can make sense of

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:21.550
this on the basis
of competition.

00:21:21.550 --> 00:21:24.950
Competition between what holds
the compound in the solid

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.650
state versus what will pull
it into the liquid state.

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:31.750
So for example, we can compare
sodium chloride, which we know

00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:33.160
dissolves in water.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.470
So sodium chloride, as a
crystalline solid, will

00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:42.600
dissolve to form sodium chloride
aqueous solution.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.970
Whereas if you look at magnesium
oxide, which is also

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:56.190
an ionic crystal, it does not,
to any standard imaginable,

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.960
dissolve to form an aqueous
solution of magnesium oxide.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.170
And what's the difference
here?

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:10.440
The difference here is, compare
solvation energy, in

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.870
other words, the energy that you
got by pulling this into

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.670
solution, and forming bonds
between sodium and chlorine in

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:20.855
water, with the crystallization
energy.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:25.920
And what's that all about?

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.310
Well, that's the Madelung
constant, remember?

00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:29.970
Madelung constant.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:35.520
q1 q2 over 4 pi epsilon
0 r, where this

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.880
is the cation anion.

00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:41.200
And you can see here that sodium
chloride has sodium

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.870
cations and chloride anions, and
there's a certain binding

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.320
energy in the crystal.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.710
Magnesium has 2 plus.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:51.750
Oxide is 2 minus.

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:55.030
The binding energy between
magnesium and oxygen is so

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:58.750
great that there's no driving
force to dissolve.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:01.610
Now, I don't expect you to be
able to look at this and tell

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:04.470
me whether something's going
to dissolve or not.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.570
But if I were to say to you,
explain why sodium chloride

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:13.300
forms solutions with water, and
magnesium oxide doesn't,

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:16.380
that you could go through
this rationalization.

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:18.820
And here's a cartoon from the
textbook that tries to

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:20.560
illustrate this solvation.

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:23.460
Here you can see a crystal of
sodium chloride, in the

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:27.440
inimitable fashion, as drawn by
chemistry books, where the

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:31.655
chloride ion is green, and
the sodium ion is blue.

00:23:31.655 --> 00:23:32.560
And that's OK.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:34.930
I can live with the
color-coding, as long as we

00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:38.310
agree amongst ourselves, these
ions are clear and colorless,

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:40.180
because they have octet
stability in

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:41.610
their electronic shell.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.030
And here's water, with the
hydrogen shown in white, and

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.730
the oxygen shown in red.

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:51.930
And you can see that the oxide
end, the oxygen end, the delta

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:56.940
negative end of the water, is
trying to wrest sodium cation

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.850
out of the lattice,
and ultimately

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.870
surround it by a cage.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:01.950
And the same thing here.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:04.400
You see the hydrogen ends of
the water trying to pull

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.840
chloride out, and ultimately
surround it with

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:09.600
a water-like cage.

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.850
So this is the competition
I was talking about.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:14.480
In the case of sodium chloride,
water wins.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.530
In the case of magnesium
oxide, water loses.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.900
The binding energy between
magnesium and oxygen and the

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.580
crystal dominate.

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:25.010
So you don't see
that solvation.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.310
OK.

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:27.430
Let's talk about metrics now.

00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:30.100
Let's look at some metrics
of solubility.

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:31.850
It's quantifiable.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:38.230
So we can express a measure of
solubility in terms of a

00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:40.210
quantity known as molarity.

00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:55.165
So we can express moles of
solute per liter of solvent.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:07.300
And this is called molarity, and
the symbol is capital M.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:12.750
So we can say, for example, a
1 molar solution of sodium

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:16.885
chloride in water, we'll write
1 molar NaCl, and then we'll

00:25:16.885 --> 00:25:19.100
write subscript aq,
meaning aqueous.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:24.340
So it's an aqueous solution at
a concentration of 1 mole of

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:29.170
NaCl per liter.

00:25:29.170 --> 00:25:34.460
And the liter is named after a
person, so that's capital L,

00:25:34.460 --> 00:25:37.200
per liter of solution.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.040
And remember, the solution
is the sum of

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:44.480
the water plus solute.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.510
For dilute solutions, there's
very little difference between

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:51.200
the total amount of water and
the total amount of solution.

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.090
But in certain instances, the
presence of the solute

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:56.340
actually has a volumetric
change on here.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:00.500
So strictly speaking, it's
per liter of solution

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.800
And as I've shown you, there
are degrees of solubility.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.690
So people represent the
threshold of solubility as c

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:12.580
of the solute.

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.780
When c of the solute is less
than about a million molar,

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:20.770
0.001 molar, we call
this insoluble.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:24.580
So something is vanishingly
soluble, we

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.165
say that's the value.

00:26:26.165 --> 00:26:27.595
So we'll call this
the threshold.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.350
And then, something that's quite
soluble, we'd say that

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.272
the concentration of the solute
starts to exceed at

00:26:36.272 --> 00:26:38.740
about 0.1 molar.

00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:43.035
And then we would say, that
qualifies as soluble.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.950
So now let's look at two
extremes in solubility,

00:26:51.950 --> 00:26:54.100
operating off of this.

00:26:54.100 --> 00:26:57.040
So in the one case, we can
have complete solubility.

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.060
So examples of that, where
things are completely miscible

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.220
in one another.

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.990
Complete solubility.

00:27:04.990 --> 00:27:07.080
By the way, some people will
use the term miscibility.

00:27:10.530 --> 00:27:12.810
When something is miscible
it means it's soluble.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:13.890
Same idea.

00:27:13.890 --> 00:27:16.440
If something is insoluble, some
people might say it's

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.000
immiscible.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.190
Same thing.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.770
OK?

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:25.980
So complete solubility is
ethyl alcohol and water.

00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.575
You can mix them in
all proportions.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.050
Continuously variable.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:40.580
On the solid alloy is
silver and gold.

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.960
Silver and gold, you can make
alloys of any composition

00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:47.780
between 100% gold
and 100% silver.

00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:50.360
Now, that's the exception.

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:54.280
Most cases are situations
of limited solubility.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:09.000
So they go up to a maximum,
which we can denote C-star or

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.250
C saturation.

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:15.980
This is the maximum
solubility.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.590
So an example of something
that's sparingly soluble in

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:24.120
water is silver chloride.

00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.030
Let's look at silver chloride.

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:30.380
So silver chloride, I'm going to
start here, silver chloride

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:34.130
as a crystal, and I'm going
to dissolve that in water.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:38.520
So that gives me AgCl aq.

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:40.980
So that's just simply the
formation of an aqueous

00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:42.900
solution of silver chloride.

00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:47.240
And when the reaction moves from
left to right, we call

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.670
that dissolution.

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:53.110
The silver chloride is
dissolving, and when the

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:57.190
system moves from right to
left, we call that--

00:28:57.190 --> 00:29:01.840
now here I'm going to nitpick
with the book.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:04.420
The book calls the left reaction
crystallization.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:08.490
And that's correct.

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:11.080
It is crystallization in this
case, because silver chloride

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.050
is a crystal.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:18.150
But it is possible, in other
systems, to have the solute

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.560
come out of solution, and
make a solid that is

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.980
noncrystalline.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:26.200
And you know that all crystals
are solids, but not all solids

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:26.840
are crystals.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:28.180
You can have an amorphous
solid.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:31.040
So what would happen if you were
to bring out of solution

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:32.080
an amorphous solid?

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:34.000
It would be silly to call
it crystallization.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.420
So I prefer to use the
term precipitation.

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.620
And there's another term that
you can use, and I learned

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.680
this one from reading the
literature of geochemistry.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:48.980
What the geochemists call the
reaction going from solution

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.140
to make a solid, they say
the system exsolves.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.470
This is dissolve,
this is exsolve.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:58.950
So this is called exsolution.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:01.440
It's amazing what you can
do when you know a

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.610
little bit of Latin.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:03.560
So this exsolves.

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.530
So that's the exsolution, or the
crystallization reaction.

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:09.590
Now I'm going to show you what
won Arrhenius his Nobel prize.

00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:12.570
Arrhenius did not get the Nobel
prize for his brilliant

00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:14.790
work on activation energy.

00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:18.300
He got his Nobel prize on the
theory of electrolytic

00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.150
dissociation, which was, people
knew that you could

00:30:21.150 --> 00:30:24.670
dissolve salts and water, but
they didn't know how.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.940
And it was Arrhenius who said
that the salts go into

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.240
solution by dissociating
and forming ions.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:38.190
So goes in as Ag plus Ag plus
aq plus chloride ion--

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:39.700
thank you.

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:42.930
And that, ladies and gentleman,
was a Nobel prize

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:44.500
for Arrhenius.

00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.880
And you can see that there's
a relationship between the

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.530
amount of silver chloride
and the amount of ions.

00:30:50.530 --> 00:30:53.960
So there's a mass balance there,
that the concentration

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:58.310
of silver chloride dissolved, in
fact, equals, in this case,

00:30:58.310 --> 00:31:04.520
by stoichiometry, the
concentration of Ag plus,

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.820
because of the nature of the
dissociation reaction on a

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:08.930
mass balance basis.

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.880
And that also equals the
concentration of the

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:15.050
chloride ion, OK?

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:20.590
So that's the way we can
look at the system.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:25.510
And how do we know that this
thing has limited solubility?

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.390
Well, there's various ways of
measuring it, and one of them

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:31.740
involves conductivity.

00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.820
Here's the conductivity
of pure water.

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:36.830
And you know that water has
very, very poor conductivity,

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.640
and in fact, what's happening
here, when we add silver

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:42.680
chloride is, we're adding charge
carriers, because the

00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.220
audience are charged species.

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:45.720
So they can carry charge.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:49.050
And you can see that this is a
measure of conductivity as a

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:51.920
function of silver chloride
concentration.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:55.840
And as you add silver chloride
to higher and higher values,

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:57.500
the conductivity goes up.

00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:00.730
And look at even the tiniest
amount of silver chloride has

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.490
a conductivity that's about,
what, half an order of

00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:05.380
magnitude higher than
the conductivity

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.340
of pure water itself.

00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:10.700
So I would say that this is
akin to doping, isn't it?

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.400
So up here, when you've got 10
to the minus 6 Siemens per

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:17.810
centimeter conductivity, that
aqueous solution is

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:20.720
demonstrating the extrinsic
behavior.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.680
This is very similar
to doping.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.780
And at some point, we get to
this value here, around 10 to

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:31.300
the minus 5 moles of silver
chloride per liter, and then

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.350
adding more silver chloride has
no impact on conductivity.

00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:38.150
Which tells you that you've
hit saturation.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:41.540
This is akin to adding more and
more sugar to the cup of

00:32:41.540 --> 00:32:44.190
tea, until finally the sugar
just falls to the bottom.

00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:46.470
You can stir all you want, but
you won't get it to dissolve,

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:48.890
because you've hit saturation.

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:54.680
So that indicates the presence
of a saturated solution.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:33:01.820
And so we can talk about that
value, and we can say that for

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:07.650
silver chloride, the
concentration at saturation is

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:15.070
equal to 1.3 times 10 to the
minus 5 moles per liter.

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:18.160
Moles of silver chloride
per liter.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.940
And obviously, that's equal to,
according to that, it's

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.680
equal to the silver
ion concentration.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:27.650
I'm going to use square brackets
to indicate moles of

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:30.850
silver, ion per liter
of solution, which

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.380
is also equal to--

00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:37.960
pardon me-- it's also equal to
the chloride ion concentration

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:39.530
at saturation.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:41.280
Now I'm going to ask you
a simple question.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.840
Suppose I've got a beaker here,
and I know the maximum I

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.100
can get here, the maximum is 1.3
times 10 to the minus 5.

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:51.950
Now this is a really
simple question.

00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.060
Suppose I am about to add
silver chloride--

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.130
let's say this is
1 liter already.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:33:59.710
All right?

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:00.890
I've got one liter.

00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:03.880
And you'd tell me, well, you can
put in 1.3 times 10 to the

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.490
minus 5 moles to get
the saturation.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:10.220
Suppose instead of 1 liter of
pure water, I had 1 liter of

00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:15.530
water already containing, say,
1 times 10 to the minus 5

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:18.230
molar silver chloride.

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:20.050
Well, that's kind of
obvious, isn't it?

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:24.700
I'm only going to be able to put
0.3 moles in, because 0.3

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:26.520
times 10 to the minus 5, because
I've already got

00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.910
silver chloride in there.

00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:28.960
That's easy.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.490
Now let's make the question
a little more interesting.

00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:34.520
Suppose instead of a certain
amount of silver chloride in

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:38.810
there, I have no silver
chloride in there.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.010
But I've got, say, 0.1 molar
sodium chloride.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.090
It's a salt.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:48.840
It's a difference salt.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:52.830
So the question is, does the
presence of a different salt

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:57.950
have an impact on how much
silver chloride I can put into

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:58.862
this solution?

00:34:58.862 --> 00:35:00.960
And the answer is, yes.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.720
The answer is yes.

00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:09.130
So what we find is that the
presence of the other salt, in

00:35:09.130 --> 00:35:13.210
this case, has an impact,
because sodium chloride goes

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:17.240
in as sodium plus, and
chloride minus.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:21.070
So there's already a boatload of
chloride ion in there, and

00:35:21.070 --> 00:35:23.980
that has an impact on
this relationship.

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.620
So how do we answer the
question, what is the

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:30.100
solubility of silver chloride
in the presence of other

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.710
chloride ions?

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:36.510
And for that, we define
something called the

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.760
solubility product.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.980
And you need it in order to
answer the question, how do

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.500
you determine the solubility
of a solute when there are

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:50.260
other solutes present already?

00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:55.140
And it's denoted capital K,
lowercase sp, subscript.

00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:56.470
Solubility product.

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:00.770
And it's equal to simply
the ion products of the

00:36:00.770 --> 00:36:01.520
constituents.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.320
So the solubility product of
silver chloride is the product

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.470
of the silver ion concentration,
and the

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:09.620
chloride ion concentration.

00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:16.760
And you know that in a solution
of silver chloride

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:24.210
alone, if nothing else, that
the concentration of silver

00:36:24.210 --> 00:36:26.910
ion equals the concentration
of chloride ion.

00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:30.600
That's the whole business
of dissolving by itself.

00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.300
And so I can then just
say that Ksp.

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:38.020
will then equal the
concentration of silver ion

00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.910
squared, which we also know is
equal to the concentration of

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:44.240
silver chloride aqueous.

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.050
See, all of these
are the same.

00:36:46.050 --> 00:36:47.720
So this solubility
is the same.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:52.370
I can just put that in, which
is just concentration of

00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:55.220
silver chloride.

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.530
Square that.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:37:02.710
So if I square 1.3 times 10 to
the minus 5, I end up with a

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:08.080
solubility product of 1.8 times
10 to the minus 10.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:13.510
So now I can use this in order
to determine how much

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:17.400
solubility I get in the presence
of another salt.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:22.340
So in this case, I'm going to
put 0.1 molar sodium chloride.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.870
And these are strong salts, so
we're going to get complete

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.090
dissociation.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:35.010
Gives me 0.1 molar sodium ion,
and 0.1 molar chloride ion,

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.080
when it dissociates.

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.330
Now you see the difference.

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:42.240
Because the silver chloride, by
itself, gives me 10 to the

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.750
minus 5 molar chloride ions.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:48.360
When I add sodium chloride,
I get 4 as a

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.890
magnitude more chloride.

00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:53.160
So let's go back to the Ksp.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:56.180
So Ksp, this is for
silver chloride.

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:59.550
Ksp for silver chloride is
going to be equal to the

00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:04.100
silver concentration and the
chloride concentration.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.930
And in this case, the silver
concentration is just equal to

00:38:07.930 --> 00:38:09.700
whatever that solubility is.

00:38:09.700 --> 00:38:11.850
Because there's only source
of silver ion,

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:13.000
and it's silver chloride.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.440
So I can write that as

00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.410
concentration of silver chloride.

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:19.350
That's good.

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:20.870
And now this one here is what?

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:22.310
I've got two sources.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.590
I've got silver chloride, I
I've got sodium chloride.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:27.600
So it's going to equal
this thing here.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:32.580
0.1 plus whatever I get
from silver chloride.

00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:35.560
And it's vanishingly
small, isn't it?

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.200
The concentration of silver
chloride, whatever it is.

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.770
This is nothing, so I'm just
going to neglect it.

00:38:42.770 --> 00:38:43.850
It's dominated now.

00:38:43.850 --> 00:38:47.230
The chlorine is flooded by
the silver chloride.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:48.940
And this product
is a constant.

00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.300
That's still equal to
10 to the minus 10.

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:56.920
So I can turn this around and
solve for the concentration of

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.650
silver chloride, which
is equal to the

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:02.780
concentration of silver io.

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.370
And that's equal to, what is
it, 10 to of the minus 10

00:39:05.370 --> 00:39:10.170
divided by 0.1, which
then gives me--

00:39:10.170 --> 00:39:12.000
what's the number here?

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.390
Plug that in.

00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:17.390
And I end up with 10
to the 1.8 times 10

00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:20.300
to the minus 9 molar.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:20.830
Right?

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:21.350
So look.

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:26.970
Look at what's happened by
having the chloride present

00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:30.660
from sodium chloride in
such a large amount.

00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.360
It's repressed.

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.460
It has repressed the
dissolution.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:40.130
The presence of chloride then
has a negative impact on

00:39:40.130 --> 00:39:43.490
solubility, and instead of
having 10 to the minus 5

00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:46.350
molar, it's down to 10 to
the the minus 9 molar.

00:39:46.350 --> 00:39:51.570
And this effect of repressing
solubility by adding a second

00:39:51.570 --> 00:39:56.030
solute is called the common
ion effect, OK?

00:39:56.030 --> 00:40:09.790
Solubility repression by second
solute is known as the

00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:13.100
common ion effect.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.140
And this is used
in processing.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:20.680
If I want to trigger
the precipitation--

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:22.980
see, if I started with a
solution containing 10 to the

00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:26.330
minus 5 molar of silver
chloride, and I throw in some

00:40:26.330 --> 00:40:28.170
sodium chloride, it'll start

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.690
precipitating out silver chloride.

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:33.040
So if I wanted to make a fine
precipitate of silver

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:35.530
chloride, I make a pregnant
solution.

00:40:35.530 --> 00:40:37.920
And I could drop the
temperature, because you can

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.790
imagine that solubility is a
function of temperature, or I

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:43.580
could keep it isothermal, throw
in some sodium chloride,

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.030
and out comes silver chloride.

00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:52.610
So since the common ion effect
on it and its value in

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.540
processing.

00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:54.970
OK.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:55.940
Good.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:03.820
Well, I think I'm going
to hold it there.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.490
I"ll show you just
one more thing.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:10.730
If you've got stoichiometry
like this--

00:41:10.730 --> 00:41:13.040
this is a difluoride
of magnesium.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.930
If it goes into solution, you
get magnesium cation plus 2

00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.200
fluoride anions.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.240
And so if I wrote the Ksp for
this reaction, it would be the

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:28.450
product of the magnesium
concentration and the fluoride

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.000
ion concentration.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.580
Because there's the two
here, this is squared.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:38.860
So this, too, will transfer up
there, and then throw in some

00:41:38.860 --> 00:41:42.860
sodium fluoride, and cause the
other thing to exsolve, and

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.910
away we go.

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:44.080
All right.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.680
I've got a couple of
things to show you.

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:47.400
We're talking a lot
about Arrhenius.

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.860
This is a book I have. It's an
English translation of a book

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:54.540
written by Arrhenius in the late
1800s, and it was printed

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.480
in English around 1908.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.710
And Arrhenius was a genius.

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.390
He wrote on all sorts
of topics here.

00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:04.840
Biology, physics, you name it.

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.430
And one of the things and he
was interested in was the

00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:10.470
origins of the earth.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.450
So this chapter is called,
Celestial Bodies as Abodes of

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:18.670
Organisms. Already speculating
on whether you could have life

00:42:18.670 --> 00:42:23.520
as we know it exist elsewhere
in the universe.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:26.340
And one of the things he talks
about is global warming.

00:42:26.340 --> 00:42:28.400
So this is Arrhenius
on global warming.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.780
I'll read you the last paragraph
of this chapter.

00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:34.240
There had been some major
volcanic eruptions that had

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:37.600
caused cooling when Krakatoa
in 1883 and

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:39.390
Martinique in 1902.

00:42:39.390 --> 00:42:45.300
Major plumes of soot that caused
dramatic decreases in

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.550
temperature.

00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:49.400
So now here comes the
last paragraph.

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.280
We often hear lamentations that
the coal stored up in the

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:56.320
earth is wasted by the
present generation--

00:42:56.320 --> 00:42:58.020
remember, this is written
100 years ago--

00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.910
without any thought
of the future.

00:42:59.910 --> 00:43:03.110
And we are terrified by the
awful destruction of life and

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:07.920
property which is followed the
volcanic eruptions of our day.

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.500
We may find a kind of
consolation in the

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.480
consideration that adheres
in every other case.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.780
There is good mixed
with the evil.

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.920
By the influence of the
increasing percentage of

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:20.660
carbonic acid in the
atmosphere-- that's CO2--

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.220
we may hope to enjoy ages with
more equitable and better

00:43:24.220 --> 00:43:25.540
climates.--

00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:29.150
Remember, he's a Swede;
it's cold--

00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:32.350
especially as regards the colder
regions of the earth,

00:43:32.350 --> 00:43:35.510
ages when the earth will bring
forth much more abundant crops

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.640
than at present for
the benefit of

00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.050
rapidly propagating mankind.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:41.930
So it's interesting
to see the world--

00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:42.910
it's a great book to read.

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:46.140
And you can see people in the
1830s were already calculating

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.600
heat transfer coefficients
to how much

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.400
the earth was changing.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.970
We're going to post these
to the website.

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:55.230
This was, last year, in
the New York Times.

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:57.640
Every Tuesday they have
a science section.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.260
And this was about glass.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:04.420
And very, actually, with your
3.091 knowledge, you'll read

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.600
this like a newspaper, and
it'll be very easy.

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.590
And they go through
the structure.

00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:11.770
Here's the structure
of a window glass.

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:13.420
You can see the network,
former network

00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:14.970
modifier, and so on.

00:44:14.970 --> 00:44:18.630
And they talk about how
difficult it is from a first

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:23.160
principle's standpoint to model
the structure of glass.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:27.210
These oxide glasses are complex
and not easy to model.

00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:29.990
So when you're trying to
engineer the glasses, instead

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:33.430
of trial and error, it's hard
to do so by theory.

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:37.820
And it talks about some efforts
at theory, and so on.

00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.380
And the last thing I want
to talk about is

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.640
bulk metallic glasses.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:48.170
You recall that I showed you
metallic glass that was made

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:53.550
by melting gold silicon,
and dripping it onto a

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:58.000
water-cooled copper wheel that
was zooming around to give us

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.830
a cooling rate of about a
million degrees a second.

00:45:01.830 --> 00:45:06.020
And those strips had
to be very, very

00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:07.210
thin, the metal strips.

00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:13.110
Because you've got liquid
dripping down, and we're

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:15.330
pulling the solid away,
and there's a

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:18.600
finite thickness here.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:20.250
Let's use a Greek letter, xi.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:22.210
There's a finite thickness xi.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:25.680
Because what's happening is that
this is the water-cooled

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.100
copper wheel, and you're
extracting heat here.

00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:32.370
But eventually, the thermal
conductivity of the metal is

00:45:32.370 --> 00:45:33.690
the limiter.

00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:35.080
In other words, I don't
care how cold.

00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.240
You can put this in liquid
helium if you want.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:40.660
You can't get the heat through
the metal fast enough.

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:44.350
And what happens is, when you
look down here, the lower part

00:45:44.350 --> 00:45:46.820
is amorphous and the upper
part is crystalline.

00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:48.450
So you don't end up with
metallic glass.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:51.370
You end up with some metallic
glass, and the upper part is

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:52.510
crystalline.

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:56.120
So what happens when you end up
with the limitation being

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.080
the thermal conductivity
of the metal?

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.010
At that point, you're
finished.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:04.330
And this was typically on
the order of microns.

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:06.520
And then they got up to,
sort of, submillimeter.

00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.190
And that was it.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:09.770
So the glass that I showed
you was foil.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.640
Now what happened was,
with more research--

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.200
so here we are.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.950
This is Pol Duwez at Caltech,
gold silicon.

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:17.460
And this is the thickness
in centimeters.

00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:22.250
So you were down here at some
tens of microns, all right?

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:28.260
Now, in the '60s, research at
Harvard uncovered a set of

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.760
palladium alloys that had better
thermal conductivity

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:36.560
and, remember the first day,
about the analogy to the

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.800
musical chairs?

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.350
These things have slightly
more complicated crystal

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:41.320
structures.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.660
So for a given cooling rate, the
metal has more difficulty

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.460
finding the proper
lattice site.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.760
And they were able to make
metallic glasses that were on

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.650
the order of 0.1 centimeters.

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:53.470
That's still fairly thin.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:58.555
And then back to Caltech in the
late '80s, early '90s, and

00:46:58.555 --> 00:47:03.740
a man by name of Bill Johnson
was able to develop a set of

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:07.300
alloys that can be made
in bulk form.

00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:09.290
Totally amorphous metal.

00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:11.290
And these are known as bulk
metallic glasses.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:15.540
And look at the complexity
of the alloy designation.

00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.360
So now you see, well, why
are they doing this?

00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.430
Because look, this is strength
versus elastic limit.

00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:22.430
So you can either have things
like polymers, that you can

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.830
stretch very, very far, but they
don't have much strength.

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:29.560
Or you can have things like
certain steels, that are very,

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:33.560
very strong, but you can't
bend them very far.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:36.330
And bulk metallic glass has
put you right up here.

00:47:36.330 --> 00:47:39.000
You have strong alloys
that have very, very

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.040
high elastic limits.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.410
So they make great golf clubs
and tennis rackets and so on,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:46.400
because they can flex way back,
store enormous energy,

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.650
and then spring.

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:52.460
So here are some bulk metallic
glasses, and

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.130
here's a classic one.

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:58.565
This is zirconium, titanium,
copper, nickel, beryllium.

00:47:58.565 --> 00:48:00.060
All right, now how
do we get that?

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:05.900
Well, zirconium and titanium are
body-centered cubic, we've

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:09.740
got copper and nickel are
face-centered cubic, and

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.540
beryllium is hexagonal
close-packed.

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:17.130
So the idea here is the
principle of confusion.

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:19.840
So the alloy is fighting
with itself.

00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:22.100
You know, am I face-centered
cubic, am I body-centered

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.780
cubic, am I hexagonal?

00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:28.650
And this confusion about what
the crystal structure is to be

00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:32.440
leads to quenching and the
disorder of a liquid state,

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:34.840
and preventing the formation
of grain boundaries,

00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:36.520
dislocations and so on.

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.880
So I want to show you one
example besides golf clubs.

00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:45.220
Dave, could we cut to the
document camera here?

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:48.310
Get this thing down.

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:50.890
So this is a--

00:48:50.890 --> 00:48:53.280
I'm not endorsing the product at
all, but you know, this is

00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.720
one of the companies
that makes, this

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.090
is SanDisk, I think.

00:48:57.090 --> 00:48:59.870
And they make these
flash memories.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.820
This just looks like a another
piece of metal, and in fact,

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:05.270
it's very disarming,
because they call

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.820
this model the Titanium.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.430
Well, it has about
13% titanium.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:11.900
The interesting thing here,
what's so cool about this,

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:13.900
this is bulk metallic glass.

00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.360
And what's attractive about
the fact that it's bulk

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.800
metallic glass is, that it can
be shaped by casting, from the

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.810
liquid state to very,
very fine precision.

00:49:24.810 --> 00:49:27.680
So you see all of these slots
and everything, and on the

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:31.830
side, all of this kind of
stuff, and on the end.

00:49:31.830 --> 00:49:34.770
All of this is done by casting
from the liquid

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:37.320
state, in one operation.

00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.290
And this is a clam shell.

00:49:38.290 --> 00:49:39.250
There's two pieces here.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:41.660
I don't know if you can see,
but there's two pieces that

00:49:41.660 --> 00:49:43.000
have been sandwiched together.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.530
You can see on the edge there.

00:49:44.530 --> 00:49:48.300
And the impact that has on
manufacturing costs is

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:51.900
phenomenal, because normally
you make the basic shells,

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:54.220
then you have to drill,
and you've got to

00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:55.320
auger out, and so on.

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:57.320
This thing, one step operation,

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.400
including the labeling.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:03.330
There's no subsequent
processing.

00:50:03.330 --> 00:50:06.810
And this is done by a company
out in Michigan

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:09.220
called Liquid Metal.

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:11.630
And they've licensed the
technology and so on.

00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:13.610
And again, I'm not trying to
make a commercial thing, but

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:18.790
I'm just trying to show you that
these ideas of changing

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:22.200
properties for engineered
materials, you know, are

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:24.870
around us everywhere.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:26.410
And this is relatively recent.

00:50:26.410 --> 00:50:27.920
Bulk metallic glass.

00:50:27.920 --> 00:50:31.830
Fantastic example of structure
property relations.

00:50:31.830 --> 00:50:33.080
OK.
