00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Now, despite being a really brilliant thinker,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Archimedes estimate of the earth's circumference seems to have been a guess.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And that's not the best way to do physics.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's look at alternatives to guessing.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One thing we could do to maybe improve on just a blind guess is we could have many people make guesses

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and then take the average.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Or we could look at the geometry of a sphere

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and somehow find a clever way to calculate the circumference.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We could also wrap a really long string around the earth and measure the length.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Or we could determine the circumference of the moon and assume the earth is the same size.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Of these four alternatives, which do you think is the best?

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Just choose your favorite answer.
