00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:07.834
When I look at this ship,
it just speaks seedy to me.

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:09.800
There's something
suspicious about it.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.300
Not only is it a reefer
with a Chinese name,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.633
indicating that it could be
Chinese or Taiwanese, but now

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:16.633
all of a sudden it's
got a Bolivian flag,

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:18.367
and that's a flag
of convenience.

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:34.867
The irony, of course, about La
Paz and the flag of convenience

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:38.667
of Bolivia, is that it's
a landlocked country,

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.700
and it has no coastline.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.166
I want to take a look around
because these reefers will also

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.767
have a log of all the
long-liners that came up to it

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:50.867
and try and shift with it.

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:57.200
Now imagine if all of a sudden
we can find Ping Shin 101.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.867
I thought there'd
be no one on board.

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:01.767
I was wrong.

00:01:01.767 --> 00:01:03.567
They may have a pilot
ladder they could toss down.

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:06.000
But it looks like right
now they're making a call.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.066
This will likely
be for permission.

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:15.266
[non-english speech]

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.633
Whoever they were talking
to does the trick.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.633
Good evening, gentlemen.

00:01:25.633 --> 00:01:26.734
What's the story with this ship?

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:30.667
OK.

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.367
There have been cases
where reefers have

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:38.934
been used for narcotics
trafficking, typically

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:39.967
in South America.

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.166
Are you getting paid
well for this job?

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:47.233
At least what?

00:01:53.533 --> 00:01:56.800
I'm hunting for the reefer's
log or any other clues

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.300
that could identify the
ships that came alongside.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.567
Imagine all these longliners
that are coming in,

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:06.166
in this case the
Indian Ocean, all

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.233
rendezvousing with this
vessel and conducting

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.033
massive transhipments.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.233
Longlining buoys.

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:31.734
It's pretty eerie down here.

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:34.734
I'm waiting to find either a
dead body or about 100 migrants

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:35.500
that are being smuggled.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.300
There's no GA.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.100
They ripped it off.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.133
A GA's a General Assessment.

00:02:42.133 --> 00:02:46.266
It's basically like the
floor plan, blueprint.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.967
That's probably the
captain's quarters in there.

00:02:53.934 --> 00:02:56.033
It's almost like he
left in a complete rush.

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:10.633
The reefer is a dead-end.

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:14.533
I need to know hoodlum's name,
and I still need a motive.
