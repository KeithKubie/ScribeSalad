00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.620
In the last video,
we gave an argument

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.140
for why 3 to the
negative 2 power

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.310
should be equivalent to 1 over
3 to the positive 2 power.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.370
I now want to do a
very similar argument,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.210
but I want to do it for general
bases and general exponents.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.520
So in particular, I
want to think about what

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.970
a to the b power,
or in particular,

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.030
what a to the negative b
power should be equal to.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.600
So we know that we want
to uphold the property

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.050
that, if we have the base
raised to an exponent

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.370
and then that's being multiplied
by that same base raised

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.230
to another exponent,
that we would just

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.600
add the two exponents.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.760
So just to be clear, we want
to maintain this property,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:54.440
that a to the b power times
a to the negative b power

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.630
should be equal to a to
the b plus negative b

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.069
power, which of
course is going to be

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:07.390
equal to a to the 0-th power.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.110
And as long as a
does not equal to 0,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.350
this should be equal to 1.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.730
Let me write that--
for a does not equal 0.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:24.280
So in general-- actually I'll
just copy and paste this-- a

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.410
to the b times a to
the negative b-- copy

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.065
and paste-- should
be equal to 1.

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:35.111
So this right over here
needs to be equal to 1.

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:37.610
And so if we want think about,
what does a to the negative b

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.110
equal?

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.850
We just divide both
sides by a to the b.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.075
And we would get a
to the negative b.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.515
I've kept the colors
consistent this long.

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:50.920
Gotta keep going.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.280
a to the negative b is
equal to 1 over a to the b.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.510
And so I just want
to review this.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.350
And it's really
important to keep in mind

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.800
because when you see
something as a base

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.990
to a negative exponent,
there's a temptation

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.940
to somehow introduce
a negative number.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.860
But a negative
exponent is really

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.860
about taking the reciprocal.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.920
So you're taking the reciprocal
of this number raised

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.885
to the positive base.

00:02:19.885 --> 00:02:21.260
And we've just
shown the argument

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.940
that if we want this
property be true--

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.030
and a lot of the
properties of exponents

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.250
are all about just keeping
consistency, keeping

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.180
the old properties continuing
to be true as we introduce

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.500
new definitions and
new properties--

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.820
and we see that if we
want this to be true,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.970
then a to the negative b
should be 1 over a to the b.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.180
And in other videos we'll
show other motivations

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.120
for why a negative exponent is
essentially defined this way.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.070
But now that we've
seen this is true,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.540
for any non-zero
a and any b, let's

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.870
actually do some examples.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.930
And actually, let's think about
the size of these numbers.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.810
So for example-- and let
me introduce new colors

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.570
right over here.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.750
I said I would
introduce new colors,

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.400
and I didn't-- if I were to
take 5 to the third power,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.850
we know that's 5
times 5 times 5.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.600
That is equal to 125.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.830
It's a reasonably large number.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.630
Now what should 5 to
the negative 3 power be?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.530
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.020
and think about this
before I tell you.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.370
Use what I just told you.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.590
What should 5 to the
negative 3 power be?

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.160
Well, I assume you've
paused the video.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.270
So this is going to
be equal to 1 over 5

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:53.570
to the positive 3 power,
which is equal to 1/125.

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.290
So this is really interesting.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.530
5 to the third was a
reasonably large number.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.170
While 5 to the negative 3,
it wasn't a negative number.

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.280
It's still a positive number,
but it's a very small number.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.270
It's 1/125.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.370
Let's do two more examples.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:21.160
Let's say I were to
take negative 1/2,

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.540
and I were to raise
this to the third power.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.730
What is that going to be?

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.790
Well, it's negative 1/2
times negative 1/2 times

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.740
negative 1/2, which
is, of course,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.030
going to be equal
to negative 1/8.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:49.060
Now what should negative
1/2 to the negative 3 power

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.330
be, based on everything
that we just talked about?

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.740
And once again, I encourage
you to pause this video

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.180
and think about it.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.230
Well it should be equal
to 1 over negative 1/2

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.640
to the positive 3 power.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.360
Well, we just figured
out what that is.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:11.090
Negative 1/2 to the positive
3 power is negative 1/8.

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.170
This thing right over
here should be equal

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:14.770
to negative 1/8.

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:20.880
So it's going to be equal
to 1 over negative 1/8.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.490
And what's that equal to?

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.750
Well that's equal to
1 times the reciprocal

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.130
of this denominator over here.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.290
So it's 1 times
negative 8/1, which

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.690
is going to be
equal to negative 8.

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.120
So this is interesting.

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.920
Normally when you take a
number whose absolute value is

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.634
less than 1 and you take it to
larger and larger exponents,

00:05:46.634 --> 00:05:48.300
it gets smaller and
smaller and smaller.

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.930
When you multiply either a
positive or negative 1/2 times

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.640
1/2 times 1/2, its magnitude,
its absolute value,

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.170
is normally going to get
smaller and smaller and smaller.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.490
But now, when you raise
it to a negative exponent,

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.780
it's absolute value is getting
larger and larger and larger.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.840
And that's because, once again,
you are taking the reciprocal.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.324
The important thing I
want to emphasize here

00:06:12.324 --> 00:06:13.990
is that you shouldn't
view this negative

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.010
as when you think about
negative multiplication.

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.460
Notice, this negative
did not change

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.200
the sign of what the
eventual value is.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.380
You've got negative 1/8.

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.630
You got negative 8.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.130
What it did is, it
changed the magnitude.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.980
So this is negative 1/8.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.000
When you took to the
negative third power,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.430
you took the reciprocal of
that, which is negative 8.
