00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.455
- [Instructor] You've
probably seen plants,

00:00:01.455 --> 00:00:03.734
either in your house or
if you go for a walk.

00:00:03.734 --> 00:00:06.122
You've seen parts of the
plants twist and turn

00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:07.791
in all sorts of directions.

00:00:07.791 --> 00:00:10.420
And if you observe closely,
you'll see that oftentimes,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.111
it looks like the plant is twisting

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:14.737
or turning towards the light.

00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:16.245
And what we're gonna do in this video

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:19.071
is study that phenomenon
a little bit more.

00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:21.756
So, in general, whenever we're
talking about an organism

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:24.791
twisting, or turning,
or changing direction

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.957
because of some type of external stimulus,

00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:30.204
we call that tropism,

00:00:30.204 --> 00:00:31.037
tropism.

00:00:32.245 --> 00:00:35.851
And in the case of turning
or switching directions

00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:39.028
because the external stimulus is light,

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:42.412
we would call that phototropism,

00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:43.495
phototropism.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.515
And phototropism is the general term

00:00:46.515 --> 00:00:49.870
for any type of organism
turning direction,

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.210
or switching direction, or
moving in a certain direction

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.269
because of light.

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.150
And it could be moving towards the light,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.825
or it could be moving away from the light.

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.318
Now, most of what we observe,

00:01:01.318 --> 00:01:02.703
if you were to go see a forest,

00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:05.552
you'll see that there
might be a patch in the,

00:01:05.552 --> 00:01:07.492
or there might be an
opening in the canopy,

00:01:07.492 --> 00:01:10.136
where the light is coming.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:13.423
And you'll often see trees and plants

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:17.864
moving towards that light,
growing towards that light.

00:01:17.864 --> 00:01:19.966
So, they are turning towards it.

00:01:19.966 --> 00:01:23.349
This would be called
positive phototropism.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.137
If for some reason, there
was some type of a plant

00:01:26.137 --> 00:01:27.706
that was moving away from it,

00:01:27.706 --> 00:01:30.020
that would be negative phototropism,

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.877
which is a little bit less,
or it's a lot less usual,

00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:35.500
especially for the stem of a plant,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.609
but we might talk about
that in future videos.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:38.823
But what you would typically see

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:42.425
is positive phototropism like this.

00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:43.807
And so, the question is,

00:01:43.807 --> 00:01:46.089
is how does a plant do this?

00:01:46.089 --> 00:01:50.394
What causes it to turn in
the direction of the light

00:01:50.394 --> 00:01:53.778
in the case of positive phototropism?

00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:57.945
Well, the key actor here
is a molecule called auxin.

00:01:59.547 --> 00:02:01.289
It's auxin.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.456
And auxin is phytohormone.

00:02:04.335 --> 00:02:05.835
So, this is phyto,

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.232
phytohormone.

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:10.697
And

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:14.058
it's a fancy word for, this
is just a molecule involved

00:02:14.058 --> 00:02:17.117
in the actual plant growth.

00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:20.960
And so, what happens, let me
zoom in here on this plant,

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.234
let me zoom here on this plant.

00:02:23.234 --> 00:02:26.055
And to be clear, we know how auxin acts.

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:29.262
But all of the mechanisms by
which the distribution of auxin

00:02:29.262 --> 00:02:32.226
changes or how it gets
activated or deactivated

00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:34.713
isn't completely understood.

00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:37.553
And this is still an
area of active research.

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:40.158
But, what we know happens,

00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:42.241
so let's say the light is coming from

00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:44.315
that direction over here,

00:02:44.315 --> 00:02:47.910
is for various reasons,
or for some reasons,

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.042
you have an increase
concentration of active auxin

00:02:52.042 --> 00:02:54.810
on the side of the plant
away from the light.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.789
So, you're going to have more auxin,

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.855
in this case since the light
is coming from the left,

00:02:58.855 --> 00:03:01.770
you're gonna have more auxin on the right

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.779
than you are going to have on the left.

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.780
And what the auxin on the
right is causing to do,

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.782
it causes the cells

00:03:09.782 --> 00:03:14.196
on the right side of this
stem right here to elongate.

00:03:14.196 --> 00:03:15.814
So, if we were to zoom in,

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:18.399
so let me zoom in over here,

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:21.683
yeah, so let me take
that part of the plant.

00:03:21.683 --> 00:03:22.844
And

00:03:22.844 --> 00:03:24.594
if I were to zoom in,

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.829
if I were to zoom in, and if the cells,

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.456
I'm just gonna have a
two-dimensional view here.

00:03:30.456 --> 00:03:33.258
Let's say on this side,
these are the cells.

00:03:33.258 --> 00:03:37.613
And on this side, these
are the other cells.

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:41.415
Now, if we have more auxin,
more of this phytohormone

00:03:41.415 --> 00:03:43.870
on the right-hand side, right over here,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.212
than we have on the left,

00:03:45.212 --> 00:03:48.660
what we know happens is
it causes the cell walls,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.505
where there's more auxin, to
break down a little bit more.

00:03:51.505 --> 00:03:55.864
And so, it allows those
cells to stretch or elongate.

00:03:55.864 --> 00:03:57.435
And so, what's going to happen,

00:03:57.435 --> 00:03:59.348
let me see if I can draw this,

00:03:59.348 --> 00:04:03.550
is the cells on the right-hand
side are going to stretch,

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.752
are going to stretch, or elongate,

00:04:06.752 --> 00:04:09.182
because of the auxin,

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:11.928
because they have more auxin in them

00:04:11.928 --> 00:04:15.018
than the cells on the left-hand side.

00:04:15.018 --> 00:04:17.415
And since these have
a higher concentration

00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:20.174
of active auxin, they stretch.

00:04:20.174 --> 00:04:22.103
And if the right-hand side gets longer

00:04:22.103 --> 00:04:24.464
than the left-hand side,
what's going to happen?

00:04:24.464 --> 00:04:28.499
Well, the plant is going
to bend to the left.

00:04:28.499 --> 00:04:31.832
So, the plant is going to bend like that

00:04:32.676 --> 00:04:34.453
because now the right-hand side

00:04:34.453 --> 00:04:37.006
is longer than the left-hand side.

00:04:37.006 --> 00:04:39.555
So, this is what we know about auxin.

00:04:39.555 --> 00:04:41.288
It's a phytohormone

00:04:41.288 --> 00:04:43.906
that whenever it is in
higher concentrations

00:04:43.906 --> 00:04:48.215
and it's active, the cells
there are going to elongate,

00:04:48.215 --> 00:04:50.340
which will cause this bending.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.774
Now, the things that are
still being studied is

00:04:52.774 --> 00:04:57.179
well, what caused there to be
a higher auxin concentration

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:59.978
on the right-hand side, and
all of the exact mechanisms

00:04:59.978 --> 00:05:03.069
by which the auxin is actually acting.

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:05.305
We know things like it creates
a more acidic environment,

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.077
which helps break down the cell walls.

00:05:07.077 --> 00:05:08.273
But how does it, you,

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:11.804
how do you have a higher
concentration here on the right?

00:05:11.804 --> 00:05:15.818
Well, in many plants studied,
it's actually the blue light

00:05:15.818 --> 00:05:17.596
that causes the sensitivity.

00:05:17.596 --> 00:05:18.671
So, I drew this as yellow,

00:05:18.671 --> 00:05:20.976
but really I should
draw this as blue light

00:05:20.976 --> 00:05:22.580
that causes the sensitivity.

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.854
Although, it's not always blue light.

00:05:23.854 --> 00:05:24.691
It could be red light.

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.788
It could be other frequencies of light.

00:05:26.788 --> 00:05:28.313
And the various theories,

00:05:28.313 --> 00:05:30.373
and it might be some combination of it,

00:05:30.373 --> 00:05:34.540
is when you have the light
on one side of the plant,

00:05:35.537 --> 00:05:37.293
that it causes, one possibility is

00:05:37.293 --> 00:05:39.600
maybe it causes the auxin to migrate

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.942
from the side with the light

00:05:40.942 --> 00:05:43.116
to the side that has less light.

00:05:43.116 --> 00:05:47.348
Another possibility is if
the auxin is migrating down

00:05:47.348 --> 00:05:49.189
from the top of the stem,

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:51.351
that it might cause more to migrate

00:05:51.351 --> 00:05:56.019
where there is less light
than when there is more light.

00:05:56.019 --> 00:05:58.893
There is other possibilities,
that somehow the light

00:05:58.893 --> 00:06:01.281
deactivates the auxin on the left,

00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:04.803
or maybe allows less auxin to be produced

00:06:04.803 --> 00:06:07.287
than what would happen on the right.

00:06:07.287 --> 00:06:09.080
So, these are all possibilities.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.020
And this is what's
interesting about science

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.893
is that there's always
more for us to understand.

00:06:13.893 --> 00:06:15.133
But what we do know

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:17.346
is that this type of
positive phototropism,

00:06:17.346 --> 00:06:19.116
which you will often in the forest

00:06:19.116 --> 00:06:21.019
or you'll even see it on a house plant,

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:22.038
if you put it next to a window,

00:06:22.038 --> 00:06:23.079
it'll bend towards the window,

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:25.186
or it'll often bend towards the window.

00:06:25.186 --> 00:06:29.209
It's caused, the key actor here is auxin

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:30.755
and the distribution of auxin

00:06:30.755 --> 00:06:32.583
changing in response to the light,

00:06:32.583 --> 00:06:35.626
and that the auxin distribution increases

00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:37.867
on the side away from the light

00:06:37.867 --> 00:06:40.641
when you have positive phototropism.

00:06:40.641 --> 00:06:41.555
Now, this picture here

00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:43.240
looks like this might be phototropism,

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.822
but this is actual a mutant plant

00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:47.628
that actually is lacking auxin.

00:06:47.628 --> 00:06:50.745
So, it's growing in all
sorts of random directions,

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:53.869
but it's just interesting to look at.
