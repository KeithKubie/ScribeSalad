00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.620
If you wanted to cure cancer or solve
Alzheimer's disease, would you study a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.330
jellyfish? A lot of people would say, 'No
way. What does medical research have to do

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.170
with the sea creature?' But it turns out
that asking a simple question about a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.220
jellyfish led to a powerful new tool
that's completely transformed research.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.900
It all began with a simple question: what
makes a jellyfish glow? There's a type of

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.180
jellyfish known as the crystal jelly. A
researcher named Osamu Shimomura began

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.500
studying it in the 1960s and he
discovered a protein in the jellyfish

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.879
that glows bright green under a UV light.
It came to be known as the green

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:47.190
fluorescent protein or GFP, for short.
Years later, a researcher named Martin

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.970
Chalfie heard about the green
fluorescent protein at a conference. 'I

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.489
got very excited and immediately ignored
the rest of the seminar and just sat

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.510
there fantasizing about what would
happen if we could possibly take his

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.290
protein and allow it to be made inside
of our worms and look at how things were

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.759
being made.' At the time he was studying
these small organisms called round worms.

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.960
There's all this activity going on
inside of an organism that's completely

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.750
invisible to researchers — even with a
microscope.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.759
Martin realized that he could use GFPs as
a way to map inner workings of a round

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.530
worms. This was a big deal. Like the
invention of the microscope, the x-ray or

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.600
the MRI, green fluorescent protein opened
up a new world for scientists. They could

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.140
suddenly see what was happening inside
of a cell that had been completely

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.280
invisible before. But the green
fluorescent protein wasn't perfect. It

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.570
would lose its color over time and it wasn't the ideal color for all studies. Here's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.460
where UC San Diego researcher Roger
Tsien enters the story. Roger developed

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.689
variants of GFP that were brighter and
came in a variety of colors beyond green.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.430
'And we then had to come up with names
for these and upon examination the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.020
Crayola website and other consultations,
we realized that the simplest — instead of

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.490
giving them numerical names, were names like this monomeric banana, orange, tandem

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.440
dimer tomato, tangerine, etc., all the way
out the plum.'  This beach scene in a petri

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.670
dish was made using some of these
colorful variants in Rogers lab at UC

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.310
San Diego. But these glowing proteins aren't just

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.120
pretty. They allow researchers to mark
and observe more than one thing at a

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.350
time. Researchers at Harvard University
use them to color nerve cells in a

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.280
mouse's brain to see how they form a
network. The experiment was called 'the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.770
brainbow.' Today scientists at some of

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.870
the world's leading hospitals use green

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.790
fluorescent proteins to study all sorts
of diseases. UC Davis uses it for HIV

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.849
research, while UC San Diego uses GFP to track

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.450
breast cancer tumors. And Mass General
has used the technology to better

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.010
understand Alzheimer's disease.
When Osamu Shimomura began his research,

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.730
he didn't know that this jellyfish
protein would lead to a scientific

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.780
revolution. He was just trying to answer
a basic question about how our world

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.519
works. And in 2008, these three
researchers won the Nobel Prize for

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.000
chemistry. 'One has to wonder how many
other secrets there are out there and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.010
organisms that we are not being able to
look at because funding is not viewed as

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.660
important for research, when in fact we
need to learn so much more.' In science,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.370
ideas are kind of like seeds. If you're
lucky a seed will grow and expand the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.700
boundaries of human knowledge, but it's
hard to know which seeds will take root.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.890
Take any invention or modern innovation
and in its history you'll find decades

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.459
or even centuries of odd and obscure
research that led to its creation. The

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.819
development of green fluorescent
proteins took decades of work and it

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.269
wouldn't have been possible without
sustained funding from federal agencies

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:49.380
like the National Institutes of Health
and the National Science Foundation.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.819
Funding for federal research agencies is
more important than ever as we tackle

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.319
some of the greatest scientific and
technological challenges of our time. To
