You've heard the saying, "it takes a
village to raise a child" and today,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.250
it has taken a village
to put on this program.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.400
And I just want to welcome
each of you in behalf

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.190

that has been prepared
for you today.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.350 position:56%
Again, we welcome you, and at this
time we'll have Mister Pinckney come

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.670
and give his presentation.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.340
&gt;&gt; Kevin Pinckney: Good morning,
my name is Kevin Pinckney,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.280
and in June of this year I
went to my first Comic Con,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.890
there was too much to
see and little time.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.540
So, I chose what two items I
wanted to see at the program.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.890
One of the programs was this
one called the -- here we are --

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.420
the unacknowledged
history of black creators

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.390 position:56%
and black characters in comic books.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.570
And as you see, as Mister Goza
has already stated there is a lot

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.380
of information, and he
barely had enough time then,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.180
to give his presentation.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.170
And he's already started ahead of
time, and I'm sure by the time --

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.360
times up, he'll have
even more to go.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.010
He said five or six
hours, so -- Yes, exactly.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.010
So, Darrell goes ahead
of creation --

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.660
creatives script graphic comic
books, affirmed specialized

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.890
in commercial art and design,
he's a well-known author

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.700
of African-American comics, and who
has explored the American history

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.730 position:56%
which shaped the comic book history.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.170
David McLane [phonetic]
to the far end,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.830
is co-owner of Graphic,
Rhythmic Productions.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.300 position:56%
Mister McLane is a cartoonist and
illustrator, he does create his work

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.740
in New York City metropolitan area,

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.850
and has been in the graphic
arts business since 1970.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.550
Katrina Oxner [phonetic]
sitting to my left, and those --

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.310
made digital systems and
social media integration

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.940
for Goza Creative Script
Graphics comic books.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.410
Miss Oxner works on creative
resources for the firm,

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:25.330
and provides costumer engagement
and investigative capabilities

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.330
to strengthen their brand.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.270 position:56%
And I was going to talk -- ask about
Stan, but he's already startled

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:36.660
by that, because that's the
concept that I was thinking

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.960
about when he was giving
his presentation in June.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.570
The other group that was
briefly mentioned was the Library

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.730
of Congress professional
associations, What If,

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.240
Science Fiction and Fantasy Club.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.970
And I'm going to leave
it to Mister Goza now,

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.360
to pick up where he left off,

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.160
I got the script ready,
and we'll go for that.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.460
Thank you.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.760
&gt;&gt; Darrell Goza: Thank you.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.820 position:56%
My name is Darrell Goza, I represent
Goza Creative Script Graphics.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.360
Initially, when I first
started doing work in comics,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.870
I used to do a lot of
shows, and when I was

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.840
in college a gentleman met
me at a show on Neil Adams,

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.650
and he said he liked the work
that I was doing, he said,

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.050
"Come work for me, you can
learn more about comics with me,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.180
that you'll ever learn in school".

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.480 position:56%
So, within two weeks I was at his
studio on New York, and I work there

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.410
for nearly 15 years --
actually, more like 20, OK?

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.880
I ended up leaving it, because
I looked out and I realized

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.720
that as long as you are working for
somebody else, in that capacity,

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.640
you don't get to spread
your own wings,

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.680
is always about having his
wings been [inaudible].

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.630
And Neil has some big
wings, trust me.

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.750
He's very good, he
has one of the most --

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.510 position:56%
well, I call it the most devastating
work ethic on the planet.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.090
I'm trying to have one
even better than his.

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:01.940
He's a guy that during
his formative years,

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.300
only had to do 10 comps
in his class.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.770
He wanted to be the
best in his class,

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.280
so he did 100, and
picked his best 10.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.460
It took two years before the
students in the class with him,

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.830
realized they needed to do that,
if they wanted to beat him, OK?

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.990
So, coming into that with
this, I looked and said,

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.550
"If I'm going to do
a comic book line,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.390
what's the one big problem
most comic book lines have?"

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.460
Is that they produce a
book, put into the market,

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.960
hope it makes money, and then
they try to make the next one.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.260
And then, they hope
that makes money,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.650
and then they try to
do the next one.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.080
So, I looked at my team, when
I started assembling my team,

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.380 position:56%
and said, "We don't want to do that.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.190 position:56%
We want to have 50 books in the camp
before we launch" So, this way --

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.010
then it's just a question of
getting in into the market.

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.940
And we found that that's going to
be the best way for us to do this.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.920
Now, I'm going to tell you
something about creatives;

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.120
they are notoriously
-- like Batman says,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.180
that criminals are
notoriously cowardly lot, well,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.360
most creatives are
notoriously lazy lot.

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.660
How do I know?

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:00.600
I used to be one of them,
until I met Neil, OK?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.790
Once that happens, and you
start working with creatives,

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.180
you start to find out
they have two ways

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.790
in which they operate
with their work.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:07.800
One, you stroke their ego
and make them feel good,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.540 position:56%
and maybe they'll work, or you don't
work with them at all, because,

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.980
ultimately if you have to stroke
the ego to get them to work there,

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:15.740
they're not committed
to their work at all;

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.270
they're committed to their ego.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.120
And I'm not against them
being committed to their ego,

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.390
but in this industry, you need
someone that can do the work,

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.050
because you have to do a
minimum; minimum one page a day,

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.280
complete one page a day, if
you can't do one page a day

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.320
in comic book art, you're
in the wrong industry,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.790
you're in the wrong field.

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.660
And I know this from experience,
and I know from every other person

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.920 position:56%
and about the most people are trying
to do more than that Jack Kirby,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.430
who helped Stan Lee build
the Marvel universe,

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.750
he used to do up to
five pages a day.

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:45.760
And that's why he got be
known as phenomenal --

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.970
to be the phenomenon that he was.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.550
Today, we're going to talk about
some of the unknown creators

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.300
out there that were just as
diligent doing what they did

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.370
but they didn't receive the
accolades for what they did.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.840
But, before we can even begin
that conversation we have to start

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.450
with the conversation that says,
where do the images of us come

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.730
from in the first place, how did
they come about, what created them,

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.380
and what made them so resistant
on getting away from them --

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:15.170
so resistant, or resistant to
us overall, and to do that,

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.090
we have to go back when they
first started, all right?

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:21.300
'1950s; birth of a nation.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.820
Affectionately called the classmen
marked the time in our history,

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.470
when we weren't allowed
to even play ourselves

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.370
in popular media productions.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.060
Instead, they were white actors
that took [inaudible] on black,

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:34.070
in their face for the playouts,
and were even more than not,

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.480
more stereotypical than
they were realistic.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:39.680 position:56%
And here's an interesting thing; the
gentleman you see in this picture,

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.420
his name was Bert Williams.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:47.620
He was a Jamaican, who had to put
caulk on his face to get work.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.930
Think of that concept, a black
guy has to put caulk on his face

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:55.300
to get work as a black guy, OK?

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.370
This is why I have laughed for
the most part, about how stuff

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:01.710
with us worked, back in the day.

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:04.580
Now, if you take a look for
the down, you'll see Al Jonson,

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.700
on the Jazz Singer, and
this also became a very,

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.920
very stereotypical image of
black people back in the day.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.690
And quite naturally,
since most comic book art,

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.910
or most art in general
reflects the sign of its times,

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.620
it you look right underneath
it, this was from a comic strip

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:29.320
of Mickey Mouse, where they
actually mimicked that image.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.220 position:56%
And I want you to take a look on the
image on the bottom lower right --

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.530
well, your right, my left.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:41.620 position:56%
That's a character called Little
Ape Boy [phonetic] keep him in mind.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.170
Next slide.

00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:47.450
In the 1930s, Looney Tunes

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.210
and Mickey Mouse did
those kind of things.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:54.230
In 1934, there was a comic strip
called Mandrake the Magician,

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:56.790
and there was a character they
introduced that they called Lothar.

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.660
This was one of the first attempts
to actually humanize black people

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.350
in this country, and what they
did was that they brought him in,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.200
and he was the king
of seven nations,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.010
or the prince of seven nations.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.460
Now, think about this.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.440
I'm a magician, I come to your
land, you're in line to be king

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:18.460
of seven nations, and you decide
that you wanted to be my sidekick.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.740
Shouldn't that have been
the other way around?

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.000
So, for all antics
and purposes, though,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.900 position:56%
they drew him fairly humanistic, OK?

00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.320
And that was a good thing
that was a good thing.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.600
Lee Falk understood something that
even back then, about the nature

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:38.600
of human beings and what people
looked for out in the world.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.880
You'll also notice that on
the lower right-hand side,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.370
there's a character called
Wacko, because back at that time,

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:46.160
Marvel was also looking
at these things,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:49.100
because when people were doing
stuff, they don't work in a vacuum.

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.500
So, if I create a Star
Wars; I can guarantee you,

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.750
there's going to be 15
rip-offs of Star Wars.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.500
So, if I created a character
like that and it turns

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.570
out to be a popular thing,
you're going to get people

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:02.770
that are going to also do that.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.430
Next slide.

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:10.750 position:56%
1936, Jackie Ormes; the thing
that's really interesting about her,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.680
her name was Zelda
Jackson when she was born,

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.570
but she took on the name
Jackie Ormes, and she was one

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:19.210
of the first females
and it's largely on --

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.710
she's largely perceived,
and largely received

00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:24.410
as being the first female --

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:28.020
the black female, African-American
cartoonist.

00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:30.220
In 19 -- when she did her strip,

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:34.950
she would actually
engage in social issues.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:36.990
She would actually
engage in social issues.

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:41.260
Now, early on, she did them fairly
benign, but when this strip came,

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.520
when she -- when they
brought it back on the '1950s,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.330
she actually went full tilted head
on, and took on social issues,

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:53.660
such as racism, such as poverty in
the actual comic strip itself, OK?

00:10:53.660 --> 00:11:00.640 position:56%
Next one. But, as it is in the
world, no good deed goes unpunished.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.830
So, what happens is that at that
time, when people actually started

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:10.100
to portray us in comic as being
human, then there was a backlash,

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.790
so people decided that
what they were going to do,

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:14.670
is that they were going to go
back to the old, original ideology

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:16.860
and iconography of who we were.

00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:20.490
Note Little Ape Boy, not only did
they do comics strips like this,

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:23.380
when they gave us the big head,
the dark skin, the big lips

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.460
and the big eyes, they put on
planes, and took it all the way

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.890
around the world, because
they wanted the entire world

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:30.460
to see us that way.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.830
Now, I want you to understand
something; I do not fault for being

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:37.920
who they are, at the time, when
they don't know any better.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.420
Back then, most people
did not know any better.

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.850
Remember that birth of a clan
-- that birth of a nation film,

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.910
it basically set the
standard for a lot of things,

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.990
and the way that people
looked at things in the world.

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:53.840
Did most of you know
that the burning cross

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.810
that most clansmen began to use,
wasn't even originally theirs?

00:11:57.810 --> 00:12:00.760
It was done in that
movie, and they adopted it.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:07.800
What a brilliant film, I
quote, 13 done by Ava DuVernay.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:14.420
If you get an opportunity, see
that film, rent it, download it,

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:17.690
go on Netflix and watch that film.

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:20.540
Because, she explains the
history of that, and she's very,

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.380
very succinct in how she does it.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.700
OK, next one.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:29.460
Now, as I said, if you remember,
even Stan Lee at the time,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.500
and this was when --
before Marvel was Marvel,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.290
when they were known
as Stan Lee Comics.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:37.530
Stan Lee Comics, they did
a book called Young Allies,

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:41.660
and in Young Allies they created a
character called Washington Jones.

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.970
And by the way, Washington
Jones was his name,

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.840
but what they called him
in it, was White Washed.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.800
His name was Washington
"White Washed" Jones.

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.090
And for the most part, what
he was used as is the guy

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.270
that always had to be rescued.

00:12:57.270 --> 00:13:00.560
He always had to be rescued,
he always had to be saved,

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.920
he was always the one getting
in trouble, and for all intents

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:07.180
and purposes he was
used for comic relief.

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.480
I don't want -- I'm trying to
figure a nice way to say it;

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.780
there's no nice way to say it.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.080
Comic Relief.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.000
And for the most part, this
is how characters were treated

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.660
over that time frame.

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:18.020
Now, I want you to
take a look at the one

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.650
at the upper right, all
the way on the side.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:20.950
That's the Spirit.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:23.460
Underneath you'll see a
character called Ebony White.

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:26.000
Ebony White was drawn exactly like,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.750
or in the same iconography
stereotypical way

00:13:28.750 --> 00:13:34.850
as White Washed Jones, there was
one difference though, the artist,

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:39.190
the creator of The
Spirit, Will Eisner;

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.840
he had a different ideology
about his character.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.920
So, whereas he drew him like that,

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:47.390
he actually had a character
being more human,

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:50.650
in the way that he was
interacting within the story.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:54.010
And I had a 45-minute conversation
with Will Eisner out of show,

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:55.890
because I wanted to
ask him about that,

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.230
I said, "Will, you're a hip guy.

00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:59.870
How could you even do that?

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.170
Why didn't you rail against him,

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:03.670
why didn't you showed them
what it should have been?"

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.680
he said, "Sign of the times".

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.370 position:56%
Those were his exacts words that was
a quote, those were his exact words,

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:11.120
it was the sign of the times.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.110
He said, "But, I did
at least, to my credit,

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:17.410
at least have him be heroic",

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:20.390
even in spite of the way
he was visually portrayed,

00:14:20.390 --> 00:14:23.250
and that was true.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:29.520
This gentleman's name is
Clarence Baker, this guy --

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.550
I never knew he was black
throughout his entire career;

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:33.880
I never really knew he was black.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.670
But, what he did was,
is he specialized

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.630
on what's known as good girl art.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:43.100 position:56%
Because, he knew that if you do good
girls, people would buy your books.

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:45.900
So, they put him -- he didn't
even start on Phantom Lady,

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.010
but he was the one that
changed her, and modified her.

00:14:49.010 --> 00:14:51.690
So, that she was as
sexy, as she is now.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:55.200
Now, here's the sad part
about that; at that time,

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.300
and let me give you the
date, because I want

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.600
to make sure that you know this.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:03.040
Now, we're in 1944, what happen
was that there was a gentleman

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.340
by the name of Fredric Wortham,

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:07.010
who was writing a book called
Seduction of the Innocents.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:08.960
And in Seduction of the Innocents,
what he was trying to do,

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:12.270
was say that comic books
led to juvenile delinquency,

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.450
because they had juvenile
delinquency problems in America,

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:15.960
or at least they thought they did.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.880
And so, what he did is that he
wrote a book called Seduction

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.800
of the Innocents, and in that
book, he said, that comic books

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.500
by a large, cause people --

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.080
young kids, to become
juvenile delinquents.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.220
He had no scientific data to
back that up, it was all based

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:32.270
on his own supposition in
it, and you end on his part.

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.340
But, the Phantom Lady; that's

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.060
on the bottom left, all
the way to the side.

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:39.410
That was one of the images
that he put in his book to say,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.180 position:56%
that this is one of the reasons
white kids are juvenile delinquents.

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:46.060
Because they see women
half naked in a comic book.

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.790
Go figure, go figure.

00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:54.120
Next one. Now, we're in 1947.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.420
Now, this is what I think --

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.840
again, remember; things go
in cycles with most people.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.210
You may start off one way with
an image and a stereotypical way

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.770
of seeing things, and as you
put that out on the world,

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:06.260
people will rebel and they'll do
something totally the opposite

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.560
of that.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.600
So, early we started with us
being global savages, then,

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.900
we became like Lothar; not really
that super intelligent yet,

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.040
but at least, we looked
at least human.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:22.930
Then, they went back to the other
stereotypical image, and now,

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:24.490
they say, "Well, wait a minute.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:27.570
There have been black that have
done a lot of things in the world",

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:31.360 position:56%
but again, we're not necessarily
heroes, but what they decided to do,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.880
is that they decided
that what they would do,

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:34.740
is that they would
actually start the show --

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.480
people that were real
life and out in the world.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.990
So, now they started doing
comic books about sport figures

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:43.730
or science guys, and things along
those lines because they were safe.

00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:47.900 position:56%
And basically, that's exactly what
it was; it was all about being safe.

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:51.630
You probably should view comic
books with more positive portrayals

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.230
of black characters than they did.

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.870
Paris Magazine Institute published
Negros Heroes, in the spin of 1947,

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:02.060
but the title would
only go two issues.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:05.130
There was not enough
people that was buying them.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:08.200 position:56%
And it was for reference, after that
point that they started doing it,

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.170
and then they started doing
more stuff along those lines.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.490
Well, it would actually be stuff
that was already being printed

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.750 position:56%
in newspaper, and they would compile
them and put it into books, OK?

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:22.700
Next one. In 1950 --
oh, let me go here.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:27.290
In 1950, [inaudible] did a
book called Negro Romance,

00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:29.000
which was the other side of that.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.540
But, on June of '47, a bunch
of creators that was working

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.920
for a newspaper called the Record,
decided that what they were going

00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.940
to do, is that they were
going to produce a comic book

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.910
that featured not only all
black writers and artists,

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.790
but all black characters.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.290 position:56%
And this book was called All Negro
Comics, and it was published in June

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:52.190
of 1947 as the first comic book to
be published by Black Americans,

00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:54.310
to feature black characters
and black creators.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:18:01.210
And may also be the first
independent book ever produced.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:04.900
African-American journalist
Orrin Cromwell Evans,

00:18:04.900 --> 00:18:10.590
decided that it was time that
black people had a comic book.

00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.150
So, he produced this book; he got a
bunch of his people from newspaper

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.530
of like mind, and they
produced the comic book.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.910
One of the things about this
comic book that I find to be very,

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.280
very interesting, is
that some of the --

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:24.690
they actually had super heroes
in it, they had detectives in it,

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.160
they had one little cute history,
with these little cherub --

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.890
little kids, that had
little wings and it was kind

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.850
of really, very, very nice.

00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:34.780
That's one of those
really like kid-say things.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:37.750
And when I was reading it, it was
funny, because when I first find

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.610
out about this, you couldn't
find this book anywhere.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:42.980
I heard of -- I've seen
one writing upon it,

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:44.730
one sentence on a paragraph,

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.880
and I started searching
on the internet for it.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.560
And it actually took me
over a year and a half,

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.350
to find any imaging from it.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.490
And then, I found some imaging from
it, because somebody had an issue

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:57.150
that they were trying
to sell online.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:59.760
So, now with a guy that has
scanned the entire book,

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.410
and he's now got the
entire book online.

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:04.650
I downloaded it right away,
the entire book, because I want

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:09.010
to have a history and a record of
all the books that have been done

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:12.350
by African-American creators,
and African-American people

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:15.670
that features African-American
characters.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:17.860
I want to actually create
an archive where we have

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.030
that entire thing laid out, where
people can go and they can see it

00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:25.510
in historical context, of how it
goes from year, to year, to year,

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:28.900
to year, and this is something
I'm pretty sure I really am --

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.100
I'm going to have to dedicate my
life to, because I had no idea

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:34.630
that there was as much out on
the world as there is, with this.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:37.000
Now, thank you, next one.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.300
This book.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.140
This book is called Treasure
Chest the Fun in Fact.

00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:42.870
Most people may not
know, have never --

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.100
may have never heard of this book,

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:47.640
don't mind me I'm just a little
bit nervous, it's been in moments

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.940
since I've given this lecture.

00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.710
So, I'm trying to remember
all of this stuff,

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.010
and the research that I did.

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.760
Because, I'm doing
research, far beyond this now.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.130
This book; the most
interesting thing about is,

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.060
this book was an anthology title.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.480
So, in this book they were
usually about 8 to 10 stories.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:06.510
This was one story called 1966.

00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:10.500
So, remember was done in
the '1950s, this was 1956.

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.620
So, they were postulating
20 years into the future,

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:16.300
where the presidential
campaign would look like.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:20.060
In that presidential campaign
the opposing character,

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:23.040
you never saw him, and his
name was Pettigrew [phonetic]

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.520
and you never saw him.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.300
They would always have
him hidden behind the tree

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.820
or a lamp, or a post.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.540
So, for the entire 10
issues that it ran,

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:33.280
you never saw that it
was a black candidate.

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.490
So, think about this, catholic
charities in 1957 thought

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.780
by 1976 we would have black
people running for president,

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.170
or running for the nomination.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.140
How outrageous is that
in this day and age,

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.230
where we actually now have
had a black president.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:56.330
Even though it was from
57 -- therefore I remove.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:59.420
So, does that mean, if you're a
catholic school kid you're going

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.660
to be ahead of your
time, progressive.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:03.460
Well, let me tell you,

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:07.370
I was a catholic little
kid, so I'm saying yes.

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.280
OK In it, they just showed
him winning the nomination.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.070
And they left it opened
ended as to whether

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:16.510
or not he would have
actually won the presidency.

00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:18.200
So, now we know it's a day
that we can actually have

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.150
when it comes under presidency.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.450
OK, thank you.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:27.870
Along with that, also in 1965;

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:30.200
we're going to skip ahead
for this a little bit.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.720 position:56%
This was the first actual comic book

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:37.180
that actually featured a black
character in a lead role,

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.380
and as the lead of the book.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:43.340
Up until then, you had a lot of
characters like Wacko for instance;

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.030
ran in the back of some issues.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.970
So, you have a lot of it with the
characters that they would put

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.260
in as a part of an anthology
story, or annual story.

00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.790
Now, this was the first
book, that actually outside

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:59.360
of All Negro Comics, where they
actually had a lead black character

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.720
in the book.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.320 position:56%
The thing that's very interesting
about this also, is that it was done

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.940
by what was considered at
that time a major publisher.

00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:10.480
Dell used to be a major
player in the book place,

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.070
in the publishing place,
in the paperback space

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.360
and in the comic book space.

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.900
And this is something
I didn't know either.

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.770
When I was a kid, we used
to laugh at the Dell books,

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:22.470
they had painted covers, and then
they had some story on the inside,

00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:24.810
we looked at that and said,
"That's nice, that's cute,

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.300
but we're going to Marvel and D.C."

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.270
But, I had no idea about the story
of Dell until I saw this book,

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:34.090 position:56%
and I saw it reading up on what Dell
did, and what else did they produce,

00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:35.390
because [inaudible] producing this.

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.330
Do they have black females,
do they have Hispanic females,

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:40.730
do they have -- so, I'm trying
to see everything that they have,

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:44.020
and unfortunately this
was it, all right.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.320
But, this was for all intents
and purposes the first book

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.110
to feature a black character.

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:51.500
So, I love you people who thought
-- who Cage was it, you are wrong.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:57.200
For those of you who know who Luke
Cage is from Marvel, all right?

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.190
Next one. Now, when
that book came out,

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:06.080
I'm going to tell you one quick
aside -- when that book came out,

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.050
the general print out
on that book was 200,000

00:23:09.050 --> 00:23:11.500
which was a standard print
for dell at the time.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:14.970
Those books were sent out, and most
comic book companies are working

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:16.270
three months in advance.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.570
So, they basically worked

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:18.880
on the third book before
the first book comes out.

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.180
This, when they put
out the first one,

00:23:20.180 --> 00:23:21.880
and then they started
working on the second.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.090
When they -- way they looked at the
numbers and the returns; the sales.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:29.040
They would notice that the
books were not selling,

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.460
and why the books are not selling?

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.880
And back in that day, they had
what was known as returnable.

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.330
In other words, you ripped of
the cover, sent the book back

00:23:35.330 --> 00:23:38.210
and you'd get credit
for your next purchase.

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:40.440
So, what happens was the
books were coming back

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.290 position:56%
with the covers ripped off, and they
were wondering why isn't this book

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.790
selling, this book should
be selling like hotcakes.

00:23:46.790 --> 00:23:49.390
And what happened was is that
it would get to the retail out,

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:52.900
and the retail outlet guys would
at the book, "I'm not selling this.

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:55.750
I'm not selling that; it's a black
character, I'm not selling that".

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:59.330
Now, here's what I'm thinking, me
-- well, again, known to who I am,

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.010
if someone sent a book to me like
that, I would've looked at them,

00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:03.870
and said, "If it's a chance for
the soul, let's put it out and see

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:05.270
if it does", if it does
-- what I'm making?

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:06.840
I'm making money, you understand?

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.740
I'm not trying to not make
money, I'm wanting to make money,

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.830
but they were not going to forward
a black comic book character.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.660
So, they were sending
the books back.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.280
So, by the time they
got by the second issue,

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.660
they finished the second
issue and a friend

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.230
of mine actually purchased it,

00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:21.080
he purchased a copy
of the second issue.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.960
And again, I scanned
the crap out of that,

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.830
so I now I have that on my archive.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.440
OK. The first one and second
one are archived already,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:33.150
and because they sent those books
back, the publisher said, "Listen,

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:35.570
nobody is buying this, so we're not
going to continue to put out money

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:38.620
for 200,000 prep runs, and
nobody is going to buy it".

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.140
So, that's why it has
only two issues,

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.940
and that was the end of that.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:45.620
The fact that they
actually got the book

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.540
to the stand made an
impact on the industry.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.600
So, now what happens is Marvel
looked out at this, and well,

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.800
maybe there is time, maybe we
need to have a black character

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.110
out there, maybe we should.

00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:57.190
So, they reached back into their
archives, and they pulled a book

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.810
out called Wacko, remember
him from back

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:03.170 position:56%
in the '1930s; they brought it back.

00:25:03.170 --> 00:25:07.070 position:56%
But, now they weren't really willing
to give him his own book just yet.

00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:09.180
So, they said, "Well, we'll
do it as an anthology title",

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:11.630
and as an anthology title it had
a bunch of different stories,

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.410
and Wacko's story was one of them.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:16.950
They put him in there, and
here's the funny thing;

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:20.000
people liked it fine, it wasn't
as if they ran away from it,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.660
or got away from it, or didn't
like it, or didn't want to read it.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.680
So, they said, "Well, wait
a minute, now I wonder --

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.990
then along comes a gentleman
by the name of Jack Kirby,

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:31.180
who've been working for them, would
made Captain America popular --

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.480 position:56%
for popular and the Fantastic Four
popular and he says, "You know what?

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.370
We need to have a black character".

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:38.980
So, he went on to call the
Black Panther initially,

00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:40.910
he wanted to call him Cold Tiger.

00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:42.590
Stan Lee said, "Cold Tiger?

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.940
I don't think so."

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.470
He said, "We've got to give them
something that's a little more

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.070
powerful, a little more
fantastic", and so,

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.370
they came up with Black Panther.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:53.000
And initially, the original Black
Panther costume; the face was open,

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.990
just like a regular super hero
where you could see the skin.

00:25:56.990 --> 00:26:00.330
Stan Lee figured, "Well,
let's not push that.

00:26:00.330 --> 00:26:02.750
Let's cover him up, let's
get people into the story,

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:06.170
let's let people read the story,
and get connected to the character

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:08.330
and then they'll realize who he is.

00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:11.650
So, that's why you have Black
Panther; the all black outfit.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:14.440
And when he came out in the book,
it turned out that it was a hit,

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.990
it turned out to be a very,
very phenomenal book in terms

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.780
of their selling structure.

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:22.080
At that point, they realized
they had a hit on their hands.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.790
So, they decided that they
were going to actually start

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:25.690
to do some stuff with him.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:29.510
Now, from 1966, and this
book was done in 1966 --

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:31.710
in 1969 they decided, now,

00:26:31.710 --> 00:26:34.780
let's actually create a black
character people will know he's

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.880
black from the very beginning.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.220
This is when the Falcon came in.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.490
And by the way, the Falcon came
in because he was recruited

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:47.600
by the Red Skull, to help the
Exiles defeat Captain America.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.450
They put him on an island that
Red Skull used the cosmic cube

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:57.140
to steal Steve Rogers identity,
and what he did, he said, "Well,

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.300 position:56%
I'll become Cap, and I'll put Cap on
this island, and they'll kill him,

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.910
and then I'll just be Captain,
I'll ruin his reputation,

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:06.820
I'll ruin everything", they
put him on this island,

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:10.820
he runs across Falcon
one day on the island,

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:12.120
and he's like, "Who are you?"

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:13.420
and he's like, "Well, who are you?"

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:17.870
And so, they started talking,
and [inaudible] they have me here

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:21.230
to kill some guy, and he says, "I
know, I'm that guy", and he's, "Oh,

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:22.770
I don't want to kill
anybody", he said,

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:25.540
"But I don't know what I can do",
he said, "I know what you can do;

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:28.080
you can fight them", he says, "I
can't fight, I don't know anything

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:32.710
about that", so Cap says,
"I do, let me train you."

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.230
So, Falcon and Cap were in
secret, were training each other

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.530
so that they could
take on the Exiles

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:40.520
and then, take on the Red Skull.

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:44.610
Now, if any of you know anything
heroes and comics, do heroes win?

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.310
So, did they win?

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:48.620
Absolutely.

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:51.970
But, in that, when they were
fighting, he said, "Falk,

00:27:51.970 --> 00:27:54.480
you need to have an
outfit", and at that time,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.300
Falcon already had the bird.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:59.440
Red Wing was his bird and his
friend on the island, so as such,

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.110
he decided to take on
the name of the Bird,

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:03.770
which is a Falcon, so he did.

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.840
And the interesting thing was
when they fought, he said,

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.870
"You need to get an outfit, you
need to get yourself a name",

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.860
and he said, "Call me The
Falcon", and there was Falcon.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:15.680
So, they fought, they won,
they got off the island.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.490
And again, they had a hit
in the Falcon character,

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:23.300
they drawn him back a couple of
times in Captain America's book.

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:29.520
So, from 1969 to 1972, still
no real major black presence

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.510
in the major comic book industry.

00:28:31.510 --> 00:28:33.520
But, now it looked up
and said, "You know what?

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.920
We need to have a dedicated book,
specifically to a black character."

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.660
Now, remember none of this
stuff happens in a vacuum.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.120
So, outside of that, what happens?

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:43.560
You have the black
exploitation films

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.290
that were happening
too in that time frame.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:48.160
Anybody remembers Sweet
Sweetback Badass Song?

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.460
[Inaudible] black hand sign, yes.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.590
So, now, guess who's
going to the movies?

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:53.890
Black people.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:57.600
Let me tell you --
again, a little aside,

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.670
when Melvin van Peebles attempted
to take Sweet Sweetback Badass Song

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.640
and get it into the
distribution that --

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:09.470
nobody would buy, nobody was going
for it, there were two little guys,

00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:12.500
there were two Jewish guys,
I think it was Chicago

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.850
who had this movie
theater that was failing.

00:29:15.850 --> 00:29:18.630
And so, when he came to it, he
called me and said, "Listen,

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.060
since the distributors
aren't doing --

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.810
he decided he's going to
call all the movie houses,

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:24.110
to see if he could get it in there.

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:25.410
Nobody was listening.

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.430 position:56%
These two guys, their movie
theater was failing, they were going

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:28.730
to lose it; so, they
said, "You know what?

00:29:28.730 --> 00:29:30.310
What the heck, we've
got nothing to lose.

00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:32.860
Well run for it, we
can see how it does."

00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:35.850 position:56%
So, they took Sweet Sweetback Badass
Song, put it in that movie theater,

00:29:35.850 --> 00:29:41.040
and within one showing had lines
around the block, four people deep.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.340
So, now of course, Hollywood

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:44.550
when they were getting
the numbers back --

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:48.260
OK, from the tracking sheets
they said, "Well, wait a minute.

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:49.600
All of our movies are flat lines.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.430
How come this movie
is doing so well?"

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.320
So, they sent a representative
about them, and said, "yes,

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.210
we are running this black
film" So, they said, "Really?

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:02.130
Wow", so the black
[inaudible] of films began.

00:30:02.130 --> 00:30:04.180
Now, everybody wants to
put a black film, why?

00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.000 position:56%
Because they realized that there was
a market out there that they never,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.580
ever looked at as being a market.

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:12.040
And again, to me; smart
business men.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.140
When you're looking at dollars and
cents, you're not looking at color;

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.440 position:56%
you're looking at dollars and cents.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.250
And 15 people in this -- if
everybody in here was an elf,

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:21.990
and they would pay in to
come here to see this,

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:25.520
trust me, I'm making an elf movie.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.420
OK. Let's be real.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.700
OK, let's be real; I'm
making an elf movie.

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.170
So, that's what happens.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:32.970
So, Marvel looked up at
that and said, "Maybe,

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.530
we should make a black
comic book dedicated,

00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:37.280
with a black lead character.

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:40.940
We'll be the first in history",
they didn't remember Lobo,

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.150
they didn't remember
All Negro Comics.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.070
So, Marvel actually
marketed just like that;

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:50.050
the first black character
to have his own book.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:55.520
And the book sold well,
the book sold well.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.430
So, D.C., their competitors, looked
at that and said, "Wait a minute.

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:05.720
This can't be possible, that book
is doing well, is doing good."

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.020
So, what did they do?

00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:08.320
They created Black Lightning.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.880
And by the way, a friend of mine
named Trevor [inaudible] some

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.260
of his work is in the
back game, which we found

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:14.830
to be very, very interesting.

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:17.660
He was the guy that was brought in
to draw that book, and guess what?

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.130
They just did something totally
unusual; usually they're looking

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:22.460
for people that have
a lot of credit,

00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.070
a lot of history in doing comics.

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:27.930
Trevor, wasn't even 16 years
old when he drew that issue.

00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:29.550
16 years old.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.650
So, now they had the
opportunity to have a double cue.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.230
Number one; they had
a black character,

00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.150
and not only was he a black
character, whereas theirs was drawn

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.020
by white man, ours is
drawn by a young black guy,

00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:42.470
and that's how they marketed it.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.500
And what can I say of that?

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.070
It's what Trevor told me,
he said, "God bless them".

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:52.100
God bless them, next one.

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.550
Now, across the [inaudible]
in England, they were looking

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:59.220
at this phenomenon in America
called the black exploitation era.

00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:01.390
They were looking at the fact
that black books were now

00:32:01.390 --> 00:32:05.830 position:56%
in the mainstream, and they decided,
"Well, we need to do one too."

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.430
So, they decided to do a
book called Power Comics,

00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:10.660
or actually the book was
really called Power Man,

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:13.730
this is a compilation of it, when
they found it they did it again,

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:16.820
and brought it back in this form.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:19.810
Now, the character that they
originally had was a character

00:32:19.810 --> 00:32:26.360
called Power Man, and his
only weakness was snakes.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.430
Now, don't get me wrong,
I have that same weakness.

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:33.600
OK, and I'm pretty sure if
-- a snake on the floor,

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.560
a lot of you wished that
you would have it too.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.090
But, outside of that he did
it, and here's the thing;

00:32:39.090 --> 00:32:42.020
they wanted to market it
to schools in Nigeria.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.300
They were producing it in
England, and Brian Bolland who went

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:49.740
in to later -- to do Watchmen, was
the artist on a lot of the stories,

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:52.010
and they wanted to take him
into the school systems,

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:54.630
and into the market
in Nigeria to sell.

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:58.160
And so, that's what they
did, that's what they did.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.080
Next one. Thank you.

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:04.470
Now, again, as I said, nothing
ever happens in a vacuum.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.550
So, what happens is a lot of black
creators were looking at that time,

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.050
and they were saying to
themselves, "Now, wait a minute,

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:14.000
they're doing books
about our characters,

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.460
why aren't we doing books
about our characters,

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:20.010
we aren't doing comic conventions
where we're bringing in a lot

00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.440
of black creators, to show
what black creators are doing",

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:25.000
because again, we're part of
it, we're part of this us all.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.970
So, we're looking at this
stuff, and what we're doing;

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:30.170
Dave and I were creating stuff
all along that time frame.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:35.830 position:56%
OK, crude, because we didn't have
the expertise at the time back then.

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:39.490 position:56%
But, we were looking at all of
that, we were influenced by it also.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:42.180
So, just as we were influenced,
so were a lot of other people,

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.950
but a lot of other people had
much more experience than us.

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:47.190
And because they had much
more experience than us,

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:49.630
they were bringing a lot
more heat to the table.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:52.380
And because such, a
gentleman by the name

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.720
of [inaudible] his career
was touched upon a variety

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.980 position:56%
of disciplines of fine arts, applied
or visual art, producing works

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:01.410
in painting, drawing
illustration, publishing fashion,

00:34:01.410 --> 00:34:03.090
most [inaudible] production.

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:05.770
So, what he -- it was quite
naturally that his attitude was,

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.770
"Wait a minute, why don't we create
an entire movement around this?

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:13.360
So, that we can actually have
stuff that we can say is our own"

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.790
and so, that's what he did.

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.410
[Inaudible] was for all intent
and purposes the grandfather

00:34:17.410 --> 00:34:20.870
of the Black Comic Book movement.

00:34:20.870 --> 00:34:23.810
He started organizing shows
and organizing conventions,

00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:26.460
and having creators, and
inviting black creators in.

00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.020
So, that they could actually show
the stuff that they were doing,

00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:33.030
and in doing that, he opened
up and entire well spring

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:35.410
of what was available
to everyone here.

00:34:35.410 --> 00:34:38.180
Now, at some point I'm going --

00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:40.280
each one of the people
on these slides is going

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.120
to have their own slide, OK?

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:45.470
Because, when I was
doing it back in the day,

00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:47.460
I realized that they
were very, very small.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.050
And you can't really
see who they are,

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.040
and you can't really
see a lot of their work.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.870 position:56%
But, to give you an example, the
guy just a little bit above, lonely,

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:58.930
a guy by the name of Jerry Craft,

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:02.270
he does a syndicate
strip called Mama's Boys,

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:05.300
which talks about a mother
raising to their young boys,

00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:07.420
and it's one of very
few comics that --

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.550
the gentleman right under that is
Al Simmons; Al Simmons has opened

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:15.020
up a connection between
African-American creators

00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.400 position:56%
and Africa, where he goes over there

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.350
and he does this thing
called Kids Con,

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:23.400
where he teaches young African kids
about comics and how to do them,

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.580
and the comics that exist on
every other nation in the planet.

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:30.030
Here -- planet, well,
we've only got one planet.

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.990
But, I'm sure, if he could
get it out to space, he would,

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:35.880
because that was the kind of guy,
he was very forward thinking,

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.450
and he created a character
called Blackjack,

00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:43.050 position:56%
which is about a black adventurer in
the '1930s, who actually met Tarzan,

00:35:43.050 --> 00:35:45.480
in the Tarzan syndicate district.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.160
Because he got to write
for that format,

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.230
and so he brought his
character into that,

00:35:49.230 --> 00:35:50.790
which is very, very interesting.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:55.090
Now, we have Felix, who's all the
way on the other side of the top,

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:57.730
a little small picture of Felix.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:00.610 position:56%
He does a lot of stuff on the New
York area, where he does conventions

00:36:00.610 --> 00:36:03.510
for a lot of creative
and independent creators.

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:07.050
Primarily Latino in nature.

00:36:07.050 --> 00:36:11.310
Latino and Hispanic, but he invites
us in because he gives the nod.

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.660
So, that's how I met him.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:16.280
Underneath him, in the
far-right hand corner,

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.810
the gentleman on the
bottom with the head rag on.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:23.570
His name was Mshindo Kuumba,
you may want to remember that.

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:25.770
This guy is for all
intents and standards,

00:36:25.770 --> 00:36:27.910
when I tell people
is the goal standard

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:30.510
for what we're trying to do.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:34.760
If I could draw like
him, right now, you --

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.710
trust me, all of my work
would be in this building,

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:39.510
all of my work would
be in this building.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:45.060
This guy, for all intents and
purposes is what we're aiming at,

00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:47.840
that level of quality, that
level of sophistication,

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:53.990
that level of coloring; humans
in terms of the way he draws,

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:55.290
that's what we're aiming at.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:36:57.490
And he has some stuff that's
coming out over the next two years,

00:36:57.490 --> 00:37:00.000
and I can't say anything
about it unfortunately.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.450 position:56%
But, it's some of the most beautiful
stuff I've ever seen in my life.

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:07.980
Are any of you familiar with the
gentleman by the name of Alex Ross?

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:12.110
He was Alex Ross, before
Alex Ross was Alex Ross, OK?

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.030
He's that good.

00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:15.470
And so, he's going
to be bringing stuff

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:17.660
to the table and out to the world.

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.540
Now, he has stuff out now, but
we need to get him in a book,

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.510
we need to get him into something
that we can get into kids' hands.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:28.190
Once that happens, the game will be
changed, the game will be changed.

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:29.790
Next slide.

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:34.460
Now, along this time frame, since
it took only opened up that door,

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.110
quite naturally is going to be
somebody is going to actually step

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:38.960 position:56%
through it, and say, "You know what?

00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:41.440
We need to do something else."

00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:46.820
This character was the first
statement, where this guy decided

00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:51.330
that he was going to create a
character that actually spoke

00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:56.090
to the actual black
dysphoria in America.

00:37:56.090 --> 00:37:57.610
And this character is
called Brother Man.

00:37:57.610 --> 00:38:00.340
Now, I'm going to tell you why
I haven't mentioned his name.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.720
Guy Sims is the guy that wrote it.

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.560
The guy that drew it is named
Dawud Anyabwile [phonetic].

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:09.600
That's what I'm trying to
not say the name too much.

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:13.690 position:56%
I'm just going to call it Dawud, and
we'll leave it at that, all right?

00:38:13.690 --> 00:38:19.910
But, when he drew this character,
he took it to the New York expo,

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:24.510
in 1990 and at the New York expo,

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:29.980
three-day event, he
sold 70,000 units.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:36.370
What he showed, was that black
comic books could make money,

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.690 position:56%
they could sell, and they didn't
have to come from a major publisher.

00:38:39.690 --> 00:38:43.240
That was the statement that
he made, in addition to that,

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:47.690
this book did so well, that it
was featured on our City Hall,

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:51.160
and what our City Hall said
was this, "If this character,

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:53.580
that image you see down
there on the bottom left --

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.770
your bottom right that
was the image he flashed

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:57.900
on his screen behind him he said,

00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:00.290
"They say that the sales are
Superman and not doing well,

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:04.370
maybe if Superman looked
like this he'd sell more."

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:06.910
That's the quote.

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:08.920
Next slide.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.840
So, now, of course after
that, what did Black Prize do?

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:14.640
Wait a minute, if this guy
can do it, we can do it.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.760
And here's the thing, the interiors

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.790
of the Brother Man book
were all black and white.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.640
Just like Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles;

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.410
Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles black color covers,

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:26.090
black and white interiors,
so was that.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:27.710
These guys came along and decided,

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:29.970
we don't need one book,
we need a line.

00:39:29.970 --> 00:39:32.410
So, they decided they wanted
to create a line of books.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:33.990
And this was called Ania [phonetic]

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.350
and I forget what the
promotion thing was.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:40.870
Was it all black creators, all
black art, all black, all black --

00:39:40.870 --> 00:39:42.630 position:56%
someone tells they put so much black

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:45.110
in their first advertisement
that I was like, "Wow.

00:39:45.110 --> 00:39:48.450
Gee, I guess they're
a black company" But,

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.250
here's the funny thing.

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.620
They ran it to the same
problem most creators ran

00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:54.180
into when they were
trying to create products;

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:57.410
they produced the first books, they
put them out, and they got a lot

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:00.570
of press all across the country.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:01.870
They guy that did [inaudible] --

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:04.040
he used to actually dress
up like a Zulu warrior,

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:07.740
and he would climb besides the
capital buildings, and have a flag

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.960
up there to generate publicity.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.380
So, people buys his book.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:14.620
And what happens was that
they ran into the problem

00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:15.980
that most creators run
into, that they think

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.650
that they're actually
going to create a book,

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:19.520
make money, and then do more.

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:23.430
So, most of these books ended up
not getting past the third issue,

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:25.390
because the creators
could not keep them.

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:28.490
The one book that was an exception
to that was the book called Purge,

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:29.790
and that was done by Roosevelt.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.790
That book is still being
published today, in fact,

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:34.380
he just released a graphic
novel just his past summer,

00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:36.960
and this past fall.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.830
Now, out of this company,
comes this one;

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:45.540
this is the company most people
will know as being the eminent

00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:48.640
and the standard by which all black
comic book companies will be judged

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.940
from here on out.

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:55.960
This was Milestone Media, it
was headed by Dwayne McDuffie,

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.500
Denys Cowan, Derek Dingle;

00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:02.710
who worked for Black Enterprise
Magazine, and Ed Davis.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.910
Ed Davis and Denys
Cowan; I both know,

00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:07.140
and I got to meet Dwayne McDuffie,
because when they first thought

00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.630
of Milestone Media and I saw it, I
said, "I want to know about this",

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:13.600
so I went down to the
offices and met McDuffie,

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.470
and one of the things he said
to me at that point, he said,

00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:17.800
"There's a lot of creators that
want to be in this business,

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.490
but not a lot of them
are very good."

00:41:20.490 --> 00:41:22.890
So, that means, you go home,
you work, and you get good.

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:28.530
One of the guys that worked there
with us, a guy by the name of --

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:31.270
he actually worked with
them, but let me tell you,

00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:33.570
again as I tell you,
most creators are what?

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:35.870
They are a lazy lot.

00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:37.770 position:56%
So, they would give him stuff,
because Ernie [phonetic] would come,

00:41:37.770 --> 00:41:41.020 position:56%
and he would just do a little bit of
work, and they wanted to push him,

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.330
to find out who he was, and
to find his artistic voice,

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:46.180
and Ernie's whole thing, when
he would come to our meetings,

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.870
was like, "Man, they're
giving me nothing to do.

00:41:47.870 --> 00:41:49.550
They're giving me all this crap",

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:53.370
we used to tell him,
"Just do it, just do it.

00:41:53.370 --> 00:41:56.310
If it's so trivial, just do it."

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:58.640
Well, he never did, and they
ultimately didn't use him

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.100
because of it.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.600
But, he would have been in there

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.040
when they would first
getting started,

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.890 position:56%
and he didn't see what was possible.

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:08.190
So, he didn't do it.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:11.660
But, anyway, when they did this,
they actually set the standard,

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:14.560
and they worked out one of the
most beautiful distribution deals

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.910
with D.C. Comics; they
maintain all the rights

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.000
to their characters to this day.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.880
D.C. distributed it, through
their distribution network,

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.260
and paid them a fee.

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.790
So, all they have to do
is produce the books,

00:42:29.790 --> 00:42:34.700
get them into the pipeline,
make money, right through D.C.

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:39.920
And D.C. was being carried by
every major retail in the planet.

00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:42.740
Not just in this country,
but worldwide.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.610
Now, I'm going to tell you a little
interesting thing that happened

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:48.290 position:56%
with that; as with anyone else, when
you start to get a lot of notoriety

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:51.560
in this business, when
good opportunities come,

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:52.880
you want to take them on.

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.180
So, what happened?

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:57.670
Motown Records at the time decided
they wanted to go into animation.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:59.520
So, what did they do?

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.220
They reached out to these guys to
help them form Motown Animation,

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.890
which is why you now have this
static shock animated series.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:12.010
That's where it came from,
it came from them and this,

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:13.310
because they did Milestone.

00:43:13.310 --> 00:43:15.020
Next slide.

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.660
Now, in addition to that; everybody
looked at what any did, and then,

00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:20.480
looked at what Milestone
did, and of course,

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.670
how could we not do it ourselves?

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:24.370
We couldn't, we had to.

00:43:24.370 --> 00:43:25.840
We were compelled.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.270 position:56%
So, what I did -- there was this guy
who they called, watch out magazine,

00:43:30.270 --> 00:43:33.540 position:56%
that's how I met this gentleman
Dave Bucklay [phonetic] he was good,

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.920
well, as I watched out
a generation after me.

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:40.190
And we were being taught the comic
book industry by the gentleman

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:43.060
by the name of Dan Brown
[phonetic] who's no longer with us.

00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.020
But, he opened a door to
showing us that we too,

00:43:45.020 --> 00:43:47.350
could do this stuff, all right?

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:51.280
Underneath that is a book called
Steel I raise, and to the left

00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:54.330
of that is a book called MCSquare,

00:43:54.330 --> 00:43:58.930
this is the first hip
hop comic book ever.

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.230
And how do I know?

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.530
Because, they came to
me to have me do it.

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.330
We couldn't, we could never
work out the financial thing.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:06.720
So, they got another by the
name of Balufu Bay [phonetic]

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:09.360
to do the artwork for them.

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:13.280
And until the day that he passed,
he and I were in communication

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.140
and good friends, all right?

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.090
The thing that's really
interesting also, out of that,

00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:20.450
is that there's a gentleman
by the name of Dwayne Ferguson

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.260
that did a book called
Captain Africa.

00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:24.730
Because, he felt that if you
and have a book about Africans,

00:44:24.730 --> 00:44:28.370
and featuring Africa-American
[inaudible] somewhere in the title.

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.290
So, he did a book called
Captain Africa.

00:44:30.290 --> 00:44:33.360
But, his claim to fame
wasn't through this book,

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:35.890
it was through a book called
Hamster [phonetic] Vice.

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:38.790
Which floated in time line
of books called Blackthorn

00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:42.780
for over two years while they were
forming; his book was the book

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.260
that people bought, and that's
why they're able to do their line

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.380
of books out in California.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.770
Underneath that is a girl
by the name of Rachel Lewis,

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:53.480
who did a book called Sandstorm,
and she also worked through us

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:56.140
with a company called Bidnip, which
is the fourth book that you see

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:58.450
in the upper left with
the green behind that.

00:44:58.450 --> 00:45:01.470
And the cooper book we have,
we printed copies of it,

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:02.810
over in the back for you today.

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:04.850
So, that you can take them home,
and you can read a real story,

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:06.550
because let me tell you
what we wanted to do;

00:45:06.550 --> 00:45:09.140
in addition of doing a comic
book story, we actually wanted

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:11.850
to do areal novel, we wanted
to say, "What will happen

00:45:11.850 --> 00:45:14.510
if you put a real novel
in a comic book?"

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:17.580
I mean, a real story, something
that when people read it,

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.600 position:56%
you don't just read it and brush
through it, but you actually read it

00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.520
like a novel, but it
just has illustrations.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.930
So, that's what we did,
and in doing that story,

00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.000
we [inaudible] it all
throughout Pennsylvania,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.880
we figured Pennsylvania
would be the toughest market

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:32.320 position:56%
for a black guy, in a black company.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.960
And you would read on the back of
it, what they said about that book,

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.490
and how well they liked it, and
so we were all like, "Yes, yes.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.120
So, we need to compile all
of this in one big volume.

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.380
So, that people can get it all
at one time", the whole story all

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.280
at one time, so that's what we did.

00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:50.800 position:56%
And underneath it, underneath that,
you'll see a book called PB soldier,

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.180
that's one of my partners, that's
going to be launching along with me

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:58.920
in 2017, his name is Naseed Gifted,
and the next will go over Star Age,

00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:01.250
which is also going to be one
of the first books that's coming

00:46:01.250 --> 00:46:06.000
from our line in 2017 --
February of 2017, actually.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.700
Next slide.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.680
In addition to this,
I was not satisfied

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.970
with that just being a comic
book, and by the way I want you

00:46:12.970 --> 00:46:16.280
to understand this, at a certain
point you start to realize that --

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.390
again, we don't work in a
vacuum; because we don't work

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:22.380
in a vacuum the digital
age was upon us.

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:24.260
So, we decided that what we were
going to do, is we were going

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:25.940
to create some digital
online content

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:27.480
that people could read for free.

00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.680
Now, this would operate as
a promotional tool for us.

00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:31.150
It would also operate
as the thing --

00:46:31.150 --> 00:46:32.450
but we would have content

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:34.980
that we could actually put
on books down the line.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.280
And so, that's what we did.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:39.860
We launched that project in 2013,
and we've been doing roughly

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.810
about 2,000 to 3,000 hits a month.

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:45.740 position:56%
Well, actually it's a weak, if I'm
not mistaken, but people will coming

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.070
in -- and it's funny,
because the creators --

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:51.370
we have creators, and when each
one of them gets that higher hit,

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:52.780
everybody tries to
act like, "Oh, no.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:54.290
It's not about the hits,
it's not about this",

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:57.150
until somebody else beats them.

00:46:57.150 --> 00:47:00.490
Then it's like, "Wait a minute,
wait a minute", it's not really

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:03.410
about the hits and it's like,
"Well, I'm coming for you".

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:08.070
So, we wanted to be competitive,
because that's how you can better;

00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:10.170
competition meets excellence.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:14.120
So, if people are competitive,
they will step up in excellence

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:16.640
or they will get going,
because that's the way

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.770
that this industry works; you
either get people to like you,

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.000
or you're leaving because
you're herd,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.040
and that's how we are very,
very insecure, that way.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:28.580
OK, next one.

00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.810
So, in addition, I want to do some
honorable mentions very quick.

00:47:31.810 --> 00:47:33.550
Now, this is new, so the people

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:35.660
that saw it prior, did
not see this stuff.

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.960
The reason I wanted to this was

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.490
because Mohammed Ali had a
comic book, believe it or not.

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:42.720
And he fought Superman,
believe it or not.

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:45.040
And he beats Superman,
believe it or not, OK?

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:52.370
Upper right, your upper left, it's
a comic book called Black Man.

00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:54.820
This was the beginning of the black
exploitation theories in films,

00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:56.860
which was done around the
time that Ania came out,

00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.090
and I put this one in,
because this was the first one

00:47:59.090 --> 00:48:03.780
that struck my fans, because it had
turned them like this; Black Man.

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:07.310
I said, "Can't beat it" I wanted
that name, believe me I did.

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:11.050
But he came out, I was
like, "Don't go in it"

00:48:11.050 --> 00:48:12.460
so I couldn't mess with it.

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.870
Brother Voodoo was a character,
a Marvel created it was going

00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:18.480
into their supernatural
space, he ultimately ended

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.580
up becoming the sorcerer supreme,

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.940
which is what Doctor
Strange actually is.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:25.500 position:56%
And now for -- because of the movie,
they brought Doctor Strange back,

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:28.900
and he's the regular
Doctor Strange again, OK?

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.580
Next, do you see classics
illustrated --

00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.880
in the beginning they were doing
books a lot like the books back

00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:36.680
in the '50s, where they
were doing benign characters

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.130 position:56%
of society's sport figures and along
those lines, which was kind of nice,

00:48:41.130 --> 00:48:45.440
on the complete left, the two books
on the bottom; these were books

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.320
that were based on animated
characters, Cosmic Kids,

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.440
Column Globetrotters, and
there's a whole bunch of them,

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.240
I just put two up, but
there's a whole bunch

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:55.220
that were done based
on animated things.

00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:58.550
Because, they knew that kids were
watching the animated series,

00:48:58.550 --> 00:49:00.600
that they had automatically
had a locked in audience.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:03.800
And so, they would actually
produce books based on that.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:07.930
X-Men; I've put this on, and only
because people kept telling me,

00:49:07.930 --> 00:49:09.820
"You mentioned all these
black characters nobody knows,

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.180
but you never mentioned Storm."

00:49:11.180 --> 00:49:12.480
And I said, "OK."

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:17.020
The Storm; that was her first book,
that's how they introducer her, OK?

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:18.970
In X-Men number one,
they introduced her,

00:49:18.970 --> 00:49:20.460
they introduced the
Russian character,

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.090
and introduced Nightcrawler.

00:49:22.090 --> 00:49:24.030
Mister Miracle; the
reason I put this one in,

00:49:24.030 --> 00:49:25.360
it's because the character

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.140
that Mister Miracle trains
was called Shilo Norman,

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:31.780
he ultimately ended up becoming
the next Mister Miracle, and then,

00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:34.820
when they killed off the entire New
Gods line, they brought him back,

00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:38.450
and now you have the regular
Mister Miracle again, go figure.

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.740
Underneath it, you
have Star Spangled War,

00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:44.270
which is the first time
or not the first time,

00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:46.620
but there was a character
known the Unknown Soldier.

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.100
Now, throughout the
history of that book,

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.390
the Unknown Soldier was
always a white character,

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:53.120
until they did the front, they did
a series on him, and in the front,

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:58.050 position:56%
he was a black character fighting --
helping to fight the war on Ruanda.

00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:01.610
So, I was kind of interested
in that, and so I ended

00:50:01.610 --> 00:50:02.910
up getting the series
because of that,

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:04.210
and it turns out it
was a black character.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.510
Next dude is Wonder
Woman, and by the way,

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:06.810
the woman you see here fighting?

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:09.970
Her name is Nubia, she's black,
and she's Wonder Woman's sister.

00:50:14.760 --> 00:50:18.970
Now, the reason I say it, it's
because her mother created two;

00:50:18.970 --> 00:50:21.230
she created Wonder Woman,
and then she created Nubia,

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:24.090
she made her with a
different clay, that's all.

00:50:24.090 --> 00:50:25.390
All right.

00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:27.680
Underneath it, you'll also
see Spider-Man in the prowl,

00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:29.210
at night a conversation
with a gentleman eerily

00:50:29.210 --> 00:50:30.760
by the prowler character.

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:32.230
All right.

00:50:32.230 --> 00:50:34.850
Next tool you see on static
shock, the comic book and then,

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.430
you'll also see Static
Shock the DVD.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:39.960
Dave, next one.

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:43.350
And, here are two trail blazers
that I wanted to mention.

00:50:43.350 --> 00:50:47.860
Kyle Baker was one of the first
illustrators in the world,

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:51.440
by my knowledge, to
actually say, "You know what?

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.050
Comic books are nice" and I
had a conversation with him

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:58.220
at the New York Comic Con, and
he said to me, "Comics are nice,

00:50:58.220 --> 00:51:03.520
but that comic book space is owned
by Marvel and D.C.", he says, "But,

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.130
they're not the only
publishers in the world."

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:08.480
So, what he did, he started taking
his concepts to book publishers,

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:10.070
and that's what he did; he ended

00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:13.800
up producing graphic
novels for book publishers.

00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.640
Now, I'm going to tell you
something that's really interesting

00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:17.020
about all of these books.

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.810
They're all very well
done, they're all very --

00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:21.300
they're elected, they're not
done like comic books per se,

00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.520
as they use that as a format, but
he's drawing them in all kinds

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:26.890
of ways, and using all
kinds of techniques to draw.

00:51:26.890 --> 00:51:30.390
But I want you to note that Matt
Turner book; he did something

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:33.850
so phenomenal, in that Matt Turner
book, even today my mind is blown.

00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:38.370
That book is done with nothing
but illustrations, no words,

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:40.780
which means it can
go into any audience,

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:43.300
because anybody can
read the pictures.

00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:47.380
So, an Asian person can read it,
a Hispanic person can read it,

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.100
a Mongolian person can read it,

00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:52.710
an American person can read
it, and still get the story.

00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:55.300
That's what made that
book phenomenal to me.

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:58.720
Larry Stroman, on the other
hand, the reason I put him in,

00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.550
it's because I've also
worked with him.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:04.970 position:56%
But, his claim to fame while all the
books are the upper part of that,

00:52:04.970 --> 00:52:09.290
even Black Panther, but the book
that gives him the claim to fame

00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:11.910
for me is the book on the
bottom, with the black cover,

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:16.240
with the silver encasing; that
book was called Tribe Number One.

00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:19.720
That book sold over a
million units for image.

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:23.060
According to Rob Liefeld,
and again, my attitude is

00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:26.150
that if I sell a million unit of
any of our books, I guarantee you;

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:27.650
I'm going to hire so
many black creators,

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:28.950
that you're all going
to think that I'm crazy.

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:31.860
You're all going to see so many
black, and Hispanic, and Latino,

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.680
and white and women and everything;
I might have the United Nations

00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.820
in my comic company, if I sell
a million units of anything, OK?

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.120
All right, thank you.

00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:45.550
Next, OK. Now, for those of you
who don't understand why we need

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:49.740
to have a black comic book, and a
black comic book line this is why;

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:52.570
most of the people in
this are black people,

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:55.130
dressing up as white characters.

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.470
It's not like we don't have black
characters, we don't have what any

00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:58.770
of that are out there --

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:00.360 position:56%
they're powerful enough that a black
person wants to dress like that

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.880

character", OK?

So, you've got Black Aquaman, you've
Black Robin, you've Black Superman,

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:14.700 position:56%
and by the way; for those of you
who don't know, there's an actual --

00:53:14.700 --> 00:53:18.850
there is an entire race
of black cryptonians,

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:21.760
that was written in
the Superman story.

00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.600
And I'm trying to find out what
they're going to do with that,

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.070
because I want to write something
and propose it to D.C., and say,

00:53:27.070 --> 00:53:29.790
"Listen, you do know you
have a bunch of Superman

00:53:29.790 --> 00:53:32.220
on your planet that
are black, right?"

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:33.720
now, I want to see what
they're going to do with that.

00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.020
But, I have a story
in mind for that.

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:37.560
But, again, whether they take
it or not, I don't know; but,

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.680
I'm definitely going to write it,
definitely going to draw it, OK?

00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:43.270
Thank you.

00:53:43.270 --> 00:53:46.890
And, we're again -- no
one works in a vacuum.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:50.850
So, we have African brothers
that are creating entire lines

00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:53.650
of comic books right
now that they're putting

00:53:53.650 --> 00:53:58.070
out to the market place, even
more -- and again, more of them.

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:00.450
And I just want -- would like
you to see some of the diversity,

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:03.370
and some of the stuff that
they're doing out in the world.

Next one. And, for those of you
who've got phone, you might want

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:09.080
to take a photo shot of this,
because these are places you can go

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:12.510
to find a lot of information
about what's going on online,

00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:14.040
right now with black creators

00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:18.620
and black stuff --
how much time we have?

00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.160
Right. This should be it.

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:24.270
And the end -- this was
opposed to what I did,

00:54:24.270 --> 00:54:27.910
coming writing this kind of stuff.

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:29.710

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.230
Sorry about that.

00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:38.800
And here's a funny thing, normally
I would be the guy sitting there,

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.290
writing it down, I would still
not text Abby with this --

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:43.670
then it says, "Wait a
minute, wait a minute,

00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:45.850
I got to say -- let me use it".

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:48.680
So, this is what we'll do, to make
everybody know, so that you can go.

00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.980
And if you go to these
things, you --

00:54:49.980 --> 00:54:52.090
a lot of the stuff that you've
seen here today, you'll see.

00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:54.040
And a lot of the stuff
-- international.

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:57.720
I didn't get the chance to go
on to South American heroes,

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.820
Deepak Chopra, the guru; he
had a line of comic books

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:03.970
of hind characters from India.

00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:06.550
Like the real India, not
Indian-American; India.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:11.150
So, I hope this has been at
least fairly informative,

00:55:11.150 --> 00:55:13.820
and remember there's a lot more I
could've put on this and brought

00:55:13.820 --> 00:55:16.470
to the table, but again, we'd be
here much, much longer already

00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:17.770

Vixen -- they never really gave her
a title per se, for the most part,

00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:19.220
what they did, is they
did it with women.

00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:21.640
They did this really weird
thing that I never understood;

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:26.070 position:56%
they gave them these short runs,
they gave them like a six-issue run.

00:57:26.070 --> 00:57:28.040
That to me is not really
giving a person an issue,

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.440
if you believe your
character is good;

00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:32.270
give him a book, give him a book.

00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:34.870
Let the audience decide
whether or not they're one.

00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:37.950
Even Wonder Woman had to fight with
Wonder Woman to keep her out there.

00:57:37.950 --> 00:57:40.170
And I don't understand that at all,
given that there are more women

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:42.210
in this country than men.

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:43.510
But, they never promote her.

00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:47.020
If you look at the Avengers
movie, when they did the marketing

00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:49.220
for the Avengers movie with
the toy line and the dolls

00:57:49.220 --> 00:57:52.450
and the action figures, they didn't
have a Black Widow action figure.

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:55.950
You know how many girls would
have wanted that action figure?

whole non-woman, nonblack people,

money to be made.

That's Milestone that was Milestone.

00:58:50.830 --> 00:58:55.480
And the question, is that you
want to know where Milestone went?

00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:58.890
With the Icon character.

00:58:58.890 --> 00:59:02.030
Well, what happened was that Dwayne
McDuffie started writing upbeat

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:05.400
pieces about the fact that blacks
are not represented in comics.

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:09.730
So, they quickly took him off that
book and stopped published Icon.

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:14.470
Icon was slated to become one
of the JLA, and that ended in --

00:59:14.470 --> 00:59:17.870
within that two-year time
span, Dwayne McDuffie passed.

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:22.790 position:56%

said, "Well, nothing to really going

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:26.190
to do with it", remember,
Milestone owns those targets.

00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:30.180

do anything without them,

00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:33.160
unless the Milestone
people want them,

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.440

them, that "Yes, you can use them",

are going to say to them.

become a comic book?

I think they did a one off, if I'm
not mistaken, but it never was --

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.070
it didn't become a series per se.

01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:02.530
It's again, one of those things
where you run it up the flag pole,

01:00:02.530 --> 01:00:05.400
and if enough people
don't generate interest,

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.020

show off the money.

you have to print first

about educational outreach,

one of the things we're trying
to do in educational outreaches,

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:42.250
is that we want to be
able to tie directly

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:44.680
to school's core curriculum.

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.820 position:56%
See, we can do a book about science,
or we can do a book about math,

01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:52.040
but if it doesn't tie in
to the school's curriculum,

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.240
then the school can't
really utilize it as well.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:59.310
Not that they can't use it, but we
want them to buy the book from us.

01:00:59.310 --> 01:01:01.450
OK, we want to produce the actual
physical book, and we want them

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:05.370
to buy it from us, and the way
we're looking at is if we work

01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:08.070
with the education, in any
particular school system

01:01:08.070 --> 01:01:12.560
in developing that curriculum, as
a comic property, what happens is,

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:15.180
as their characters are going
through the book and doing things,

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:18.540
they'll be learning based on that,
and because they're learning based

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:21.230
on it, we -- Our assumption
is, quite naturally,

01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:23.010
that their grades will do better.

01:01:23.010 --> 01:01:26.020
If you have watched a
kid that actually learns,

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:29.210

something he's Superman;

01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:31.510

the S on its chest.

just looked it on YouTube,

because he got an A. I was like,

"Are you kidding me?"

01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:46.380

let me show you a better way",

they're going to exposed to it.

is, that you might have

to actually go to some comic shops.

shop, particularly on a Wednesday

when the books are released,
you will find creators in there.

and once they've connected them with
the audience, that artist will more

01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:12.510
than likely want to help
your son do this stuff.

Well, the mission book that we
do is written by Kelly Williams,

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:38.150
the star -- the book that I showed
you with of the Cheetah's book.

Sandstorm that was
written by a female.

01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:45.270
Did so well, that she was
able to get over $100,000

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:51.330
from a video company, to
produce it as a video game.

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:54.580
And here's a funny
thing; she's a doctor.

01:03:54.580 --> 01:03:55.940
She went to school to be
a doctor, she went back

01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:59.420
and got a doctorate,
to be an actual doctor.

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:01.530
And I told that, said --
went about the Comics.

01:04:01.530 --> 01:04:05.100
So, she said, "You
know, it was fun."

01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:09.170
OK. And we would love
to have her back,

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:11.270
because her books actually
sold in the market place.

01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:13.830
A friend of ours, one of our
artists, when he used to go

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:17.820
on the park on New York
and on the weekends,

01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:20.060
he would actually sell
her books at there,

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.970
he said, "They're a big seller".

01:04:21.970 --> 01:04:25.510

01:04:54.550 --> 01:04:57.190
Well, here's the most interesting
thing about all of the black people

01:04:57.190 --> 01:04:58.490
that are doing stuff in this field.

01:04:58.490 --> 01:05:00.800
Like I told you, there's
so much stuff out there,

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.120
I try to catch as much
of it as I can.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:05.790
But, I'm sure stuff is
flowing through the cracks,

01:05:05.790 --> 01:05:08.200
I'm absolutely sure stuff just
fallen through the cracks.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:11.220
But, that won't be
the case all the time.

01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:14.790
This for me is like being
on a journey now, OK?

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:19.110
The gentleman started
me on this past, OK?

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:20.800
They've started me on this path

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.060
of finding the historical
side of this, OK?

01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:29.650
It opened my eyes, and once my eyes
-- I felt like I was in the Matrix.

01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:31.040
They unplugged me,
and I was like, "No,

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.550
I can't go back, can't go back now.

01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:36.420
There's just too much out there".

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:38.310 position:56%
I'm so curious about everything now.

01:05:38.310 --> 01:05:44.300
I'm not even locationally
afraid anymore.

01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:47.710
I want to find out what people
in other countries are doing.

01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:52.100
I want to find out what the
little kids Burmese jungle --

01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:53.840
what kind of -- what is he drawing.

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:56.830
What kind of story is he telling?

01:05:56.830 --> 01:06:02.290
So, I'm hoping that at some point,
we'll have an international --

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:07.190
what I was saying, an international
nations of comic book creators,

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:10.730
where everybody is involved,
and everybody is engaged;

01:06:10.730 --> 01:06:13.080
that is my hope that
is the dream I have.

01:06:13.080 --> 01:06:14.880
All right, I want to thank you.
