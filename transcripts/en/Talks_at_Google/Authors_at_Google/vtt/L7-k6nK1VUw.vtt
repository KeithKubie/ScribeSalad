[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:06.660
SARA ZASKE: Hello.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.310
My name's Sara Zaske.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.030
And I'm here to talk to
you about "Achtung Baby"

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.847
and how Germans raise their
kids for self-reliance.

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:16.430
I'm really happy to
be here at Google.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.960
But before I start, I'd like
to ask you a few questions.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.317
I know who I'm talking to.

00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:23.400
So first of all, how many
of you here are parents?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.200
And it's OK you're not.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.760
Oh, a lot.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.260
Good.

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.600
You're in the right place.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.280
How many of you have school-aged
kids, so ages 6 to 12?

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.110
Oh, quite a few.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.820
So let me ask you this.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.300
If you have kids aged 6 to
12 or you had them older,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.830
think back to that time.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.290
How many of you let
them walk places

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.295
by themselves to the
friend's house, to the park--

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:50.430
I see my allies back there--

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.470
or to school?

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.190
So just a couple.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.680
As you know, you're very
typical American parents.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.140
The rest of you--

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.340
the dominant style
of American parenting

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.000
today is high on supervision.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.992
And not just
physical supervision.

00:01:04.992 --> 00:01:05.950
I don't know about you.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.300
But I have this nifty
thing back in my home town

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.420
called power loop where
I can watch the grades

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.930
as they come in in real time.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.040
Well, that's a lot
of supervision.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.240
And we have the best
intentions, right?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.800
We want our kids to be safe.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.720
We want them to succeed.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.520
But we exercise so
much control in trying

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.100
to make those two things happen
that we've actually become more

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.180
controlling than German parents,
which sounds like an odd thing

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.960
to say.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.960
Because when we think of
Germans, what do we think?

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.160
Strict people, right?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.710
Very exacting people,
rule following.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.480
I had all of those ideas in my
head when I moved to Germany.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.660
But very quickly, I
learned that what I thought

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.810
was not exactly correct.

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.270
When I first moved to Germany,
my daughter was 2 and 1/2.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.169
And we lived there
for 6 and 1/2 years.

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:58.710
And one of the first
things I noticed

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.400
was how Germans interact or
don't interact with their kids

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.230
on the playground.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.540
One story that I tell
often, because it

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.720
was so shocking to me, was
I was at the playground

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.710
with my young daughter.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.390
She's was still
about two or three.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.910
And another kid who
was eight or nine

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.220
had climbed on outside of
a playground structure.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.500
And it was really high.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.020
And he's dangling
there by one hand.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.140
And there's a good 10 feet
below him to the sand.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.620
And I stand up, and I
go, "achtung," which

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.210
means attention, watch out.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.220
Where is this kid's mom?

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.310
I'm looking at all
the other adults

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.130
at the edge of the park drinking
coffee, not worried at all.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.290
And by the time I
turn back, the kid

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.850
drops down, looks at me like
I'm crazy, and runs away.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.940
And then I thought, huh,
there's something going on here

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.860
that I don't quite understand.

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.570
And I found myself having many
of those kinds of experiences

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.240
in Berlin, where I'm the
one yelling "achtung"

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.400
and running after
the kids or thinking

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.990
I've got to watch them
on every playground.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.420
And I started to think,
why am I so afraid?

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.090
Or better yet, why are
the Germans not afraid?

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.640
So I'm not going
to talk too much

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.420
about what's wrong
with American parenting

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.840
because I'm sure we've
heard it all, right?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.600
Some people call it
helicopter parenting.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.330
Some people call
it overparenting.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.790
I think the most precise
term that I've heard

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.170
is from psychologist Peter Gray.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.440
And he calls it,
protective-directive parenting.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.160
And I would add that I think
it's primarily based on fear.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.300
We're afraid for our kids'
safety, so we protect.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.170
And a lot of that protection
involves restricting.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.110
You can't walk alone.

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.300
You can't play alone.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.470
You can't do anything
that's vaguely dangerous.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.690
The direction part comes in our
fear for their future success

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.050
or failure.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.359
So we direct all
their academic grades.

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:57.900
We watch their grades
really closely.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.180
And if they start
to flounder, we

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.980
get on the kid or we
get on the teacher

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.020
or we have a meeting
with the principal

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.900
and we make sure they fill
out their academic resume

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.170
with plenty of extracurricular
sports or violin

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.250
or learning a language.

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.480
And that style of parenting
doesn't leave a lot of room

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.709
for the kids to make
choices or mistakes.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.160
And taken to its extreme,
some American parents

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.250
protect and direct
through adolescence

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.820
and into young adulthood.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.420
And that doesn't leave
a lot of opportunity

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.090
for the kid to become
an independent adult.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.135
But one place that they
don't do this is in Germany.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:42.250
Oh, I forgot this.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.690
Pardon me.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.670
But for those of you who
are parents-- most of

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.850
you are parents here.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.560
I don't think of raising
kids as a side issue.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.140
This is something that is
important for all, all of us.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.140
And it sounds cliche, but
children are literally

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.392
the future.

00:05:02.392 --> 00:05:04.350
When we get older, they're
going to be the ones

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.930
running the economy,
making the decisions,

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.520
hopefully founding the
next innovative idea that

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.080
changes our lives.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.910
And so with that
bigger perspective

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:18.050
in mind and your own
personal perspective,

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.490
I'd like you to consider
these two lists.

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.070
So which is more
important to you

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.900
for children to learn,
obedience or self-reliance,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.070
if you had to choose
between the two?

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.510
Respect for elders
or independence?

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:35.800
Being well-behaved
or being considerate?

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.844
Good manners or curiosity?

00:05:38.844 --> 00:05:40.760
I'll give you a moment
just to think about it.

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.410
And some of you may have
seen this list before.

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.850
It's not mine.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.940
It's a list that
researchers use to determine

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.060
how authoritarian you are.

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.460
So if you chose
the first column--

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.140
obedience, respect
for elders-- if you

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.910
chose more of
those things you're

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.160
more authoritarian
in your worldview.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.890
If you chose the second column--

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:10.770
self-reliance,
independence, curiosity--

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.260
you're less authoritarian.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.210
Now, I'm going to
take a wild guess.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.670
Because we're here
at Google in Seattle.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.420
Most of you probably took
self-reliance, independence,

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.090
that call.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.800
That's great.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.110
And those are all
very American values.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.680
However, if you parrot in that
dominant, directive-protective

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.080
style that I just
mentioned, you're

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.810
actually reinforcing
the first column.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.520
Because in order
to do that, you're

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.130
asking for a lot of the
obedience from your kids,

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:43.430
a lot of respect for elders,
and good behavior instead

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.400
of their own initiative.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.800
So as I said before,
the one place

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.510
they don't do this, this
first column, is Germany.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:57.020
And while I had that
stereotype of Germans

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.910
as being the strict,
overbearing parents,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.520
that's true in the 1940s.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.760
Things have changed a lot
in Germany since then.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.820
And in fact, World
War II prompted

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.055
a big reaction against
that kind of parenting

00:07:12.055 --> 00:07:15.750
and really against
everything the Nazis did.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:17.270
The generation that
came after them

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.220
who were growing up in
the 1960s really rebelling

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:21.170
against their parents.

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.950
I mean it was going on here too.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.610
But the Germans
really had some things

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.950
to rebel against of course,
including how their parents

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.080
raised their kids.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.490
So there was even an
anti-authoritarian movement.

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:37.710
And some people opened
up daycare centers that

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:40.200
had absolutely no rules at all.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.990
And I've seen some videos
of those daycare centers.

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.930
And they're pretty wild.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.990
And things have come
back a bit then.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:52.200
German parents are much more
moderate than that extreme.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.620
However, you would be
really hard-pressed to find

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:58.140
many German educators
or parents would

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:00.690
advocate for a strict,
controlling way of dealing

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.920
with kids.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.400
And some evidence to that
fact is, around 2000, they

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.100
banned corporal
punishment, which means,

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.400
it is illegal to spank
your child in Germany.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.320
And when you think
about it, that's perhaps

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.790
the most authoritarian
thing you can do to a child

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:18.210
is your physical power
over them to try to force

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:21.590
them to do what you want to do.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:25.220
So while they may be
anti-authoritarian,

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.740
German society is anything
but a wild bunch of people

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:31.460
just running around in chaos.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.610
So how do they do it?

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.480
How do they manage to
raise kids who are not only

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.830
independent, but responsible?

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.820
The good news is that
you do less, not more.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:47.560
The bad news is that doing less
can be really, really hard.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.150
Whenever I talk
to German parents

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.670
and say, how can you let
your kids walk to school

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.460
or take the subway
by themselves,

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:57.070
they say, I'm afraid.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.090
I hate it.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:08:59.560
But I have to.

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.110
Because if I'm always with them
and I'm always hovering over

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:07.690
them, they'll never have a
chance to learn independence.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.960
So they don't just throw their
kids out there, give them

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.550
a subway ticket and say, find
your way or go find school.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.710
They spend a lot of time
preparing their kids

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.900
to take on each new
step of responsibility.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.190
And one example of this
is walking to school.

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:27.010
In first grade, I walked my
daughter to school every day

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.370
about 900 yards through
busy city streets of Berlin.

00:09:30.370 --> 00:09:33.740
There is about 3.5
million people there.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:38.170
And at the end of first grade,
they had a little course,

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:40.930
her teacher did,
on traffic safety.

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.263
And they showed her the [GERMAN]
outside the school, which

00:09:44.263 --> 00:09:46.360
are like the crosswalks
and basically

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.190
the whole area
around the school.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:51.400
And after that, I was
supposed to let her try

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.600
to walk to school on her own.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:59.950
And I thought, hm, she's
seven, and I'm American.

00:09:59.950 --> 00:10:02.000
We are not doing that.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.530
And so ashamed to admit,
I walked her every day

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.650
through most of second
grade and part of third,

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:11.080
while all her other friends
were walking to school

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:11.770
by themselves.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:14.070
And one day, she
finally said to me,

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:17.570
you know, mom, I can do this.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.540
And I said, well, the traffic.

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.450
And there's these
seedy guys who hang out

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.741
in the corner in the afternoon.

00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:24.140
And I don't like that.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:30.070
And she said, mom, all my
friends do it and they're fine.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:32.300
Now, I hate the "all
my friends" thing.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.930
However, she did have a point.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.850
While I was walking my
daughter to school every day,

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:41.760
her best friend was biking
from much further away.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.200
And every day she would
cross a really busy street,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.530
Frankfurter Allee.

00:10:45.530 --> 00:10:49.480
And she still does, as I
know, and she has not yet

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.710
been hit by a car.

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:54.170
So there is some evidence there.

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:57.160
And then I did eventually let
my daughter go walk to school.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:59.800
And when I did, it
was transformative,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.380
not just for her, but for me.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.020
For her, all of a
sudden, it was easier

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:06.580
to go to school in the morning.

00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:10.420
She got herself up, got dressed,
made a snack, packed her back--

00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:11.370
so proud.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.910
Said goodbye to mom at the door.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:19.060
And for me it was like,
oh, this is really my job.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.420
I thought my job was to
make you completely safe

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.300
and to make sure
that you succeed.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.480
But really my job
is to teach you how

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:27.430
to do things and then let go.

00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:35.140
So the German method is
to prepare their kids--

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:37.540
instead of trying to
keep them 100% safe,

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.099
but to prepare them to
manage risk themselves.

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.890
Because if we really
admit it to ourselves,

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.010
there is no way that we can
make the world 100% safe

00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:45.970
for our kids.

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:48.730
That's just not the
nature of the world.

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:51.340
The best thing that
we can do for them is

00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:55.610
give them the skills they need
to manage risk on their own.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.690
And one way Germans do
this from an early age

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.260
is through playgrounds.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.100
There we go.

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.380
And not this playground.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.490
This playground is in a
typical American playground.

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:09.320
Does it look familiar?

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.380
You could probably find
this in any city in America.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.310
It's plastic.

00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:14.430
It's short.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.560
The slides are plastic,
so they're not very fast.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.050
There is not a whole
lot of risk to be

00:12:20.050 --> 00:12:22.630
had here, except for
maybe a three-year-old

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:23.560
or a four-year-old.

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:27.080
After that, it's not
even very interesting.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.400
This is a more typical
German playground.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.630
And I say typical.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.660
But I have never seen one German
playground that was exactly

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.790
the same as another,
which you can't

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:39.700
say about American
playgrounds unfortunately.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.660
But some of the typical
elements they have are towers.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:46.386
And they're much
taller than ours.

00:12:46.386 --> 00:12:48.010
And they have different
ways of getting

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:54.140
to those towers that are
sometimes a little dangerous.

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.560
Here's an example.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.810
That's my daughter up there.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:59.740
And you can see from the
height that it's at least twice

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:01.240
as tall as she is.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.880
And she's on a log with
just a rope to hang on.

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.480
So there's a lot of
chance to fall there.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:11.710
So she's learning right there
how to manage some risk.

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:16.160
And not only are they more
dangerous or more risky.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:16.930
They're more fun.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:22.960
I mean, what's more
fun, this or this?

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.460
Now, this one's
actually in Bavaria.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.500
A friend sent it to me.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:30.820
And that kid is up kind of high.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:33.730
This is more of a
side view of it.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.290
These climbing rope
triangles are fairly common.

00:13:37.290 --> 00:13:39.930
And if you see at
the end, that tail--

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:41.920
this whole thing is
sort of like a snake.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.990
That tail is a slide.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.330
So the reward for
climbing up there

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:48.970
is you get to go down that
really fun slide, which

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.950
might be a little scary.

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:54.130
Now, I was lucky enough
that, in our neighborhood,

00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:56.375
we had something
called [GERMAN]..

00:13:56.375 --> 00:13:59.040
And that's the
[GERMAN] right there.

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.180
Now, this dragon has
since been torn down.

00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:04.060
And then they built another one.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.040
But it's not only high.

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.460
It has a scary look to it.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.600
It's got these big red teeth.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.240
And the kids can actually
climb up into those teeth.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:17.130
They can also hang out in
this gullet right here.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:20.650
And they're two enormous slides
that go down the side-- metal,

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.900
so they're fast.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.290
My daughter was
terrified of this thing.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.650
She would not go near it.

00:14:26.650 --> 00:14:29.830
Of course, she was really small.

00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:32.510
That was her when we
first arrived in Berlin.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.120
And this is the area in
front of the dragon, which

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.980
has some swings and some other
things that you can climb.

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:42.160
And for years, she would only
play around with the dragon.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.310
The most she would do with
it would be go up the back

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.400
and down again, and up and down.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:48.830
And that was it.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.350
So flash forward two years,
I've got a new baby boy now.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.520
And I'm watching him a lot
more than I'm watching her.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.390
And I hear, mama, mama, mama.

00:14:59.390 --> 00:15:01.120
And I'm like, ugh,
she's hurt herself.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.635
I wasn't watching her.

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:03.560
Oh, my gosh.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.150
But then I look up,
and she's in the teeth.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.780
And then she comes
down the slide.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.190
And when she stands on
it, you can just see it.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.280
She had conquered her fear.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.630
I didn't make her do it.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.850
She did it all by herself.

00:15:18.850 --> 00:15:21.940
And I think that's a really
important step for a child

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:24.490
to take, even when they're
five, is to face something

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.520
that they're afraid of and
to overcome it themselves,

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.420
and in their own way.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.310
I mean, she was working
up to that point,

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.505
I think, for a long time.

00:15:33.505 --> 00:15:37.420
And I'm a little afraid
that American kids don't

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.250
get a chance to conquer a
dragon very much anymore,

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.760
at least outside
of a video game.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.790
This picture was taken actually
several years after that,

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:48.175
because you see there's
another little face up there.

00:15:48.175 --> 00:15:50.710
And that's her brother.

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:53.000
So I guess if you have
a brave older sister,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
you get pushed to do
things a little bit faster.

00:15:57.650 --> 00:16:02.110
But another really important way
that Germans prepare their kids

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:07.010
is through using dangerous
implements that we normally

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:08.200
don't.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:14.650
And there's none that is more
stark of an example than fire.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:18.130
What are we taught about
fire when we're kids?

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.480
Don't play with it.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.600
Don't play with matches.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.210
If you ever seen a
lighter, go tell an adult.

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.700
That's not for kids.

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.990
That's not the prevailing
wisdom in Germany.

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:31.220
In fact, my daughter came
home from first grade one day,

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:34.970
and she said, mom, I would
like to light some candles.

00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:39.380
Because she had learned how
to light matches in school.

00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:41.540
And that was quite
shocking for me.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:44.660
But she had the note
from her teacher.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:47.810
And the idea behind
this is that Germans

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:49.892
think it's safer
to teach a kid how

00:16:49.892 --> 00:16:51.350
to use something
that's potentially

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.870
dangerous than to prohibit it.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.674
Because when you
prohibit, there's

00:16:55.674 --> 00:16:57.590
a great amount of children,
especially when it

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:01.130
comes to fire, who
will try it in secret.

00:17:01.130 --> 00:17:05.000
And of course, in secret is
dangerous because it's secret.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.760
And because they have
no capability at it.

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.190
You actually have to
know how to hold a match.

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.540
A lot of young kids
will hold it like this.

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.270
And the fire burns
their fingers.

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:15.440
And then they drop it.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.140
And then maybe something
catches on fire, right?

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.420
And their first thought,
if it's prohibited,

00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:23.250
is, I'm going to get in trouble.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.490
And then they run, or they hide.

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:29.310
And that's how a lot of
child-started fires happen.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:32.840
Now, there is a
man in [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.880
who is a pioneer in this area.

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.190
And he teaches kids who
are even younger than seven

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.374
how to light
matches and candles.

00:17:40.374 --> 00:17:42.290
But not only how to light
matches and candles,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:46.100
but how to make bonfires.

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:50.120
Now, [INAUDIBLE],, he's kind
of an interesting character.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.730
Because he used to
be a fire artist.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.750
And he once burned the
Berlin Wall in the 1980s.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:18:00.980
He has since got a second career
as a fire safety instructor.

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:05.720
And his idea of fire safety
is to teach very young kids,

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.280
ages 4, 5, and 6--
this is at a [GERMAN],,

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.190
which is like a daycare center--

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:11.650
how to deal with fire.

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:14.115
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:14.115 --> 00:19:10.279
- [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:19:10.279 --> 00:19:12.750
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:15.240
SARA ZASKE: What I love
about this video so much is,

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.100
not only do you see these
small kids making fire,

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:22.650
but you see them sawing
things using an ax,

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:25.020
cutting food, and cooking it.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:28.260
And I think it really
challenges our notion

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.850
that kids are
incapable and that they

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.440
need everything done for them.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.470
With a little instruction,
they seem to manage quite well.

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:38.970
Now, these kind of workshops
are everywhere in Germany.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.730
They're more common in
Berlin and Brandenburg.

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:46.950
But before you think [INAUDIBLE]
is a complete crazy man,

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.820
he has the backing of
insurance agencies,

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:54.190
child safety organizations,
and the Berlin [GERMAN],,

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.370
the city fire department.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.710
And when I think back to
when I saw a firefighter come

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:00.540
to my elementary
school, they stood

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:01.920
at the front of the classroom.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.780
And they told me not
to play with matches

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:07.330
and how to stop, drop, and
roll, which are all good things.

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:10.650
But never did I make
a fire with a fireman,

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:13.140
which might be
quite an experience.

00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.660
So the German way
of dealing with fire

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.170
is almost the complete
opposite of ours.

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:21.420
However, I have
found no evidence

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:24.960
that child-started fires are of
any greater number in Germany

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:28.410
than they are here where we
have a lot of prohibition.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:31.050
So that begs the question
then, if we're prohibiting it

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.380
and it's not working,
then why are we doing it?

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:37.720
And what is being lost
through that prohibition?

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.120
And I think, if you saw
those kids in that video,

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.680
they were incredibly engaged.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.570
Kids are very
fascinated with fire.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:48.090
And some people even
think we're evolutionary

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.550
wired to be fascinated
by fire because we used

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:53.100
to depend upon it for so long.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.590
But this is also an opportunity
for learning, really intense

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.720
learning for them.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.510
And that's another subject that
we are very concerned about,

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.290
right?

00:21:01.290 --> 00:21:05.430
We all want to know what
makes children succeed.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.640
Out here in the US,
we have pushed down

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:13.470
a lot of conceptual
learning into kindergarten

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.270
and to preschool.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:18.240
And we do worksheets and
flash cards with kids.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.960
In fact, Americans are
famous for trying to push

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.525
learning earlier and earlier.

00:21:23.525 --> 00:21:26.010
The psychologist
Jean Piaget once

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.800
called it the "American
question" back in the 1970s.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:32.680
And that question was,
can we do it faster?

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.934
How can we do it earlier?

00:21:33.934 --> 00:21:35.850
And he didn't answer
that question, why do you

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:37.807
want to do that earlier?

00:21:37.807 --> 00:21:39.307
And I have to say,
I'm guilty of it.

00:21:39.307 --> 00:21:42.660
Because back in the US
before we left Germany,

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.520
I had this brilliant
little daughter

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.110
who could speak at
a really early age.

00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.450
And I thought, she's a genius.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:49.590
I got to help her.

00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:51.390
And I started to teach
her how to spell.

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.839
I taught her to spell her
name while we were swinging.

00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:55.380
And I would swing
her back and forth.

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:59.454
And she'd say,
S-O-P-H-I-A, Sophia.

00:21:59.454 --> 00:22:01.311
And I was like,
oh, that's great.

00:22:01.311 --> 00:22:02.310
I'll try something else.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:03.980
OK, Sophia, let's spell mommy.

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.578
And she would say,
S-O-P-H-I-A, mommy!

00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:12.180
So we may be able
to get young kids

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.940
to repeat back to us a lot of
things, including math facts.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.320
And you may even be able
to get them to read,

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.160
which, by the way, has
very little evidence

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.300
that it gives them an
advantage later on.

00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.245
In fact, there was a study that
compared early readers of four

00:22:28.245 --> 00:22:29.970
or five with later
readers of more

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.010
the traditional seven or eight.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.545
By the time both
sets got to be 11,

00:22:34.545 --> 00:22:37.040
the late readers had caught up.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.080
So again, if it doesn't
give them an advantage,

00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:41.460
why are we doing it?

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.440
And more importantly,
what are they

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.690
missing while we are trying
to cram reading and math

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.230
at an early, early age?

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:52.500
And I would argue that
they're missing play.

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.750
And play is so essential.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:57.570
All mammals do it, including us.

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.350
And it's kind of the
primary way that we learn.

00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:04.430
In kindergarten, which
was invented in Germany,

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:07.350
at least there,
Frederick [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:10.180
had the idea that child
learning would take place

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.676
in a kind of Eden.

00:23:11.676 --> 00:23:15.350
Thus, the "garten"
in kindergarten.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:17.280
And that play was essential.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.530
And they've had some
changes in kindergarten.

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.930
But they are back to that model.

00:23:21.930 --> 00:23:27.170
And all they do in preschool
and kindergarten is play.

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.400
And when the ambitious
American in me

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:32.190
got nervous about that,
they would tell me,

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.720
really, they are learning.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:35.490
They're learning social skills.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:38.670
They're learning how to be
creative, how to be leaders,

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.130
how to have self-control.

00:23:41.130 --> 00:23:43.230
And a lot of the
kindergartens there

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.620
practice what's
called the [GERMAN]

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.620
or what used to be known here
as the observational approach.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.630
The teachers would step
back and watch what

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.520
was going on with the kids.

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.780
And this is one example.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:58.680
Every year in the
"garten" at our [GERMAN],,

00:23:58.680 --> 00:24:00.810
they would have a lot
of chestnuts come down

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:01.830
from the trees.

00:24:01.830 --> 00:24:02.850
And the kids love them.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:05.370
They would cram their
pockets full of them,

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.910
take them home, take
them in the inside rooms.

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.630
Rather than fight
it, they said, go.

00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:13.360
Get all of them that you can.

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.710
And they bring them
in to play with them.

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:18.650
Now, I'm sure there's some
math skills going on here.

00:24:18.650 --> 00:24:20.960
But they're not
very [? formal. ?]

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.970
The other kinds of
things that they would do

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:25.010
is they would do
projects with the kids,

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.860
but only projects that
kids chose themselves.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.387
So they would have a little
meeting, and they'd say, OK,

00:24:30.387 --> 00:24:31.720
what should our next project be?

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.510
And kids would throw out
ideas, and they vote on them.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:38.060
How democratic, right?

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.980
And then they have
the kids throw out

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.860
all the questions they have
about that particular idea.

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:45.600
For instance, they did
a body project one year.

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:49.100
And so kids wanted to
know, how do the eyes see?

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:50.360
How do the ears hear?

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.830
The heart beats?

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.230
What's my skeleton look like?

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.507
And so after that, for
over a period of weeks,

00:24:56.507 --> 00:24:57.590
they would investigate it.

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:59.150
They'd get books.

00:24:59.150 --> 00:25:00.560
They'd watch videos.

00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:04.040
They'd bring in an expert like
a doctor or go on a field trip

00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:05.240
to a museum.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.430
And through that
process, they're

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:09.630
learning how to engage
their curiosity.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:12.240
And they're really
learning how to learn.

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.990
And this whole emphasis on
play and self-directed learning

00:25:16.990 --> 00:25:19.660
goes on through
elementary school,

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:22.430
so until third or fourth grade.

00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:24.550
And if that worries
you, consider

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:27.970
that German teenagers,
by the time they're 15,

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.820
do much better on the
International PISA Test

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.020
than Americans.

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.810
That's math,
science, and reading.

00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.140
So maybe our
emphasis on academics

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:40.900
so early might be misplaced
and that maybe the kids

00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:46.200
need more of a foundation
of this kind of exploration.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:49.130
Oh, the last method
of preparation,

00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:53.560
I just wanted to touch on
briefly, is information.

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:58.450
Germans are much more
open with difficult topics

00:25:58.450 --> 00:26:00.520
with their kids than we are.

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:05.140
And these are things like sex,
religion, death, all of which

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.310
my daughter had
projects on in school

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.009
by the time of third grade.

00:26:11.009 --> 00:26:13.300
And of course, for Germany,
the darker parts of history

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.160
is a huge topic.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:19.750
But just to give you one example
for sex education, in Germany,

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:20.860
it's mandatory.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:24.143
You cannot opt your child
out of it for any reason,

00:26:24.143 --> 00:26:25.690
not even religion.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.670
Because they believe
the kids have a right

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.760
to know how their
body works, which

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.800
I don't know how you take that.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.220
But when I looked at the
statistics, in the end,

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:38.500
teenagers in Germany
are no more sexually

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.300
active than American teenagers.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.840
In fact, the statistics
are almost identical.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.750
The big difference, however,
are in other very important

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:47.920
statistics.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.840
Germans have a much lower
rate of teen pregnancy,

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.310
a much lower rate
of teen abortion,

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.410
and a much lower rate
of HIV incidence.

00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:00.790
So no matter what my morality
is around sex and my kids

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:04.680
having it at a certain point,
that information is powerful.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:09.410
And it has the power to help
them protect themselves.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:11.700
So then the big question.

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:13.850
How do we do any of this here?

00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:17.150
We have a very different
culture, right?

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:19.760
And I have to admit there
are some things that

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.210
happen in German society
that are society-based.

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:27.500
And making changes in our school
system or our preschool system

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.650
or even getting a more exciting
playground down the street

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:34.730
would take a lot of effort
by a group of people.

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:37.700
But there are several
things that we can

00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:41.300
do as parents and as citizens.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.640
And one of the first ones
is what we talked about

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.930
in the beginning--

00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:48.740
letting your kids learn to
navigate their own world.

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.950
A child of seven,
eight, or nine is

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:54.170
very capable of
taking themselves

00:27:54.170 --> 00:27:55.730
to a place, especially
one that they

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:59.000
go to often, like a
friend's house, the school,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:00.690
or the playground.

00:28:00.690 --> 00:28:04.850
And if it makes you nervous,
try it out the German way.

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:06.120
Go with them a lot of times.

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.500
Teach them traffic.

00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:10.630
Talk to them about strangers
possibly approaching them.

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.910
Though you should emphasize
it doesn't happen very often.

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:17.074
And if it still makes you
nervous, find them a buddy.

00:28:17.074 --> 00:28:18.740
Because two kids
walking down the street

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:21.110
feels a lot safer than one.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:25.700
And it also helps if there are
siblings involved, I think.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.640
Another thing that
we can do as parents

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:32.450
is to make time in every
day that the kids get

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:35.050
to decide what to do with it.

00:28:35.050 --> 00:28:38.750
And because we have a longer
school day now and homework

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.380
and then extracurricular
activities,

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.390
some kids can go
from first thing

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:46.640
in the morning to
the evening never

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:50.460
being able to decide
what they want to do.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.510
So for us, when I do
this with my kids,

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.220
it usually means playing.

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.250
And it's very
important for them,

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:01.850
I think, to play every day
as it is to get outside,

00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:03.186
which is also a German value.

00:29:03.186 --> 00:29:05.435
And that's not something
that's too hard to do either,

00:29:05.435 --> 00:29:09.240
though it does require
a push a little bit.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.080
And another idea is
to give them some life

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.090
tasks, even at a young age.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:17.090
My daughter does her
own laundry, which

00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:20.080
means I put a bin in her room.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.170
She fills it.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.500
When it's full, she does the
laundry and has clean clothes.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.880
I really like this
one because it

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.400
has very natural consequences.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.360
I don't have to nag.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:33.150
When she doesn't do her laundry,
she doesn't have clean clothes.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:35.860
And for a while,
she didn't care.

00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.130
But now, she
really, really does.

00:29:38.130 --> 00:29:40.314
And it gets done.

00:29:40.314 --> 00:29:42.230
And other things like
this are waking yourself

00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:43.850
up in the morning.

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.730
Cooking also has very
natural consequences.

00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.160
And they tend to be
very engaged, especially

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:53.280
if you couch it as teaching you
how to take care of yourself.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.890
It's not necessarily a chore.

00:29:54.890 --> 00:29:57.680
It's a bit of a step
towards independence.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:01.880
And if we teach our kids these
smaller things now at this age,

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.080
they get to have a growing
sense of capability.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:07.490
And as they get older, we
can give them more and more

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.370
responsibility so that
it's not such a shock

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:12.217
when they become 18.

00:30:12.217 --> 00:30:14.300
I don't know about you,
but I did know some people

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.740
in college who had
never done laundry, who

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:18.830
had never made a pot of rice.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:20.570
And they're missing out a lot.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.310
They have to catch
up really fast.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.130
And last, but not
least, is the idea

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:30.780
I brought up here about being
more open with your kids

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.600
about difficult topics.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.340
They can handle it.

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.880
And I want to tell
you a short story

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.850
about World War II in Germany.

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:46.200
You can't avoid the topic of
World War II in the Holocaust

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:49.399
if you live in Berlin especially
because it's everywhere.

00:30:49.399 --> 00:30:50.690
Your kids are going to ask you.

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.130
They'll see these
little gold [GERMAN]

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:57.000
in the street that memorialize
people who are taken off

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.730
to die in concentration camps.

00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:03.180
And whenever I ask my
German friends, the adults,

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:06.120
about World War II,
they would tell me,

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.382
I cannot remember a time when I
didn't know what my country had

00:31:10.382 --> 00:31:11.855
done.

00:31:11.855 --> 00:31:13.355
And that really
affected me because,

00:31:13.355 --> 00:31:15.750
if they couldn't remember
when they didn't know--

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:21.030
they must have been five maybe,
six when they learned about one

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:22.860
of the biggest crimes
in modern history

00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:25.290
that their own culture had done.

00:31:25.290 --> 00:31:27.220
That's a really heavy issue.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.550
And those kids were about
as old as those kids

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:34.380
you saw making the
fire and using the ax.

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.395
So I think our kids are
more capable than we realize

00:31:37.395 --> 00:31:39.420
or that we give them credit for.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.570
They're more capable of
handling physical freedom

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:45.120
and handling tough,
intellectual,

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.140
and emotional subjects.

00:31:48.660 --> 00:31:52.420
And that's the idea I'd like to
end the presentation with here.

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:55.230
I think, if we as parents
can get a handle on our fears

00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:57.690
like the Germans do
and step back and give

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.610
our kids the space
they need, then

00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:01.530
they can grow up
to be independent,

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:03.510
self-reliant adults.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.301
Thank you.

00:32:04.301 --> 00:32:07.668
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:09.210
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:09.990
SARA ZASKE: Hi.

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:11.920
AUDIENCE: Do you have
any advice for parents

00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:15.460
who would like to give
their kids more freedom

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:19.260
but are concerned about
things like your kids

00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.830
getting taken by CPS as happened
to that couple in Maryland?

00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:23.580
SARA ZASKE: Right.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.190
Absolutely.

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:26.580
I mean, we do have that problem.

00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:28.950
Germans have a sense of
community in the sense

00:32:28.950 --> 00:32:31.170
that, if their kids
gets in trouble

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:32.430
that people will help them.

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:35.610
And here we've come
to a part of society

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:39.750
where people tend to
call the police on you.

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.340
The best advice
I can give you is

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.581
to try to know your community
and talk to your community.

00:32:44.581 --> 00:32:46.080
That means talking
to your neighbors

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:47.100
and the fellow parents.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.097
And let them know
what you're doing.

00:32:50.097 --> 00:32:52.180
My kid really would like
to try walking to school.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.470
I'm going to let
them do it tomorrow.

00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:54.530
And you can get them in on it.

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:57.155
If they're a busybody, be like,
could you look out your window,

00:32:57.155 --> 00:32:58.830
make sure they're OK?

00:32:58.830 --> 00:33:01.080
I think if we start
to draw people in

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.250
to be proactively helpful
instead of negative,

00:33:05.250 --> 00:33:07.546
then perhaps we can
start to build that here.

00:33:07.546 --> 00:33:08.379
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:33:08.379 --> 00:33:09.420
SARA ZASKE: Your welcome.

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.940
AUDIENCE: How did
you get your daughter

00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:18.350
to start caring about not
wearing dirty clothes?

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:20.571
SARA ZASKE: It was
actually pretty natural.

00:33:20.571 --> 00:33:22.070
There was a little
bit of rebellion.

00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:23.240
I don't care, for a bit.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.090
And then her favorite
shirt wasn't washed.

00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:28.140
And it just kind of happened.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:28.640
Yeah.

00:33:31.814 --> 00:33:33.480
AUDIENCE: So I've
actually been thinking

00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.110
about a lot of these
issues for a long time.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:37.651
I have a 3-and-1/2-year-old and
I've been trying to introduce

00:33:37.651 --> 00:33:42.680
her to things that I,
as an overprotected kid,

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.652
wasn't able to do until much
later but I feel like she can.

00:33:46.652 --> 00:33:48.110
What I've been
trying to figure out

00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:50.390
is kind of at what
ages to do what things.

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:53.010
And it feels like a
lot of the resources,

00:33:53.010 --> 00:33:55.520
especially on the
internet-- ugh--

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.527
in America for
determining when is

00:33:59.527 --> 00:34:01.860
a reasonable safe time where,
like you said, five or six

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:02.390
for fire.

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.620
Can you recommend any
resources for figuring out

00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:13.110
how much earlier than the
American very conservative

00:34:13.110 --> 00:34:16.340
norms different
things could be moved?

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:18.659
SARA ZASKE: Well, I'm
really reluctant to say

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:22.389
that any specific age is
good for a specific task.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:25.370
It's really important to see
when your kid is ready for it.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.040
And often, they'll tell you.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.830
You can suggest some things, and
they'll be like, ugh, no way.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:33.139
And I don't recommend forcing
a kid who's reluctant.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:37.792
If you wanted to start with
cutting up potatoes together

00:34:37.792 --> 00:34:40.000
and they don't want to touch
the knife, I would wait.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.110
They'll come back.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.290
And I'll tell you a short story
about my son in the first time

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.150
he wanted to walk to school.

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:49.030
He was 6, and we
were in America.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:51.280
And he actually
wanted to walk home.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.239
I had driven that day.

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.670
And he had no interest
in getting in the car.

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:57.149
And that first time
he ran the whole way.

00:34:57.149 --> 00:34:58.892
And he was scared.

00:34:58.892 --> 00:35:01.350
He didn't really tell me he
was scared, but I kind of knew.

00:35:01.350 --> 00:35:04.630
And then he didn't ask again
for two or three weeks.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:06.610
Then when he did
it the second time,

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.240
that's when it clicked for him.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.430
And today, he
walks all the time.

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:13.260
So I would think suggesting
some things your kids

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:14.740
and see if they're into it.

00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.780
And then if they
go for it, yeah.

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.410
But if they don't, back off.

00:35:20.410 --> 00:35:23.680
Walking to school, the Germans
do it at about seven and eight.

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.090
The Fins do it at four and five.

00:35:27.090 --> 00:35:30.366
So it's kind of a
cultural thing as well.

00:35:30.366 --> 00:35:33.320
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
thoughts, observations of how

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.750
Germans teach responsibility?

00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:38.350
So for example, you give an
example of kindergarten--

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.100
just play all day.

00:35:39.100 --> 00:35:41.800
But do they get taught
like cleaning up.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.530
It's not a very
natural consequence,

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:44.980
like dirty clothes.

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:47.439
So just wondering what your
thoughts are and observations--

00:35:47.439 --> 00:35:48.146
SARA ZASKE: Sure.

00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:49.720
AUDIENCE: If there's
any differences.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.650
SARA ZASKE: It was
fairly freeform.

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:54.430
The kindergarten we went
to had very few rules

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:56.761
that the kids didn't
make themselves.

00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:58.510
So they actually would
sit the kids around

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.760
and go, what should be the
rules for our [GERMAN]..

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.329
And one kid will say, don't
climb on the furniture.

00:36:03.329 --> 00:36:04.870
And she'd say, why
don't you do that?

00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:07.190
She's like, I don't want
your dirty feet on it.

00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:09.724
Or don't hit other kids.

00:36:09.724 --> 00:36:11.140
Well, that's a
really natural one.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:11.640
Why?

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:12.510
Because it hurts.

00:36:12.510 --> 00:36:14.800
The second answer is
always the most powerful.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.710
Other kids won't want
to play with you.

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.570
So they learn some
responsibility

00:36:19.570 --> 00:36:21.935
just through the
interaction with each other.

00:36:21.935 --> 00:36:24.190
Now, if you're thinking
our parental interactions

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.410
with them, all
this responsibility

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.720
is rescindable, this freedom.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.430
So if they are being allowed
to walk to school and instead

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:35.827
on the way home they
stop at a friend's house,

00:36:35.827 --> 00:36:37.660
then you say, OK, then
maybe we need to take

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:39.070
a break from it for a while.

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.710
And I think kids,
in that sense, they

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:44.662
get a little bit of freedom and
then the accountability for it.

00:36:44.662 --> 00:36:46.120
So that when they're
older, they're

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.350
not just going out
there and going crazy.

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:54.270
AUDIENCE: The most amount of
[INAUDIBLE] to give my kid

00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:55.810
is for food.

00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:59.860
Because if I let him
pick what he needs,

00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.630
like if I have grains,
vegetables, and fruit,

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:05.610
[INAUDIBLE] I'm done.

00:37:05.610 --> 00:37:08.850
Later in the evening, he'll
ask for something else.

00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:14.503
So I don't know how to manage
that, teaching him such control

00:37:14.503 --> 00:37:18.170
and responsibility [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:20.000
SARA ZASKE: Food is a hard one.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.090
But I've heard that--

00:37:22.090 --> 00:37:24.520
if you think about the
food you hate most in life.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.730
For me, I'm really not a
big fan of Brussels sprouts.

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:30.610
Not for any particular
reason, but because I remember

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:33.070
being forced to eat them.

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:37.430
And they have that
connotation on it forever.

00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:40.930
So I would urge you not to
force them to eat anything.

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:45.760
I'm always a big fan
of continuing to offer.

00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:48.390
You only put out on the table
what you want them to eat.

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:50.920
But then he gets to
choose from that.

00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:54.190
And of course, the sweets
are only for treats and not

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:56.170
for all the time.

00:37:56.170 --> 00:37:58.840
The Germans do this a little
bit just through the way

00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.920
they do school lunches.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.540
Nobody brings their own lunch.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:04.730
So they have two choices
usually, a vegetarian

00:38:04.730 --> 00:38:06.360
and a non-vegetarian.

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.010
And if you don't like
it, you go hungry.

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:11.896
So kids tend to eat
if they're hungry.

00:38:11.896 --> 00:38:13.270
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for the talk.

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.780
This is actually really nice.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:18.560
My question is-- so if you
look at culture around here

00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:19.150
in the US.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:22.220
So for example, there was
a movie [INAUDIBLE] called

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:24.289
"Kidnap" with Halle Berry.

00:38:24.289 --> 00:38:25.205
SARA ZASKE: Ugh, yeah.

00:38:25.205 --> 00:38:26.270
AUDIENCE: It was
on accord of her

00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:27.870
taking her eyes off
her kid for a second

00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:28.953
and the kid got kidnapped.

00:38:28.953 --> 00:38:33.150
And then [INAUDIBLE]
and all that stuff.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.490
My question is-- so if
I see a movie like that,

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:38.780
I'm less reluctant to
let my kid walk to school

00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:42.090
or lay on the playground
unsupervised for a second.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:46.140
So how do you reconcile with
an environment like that?

00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:48.360
Because I'm assuming,
like in Germany,

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:51.080
they have a lot more control
over their media, or at least

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:53.882
that's the perception
that I have being here

00:38:53.882 --> 00:38:57.220
that they can prevent movies
like this from coming out.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.665
Saying, hey, don't
show things like this.

00:38:59.665 --> 00:39:02.370
[INAUDIBLE] kids walk
to school on their own.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:03.840
So how do we reconcile this?

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.810
Thank you.

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:06.810
SARA ZASKE: It is a
different media environment.

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:10.180
I don't know that they
control it so much.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.870
But there would not be as much
interest in that kind of movie.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:15.460
We like to scare
ourselves a lot here.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.300
What I really wish would
happen in our media

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:19.500
is that, whenever
they tell us one

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.640
of the real stories of
a kid being kidnapped

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.520
that they put it in context.

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:25.200
And as a formal
journalist, I wish

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.366
we could require this because
you're always supposed

00:39:27.366 --> 00:39:29.070
to put things in context.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:31.830
A little more than
100 kids get kidnapped

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.540
by strangers every year.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:36.060
Absolutely every
story is horrific.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.230
It's every parent's nightmare.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.430
But we have 77 million
kids in this country.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:45.120
Something happening to 100
kids is an aberration, not

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:47.440
a thing that happens every day.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:51.280
And if we knew that, if we
keep thinking about that,

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.160
I think we might
change our behavior.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.890
And one other short
story if I may.

00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:59.460
The far more common scenario
of a kid being sexually abused

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.240
is by someone they know.

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.970
And it's usually a man.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:06.190
And that man wants to have a
relationship with your child.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.810
Now, the child that has
been very constrained

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:11.520
and told to obey adults and
respect their elders all

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:15.330
the time is much easier
prey to a person like that

00:40:15.330 --> 00:40:17.750
than a kid who's been
raised to be independent,

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:19.290
is able to say no to adults.

00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:20.820
So there's a really
strong argument

00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:23.250
right there for making
your kid more independent

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:24.995
actually protects them.

00:40:24.995 --> 00:40:28.303
AUDIENCE: OK, I come from a
slightly different perspective.

00:40:28.303 --> 00:40:34.400
[GERMAN] So as you
see, I'm from Germany.

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:37.810
And when we moved
here, the school system

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:43.270
here does not really like if
your kids have these values

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:45.060
that you propagate here.

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:50.240
So for your own
children and in general,

00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:52.012
how do you propose
that the school

00:40:52.012 --> 00:40:55.825
system and this
kind of education

00:40:55.825 --> 00:40:57.210
really works together?

00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:03.240
Because for our kids,
it's very interesting.

00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.900
So for example, things like
the Pledge of Allegiance

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.200
in elementary school.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:10.152
This was pretty scary
from my perspective.

00:41:10.152 --> 00:41:17.930
But all this value on secondary
virtues like being on time,

00:41:17.930 --> 00:41:21.080
having all your work
done and, well, all

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.210
this control that you mentioned
that does not really go well

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.300
with this style of education.

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:31.110
SARA ZASKE: I've handled it
a couple of different ways.

00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:34.350
I've had teachers who are
receptive to it and schools

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:34.860
that are.

00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.950
I tell them my kids
are allowed to go home.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:39.360
Sometimes I have
to write a note,

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.025
because we're a very
litigious culture, saying

00:41:42.025 --> 00:41:44.730
that they have my permission
to do these things.

00:41:44.730 --> 00:41:47.330
And sometimes I get a
little passive aggressive.

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:49.470
I have a teacher--

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.650
kids do not need to do
homework in elementary school.

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:54.900
I'll say that there are
no grades, especially

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.360
until third grade.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:00.000
And there's no proof
that doing homework

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.430
helps in elementary school.

00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:05.670
And I have had arguments
with teachers about this.

00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:09.750
And other times, I've just
said to my son, don't do it.

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.269
You don't have to
do the homework.

00:42:11.269 --> 00:42:12.810
And if you want to
do it and you want

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:14.400
to bring me the
little piece of paper

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.885
that I'm supposed
to sign, which is

00:42:15.885 --> 00:42:19.029
a really interesting transfer
of responsibility, you can.

00:42:19.029 --> 00:42:20.820
And the moment he does
that, he'll probably

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.950
have passed some bar.

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.940
But I don't let them
make me control him.

00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.950
Does that make sense?

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:27.491
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:27.491 --> 00:42:29.428
SARA ZASKE: Yeah.

00:42:29.428 --> 00:42:31.327
Any other questions?

00:42:31.327 --> 00:42:33.410
AUDIENCE: Do you have any
theories on how American

00:42:33.410 --> 00:42:35.108
culture developed this way?

00:42:35.108 --> 00:42:35.816
SARA ZASKE: Yeah.

00:42:35.816 --> 00:42:38.900
Unfortunately, I
only have theories.

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:42.350
A lot of it is the media
and those scary stories

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:43.280
and scary movies.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.585
I mean, we have a show.

00:42:44.585 --> 00:42:46.130
I think it's called
"Law and Order--

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:49.370
Special Victims Unit"
where every week a child

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.800
is in some horrific situation.

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:56.480
And it gives the impression
that this happens often.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.820
I also think that we have
a very competitive culture

00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:00.110
and always have.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.990
So we are so worried
about our kids' success

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:06.980
that we think we need to start
them on that treadmill early.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:11.510
And it's actually had
some very bad results.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:13.101
Because if you're
a kid and you're

00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:15.350
working really hard in
kindergarten and in first grade

00:43:15.350 --> 00:43:17.330
so that you can work really
hard in middle school

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:19.100
and high school so you can
get into a good college

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.724
and worked really hard to get a
good job so you can work really

00:43:21.724 --> 00:43:24.170
hard, that can be
very depressing and

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:26.080
anxiety-producing.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.820
Where is the moment
for enjoyment

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:31.370
and the meaning of life really?

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:35.630
Is it just to constantly compete
and be the best and make money?

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:38.680
Or is there something else
there that's of value?

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:41.150
And I think if we
change our view on that

00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:42.830
and how we communicate
with our kids,

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:46.370
it could help them out a lot.

00:43:46.370 --> 00:43:49.130
OK, should we break
at this point?

00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:50.615
SPEAKER 1: Any more questions?

00:43:50.615 --> 00:43:52.330
AUDIENCE: What's in the book?

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.761
SARA ZASKE: What's in the book?

00:43:53.761 --> 00:43:55.980
Some of those
stories I told here.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:58.410
It's a research
memoir, so it's partly

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.100
my stories and experiences.

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.280
And it's partly I talked
to a lot of experts

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.780
and looked at studies as well.

00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.475
And I would say
it's part manifesto

00:44:05.475 --> 00:44:08.340
because I'm trying to make an
argument that we should give

00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:11.725
our kids more independence.

00:44:11.725 --> 00:44:13.350
SPEAKER 1: Thanks
for coming everybody.

00:44:13.350 --> 00:44:16.700
[APPLAUSE]
