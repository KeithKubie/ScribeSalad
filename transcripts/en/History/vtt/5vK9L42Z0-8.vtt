00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.210
Bladesmiths, welcome
to our strength test.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.210
One of my favorites,
the ice block chop.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.880
And we supersized it.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.380
What I'm gonna do is
take each of your swords,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.500
and I'm gonna beat them
repeatedly and viciously

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.170
into this big chunk of ice.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.040
It's gonna test the overall
construction of your sword,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.000
as well as its
edge-holding ability.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.710
Now, what your
swords do to the ice

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.580
is secondary compared to what
the ice does to your swords.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.330
And John, you're up first.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:26.580
How you feeling, buddy?

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.750
Nervous.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.750
Well, we're
gonna do it anyway.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.710
Yeah.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.670
[grunting]

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.500
[music playing]

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.710
Oh.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.540
[laughing]

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.920
[music playing]

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.250
[laughing]

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.330
Well, this is very heavy,
very hard to control.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.290
Also, aside from having
gaps in your shoulders here,

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.540
you've got a pretty
good bend in the blade,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.750
and that was there
before I started.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.380
Not a lot of edge
left, but you survived.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.880
Drew, how you feeling?

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.580
I'm ready.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:25.120
Good, so am I.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.580
[grunting]

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.460
[music playing]

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.790
[suspenseful noise]

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.830
Now, Drew, this is
a beautiful sword.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.000
Thank you.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.460
The blade is
still razor sharp,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.420
which is very impressive
with an ice block chop.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.750
That being said, the ice block
chop is meant to be brutal.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.080
It's meant to test the overall
structural integrity of

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.960
your sword, from tip to pommel.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.170
Problem is, I'm holding
your pommel in this hand

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.830
instead of this hand.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:08.670
So that's an issue.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.290
Yeah.

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.580
Drew, your blade has suffered
a catastrophic failure.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.000
I have to ask you to
please leave the forge.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.330
DREW: I'm sad that
my blade failed,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.250
but I feel really
good about the fact

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.830
that I was able to make
something completely

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.540
outside of my wheelhouse.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.790
But none of that matters if
the pommel comes flying off.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.290
If the functionality
isn't there,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.460
the aesthetics
really do not matter.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.500
I had a ton of fun.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.170
I would do it again in a second.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.210
I'm super excited to get
back to the west coast

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.330
and just get back
to work chipping

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.880
away at my custom orders.
