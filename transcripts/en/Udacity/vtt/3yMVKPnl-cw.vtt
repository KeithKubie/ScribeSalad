00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.860
As we said, our plan is to
have the victims contact us.

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.610
That is, after we spread a malware,
each victim computer, or

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.820
compromised computer,
will somehow contact us.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.100
For example, we may hardcode in the
malware some email address that we use

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.670
or even our IP address and so on.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.160
The first problem with such approach of
hardcoding our content information in

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.910
the malware so that the victims can
contact us, is that it is not stealthy.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.960
It is a safe bet, that eventually,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.910
security admins will find out that
there are bots on their network and

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.210
they may be able to obtain
the botcode or the malware.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.000
And through malware analysis,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.080
they may be able to recover
our hardcoded address.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.060
&gt;From there, they can identify us,
so this is not stealthy at all.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.100
The second problem is that,
this is not robust at all,

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.000
because there's only one single
server for command control.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.770
That's the one that's
hardcoded in the malware.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.080
For example, if we have hardcoded our
email address in the malware, and

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.710
the email address
account has been banned,

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.730
then there is no command control
available for victims anymore.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.890
So this is not robust.
