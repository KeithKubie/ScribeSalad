00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.840
Hey what's up guys we were back today
with another explosive project now last

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.500
night I had an idea come to me for an
improvised desktop weapon so today we're

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.280
going to be making alka-seltzer grenades
now the materials for this project are

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.799
really about as simple as they can get
you're just going to need a box of

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.949
alka-seltzer and some of these little
plastic film canisters that used to be

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.010
able to find at photo centers now I got
these ones at Walmart but because

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.789
everything's going digital now they're
getting a lot harder to find however you

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.180
can find them all over Amazon for about
50 cents each so I'll put a link in the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.810
description to where you can find some
now the reason I like film canisters is

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.719
because they're a really good size and
they have a lid that just presses down

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.190
into place nice and snug like that but
if you can't find any film canisters

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.219
like this and don't feel like buying
them online then just try and find some

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.510
other comparable sized container with a snap-on lid like this all right now the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.239
first step to making your Seltzer
grenade is to find yourself a roll of

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.199
duct tape I have a few camouflage rolls
left over so I'll be using that and the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.039
nice thing about a roll of duct tape is
the tape is the exact width of the film

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.010
canister so we're just gonna need to
wrap this around a couple times and just

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.289
like that our grenade casings got a
really cool texture

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.250
quick update guys I actually took the
last tape off of the roll it was just

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.219
enough to wrap around the container then
I pressed the lid of the container into

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.950
another piece of duct tape and use a
pair of scissors to cut around the edges

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.380
and did the same with the bottom of the
container as well and here's what we've

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.310
got now these white round alka-seltzer
tablets are really what make all the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.720
magic happen and priming your Seltzer
grenade is very simple start by filling

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.780
your container about a quarter of the
way full with warm water drop in one

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:42.950
single tablet pop the lid on tight give
it a shake throw it and run awesome the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.189
Seltzer grenade goes off with a bang
makes a pop that'll make anyone jump and

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.819
the coolest thing it's completely
reusable not only that but if you catch

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.599
it in time most of your Seltzer tablet
will be salvageable as well you can use

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.920
it again now this Seltzer grenade was
inspired by the idea of the alka-seltzer

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.429
rocket which pretty much works on the
same principle add some water drop in an

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.390
alka-seltzer tablet pop on the cap but
stick it upside down so it rests on the

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.720
table with the cap facing down the
pressure begins to build and once it's

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.440
too much for the container the body
explosively separates and gets thrown

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.459
into the air let's do that one more time
in real time we fill it up about a

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.959
quarter of the way with water add one
alka-seltzer tablet press on the lid

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:27.720
give it a shake set it down and run away

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.900
and you can see just like a real grenade
you get about five to six second delay

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.390
alright so let's talk for a second about
exactly what's happening during this

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.840
reaction alka-seltzer tablets are made
of three main ingredients they have

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.740
aspirin but they also have baking soda
and citric acid which you might remember

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.100
are two of the main ingredients we used
for the bath bombs in a previous project

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.400
video when the tablets dissolved in
water the bicarbonate reacts with the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.840
hydrogen in the citric acid to Bruce
water and carbon dioxide gas the carbon

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.530
dioxide being released builds pressure
until it's substantial enough to burst

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.760
the container so now that we've got our
Seltzer grenades down to a science let's

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.660
take it to the next level
with airsoft BB's now the setup of our

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.630
improvised airsoft grenade is pretty
much gonna be the same the only

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.340
difference is we're going to drop in a
handful of around 40 to 50 BBS so we got

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.730
our Seltzer tablet on the bottom our
airsoft BB's on the top now we simply

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.180
add a bit of water press on the top and
throw it and then get to a safe place

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:26.070
extremely far away

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:32.350
hey that was pretty powerful it was a
good one that's a good one that was what

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.840
I was looking for

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.110
so there you have guys that is how to
make a mini Seltzer grenade that you

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.710
could use just to startle an
unsuspecting victim or declare desktop

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.940
warfare on one of your mischievous
cubicle counterparts thanks for joining

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.230
me for this video guys let me look for
the next one talk to you then it smells

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.360
good
yeah it's effervescent hey guys quick
