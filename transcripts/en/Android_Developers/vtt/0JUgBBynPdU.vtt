Android apps in the Kotlin
programming language

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.920
using industry-proven
tools and libraries.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.860
Creating Android
Apps in Kotlin is

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.350
a course developed by Google,
together with Udacity.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.290
You'll learn by building real
Android apps using industry

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.920
best practices with
modern app architecture.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.310
Understand why and how to use
Android Jetpack components,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.950
such as Room for
databases, WorkManager

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.530

components, and more.

You'll use key Kotlin features
to write your app code

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.700
more quickly and concisely.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.290
Learning to develop
on Android is

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.170
much more than learning
APIs and shortcuts.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.650
It's training your brain to
think like a mobile developer.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.670
