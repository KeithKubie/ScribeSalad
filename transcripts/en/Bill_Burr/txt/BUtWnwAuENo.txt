Speaker 1:          02:51          We've hung out a million times. We never thought to do a podcast. I didn't want to infringe on the man's talents. Um, please welcome Mr Tom Rhodes. Yay. What's going? Yay from me. What's up brother? How are you brother? Um, I'm doing good man. I'm so psyched. You're on a podcast. You're one of the, one of the best comics I know. I've known you for like, I know I've known you for like 20, I don't know how many years, a long way back in la. And I would say I was living in New York like 98 99 was that it? I think, yeah, maybe that was what it was. I thought I met you in like 95 or 96 out here in la. He's out here. Maybe briefly, you probably walked by with your romantic novel hair that you had back up. Romance, novel haircut. I meet with my red Afro Two hacks passing in the night.

Speaker 1:          03:41          Right. Trying to get better. And then, yeah. And then I think the first time I like officially kind of met you and was hanging out back when we both had folic strength. Yes. And I was very excited that you knew who I was because I had seen you at eating it of all places, which is why I became a huge fan of your standup. I've told you this story before, but I'm gonna tell the listeners where you were, uh, you were talking about some sort of extracurricular activity that you were doing. I had done mushrooms in Amsterdam and vulnerable park. Yes. And I just remember you were describing the whole fucking trip of it. And I just remember you just at one point you were just like, I was running through the grass summit tippy toes. And it's just something about that was like, you know, there's w with alcohol, there's nothing worse than just seeing somebody who's like completely fucked up.

Speaker 1:          04:29          But like with mushrooms, there's like a oneness with the world where you literally watching adult become a child or something. I just thought you described it. I've never taken mushrooms, but like from what I've seen when I've seen people tripping and I'm a, I was there with, with Nia way back in the day when we were still boyfriend girlfriend. And we would die in laughing. And that became like, you know, like one of the, uh, a catch phrase for us. You know, we would just be walking around the apartment and one would be in the other room and we just, we're just yelled that out and run into the grass on my tippy toes. We both would just start laughing. That's the greatest compliment. You could get one like a, uh, a joke or a sentence from a joke becomes part of somebody's vernacular, you know?

Speaker 1:          05:05          Oh yeah, there's been a few. There's the Dave Chappelle, Dave Chappelle had a bit about, uh, how, you know, he likes eating chicken and he's a black dude. So there's that weird sort of stereotype. But he's like, but, but I like it. He goes, but I won't eat it in public because he goes, I'm afraid there'll be some white people around going look at him. He loves it. So just like the encyclopedia says, it wasn't that the last line of that bit. I don't remember. But I just remember to this day, I know I can't eat this. Thinking of that line. Well to this day when me and Nia or hanging out, uh Oh, if we're eating food and F if she go as a taste, I go, oh, that's good. I like it. And she'll just go look at him. He loves it. Like it just, it's just, there was a few of those.

Speaker 1:          05:51          Yeah. Now I've got to go through all of them. Sarah Silverman, Sarah Silverman said something about how she prac bought condoms or something. I forget. I just remember that was the punchline was cause I do a lot of fucking neo was watching that we're in this little one bedroom apartment is everything is in New York little and I was shaving in the other room and I just heard that I didn't even really even here the setup, which probably why I can't remember it, but I just burst out laughing while I was shaving. So, um, anyway, you're part of my mount Rushmore of lines that just never, it never, it just never left my, my, my, my head. I don't know why. So. And furthermore other, you know, I would say either you or Doug, Stan hope have probably put the most like stand up miles on the odometer as far as the places that, that you've played, how far you've gone.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Um, but I mean you might have to be the king man. You were telling me that at some point in this podcast you are going to start rattling off your dates. If actually you sat down here looking like you didn't have a care in the world and you just casually mentioned to me that you're off to Mongolia tomorrow. Yeah, yeah. I would be a fucking wreck going like, oh, I, what am I going to forget? Something I would have to check 50 times to make sure I have my passport and I would stick it in the bag and I would zip it shut and then look to make sure that I would zip it shut again and then I would still have to check it before I left the house in the car on the way to the airport before I started talking. That anxiety down because I used

Speaker 2:          07:18          is my, um, Genghis Khan biography to reread on the plane. That's it. Is that how you say it? It's not gang. Yeah. I played in Mongolia last October and it was freezing. It was in the third. So this is the, you're the only guy I know. Not only is Benda Mongolia over notice that he's return engagement was triumphant return to Mongolia. You asked him the Comedians, they're wonderful guys. I mean in Mongolians are beautiful and they look like the people in the Avatar, but without the blue. And, uh, five of the low f five of the local Mongolian comedians met me at the airport when I arrived and they chow, they cheered when I came out. I'm like the most famous comedian that's ever played in Mongolia, so they'd like bend over backwards showing me, uh, Ulaan Baatar and we drove out to the, uh, the world's largest Genghis Khan statue. And Yeah, they taught me that it's a, it's Genghis Khan not getting gifts and those, those,

Speaker 1:          08:16          well, I like a, you're not obnoxious with that information. You could be really conti at a party. Uh, excuse me guys. I don't interrupt. It's Genghis Khan, Huh?

Speaker 2:          08:24          Yeah. And Americans and other people say though, they call those white round tents a Yurts, but they actually call them GIRs in Mongolia. So what's, what's the, uh, I don't know anything about it other than it's just sort of spoons with northern China. It's between them and Russia and China and Russia. And, uh, so I liked it so much and um, I wanted to go back in summer and see it when it wasn't, um, bone chilling cold. So it's kind of, um, uh, vacation. So I mean, I'm going to do a gig there, but I'm going to go in and I'm going to spend like four days there. These guys are going to take me way out into the country. We're going to sleep in a girl, one of those round tents. Um, shoot life, shoot some arrows, do some, uh, do some Mongolian warrior activities. And then I got a Gig. You've got to tell Rogan about this. Rogan sounds like he would be all over the country. Would love it. I'm sure you would love it. It's um, you know, that's the,

Speaker 1:          09:23          I've shot some arrows in my time. I went, I went both fishing and some by you down and fucking hour with o was somewhere outside of New Orleans.

Speaker 2:          09:31          It's a great thing about being a comedian. I remember I was in Alaska years ago. I did a Gig in Ketchikan and I met the perfect Alaskan Guy who took me fishing on his charter boat and then took me skeet shooting.

Speaker 1:          09:45          I obviously feel like when you meet those guys, there's always some sort of like raggedy plane you get in first that lands on water or they put snowshoes on bottom of it plays upon tune. Um, so let's see. Uh, you know, you're the only guy I know that it's played Vietnam.

Speaker 2:          10:03          I love Vietnam. You know, my, my,

Speaker 1:          10:05          you're the, I know that watches like Ken Burns documentaries. Like, yeah, I've been there. I've played there. Yeah, I know what it looks like. No, I've done all of that.

Speaker 2:          10:12          Um, I, you know, well, I did that special for comedy central in 1995 called Viva Vietnam. I W I got to go to Vietnam. You've been going there? I was over the years. Yeah. I was the first comedian ever to have a development deal with comedy central and so I could do whatever I wanted. It was like being a junior filmmaker almost, so. Oh. And they were sitting 94. Bill Clinton lifted the travel ban on Vietnam, the way like Obama lifted the travel ban on Cuba and my father fought in Vietnam. He flew helicopters. He was shot down everyone in his helicopter. Can you tell that story? Uh, yeah. Quickly. Yeah. So, and this is why Vietnam has always been a really important, it's a been a big thing in our family. Um, so my father flew helicopters in Vietnam in 1969. He was stationed in play cool.

Speaker 2:          11:08          And, uh, he, there was, there was all these soldiers stuck on the ground. They're surrounded by, uh, the north Vietnamese soldiers in there. They're just getting slaughtered. So my father had to fly in and rescue these guys. How old was he? Um, he actually joined my, my dad was one of those knuckleheads, so he was 30. His, uh, his buddies in his unit called him Methuselah because he was like the oldest guy there because everybody else was 19. You know, he just thought, you know, he grew up on John Wayne movies. He thought that, you know, he was one of those guys that thought you have in your country needed you, you know, so, uh, they made, he made, I got the letter from the army, uh, and all his metals, um, after he died. Uh, so he made three attempts to land to save these guys and was, it took so much heavy fire, he had to lift up, circle around and on the fourth attempt he gets down and there's like 20 guys down there is still alive and it's life or death.

Speaker 2:          12:10          So they all like jump on the helicopter and as he's pulling up, you know, and these just getting rattled with so much, um, fire machine gun fire that the helicopter nose dived down and everybody died in the helicopter except for him and his copilot who was knocked unconscious, he unhooks him, drags him across the field under heavy fire. And then they had to wait there for like an hour or two before someone could come in and rescue. Was he shooting back at them or what? Well, it's funny, he, cause he, you know, he, my dad, uh, would laugh when he tells his story because he always had this pistol that he would take with him when he, when he was flying. And then the one day he forgot it, he gets shot down. So he wasn't shooting back, he didn't have a gun. So, um, my dad was a decorated war hero and he, um, he got like five medals for the men over your house.

Speaker 2:          13:06          He, uh, Tom has it framed. Yes. The letter and, and there's like, you know, the little from the army is saying what he did from his commanding officer and there's almost not enough room in the frame for all of them as like five, there's like six medals, but five were from that one incident. He got the distinguished flying cross and, and, uh, my, my father, um, is buried in Arlington national cemetery as they should be. And you gotta be a bad ass to get in there. You know, I would say he qualifies. So my dad, uh, probably be buried across the street. I'm like sort of a seven, 11. I want a viking funeral pyre. Um, so, so my dad, every year he would get, he would have a reunion with his Vietnam veteran helicopter buddies. It was like, um, big thing for him. Uh, and uh, and, and you know, my dad also loved stand up comedy.

Speaker 2:          13:56          My Dad loved prior and my dad's the reason I'm a comedian, you know, you yet all. I remember driving around with it as a little kid listening to Richard Pryor with my dad. So as he thrilled that you became a comedian. Oh yeah. My Dad drove me to my first open mic night. My Dad, my dad, see, I looked at him and Tommy, so my dad stand up comedy was always revered in my family and well especially, you know, because my dad and he just, uh, my dad wore shipped prior. He had a Bob Newhart records and JC great taste too. Yeah. So I, I, um, I think those were like my two biggest influences as a kid. And then my family is from Washington DC and my uncle did open mic nights for one year in 1978. I'm 11 years old. My Dad took me to see my uncle perform at this open mic night and it was a club called El Brooklyn's in DC.

Speaker 2:          14:49          And the entrance was next to the stage, the shows in progress. We walk in, I'm wearing a Washington Redskins jacket. The comedian on stage pulls me on stage and he starts interviewing me. Like I'm the coach of the Redskins and I'm like, I'm 11. I'm mum's a bashful, dopey kid. I give you one word answers. Yes, no, but I'll never forget standing on that stage and seeing all those happy people with their heads thrown back and laughter and all the teeth in their mouth. And that moment changed my life. And I, you know, and I, I just, I can, I can still picture it. You know, it's, I, you know, um, you know, black people, Latin people, white people, like Asian people, just the flavors of humanity. And I just thought that that was the most magical place in the world to stand on stage, making people laugh. So, um, I became a student of comedy after that and would keep notebooks. And then I started when I was 17 with a fake idea. You still have all your

Speaker 1:          15:51          comedy, like you like your, your apartment, first of all, it's cool as shit. It's also like this, uh, it's the Smithsonian of your life and he has his dad's helmet from Vietnam when he was shot, the one that he was wearing. Um, I got chills looking at that thing. Yeah. Like that's like a imagine like you brain when he was aware of that. Yes. And you had told me the story as we were sitting there smoking a wonderful cigar. Uh, and you told me this story and then to New York and I still have the helmet and I was like, Oh wow, man, I couldn't believe. And then to walk in and see it and after and just the heaviness of it once, it's like a story attached to it. Like if you just got a helmet and it was like, yeah, this is like, uh, you know, some memorabilia thing.

Speaker 1:          16:35          This is, and you have to wonder what have to actually know what happened while that thing was. I mean I'm into that type of shit. Like I got that weird thing of like, um, if I know the story behind it, which is why I have to be careful because I'll, I'll just fill my house up with a bunch of shit like that. And then I have all this fucking anxiety that I have no place to send anything down. You know, I can't have this thing cause I kinda grew up with semi hoarders that just would not fucking throw anything out, you know, 40 years of magazines and Shit. Um, no, that's a good thing about, you know, I had everything in storage for 10 years. I just traveled the world. I decided not to live anywhere. Do you think can see that. So I got to preserve all these great things, you know. But do you think, you think your dad being in Vietnam and then you learning about that, is that how you got the travel bug to the level you that you're on? Like some Tom Brokaw level shit? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          17:23          maybe. And my mother's from Argentina. Um, so I don't know. I mean, I had performed everywhere in the United States, you know, 20, 30 times and I wanted to branch out. Um, but, but, but, but back to Vietnam, I mean that was a really special thing for me to go there. And I filmed this hour special called Viva Vietnam for comedy central. I was like a travel log type of thing. Um, did the Jane Fonda workout tape in Hanoi with some old women in a park when that Denang China beach setup a slip. CIA people about why Jane Fonda is funny for that. Uh, Vietnam veterans hate Jane Fonda's guts still to this day. Veterans, um, at those Vietnam reunions, my dad would go to, they still sell the Jane Fonda, um, urine, uh, the thing for like a urinal guard with her picture on it. You know what I'm saying? A urinal cake.

Speaker 2:          18:21          Yeah. It was a no, like the little plastic thing on it. Oh yeah. Okay. Um, and so at the height of the Vietnam war, Jane Fonda goes to Hanoi. The, um, uh, the capital of the people were having a war with and she's antiwar and, and, and they took pictures of her own, like anti aircraft artillery and, and then she met the POW [inaudible] and one of them slipped her a note and then she, uh, apparently, if I remember the story correctly, she gave that to the Vietnamese prison guards and Oh God, who was tortured extra for, I'm slipping her a note. Oh God, that's fine. That's has to be the ultimate, uh, stupid celebrity moment. Yeah. Where you're, you're just so like, you know, sucking the Dick of your own fucking ego that you, you go and do something like that to just, well, I think being against a war zone, okay, that's fine.

Speaker 2:          19:21          Do that. You'll go to the Capitol and I've watched enough war movies that my heart would be in my fucking throat. The second you get the note, you're like, do I got to put this under my tongue and put it up my ass? Like, what do I gotta do? I gotta do it. I know this is like some top secret shit. Shitty. Yeah. Um, but so in, in 1990, we filmed it, it was me, guard came at you mad, slipped me a note. Um, he'll need extra bamboo under his fingernails. Uh, so 19 September [inaudible] 94 we filmed it and like Americans, it was only like, that's, that went there. Like it hadn't become like a tourist place yet. So, and this park in, in Hanoi, a old women would gather and do Tai Chi in the morning. So at the time in [inaudible] 94, beginning, early nineties, Jane Fonda was making these exercise tapes and we set up a television with a VCR and we brought the tape and 1994 technology, we had to run an extension cord like five blocks to, to set this up in the park.

Speaker 2:          20:27          And these old women loved it. They took to it and they started doing it and she was, I turned it as she goes, now turned to the right and I'll say, I'll say she turned to the right. Did you, did you see, uh, can you imagine her fucking agent when she was telling them that, I'm going to go to North Vietnam? He's just sitting that Jane, I've worked so hard with you to get you to this level. I'm imploring you not to do this. Oh, Marie, the a bed bed bed. Uh, Mary Tyler Moore episode. Um, God, what a fuck he sort of like the first Dennis Rodman. Like when by the time Dennis did it, it was just, just been so much. First of all, they didn't have our guys, you know, in, in p and W. Yeah. Yeah. And uh, well, I mean, you know, um, what was that guy's name?

Speaker 2:          21:17          Otto warm beer. It was a guy that I have no clue who that is. Did he played for the Bengals? I'm the only one who remembers this guy's name. I think he was from Chicago. He was there. He went to North Korea and vacation a few years ago. And he stole a banner out of the basement of a hotel. Yeah. And they sent him, sentenced him to, you know, hard labor for life. And then they came back a year later. They sent him back as a vegetable. There was in a coma. Yeah. And he died. Yeah, he died. It's heartbreaking stories. So yeah, he went up, he went in there and like, yeah, it took that poster, whatever, which is, you know, something you don't do. I remember somebody on, on, on the Internet, it was like, as you example of white privilege, oh my God. It's just like, even this, you have to turn into that.

Speaker 2:          22:03          Yeah. Can't we all just be like, wow, that's somebody's son. Yeah. You know, can't, can't you just do that? Do you have to turn it into like a fucking Hashtag, uh, social justice, whatever fucking moment. Everyone's being dehumanized. Yeah. I mean, I dunno, that was one of those six months or so. I can understand why anybody would go to Vietnam on vacation. They killed so many of our, she knew so many people that died, you know, and I went back in 2014. Hennoi was my favorite. It's French tree lined boulevards. It's really, uh, the lake. The John Mccain was shot down in, uh, in the whole town. Has Swan boats now has now has swan peddle boats. No, it doesn't. I told you that. Did you tell me that? I did tell you that was just use my Boston background. Yeah, you can rent couples. Go there and rent swan paddle boats.

Speaker 2:          22:56          See that's why I don't watch people stand up specials because things stick in years. I forget cause I was sitting there like, oh I'm going to throw in the swan joke thing from when I got back. So I went in 2014. This English guy who runs the Gig there and annoying also gives motorcycle tours of the north in Vietnam. So I went back April of this year and um, I went on this, if it was my, my dream to go on this motorcycle journey and we were 45 miles north of Hanoi going up a mountain, a little winding road, and the bike went out from under me and I wrecked and say, how good are right around you. I was the fourth time I've been on a motorcycle and I've been afraid of motorcycles my whole life. So it was something I wanted to do to break my fear. And, uh, just wearing a helmet. My head bounced off the road, but I was fine. And, uh, took a lot of skin off my elbow, but

Speaker 1:          23:56          I think it just taking the safety course out here, we ride around a parking lot.

Speaker 2:          24:00          My wife's brother, my wife is from Holland and her brother teaches motorcycle lessons in Rotterdam. So last summer when I was in Rotterdam visiting her family, uh, he took me out and, and he and I did that in the parking lot. Okay. So I did

Speaker 1:          24:16          then how long between that and then just writing up a fucking mountain in Vietnam? Uh, what,

Speaker 2:          24:22          eight, 10 months later I do this. I took my ground school and, uh, didn't fly again. And eight months later I decided to fly in fight or a dirt bike when I was a hurricane and I like tore a tendon in my arm and I missed a baseball season, which was a big deal when you're 14. Yeah. And uh, and then I didn't, when I lived in Amsterdam and I had the, uh, worked, uh, for this Dutch travel show for a year, I got to do a highlight on Peru and we went to the Nazca lines. You know those lines that people think are alien landing strips. They weren't discovered until the 1920s. That shit on

Speaker 1:          24:58          not cover that Zeplin box set. Uh, you're talking about, cause I really dumb guy here, dude. I don't, I don't, that's weird. You'd like talk in English, but half of this shit you're saying I don't, I don't, I'm just like, I don't know what that is. I'm just, this is taking me back to the

Speaker 2:          25:11          cool, well I'm just like, there's these desert drawings and they weren't discovered until the 1920s when aircraft was um, first flying over Peru and one's that Condura one's a monkey and then there's the, looks like these landing strips in between it and um,

Speaker 1:          25:28          yeah. Why would you make it like that if everyone didn't know how to fly back then? Right. Is that what they, they asked it

Speaker 2:          25:34          like a thousand years old. It's, how could they have done it unless aliens helped them? Maybe just, maybe that's the theory. They

Speaker 1:          25:43          develop some sort of hot air balloon before anybody else. And then they all perished in some sort of a plague and there, you know, everything was biodegradable back then. How you're going to find the hot air balloon. It can, it doesn't always have to be aliens doesn't,

Speaker 2:          25:57          yeah. I used to do a line years ago that a, the Incas did cocaine, I guess that explains why they were building, uh, alien UFO lending strips in the desert all night.

Speaker 1:          26:10          Um, tell me about a couple of things I want to ask. One of my favorite podcast episodes ever was the one that you did with the late great John Fox, who was, I never met him, but I heard all of the stories. He was like, um, road viking. I mean, he, like every, he, he created the cliches. Like he was kind like, uh, the like, I don't know, the Elvis or like, you know, the early days of rock and roll where there was no, you know, go out and go create

Speaker 1:          26:44          it and create what the fuck this is going to be. And he, he kind of did that as far as every fucking cliche now, um, that guy was, and listening to that podcast with him, because I'd only heard of him and I never really, you know, there's all these short little clips of him on the Internet just to get like an hour, an hour and 10 minutes, however long it is of him telling stories. And then just hearing the stories in his voice like that. I that crazy laugh he head, oh my God. Oh my God. Like, uh, amazing. How did you get like everybody on my, on my buddy Paul Versey met him and was like, man, that guy was, he was a fucking sweetheart and verse. He met them right towards the end and he actually who they are working like Milwaukee or something and he watched his set and actually gave him a couple of tags, encouraged him and all of that. And I don't know if he was sick yet, but um, he just was all mad. He was like the nicest guy and all of that type of stuff. So I'm so glad that you did that episode, but how did you get to meet John?

Speaker 2:          27:45          Um, I worked with him when I was really young. I think I was, I, I was 19 when I worked with him in Jacksonville, Florida. There used to be a punchline there. It was a great room and I used to do the comedy zone down there. This was way before that. You know, the, the Atlanta punchline in the, in the boom, in the late eighties there was punchline comedy clubs all over the south. And the one in Jacksonville was one of the best and the guys that owned it, it was like four guys and then they all got like Mercedes and BMWs and then they're breaking in so much money. They moved it to a bigger venue. They had like 150 seat room. Then they moved it to a 500 seat room and the place was never the same. And then it went out of business. But at one time that was like one of the W it was one of the greatest clubs in the south. So I worked with him. And you know, John Fox was legendary for kind of being a womanizer, coke freak, booze hound, all that. Chan I check he liked me. Um, because I I could drink heavily and um, I I was row relatively cute and um, you track some late would attracts some ladies. So he still had, he was on one of the first

Speaker 1:          29:00          right, right. That is, that is next level like getting pussy where it's just that remind me of Pedro Martinez when he lost the heat on his fast ball. So he developed a couple other pitches and he was able to stay in the league at a high level. So he's sitting there crushing ass cause he was a good looking guy when he was young. Right. Blonde hair had the mullet, which was the look, the whole Miami vice oak he could pull up was crushing as, and then all of a sudden he starts [inaudible] loses a little heat on his fastball is like, here's a good look. You look looking young fella, I'll bring him along. That'll keep bringing the ladies up to the light here. That's the thing. Yeah. I think

Speaker 2:          29:34          people don't remember, don't think of when they think of him when he could. He was on one of those early Rodney Dangerfield young comedian, and he looked like a California surfer guy. He had blonde hair, Tan, he's a Tan, great shape. And then he got older and Pudgy and he looked like an older white guy, alcoholic dude. So, um, the life caught up with him. He helped me get in. He loved me and he helped me get in with Chicago xannies where he was the man and you know, that was his hometown. He was from Waukegan, Illinois. But, um, he was mister Chicago, so he gets me work with him in Chicago, booked like three weeks, uh, the downtown room and a couple of the suburban rooms for a couple of weeks. I'm 19. I'd never been to Chicago, uh, and it was sold out every night and he was the man, uh, Saika one of those porn star came and he took me to the blues brothers, had a bar or doing cocaine after hours off to the pinball machine.

Speaker 2:          30:40          He took me, he took me to a cubs game. He took you under his wing. He took me under his wing, but it was great. I mean, uh, you know, I'd only been doing comedy for two years and now I'm in Chicago playing and sold out rooms opening for this guy. But he took me to see the cubs and he was a, he was kind of a Chicago celebrity back. Yeah. And he was buddies with Steve Stone and he actually took me up, we got to go up into the booth when Harry Carey's saying take me out to the ballgame. And like, Harry Carey's like, you know, half in the bag, leaning out the window and, um, the had to hold his belt so he didn't fall out. I mean, who lead a better life than that guy gets to announce baseball while he's just catching a buzz.

Speaker 2:          31:27          And everybody's thought it was hilarious that he was like, he was literally drunk. Yeah. On the, yeah. In the afternoon there. So, um, yeah, so I mean, you know, uh, John Fox was really nice to me and I knew him through the years and then, uh, the trials and tribulations and bad relationships and years of booze and excess, uh, it was kind of sad what, I mean, he was kind of the cautionary tale of, you know, you don't want to be this road guy who um, is just chasing women in partying and stuff forever because it, uh, it was really a sad end for that guy. And then he lived in the apartment building next door to the apartment where the xannies puts the comedians in Chicago. It's an old town. And, uh, there's the old town Ale House, which I remember him taking me there and all these, that area in the, in the late eighties was Graham a kid. And it was, you know, it was so much fun. And then, uh, he was kind of like sad, lonely drunk guy at the old town. Alehouse towards the end or was towards the

Speaker 1:          32:40          end, like when, when did it start becoming, when did it sort of shift where the industry wasn't, he stopped getting work and, um, and I, I sat in the night, Nah, I can't remember. I can't remember what year I did that recording with him. I don't think it was the nineties, cause when I was, no, no, it was asked early thousands. Yeah. Cause when I was in the nineties, when I was starting to get out there on the road, it was, uh, I would hear legendary stories about him. And then everywhere I had just been, it seemed, Doug Stan hope was there and had some sort of debauchery in the fucking green room. And I remember the first time I met Doug Stanhope, uh, you know, I instantly loved the guy, but before I met him I was like, who the fuck is this Stan Hope Guy? What the fuck can he, you know, do all this shit outside of the Goddamn, uh, the comedy condo and a, but I would always hear like, oh my God, the Atlanta punchline, they, they used to have stories.

Speaker 1:          33:37          I know there's a couple of guys who was still alive, so I don't want to fucking put this shit out there. But there was like a couple of guys on that Mount Rushmore of like the wait staff would be so excited that they were coming to town. And after like maybe a night and a half, like that Sunday night show seemed like three years away and they would just like, I don't think I'm going to make it. Because there was those guys that came to town and they just, they were like this pied Piper in the entire fucking wait staff. They had this charisma. All the bartenders, the club owners, they, he would just take them on a crawl night after night, after fucking night. And yeah, and like, I mean, I, uh, this other guy that I know of, well I'm not gonna mention his name, like he had a nickname and all that, and you would pick up the phone and he would just, he would say anything like, Tom, like Yanni bills, it's so and so. And the running joke was you would just scream in horror knowing that he was coming to town, he was going to stay with you and that you guys were going to be hitting a bottle or two every f it would be like trying to keep up with Lemmy, some of these guys. That reminds me of something like the Lemmy Motorhead stories, um, that you hear him so

Speaker 2:          34:46          well. You don't have the, um, the, the albums in the following to fall back on. Like I remember anything John Fox when he was still like surfer, good looking guy. Uh, I remember he would walk by the waitress station and he would go, um, he would just announce fuck me before him famous. He would say that out loud to the, to the way he never would have survived the me too movement. Oh my God. Wow. But so when he was so towards the end and you know, and I always had a soft spot in that from a hurt for the guy because he helped me when I was a young comedian. And, uh, so I did that interview with him. And, um, the thing that I, that stands out for me on that interview that I did with him. Oh, so there was, there was one when it, when it got sad for him, I remember there was some turbulent, he was in and, and uh, he was falling apart and as a, as an alcoholic and he's in this terrible relationship and the girl had scratched his face, like really bad.

Speaker 2:          35:49          And so he had all these scratch marks on his face. And uh, there was a story in Atlanta about him breaking down on stage and crying and just some really sad stories and shit that happened to him. But the thing that stands out fucking movie. Yeah. The thing that stands out for me about that interview was did he still believed in love? He's talking about, and he had been through all this shit in his life and you know, he's, he's older, Pudgy, alcoholic guy past his prime and he's still talking about love and it's like raging bull. But the stand up version, like the narrow back in the day Co, he could've played John Fox like the John Fox story. It's the same thing. And in the end he ends up doing stand up in raging bull. Yeah. Jesus Christ. Um, well you, uh, you, you cleaned up your act how long ago? Uh, I've been so good.

Speaker 1:          36:39          We're four, almost five years. That's fucking amazing. I've been a, I finally kind of cleaned up my act. I don't like, I don't think I would ever not do it again, but like, I drank like the last day of June and then I drank, uh, August 7th, and I'm not going to drink again. Select October now I sort of drink like the way I smoke cigars or I should say the way I would like to smoke cigars, which I like, you know, a couple times a month or every other month or something like that. Uh, you know, um, I'm trying to like, you know, I've got a kid, I'm a super old fucking dad to have a kid, so it's just like I have to fucking be around until this, my kid has it figured out.

Speaker 2:          37:21          Yeah. Every, every warrior needs to move onto Wiseman and I can't be out pounding it. And, uh, one of the greatest things ever happened to me was given up the booze. And I mean, and I have feasted from the banquet of life. You know, I, I, I mean I lived in Amsterdam, you know, uh, hosted a talk show over in London. You would like the Dave Letterman late night talk show for two years on Dutch television. But, um, you know, I went through, uh, some pretty hardcore tragedies. My Dad, who I adored, um, was killed by a drunk driver in 2009 through the irony of that, when you see that helmet, that surviving Vietnam, all of that in the metals and all that. And then just some jackass in Anaheim, which, you know, we've all fucking done. So I can't put like, it's just fucking unbelievable again. And then my little sister, who I was really close with, um, died of breast cancer in 2011, uh, my wife and I actually got married at her hospital bedside, um, the day before she died of cancer cause I didn't want her to miss it.

Speaker 2:          38:25          So that was 2011. So 2012, 2013, I had stopped drinking for pleasure, saying I would just like numbing myself because I was so heartbroken. And then, um, January 1st, 2014, uh, in Philadelphia, I blacked out and busted my head open and, uh, the next, and I got like six stitches on my forehead. I had a black guy. The next day I looked in the mirror and I saw so much ugliness and, uh, and I, I knew, I knew, she didn't know that was the moment when you look in the government. I had been thinking about it and I just thought the main, I mean vanity was, was a big reason because, um, I, I saw so much ugliness in the mirror, but also I knew it was holding me back as a comedian. I knew I could be a better comedian if I stopped drinking every night. And, um, you know, and I didn't go to any AA meetings, which a people always get offended when I say that, but, um, I just, I just had had enough and um, the, for the first, the first, first couple of weeks, you know, you're a little, little bumpy, but uh, you know, you can get through it just pictured you look into the mirror with the black guy in the car and just be like, all right, you went, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          39:44          When I'm a fucking doing this. Well, what happened was I looked in the mirror and I just thought, I want to go one year when I looked in the mirror, what I said to myself was, I want to go one year and see what it's like, not be in drunk every night to be, to see what I could get done. And I got so much done, uh, writing jokes and, you know, working on my book in different projects and stuff. Uh, I, I, I, that's what made me stick around. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          40:13          Well mine to having a kid now too. It's like it's every, every dad told me, he said, Oh yeah, I have a kid that'll, that'll curb your drinking cause they don't give a shit or have any sort of concept of what being hung over his yeah. And they wake up with like, they're there on a full tank. Like the whole body is brand new, nothing hurts and they're ready to just, it's just like that Duh Duh Duh. They get right in your face. Ha. He's yelling and shit and it's just like, um, it's actually, you know, I'm finding if I'm going to go out and do stand up, I have to make the, I have to be out the door by eight o'clock, eight oh five, I'm going to fall asleep. It's just one of those things like she gets up at like a quarter to seven in the morning.

Speaker 1:          40:53          And uh, that happened to me last night where I was like, I'm going to go out. I think it was actually, I was going to go see a mission. Impossible. Cause I'm wanting to watch Tom Cruise, speaking of helicopters, find that helicopter. And um, I just, Oh, the next showing isn't until 10 or 10 30. And I knew I was like, I'm gonna fall asleep in the middle of mission and possible Tom Cruise Action Summer action movie. I am so fucking tired, I'm going to fall asleep. So, uh, plus I want to take my, uh, Neil long to go see it in like Imax, get the whole thing before, uh, the whole experience before it goes away. So, um, let, let me see. Ah, let's, let's promote, so you're going to be in Mongolia. What else do you got? Like I don't know if I have any listeners there.

Speaker 1:          41:31          That was such a great story about how supportive the comics where, because I did a Gig in India and like most of the crowd was comedians. I was so happy that I didn't realize that because I would've been like intimidated. Like, Oh God, they're all going to be like, well, what's the next joke structure? And afterwards we all hung out and it was like, it was weird. It was like I was hanging at a comedy club on the other side of the world in, in like total. They're called, but it was the exact same fucking questions. Did you write on stage? You do that? Yeah. Don't you think this guy is overrated? And they would say shit like that. I was like, oh my God, it's the exact same physical, the guys they're repelling over there. Um, uh, emulating your, uh, gestures and stuff cause they hung out with, no, but I actually do, what I found was people in India are fucking hilarious that just, they're a, there, it's kind of that same vibe of like when you go to Ireland and Scotland, when you just meet like, like, yeah, this is why I love the most, you know, the fraternity of it, you know?

Speaker 1:          42:29          Yeah. They're like, uh, people in Australia funny. They're just fucking funny. I don't know what it is. And then other places you go, I'm not going to mention is I want to shit on any, he just go in and they're just like, these people are polite and then you go to these other places. It's just like you just is the second you walk into the airport, you just start seeing characters. He's like, all right, this is to be a good show. These people are cool. So I'm so glad you went to um, that, that um, storer in Paris and on your podcast, you wouldn't give the name of it. Oh yeah. Cause I turned you onto it. I knew I didn't want to live emails. What's the name of that Patisserie? Cause I was picturing you go in there the next time standing in this line, you know, you're all excited.

Speaker 1:          43:10          Like that fucking asshole bill. Set It on his podcast all get to stand in. But there's already, the word is kind of what people already know. And when people come up to me, I tell him like, like what it is. And I actually liked the sandwiches better. The sandwiches are amazing. I remember what I, what I told you what I tell everybody, get one of the sandwiches because they're incredible. And then buy one for later from when you're walking around Paris and you think to yourself, damn, I wish I'd bought a another sandwich for later. Yeah. And it doesn't overdo it. It doesn't, it's just makes you want to keep going back. So, um, you know a lot of, uh, that mission impossible. I heard he's in Paris, shot in Paris. Yeah. I gotta check that out, but I keep trying to get to your data. Okay. All right. Funny Bone in Mongolia. No, no, no, no. It's called the UBI. Ulaan Baatar is called a, they call it ubi city.

Speaker 1:          45:39          such a fucking interest and get you want the most interesting people I've ever met because how do you not, you know, well, I guess there are mouth breathing more on set could travel this way and [inaudible] reading. Sorry. Now we're with fucking, uh, and their worldview wouldn't fucking change, but yours does. Thankfully. I'm interrupting here. Continue. What else? Uh, yeah, but you know, I was trying to make that show where I would be the Anthony Bourdain of comedy. Um,

Speaker 1:          46:32          she used to travel with me everywhere and now she's selective where she wants to go. She wants to go to Pittsburgh because we've never seen it. I can tell you you to get was a per Manny's. You've got to get one of those sandwiches. Yeah. They're Italian section with all the, uh, the Gaba, Google and all that shit. Joe Barton, I converse, he brought me through the, they, they went and got it through. Pittsburgh is one of the, uh, great cities. This country has one of the great, the old Basset America. I've never performed one of the go, go to a pirates game. That view with the bridges. It's, it's believable. It's one of my favorite cities. And when you come from the airport, it's the greatest skyline you're going to see because it's not like you see it and it just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

Speaker 1:          47:14          You can't see it at all. And then you drive through like this fucking hill, this tunnel, and then you come out and just Boehm and says, panoramic elicits, it's like all of these bridges does the ballparks and everything to the left Heinz field, uh, um, [inaudible] pirates play. It's gonna say pac bell. It's where the giants used to play. I forgot what the fuck they call it. They change them every year. And then, uh, then the skyscrapers and though they just, there's so much to do there. The food is unbelievable. And the, uh, you should be like [inaudible] you should give out little stars for Comedians that, uh, that work ever. He used to do that. What do Willie Stargell in 1979, they called him pops. Yeah. And they had those, there's flat hats back then. Yep. The old, he used to give out little stars to the his teammates that he thought whenever they did something.

Speaker 1:          48:04          Great. All right. So on the back of their hats, they had all these stars. Do you remember that? Yeah, vaguely Kent to call them. It was like a really cool thing about the, I saw him on one of the last time, one of his last public experience, uh, to Colby, the side arm throwing no appearances. Uh, I saw, uh, yeah, but I saw Willie Stargell when he was old. He was sick. He could tell he was dying. And I was at three rivers stadium and I was watching, uh, the cubs first, the pirates and Sammy Sosa was still out in right field. You still look Cuban, you know, before, if you've seen them now. No, he's whiter than, you know. Yeah. Um, there was some big story about him. Yeah, I read recently. Yeah. He's, oh, he's living in Dubai and he's, um, he looks, yeah, he looks like John Fox.

Speaker 1:          48:50          Yep. Now that's what Sammy Sosa looks like. Okay. So, uh, yeah, what? Pittsburgh? November 29 to December 2nd, I don't think the pirates will be playing. Then we go to Heinz field and then, um, December 10th to the 17th, I'm in Israel doing this Israel tour. Uh, and then where haven't you remembered? 20th through the 22nd I'm at the Improv in Orlando, Madagascar. What have we got? I've never been Antartica Hulu. I've never, the only con I have not, the only content I have not performed on is Africa in Antarctica. Okay. Yeah. Dude, there's gotta be some sort of expedition. So the, the, uh, they're writing the comedy Igloo as soon as that opens, when the, uh, yeah, the 40th anniversary of the thing, when they, when they all go down there, you gotta a, you gotta get that thing to going to dial back the international travel next year.

Speaker 1:          49:49          Well, I want to, how I do it is I, I, I'm, I'm overdue to go, go to Australia and I just sorta like as I get the new hour, I just have it in my head were what hour I did the last time I was there and I always go and, uh, have a great time. It's a lot weirder now that I have a kid. So we set up this east level. Australia to Sydney is one of my favorite cities in the world. All of those cities are great. Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth. Yeah. I came to Perth on Australia Day. Fucking lunatics. Who Do the El Camino was still popular, so popular. They love those fucking things. That a, what's the, I forget what they call it. It's a, I remember going to Australia for the first time. I'm like, what kind of cars? Yet?

Speaker 2:          50:28          There's this, this automobile brand called Holden and they still make those, um,

Speaker 1:          50:34          yeah, cars, they're great. People would get more fucking shit faced. Drive it all around. I've told you this shit. I saw, I went to Bon Scott's grave and somebody went to Bon Scott Scott Miller, genuine draft bottle on there and I wanted to remove it, but I was like, oh, out of respect for the person that put it there at bond probably would've drank and he wouldn't give a fuck. But, um, all right, let's, uh, let's wrap this up here. So I, I just got to say you, you're one of my favorite people, one of my favorite comedians. And, uh, this has been one of the best podcasts I've done as far as just like fascinating fucking store. I mean, everything we had life death here. What'd he say? Heroic behavior here arisen. Is that a word?

Speaker 2:          51:15          Heroism. Heroism. Ben? I've been to a lot of countries too and it just doesn't seem dumb luck, man. I, uh, thanks for having meall a man. I, uh, you're one of my favorite people to hang out with every time you and I get together and we just like hang out as buddies. I always get material out of it. You know, I was telling you that story about a, because I pronounced so many words incorrectly,

Speaker 1:          51:35          I was just gonna say, I can't imagine how many, how many fucking countries I've been to. And I still sound like I've never left my block.

Speaker 2:          51:41          Oh mean, it's just so great. Um, I was telling you about arguing with my wife because she wants me to clean the toilet and like, I don't, I don't want to clean the toilet. Right. And, um, you know, a lot of thoughts go through my head during the day, you know, watching movies, sleep on the couch, call a friend, cleaning the toilet is not one of them. And we live in an apartment building. So this is what it's like to argue in an apartment building. Uh, you make a valid point. Now lower your voice, because I don't want everybody in my building, no one my business and I'm in the laundry room, folding clothes. Some guy walks in there. I know you, you're the dude who don't clean the toilet. So like I've been doing that. I've just started doing that like in the last two weeks. And that comes from having a conversation with you on my balcony smoking cigarettes or cigars cause yeah, you're one of those guys, you're always spitting out material. You realize that you've got to go, don't waste that on me. You better do that. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          52:32          I used to get an argument with me. Neva was still living in an apartment. We used to, uh, she didn't give a fuck and she calls it, she's passionate. So, uh, this is when she would occasionally throw shit at me or punch me in the chest. Um, this is back her younger wilder days. And I remember, uh, we would get into, and I would lose so many arguments because she didn't give a fuck about volume. And I would always be going like, all right, do you have your bait to point? You don't got to help the whole fucking world know about it. I said, they get loud. She would just be like, so then what's worse as you start whispering, so only your shit is coming out and all the names like, oh my God, he's horrible. He's not even arguing. She's so fucking right.

Speaker 1:          53:14          That's where they get ya when they get allowed on. Yeah. Well anyways, uh, so greatly you finally came on, finally. Got You on. I think it's cause we also love smoking cigars and telling stories. So it's like why would we have a podcast get in the way of that? Um, um, I'm so glad you came on. You get to, uh, promote your dates here. So go see him in Mongolia. If not, you can see him in Pittsburgh, Atlanta, west Nyack, Orlando. Yes. You know, I still, I still play everywhere, all over the states. And you have a great life. I majored in like radio communication where you got a great radio. I wish somebody would give me a voice over gigs. Huh? You know, this town is, you've got to take it. I'm running through the grass on my tippy toes. Um, definitely check him out. He's going to be everywhere, and if he's going to travel that fucking far, you can travel a little bit to go see him. Uh, the great Tom Rhodes, everybody, thank you so much for coming on. Here's a little music for you. And then we get, we have a bonus half hour of a greatest hits from a Thursday afternoon podcasts from earlier this year, years ago. I don't know. I don't decide. All right. Have a great weekend and I'll talk to you on Monday.
