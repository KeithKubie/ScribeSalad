00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:03.952
- I remember leaping up and then got down,

00:00:03.952 --> 00:00:05.422
and punched you and then I said,

00:00:05.422 --> 00:00:07.703
"This is going to happen
every time I see you."

00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:11.286
(electronic hip hop music)

00:00:25.213 --> 00:00:27.890
Welcome to This is Not
Happening presents Fistacuffs.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.314
If you've never been to the show before,

00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:30.959
it's just a bunch of
comics telling fun stories

00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:32.493
about real shit that happens.

00:00:32.493 --> 00:00:35.165
Mr. Steve Rannazzisi,
everybody, let him hear it!

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:38.332
(audience applauding)

00:00:41.142 --> 00:00:42.642
- Yeah, thank you.

00:00:43.638 --> 00:00:44.471
Thank you.

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:49.507
So, my fight story happened
to two of my very good friends

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:53.559
at the time, Ari Shaffir and Bobby Lee.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.795
So, considering Ari's
here, why don't we bring

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:01.155
Ari up on stage so that Ari
can sort of help us along

00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:02.638
as one of the parties.

00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:05.484
(audience applauding)

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:06.915
We're gonna get a mic over here.

00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:09.501
So, let me just paint a
little picture for you.

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.253
I don't know if any of you
have been to the Comedy Store,

00:01:11.253 --> 00:01:14.384
but it's a dank little, you
gotta walk up these dark steps,

00:01:14.384 --> 00:01:15.510
you don't really know
what you're going into.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.471
- Stink.

00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:17.534
- Yeah, really.

00:01:17.534 --> 00:01:19.602
So I'm in this booth, selling the tickets,

00:01:19.602 --> 00:01:22.330
and Ari's the first
comedian on that night,

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.095
so he was on stage,
and the second comedian

00:01:24.095 --> 00:01:26.177
is now on stage.

00:01:26.177 --> 00:01:29.521
And what were, you were
venting to me about what?

00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:31.438
- Probably about my breakup.

00:01:31.438 --> 00:01:32.661
- Yes, your breakup.

00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:33.986
You were very upset about your breakup.

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:35.202
- I was very upset, I had broken up

00:01:35.202 --> 00:01:38.695
with Natasha Leggero, and
I was very upset about it.

00:01:38.695 --> 00:01:40.445
- You were really, really upset about it.

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:43.324
- I wasn't done playing with my toy.

00:01:43.324 --> 00:01:47.753
And when baby doesn't get
his bottle, baby gets angry.

00:01:47.753 --> 00:01:52.432
- And does the baby then deflect
anger toward other people?

00:01:52.432 --> 00:01:53.844
- Well it's not baby's fault!

00:01:53.844 --> 00:01:55.704
(audience laughing)

00:01:55.704 --> 00:01:57.517
It's never baby's fault.

00:01:57.517 --> 00:02:00.863
- Okay, so I'm listening to Ari now vent

00:02:00.863 --> 00:02:04.080
to me about his breakup and why he thinks

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.042
the breakup is happening,
and his main reason

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:09.049
is he's deflecting all
his anger onto Bobby Lee.

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.041
- Bobby Lee.

00:02:10.041 --> 00:02:12.824
- So who shows up at the
cover booth, but Bobby Lee.

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:14.511
So why don't we bring Bobby up on stage.

00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:15.702
(audience applauding)

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:18.480
- Bobby Lee!
- Bobby Lee!

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.780
Got it right there.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.867
(audience applauding)

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:23.843
- Can I just say something?

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.053
I'm small, I'm small.

00:02:25.053 --> 00:02:26.041
- Yes.

00:02:26.041 --> 00:02:27.760
- I'm little, I have
no muscles on my body.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.153
- But fat hides muscle.

00:02:30.153 --> 00:02:31.431
- Excuse me?

00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:32.897
- Fat hides muscle.

00:02:32.897 --> 00:02:34.510
- That's true, that's true, that's true.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.918
- You could have muscles
underneath the fat.

00:02:35.918 --> 00:02:37.400
- [Ari] That's like the thing.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.703
- So I show up to the Comedy Store,

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:40.497
I have to check in with Steve.

00:02:40.497 --> 00:02:41.724
Now can I ask you a question?

00:02:41.724 --> 00:02:42.923
- Sure you can ask me anything you want.

00:02:42.923 --> 00:02:43.957
- Who got you the fucking job there?

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:45.625
(audience laughing)

00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:46.938
- Bobby got me the job
at the Comedy Store.

00:02:46.938 --> 00:02:48.945
- Exactly, and later that
information is gonna be clear

00:02:48.945 --> 00:02:50.522
because he betrays me.

00:02:50.522 --> 00:02:51.654
- I don't betray you.

00:02:51.654 --> 00:02:52.767
- You fucking betray me.

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:54.303
Anyway, I got him a job there.

00:02:54.303 --> 00:02:56.037
Who helped you out in the beginning?

00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:57.116
- Who got me a commercial agent?

00:02:57.116 --> 00:02:58.742
The only thing that got
me buy in the business

00:02:58.742 --> 00:02:59.839
for over seven years?

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:00.838
- Yes.

00:03:00.838 --> 00:03:01.801
- Bobby Lee did.

00:03:01.801 --> 00:03:02.756
- Bobby Lee did.
- Thank you so much.

00:03:02.756 --> 00:03:03.793
(audience applauding)

00:03:03.793 --> 00:03:04.760
- Thank you so much guys.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.984
So basically, I'm a dream-weaver.

00:03:06.984 --> 00:03:09.357
- You're a dream-weaver,
yeah, a dream-weaver, Bobby.

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:10.311
- Thank you.

00:03:10.311 --> 00:03:11.259
- [Steve] A dream-weaver.

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:12.717
- So I check in at the Comedy Store.

00:03:12.717 --> 00:03:13.687
- That's what you're supposed to do.

00:03:13.687 --> 00:03:16.402
- So I'm talking to Ari through the window

00:03:16.402 --> 00:03:18.160
and Bobby comes up and
stands right next to Ari

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.097
and goes, "Can I talk to you?"

00:03:20.097 --> 00:03:21.161
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:23.547
First of all, you have to understand,

00:03:23.547 --> 00:03:27.062
that while I was being broken up with,

00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:29.127
Bobby knew the dude that was trying

00:03:29.127 --> 00:03:32.524
to move in on my territory,
and he fucking showed him

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:35.524
love letters constantly
that they were going

00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:36.768
back and forth, he would show em to me

00:03:36.768 --> 00:03:37.715
all the time at work,

00:03:37.715 --> 00:03:38.554
so I was mad at you
- This was the bone

00:03:38.554 --> 00:03:39.559
- for not helping.
- of contention at the time.

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:41.237
- Okay shut the fuck
up for a second, okay?

00:03:41.237 --> 00:03:42.760
(audience laughing)

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.771
He came to the Comedy Store, right?

00:03:44.771 --> 00:03:46.203
To see me perform.

00:03:46.203 --> 00:03:48.954
Then he went upstairs
to the Belly Room, okay.

00:03:48.954 --> 00:03:51.147
Natasha was performing.

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:52.110
- I like how you turn--

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.385
- Shut the fuck up, alright!

00:03:54.385 --> 00:03:57.010
And he goes, "Wow, she's hot."

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.728
And I go, "Whatever, she's
dating my friend Ari."

00:03:59.728 --> 00:04:03.371
I went down to do my set,
and he had asked her out.

00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:06.923
This is two, three weeks before
he beats the shit out of me.

00:04:06.923 --> 00:04:08.295
So this is what happens.

00:04:08.295 --> 00:04:09.889
I check in with you.

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:10.890
- [Ari] Maybe, maybe, maybe.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.759
- Then I see Ari in back of me right,

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:14.715
and I go, "Hey dude what's going on?"

00:04:14.715 --> 00:04:16.593
Because I'm a nice guy.

00:04:16.593 --> 00:04:17.739
(audience laughing)

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.273
- Yeah, yeah.

00:04:19.273 --> 00:04:21.368
- Had I not already told you

00:04:21.368 --> 00:04:22.765
that I never want to talk to you again?

00:04:22.765 --> 00:04:24.002
- Yes, that was the thing.

00:04:24.002 --> 00:04:25.610
- [Ari] And please stay
away from me forever?

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.259
- Okay but we're friends still, right?

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:28.805
He never said, "We're not friends?"

00:04:28.805 --> 00:04:29.773
(audience laughing)

00:04:29.773 --> 00:04:31.073
- Wait!

00:04:31.073 --> 00:04:32.975
- "I don't ever want
to talk to you again!"

00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:34.621
But we're still buddies?

00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:37.033
- No he was saying he didn't
want to talk to you anymore

00:04:37.033 --> 00:04:39.249
and you kept trying to defend yourself.

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.662
- I go, "Hey, let's talk."

00:04:40.662 --> 00:04:42.351
And you were like, "I don't
ever want to talk to you again."

00:04:42.351 --> 00:04:43.311
- No, no, no, no, no.

00:04:43.311 --> 00:04:46.762
You said this in that fucking
Bobby Lee way, you go.

00:04:46.762 --> 00:04:48.167
"Can I just tell you one thing?

00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:50.307
(audience laughing)

00:04:50.307 --> 00:04:51.367
"Can I just tell you one thing?"

00:04:51.367 --> 00:04:52.689
- "Can I just tell you one thing?"

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:54.697
- "Can I just tell you one thing?"

00:04:54.697 --> 00:04:55.919
- [Steve] "Can I just tell you one thing?"

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:57.150
- [Ari] And I fucking hated you.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.184
(audience laughing)

00:04:58.184 --> 00:04:59.228
- Alright.

00:04:59.228 --> 00:05:03.347
- So Ari, I saw his eyes
roll in the back of his head

00:05:03.347 --> 00:05:05.319
and he could not tell him one more thing.

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.803
Cause Ari turned around with a closed fist

00:05:07.803 --> 00:05:10.359
and hit Bobby so hard in the head

00:05:10.359 --> 00:05:12.606
that I just watched
him go out of my frame,

00:05:12.606 --> 00:05:13.998
down to the ground.

00:05:13.998 --> 00:05:15.543
- Yes, now.

00:05:15.543 --> 00:05:18.619
Now, I'm kinda blacked out.

00:05:18.619 --> 00:05:20.621
You know how you get hit,
and you see this, zzzzzz?

00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:21.577
That's what happens.

00:05:21.577 --> 00:05:23.229
Zzzzzz, right?

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.869
And every time I'd open my eyes,

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:26.373
I'd see a foot coming to my face.

00:05:26.373 --> 00:05:28.364
- I kicked, I kicked him a lot,

00:05:28.364 --> 00:05:29.683
I kicked him a lot.
- Zzzz, foot!

00:05:29.683 --> 00:05:30.600
Zzzz, foot.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.785
Now this fucker.

00:05:33.785 --> 00:05:34.797
- No, no, no, let me.

00:05:34.797 --> 00:05:36.604
So I stick my head out of the booth to see

00:05:36.604 --> 00:05:38.365
what's happening down here?

00:05:38.365 --> 00:05:39.311
- And what did you see?

00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:40.777
Bobby, like a potato bug, curled up.

00:05:40.777 --> 00:05:41.610
- Bam!

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.443
Bam!

00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:43.546
And Ari just laying haymakers down.

00:05:43.546 --> 00:05:45.058
And now I have a decision to make.

00:05:45.058 --> 00:05:46.315
These are my two friends fighting.

00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:49.501
I could break this up and go
through this tiny little window

00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:52.397
and break this up or I could
take the long way around.

00:05:52.397 --> 00:05:55.970
All the way around
outside and see what I see

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.932
when I get out there.

00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:58.017
So I take the long way--
- If you speed walk,

00:05:58.017 --> 00:06:00.633
if you speed walk around that corner,

00:06:00.633 --> 00:06:02.125
it takes 10 seconds.

00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:03.115
- Tops.

00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:04.087
- Tops.

00:06:04.087 --> 00:06:05.898
It took five fucking minutes.

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:06.899
(audience laughing)

00:06:06.899 --> 00:06:08.615
- He watched for awhile,
he did watch for awhile.

00:06:08.615 --> 00:06:10.018
I remember turning back, thinking like,

00:06:10.018 --> 00:06:11.007
"Is Steve gonna break this up?

00:06:11.007 --> 00:06:12.266
(audience laughing)

00:06:12.266 --> 00:06:15.358
"I guess not, I guess it's my time."

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:16.450
- No because when I came out,

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:18.828
Ari was just like DeNiro windmill kicking.

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:19.970
(laughing)

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:20.812
Bam!

00:06:20.812 --> 00:06:21.811
Bam!

00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:23.210
And, at this point--

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.752
- He didn't fight back,
it was so unrewarding.

00:06:24.752 --> 00:06:26.071
He didn't fight back!

00:06:26.071 --> 00:06:29.794
- We are still running a
professional comedy show.

00:06:29.794 --> 00:06:33.353
There's a man performing
comedy inside for 11 people,

00:06:33.353 --> 00:06:36.081
and that man has no idea
what's happening outside.

00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:38.018
So, at that point, he goes,

00:06:38.018 --> 00:06:41.144
"Ladies and Gentlemen, the
next comedian, Mr. Bobby Lee."

00:06:41.144 --> 00:06:42.252
- And what do I do, what do I do?

00:06:42.252 --> 00:06:44.139
- Pops up, runs into the room,

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:46.641
on stage like nothing has happened.

00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:47.666
(audience laughing)

00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:48.649
- Do you know why?

00:06:48.649 --> 00:06:49.759
I'm a fucking professional.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:51.448
(audience applauding)

00:06:51.448 --> 00:06:53.126
I'm a fucking professional.

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:54.108
- You gotta do your spot.

00:06:54.108 --> 00:06:55.072
(audience laughing)

00:06:55.072 --> 00:06:56.076
You gotta do your spot.

00:06:56.076 --> 00:06:58.288
- You gotta do your spot, man.

00:06:58.288 --> 00:06:59.938
- You had a mouse under your eye,

00:06:59.938 --> 00:07:01.587
he was bleeding on stage.

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:02.614
People were staring.

00:07:02.614 --> 00:07:03.585
And at one point--

00:07:03.585 --> 00:07:04.543
- It was getting worse, you
say it was getting worse

00:07:04.543 --> 00:07:05.536
as he was up there.

00:07:05.536 --> 00:07:07.268
- His eye started swelling up.

00:07:07.268 --> 00:07:08.984
(audience laughing)

00:07:08.984 --> 00:07:12.247
Alright, so may I say something now?

00:07:12.247 --> 00:07:13.196
- Sure, sure.

00:07:13.196 --> 00:07:14.163
- May I say something?

00:07:14.163 --> 00:07:15.131
- Bobby Lee, yes.

00:07:15.131 --> 00:07:16.816
- So you know when you go
through an experience like that,

00:07:16.816 --> 00:07:18.246
you think it's over right?

00:07:18.246 --> 00:07:19.620
No.
- Was it over?

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.022
- Oh, no.

00:07:21.022 --> 00:07:23.315
Cause a week later, he
tried to choke me to death.

00:07:23.315 --> 00:07:24.550
(audience laughing)

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:25.545
- [Ari] No, no.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:27.010
- Shut the fuck up for, okay go ahead.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.590
- I had my hand on your throat,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:31.134
and then you moved forward.

00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:34.674
Just for control, I like, Darth Vader,

00:07:34.674 --> 00:07:37.211
but I actually had to touch
you, I was just like, "No."

00:07:37.211 --> 00:07:38.641
- And then a week later what happened?

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:39.615
After that.

00:07:39.615 --> 00:07:40.961
So he attacked me twice, third week,

00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:42.154
now tell me what happened?

00:07:42.154 --> 00:07:46.657
- I had gotten a job on
the show Mind of Mencia,

00:07:46.657 --> 00:07:48.199
and I got a part, and then--

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:49.164
- Uck.

00:07:49.164 --> 00:07:50.208
- Yeah, right I did that before.

00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:52.572
And then like a few days
later I didn't have the part

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.899
anymore and I heard from
around the Comedy Store,

00:07:54.899 --> 00:07:56.476
Dave Mishevitz and all these people said,

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.597
"I heard Bobby called his
friend Mencia and got you

00:07:58.597 --> 00:08:00.853
"taken off the job."
- Bam!

00:08:00.853 --> 00:08:02.060
- Can I tell you the story?

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.009
- Yes.

00:08:03.009 --> 00:08:04.174
- Don't ever point your
finger at me like that again.

00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:05.422
(audience laughing)

00:08:05.422 --> 00:08:08.459
Carlos calls me and goes,
"Hey, bro, I was on the road,

00:08:08.459 --> 00:08:10.024
"Ari auditioned for my show,

00:08:10.024 --> 00:08:12.171
"I didn't know the
producers gave him a job,

00:08:12.171 --> 00:08:13.871
"and then when I came back into town,

00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:15.160
"I realized he was doing it,
and I called him personally

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.315
"and said, 'You can't do the job.'"

00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:19.460
- Called me personally?

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.418
- Did he do that?

00:08:20.418 --> 00:08:21.364
- No, of course not.

00:08:21.364 --> 00:08:22.395
- Well that's what he
said, I never called him.

00:08:22.395 --> 00:08:24.929
Why would I know that you
were booked on the show?

00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:26.806
- Well maybe he said, "Ari's booked."

00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:27.768
- He never did that, right?

00:08:27.768 --> 00:08:28.601
So anyway.

00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:30.298
- But you were bragging
about that you did.

00:08:30.298 --> 00:08:31.159
- To who?

00:08:31.159 --> 00:08:32.127
- To everyone.

00:08:32.127 --> 00:08:33.261
- [Steve] All the people.

00:08:33.261 --> 00:08:35.115
- You love saying, "I got Ari fired.

00:08:35.115 --> 00:08:36.518
"Guess what, I won one.

00:08:36.518 --> 00:08:37.835
"One for the Korean."

00:08:37.835 --> 00:08:39.942
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:41.991
I did that, I did that.

00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:44.311
I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up.

00:08:44.311 --> 00:08:45.277
(audience laughing)

00:08:45.277 --> 00:08:46.418
- That is true.

00:08:46.418 --> 00:08:47.964
- I want one, too, thank you so much.

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:49.375
(audience laughing)

00:08:49.375 --> 00:08:50.625
My bad, my bad.

00:08:52.445 --> 00:08:54.602
So anyway, I'm in the parking lot, right.

00:08:54.602 --> 00:08:57.304
And I'm just walking, and all of a sudden,

00:08:57.304 --> 00:08:58.640
I'm on the ground again.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.314
Cause this is what you did.

00:09:00.314 --> 00:09:02.418
You went from behind
me, and just walked up,

00:09:02.418 --> 00:09:03.894
and went, bam!
- Bam!

00:09:03.894 --> 00:09:04.850
- Yeah you did.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:05.843
- You ran away, I chased after you.

00:09:05.843 --> 00:09:07.973
I was talking to Dave Mishevitz,

00:09:07.973 --> 00:09:09.786
and I saw you and I was like,
"Pardon me for one moment."

00:09:09.786 --> 00:09:10.762
(audience laughing)

00:09:10.762 --> 00:09:11.731
- Oh that's right, that's right.

00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:12.676
- "I have to take care of something."

00:09:12.676 --> 00:09:13.798
I had decided, "Next time
I see him I'm gonna beat

00:09:13.798 --> 00:09:14.713
"the fuck out of him."

00:09:14.713 --> 00:09:15.678
- So then this--

00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:18.203
- Then I ran, you saw, turn,
and you're like, "Uh oh."

00:09:18.203 --> 00:09:19.168
- Uh oh.

00:09:19.168 --> 00:09:20.307
- You've seen that look before.

00:09:20.307 --> 00:09:22.653
And then I remember, I couldn't reach you

00:09:22.653 --> 00:09:24.010
so I Superman punched.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:26.050
I remember leaping up and then got down.

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:27.063
- Yes.

00:09:27.063 --> 00:09:28.296
- And punched you.

00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:29.301
- In the face.

00:09:29.301 --> 00:09:30.134
- You did the potato bug again.

00:09:30.134 --> 00:09:30.967
- Yes.

00:09:30.967 --> 00:09:31.879
- And then I said,

00:09:31.879 --> 00:09:34.023
"This is going to happen
every time I see you."

00:09:34.023 --> 00:09:35.034
- That's right.

00:09:35.034 --> 00:09:36.083
(audience laughing)

00:09:36.083 --> 00:09:38.017
He did say that, he did
say that, he did say that.

00:09:38.017 --> 00:09:40.558
And I remember this, I
go to the office, right,

00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:41.603
now I'm gonna call the police.

00:09:41.603 --> 00:09:43.198
- Yeah, I got the advance warning.

00:09:43.198 --> 00:09:45.779
- Fuck you, Steve, focus.

00:09:45.779 --> 00:09:47.367
I'm about to call the police,
I'm dialing the number,

00:09:47.367 --> 00:09:48.415
you know what you did?

00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:49.248
You unplugged the phone.

00:09:49.248 --> 00:09:50.081
- Yeah I know.
- You know why?

00:09:50.081 --> 00:09:50.914
- Why?

00:09:50.914 --> 00:09:52.447
- You didn't want him to be
in prison for the weekend.

00:09:52.447 --> 00:09:53.280
Cause it was on a Friday.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.113
- [Steve] Oh yeah, it was a Friday.

00:09:54.113 --> 00:09:55.056
- Fuck you.

00:09:55.056 --> 00:09:56.033
- Why?

00:09:56.033 --> 00:09:56.995
He shouldn't have gone to jail for that.

00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:58.524
- He shoulda gone to jail
three, three times in a row

00:09:58.524 --> 00:09:59.498
he beat me up.

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:00.331
(audience laughing)

00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:02.081
I let two of them go.

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:05.555
Two beatings, I said, "Oh no."

00:10:05.555 --> 00:10:07.842
And then third one I had to do something.

00:10:07.842 --> 00:10:09.842
I was gonna fucking die.

00:10:10.699 --> 00:10:12.428
What are you talking about?

00:10:12.428 --> 00:10:14.948
- Steve told me to get
out of my apartment.

00:10:14.948 --> 00:10:15.936
- When you put it like that, yeah.

00:10:15.936 --> 00:10:16.899
- Yeah.

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:19.383
- Yeah that does seem fair.

00:10:19.383 --> 00:10:21.201
And then I didn't talk to you for awhile

00:10:21.201 --> 00:10:22.148
and every time I saw you--

00:10:22.148 --> 00:10:23.116
- Four years.

00:10:23.116 --> 00:10:25.176
- Four years, and every time
he'd be in a conversation,

00:10:25.176 --> 00:10:26.278
I would come up and be like,

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:27.730
"Oh, what's the liar telling you?

00:10:27.730 --> 00:10:29.062
"Are you lying to people?

00:10:29.062 --> 00:10:31.867
"Like you always do you dumb liar."

00:10:31.867 --> 00:10:32.962
- You know what you used to say,

00:10:32.962 --> 00:10:34.095
"You're dumb.

00:10:34.095 --> 00:10:35.563
"You're the dumbest Asian in the world."

00:10:35.563 --> 00:10:36.621
- I know it got to you.

00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:37.454
- "How do you survive?"

00:10:37.454 --> 00:10:38.344
Remember you saying that?

00:10:38.344 --> 00:10:40.902
"How do you survive in
the world, you're dumb?"

00:10:40.902 --> 00:10:42.448
And I'm talking to a
chick trying to get laid.

00:10:42.448 --> 00:10:43.508
Right, and I just go,

00:10:43.508 --> 00:10:45.449
"I'm dumb, I have to say
that or he'll beat me up."

00:10:45.449 --> 00:10:48.449
(audience laughing)

00:10:49.473 --> 00:10:51.090
Here's how we resolved it,

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.043
do you want to hear that, guys?

00:10:52.043 --> 00:10:54.341
(audience applauding)

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:55.738
One day I'm just watching TV,

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:58.505
and I get a phone call from Ari.

00:10:58.505 --> 00:11:02.059
And you just basically said,
"Let's just squash it."

00:11:02.059 --> 00:11:03.187
- Yeah.

00:11:03.187 --> 00:11:05.801
I saw you in the front of
the cover booth one day

00:11:05.801 --> 00:11:07.406
and you were talking to
a few friends of mine,

00:11:07.406 --> 00:11:09.280
people I knew but I didn't
have the energy to like,

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:12.250
go and like, embarrass you again.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:13.233
It takes a lot.
(laughing)

00:11:13.233 --> 00:11:15.790
You gotta like, "How am I
gonna get to him today?"

00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:18.065
And I was like, what am I doing?

00:11:18.065 --> 00:11:19.122
I'm hurting my own life.

00:11:19.122 --> 00:11:20.855
Just for the sake of this fucking feud

00:11:20.855 --> 00:11:22.806
that I don't even care about anymore.

00:11:22.806 --> 00:11:24.348
- But I didn't do anything.

00:11:24.348 --> 00:11:26.144
- I know, I know, I know, I know.

00:11:26.144 --> 00:11:28.165
- So I'm just glad that we're, you know.

00:11:28.165 --> 00:11:29.125
- Me too.

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:31.335
- I was mad at Natasha for
a very long time, Natasha.

00:11:31.335 --> 00:11:32.324
- Come here, Natasha.

00:11:32.324 --> 00:11:33.365
- Come up here, Natasha.

00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:35.017
- Give Natasha a round
of applause everybody.

00:11:35.017 --> 00:11:37.542
(audience applauding)

00:11:37.542 --> 00:11:38.579
- I don't know if we have a fourth mic.

00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:40.229
- I felt bad about calling her "she."

00:11:40.229 --> 00:11:43.445
- By the way, Ari, I'm sorry.

00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:46.158
(laughing)

00:11:46.158 --> 00:11:47.299
That was--

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:48.784
- I'll just use what I--

00:11:48.784 --> 00:11:49.997
(audience laughing)

00:11:49.997 --> 00:11:50.877
- Bobby, first of all,

00:11:50.877 --> 00:11:53.539
Bobby did not set me up with that guy.

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:55.872
But, Bobby, all of a sudden,

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.913
didn't make eye contact
with me for four years.

00:11:59.913 --> 00:12:01.578
- Do you know why, Natasha?

00:12:01.578 --> 00:12:02.559
- You never said anything.

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:04.254
And I'd see you at the
Improv and you'd look down.

00:12:04.254 --> 00:12:06.977
(laughing)

00:12:06.977 --> 00:12:08.810
And I'd be like, "Hi."

00:12:09.751 --> 00:12:10.751
- I'm sorry.

00:12:12.779 --> 00:12:14.452
- [Natasha] Did you tell
him, did you tell him?

00:12:14.452 --> 00:12:15.562
- Natasha, I'm a human
being, and I didn't know

00:12:15.562 --> 00:12:17.651
how to react, and I'm immature, right.

00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:19.740
And I didn't know how to treat you.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.586
Right, because I felt
like, I blamed it on you.

00:12:22.586 --> 00:12:24.176
This whole thing, and I apologize.

00:12:24.176 --> 00:12:26.290
- Can we say what happened to me, though,

00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:27.356
at the Comedy Store?

00:12:27.356 --> 00:12:28.545
- Oh yeah.
- Oh yes!

00:12:28.545 --> 00:12:32.595
- I'm sitting at the Comedy
Store like, a year later.

00:12:32.595 --> 00:12:33.845
With my friend.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.795
She gets up to go, and
then all of a sudden,

00:12:37.795 --> 00:12:39.964
someone pours a drink on my head.

00:12:39.964 --> 00:12:41.441
(audience laughing)

00:12:41.441 --> 00:12:42.423
- Yeah, I had a glass of ice water.

00:12:42.423 --> 00:12:43.298
- And then my friend--

00:12:43.298 --> 00:12:45.175
- With the ice still in,
I remember, the ice--

00:12:45.175 --> 00:12:46.331
- And then my friend comes back--

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:48.501
- He whipped it at her, in
her face, remember that?

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:49.452
You whipped.

00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:51.755
- And my friend comes
back from the bathroom

00:12:51.755 --> 00:12:52.802
and she's like,

00:12:52.802 --> 00:12:56.096
"Why does your ponytail
have no more volume?"

00:12:56.096 --> 00:12:57.598
(audience laughing)

00:12:57.598 --> 00:13:01.030
And I was like, "Cause Ari
just threw a drink on my head."

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.159
- I did the same thing, and I was like,

00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:03.275
real clear about it.
- And said,

00:13:03.275 --> 00:13:04.307
"You don't belong here."

00:13:04.307 --> 00:13:06.177
- No, that's not all I said.
- Oh!

00:13:06.177 --> 00:13:09.177
(audience laughing)

00:13:11.777 --> 00:13:13.445
I said, "You don't belong here, cunt."

00:13:13.445 --> 00:13:16.037
(audience booing)

00:13:16.037 --> 00:13:17.015
I remember saying that, and I'm sorry.

00:13:17.015 --> 00:13:19.071
- Is this comedy, this
feels like some kind of

00:13:19.071 --> 00:13:21.042
group therapy session.

00:13:21.042 --> 00:13:22.390
(audience laughing)

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.169
- Hey, let's wrap this
up with a group hug.

00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:27.336
(audience applauding)

00:13:29.916 --> 00:13:31.333
- [Audience] Aww!

00:13:33.113 --> 00:13:34.302
- That was a nice moment.

00:13:34.302 --> 00:13:37.746
- Also, Ari, I will say,
was very good in bed.

00:13:37.746 --> 00:13:40.659
(electronic hip hop music)

00:13:40.659 --> 00:13:41.979
- That was really nice of you,
you didn't have to do that,

00:13:41.979 --> 00:13:42.958
thank you.

00:13:42.958 --> 00:13:44.309
Steve Rannazzisi, everybody.

00:13:44.309 --> 00:13:45.556
Wasn't that a great story?

00:13:45.556 --> 00:13:49.519
And also, of course, Natasha
Leggero, Bobby Lee, and myself,

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:52.851
Ari Shaffir, for helping
him with the story.

00:13:52.851 --> 00:13:54.030
Thanks Bobby Lee for eventually

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.358
getting talked into doing it.

00:13:55.358 --> 00:13:56.306
That's the story.

00:13:56.306 --> 00:13:57.978
Last week I asked you
to leave your comments

00:13:57.978 --> 00:13:59.701
about places you would
live if you had to live

00:13:59.701 --> 00:14:00.790
anywhere in the world,

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:02.703
and here is a really cool one for that.

00:14:02.703 --> 00:14:03.887
Thank you.

00:14:03.887 --> 00:14:05.130
Next week, let's have some fun.

00:14:05.130 --> 00:14:06.770
Just leave who you think
is who you think is right,

00:14:06.770 --> 00:14:08.134
and who you think is wrong, and why,

00:14:08.134 --> 00:14:10.535
in the comments section of this video.

00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:12.717
Next week we have Jeff Dye
telling one of the greatest

00:14:12.717 --> 00:14:13.679
stories you'll ever hear.
