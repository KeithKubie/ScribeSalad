00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.790
you know there's one way to be rational

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:11.800
you know there's one way to be rational
 

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.800
you know there's one way to be rational
and there's a lot of way to be

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:13.810
and there's a lot of way to be
 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.540
and there's a lot of way to be
irrational and and that's part of the

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550
irrational and and that's part of the
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.100
irrational and and that's part of the
the issue with this field is that we

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110
the issue with this field is that we
 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.679
the issue with this field is that we
show many ways to be irrational but it's

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:22.689
show many ways to be irrational but it's
 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.710
show many ways to be irrational but it's
not just one system it involves a lot of

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720
not just one system it involves a lot of
 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.360
not just one system it involves a lot of
different things that come to play in

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:27.370
different things that come to play in
 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.970
different things that come to play in
different areas of our lives and the way

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980
different areas of our lives and the way
 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.189
different areas of our lives and the way
to to understand it and to think about

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:32.199
to to understand it and to think about
 

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.140
to to understand it and to think about
how we fight against them is to think

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.150
how we fight against them is to think
 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.030
how we fight against them is to think
about what particular irrationality is

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040
about what particular irrationality is
 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.400
about what particular irrationality is
working in each particular aspect of our

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410
working in each particular aspect of our
 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.910
working in each particular aspect of our
life whether it's emotion or relativity

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920
life whether it's emotion or relativity
 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.280
life whether it's emotion or relativity
or the influence of initial decisions or

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.290
or the influence of initial decisions or
 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.130
or the influence of initial decisions or
the row of expectations all of those can

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140
the row of expectations all of those can
 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.360
the row of expectations all of those can
have input on us and we have to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370
have input on us and we have to
 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.310
have input on us and we have to
understand exactly which irrational

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320
understand exactly which irrational
 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.560
understand exactly which irrational
forces are working in this particular

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570
forces are working in this particular
 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.930
forces are working in this particular
case

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940
 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.509
so so again it's it's I know it's

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519
so so again it's it's I know it's
 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.069
so so again it's it's I know it's
answered this factory but there's no

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079
answered this factory but there's no
 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.729
answered this factory but there's no
single silver bullet the kind of things

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739
single silver bullet the kind of things
 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.049
single silver bullet the kind of things
I'm hoping that people would get out of

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059
I'm hoping that people would get out of
 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.109
I'm hoping that people would get out of
the book is to recognize some early

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119
the book is to recognize some early
 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:09.940
the book is to recognize some early
warning signs for some of those things

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950
warning signs for some of those things
 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.010
warning signs for some of those things
so for example I have a chapter about

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020
so for example I have a chapter about
 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.499
so for example I have a chapter about
free that shows that when something is

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509
free that shows that when something is
 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.039
free that shows that when something is
for free we jump off on it too much and

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049
for free we jump off on it too much and
 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.990
for free we jump off on it too much and
in fact sometimes end up paying a high

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000
in fact sometimes end up paying a high
 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.330
in fact sometimes end up paying a high
price what can you do is a consequence

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340
price what can you do is a consequence
 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.980
price what can you do is a consequence
you can just slow down you can say I

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990
you can just slow down you can say I
 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.950
you can just slow down you can say I
know free is tempting but when I see it

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960
know free is tempting but when I see it
 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.149
know free is tempting but when I see it
in the future what they should be doing

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159
in the future what they should be doing
 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.980
in the future what they should be doing
is just slow down and think carefully

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990
is just slow down and think carefully
 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.690
is just slow down and think carefully
about whether this is the right thing or

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700
about whether this is the right thing or
 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.149
about whether this is the right thing or
the wrong thing it turns out that real

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159
the wrong thing it turns out that real
 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.919
the wrong thing it turns out that real
estate brokers can really change how we

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929
estate brokers can really change how we
 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.529
estate brokers can really change how we
view houses if they show us houses are

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539
view houses if they show us houses are
 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.630
view houses if they show us houses are
outside of our reach they might say look

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640
outside of our reach they might say look
 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.190

let's look at this house it's two

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200
let's look at this house it's two
 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.389
let's look at this house it's two
hundred thousand dollars more than what

you were planning to buy I don't think

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780
you were planning to buy I don't think
 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.649
you were planning to buy I don't think
you should buy but just have a look does

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659
you should buy but just have a look does
 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.380
you should buy but just have a look does
not just have a look seeing that would

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390
not just have a look seeing that would
 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.090
not just have a look seeing that would
change a reference price and the way we

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100
change a reference price and the way we
 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.730
change a reference price and the way we
think about houses don't let them show

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740
think about houses don't let them show
 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.710
think about houses don't let them show
you this house so so there's some

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720
you this house so so there's some
 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.840
you this house so so there's some
warning signs that we could get the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850
warning signs that we could get the
 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.059
warning signs that we could get the
other thing is there are some things we

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069
other thing is there are some things we
 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.150
other thing is there are some things we
can't help so have you ever gone hungry

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160
can't help so have you ever gone hungry
 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.710
can't help so have you ever gone hungry
to a supermarket and bought too much

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720
to a supermarket and bought too much
 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.410

food everybody does have you learned

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420
food everybody does have you learned

after one time never to repeat this

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190
after one time never to repeat this
 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.240
after one time never to repeat this
again nobody ever does what is the issue

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250
again nobody ever does what is the issue
 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.910
again nobody ever does what is the issue
here when emotion takes over hunger in

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920
here when emotion takes over hunger in
 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.390
here when emotion takes over hunger in
this case our stomach seems to grow with

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400
this case our stomach seems to grow with
 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.430
this case our stomach seems to grow with
it we seem to be very hungry and we

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440
it we seem to be very hungry and we
 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.890
it we seem to be very hungry and we
don't think this hunger will end so what

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900
don't think this hunger will end so what
 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.530
don't think this hunger will end so what
can we do when hunger takes over we will

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540
can we do when hunger takes over we will
 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.330
can we do when hunger takes over we will
become different people that are not

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340
become different people that are not
 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.750
become different people that are not
connected to our non aroused non

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760
connected to our non aroused non
 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.449
connected to our non aroused non
emotional self so what can we do we can

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459
emotional self so what can we do we can
 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.610
emotional self so what can we do we can
make a rule for ourselves we can say I

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620
make a rule for ourselves we can say I
 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.920
make a rule for ourselves we can say I
know I make this mistake and if these

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930
know I make this mistake and if these
 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.500
know I make this mistake and if these
emotions are aroused in me I will behave

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510
emotions are aroused in me I will behave
 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.140
emotions are aroused in me I will behave
badly so either go to the supermarket

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150
badly so either go to the supermarket
 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.530
badly so either go to the supermarket
never go hungry or make a list and never

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540
never go hungry or make a list and never
 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.220
never go hungry or make a list and never
never never deviate from the list
