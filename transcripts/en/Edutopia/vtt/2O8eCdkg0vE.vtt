00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:20.056
&gt;&gt;"Hey, is this the place where you
can get a job to make people sick?"

00:00:20.056 --> 00:00:21.536
And the guy's like, "Yeah."

00:00:22.096 --> 00:00:26.356
&gt;&gt;Students in Scott Comstock's
Scientific Communications class are

00:00:26.356 --> 00:00:30.446
critiquing the product of their
semester-long exploration of the role

00:00:30.446 --> 00:00:35.936
of bacteria in the health of soil.

00:00:36.046 --> 00:00:37.606
&gt;&gt;Okay, now I want feedback.

00:00:38.206 --> 00:00:40.236
&gt;&gt;I like how you asked for
a job to make people sick,

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:41.906
because you wouldn't
like normally think that.

00:00:41.976 --> 00:00:43.786
&gt;&gt;But since the bacteria
does that, it makes sense.

00:00:44.326 --> 00:00:48.236
&gt;&gt;Each student produced a unique
"Soil Superhero Pamphlet,"

00:00:48.496 --> 00:00:51.976
which integrated science,
art, history, math,

00:00:51.976 --> 00:00:53.866
language arts, and multi-media.

00:00:54.496 --> 00:00:56.156
A team of seventh grade teachers

00:00:56.156 --> 00:01:00.406
at King Middle School began planning
the project during a three-day

00:01:00.406 --> 00:01:01.156
summer session.

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:04.796
&gt;&gt;At the beginning of every
expedition, we usually look

00:01:04.796 --> 00:01:08.276
at District Calendar to see what
we're going to be doing for the fall.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.106
Then we start zooming in a little
bit on exactly what it looks

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:13.316
like from September
through say, December.

00:01:13.466 --> 00:01:16.056
And we X-out some days
we wouldn't be here.

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:19.056
And then we kind of, what I like
to call, maybe bracket the time

00:01:19.056 --> 00:01:21.626
of a kick-off, through
the culminating event,

00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:24.796
and the celebration
of the final product.

00:01:24.796 --> 00:01:27.956
&gt;&gt;This is where we start as a staff
is creating the model before we ask

00:01:27.956 --> 00:01:28.676
the kids to do it.

00:01:28.786 --> 00:01:32.786
So essentially we kind of run ahead
seven to nine weeks in advance

00:01:33.496 --> 00:01:35.666
and figure out what exactly
we're going to build.

00:01:36.356 --> 00:01:37.366
So here's a good example

00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:39.436
of an informational
pamphlet around bacteria.

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:41.766
There's like a science
piece around metabolism,

00:01:41.766 --> 00:01:43.356
and that's a science content piece.

00:01:43.766 --> 00:01:47.636
Here's a math piece around
size of their bacteria.

00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:51.386
This is a multi-media piece where
the kids have drawn their work,

00:01:51.536 --> 00:01:52.906
characters, text and background.

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:54.806
And then they would scan it and
then they would bring that in.

00:01:55.176 --> 00:01:57.386
So we did that first
to see how challenging

00:01:57.386 --> 00:01:59.546
that would be for the kids.

00:01:59.546 --> 00:02:01.066
&gt;&gt;Do we have some flexibility...

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:03.696
&gt;&gt;The scientists were all -- they
were like, "Oh, sure, we'll come.

00:02:03.886 --> 00:02:05.446
So they're all very
excited to do this."

00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:08.946
&gt;&gt;In Expeditionary Learning we
love to develop relationships

00:02:08.946 --> 00:02:12.856
between the students and community
members, because the excitement

00:02:12.856 --> 00:02:16.226
that it generates in the
students, deepens their learning,

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:18.476
and lengthens their retention.

00:02:18.476 --> 00:02:19.626
&gt;&gt;There's a word that
you might not know.

00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:20.676
The word is "soluble."

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:23.686
In other words, it's able
to be dissolved by water.

00:02:23.786 --> 00:02:26.426
&gt;&gt;Gail: Ruth contacted me and
says, "I want to do this thing

00:02:26.426 --> 00:02:27.816
with the kids about soil bacteria,

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:29.756
but I don't a lot about
microbiology."

00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:31.856
So we sat down over the summer,

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:33.956
and we probably talked
seven or eight hours.

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:36.746
And she read microbiology textbooks,

00:02:36.746 --> 00:02:40.006
and she did a lot of
learning on her part.

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:44.146
&gt;&gt;One of our ideas was to create
a comic to kind of jazz up

00:02:44.146 --> 00:02:46.926
and make bacteria colorful
and exciting for the kids.

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:51.576
But to also teach them the benefits
of bacteria in soil scientifically.

00:02:52.196 --> 00:02:54.266
And so we brought in an
expert, who showed them how

00:02:54.266 --> 00:02:56.756
to make something come alive
through illustrating it.

00:02:56.976 --> 00:03:03.286
&gt;&gt;Today, we're working with Annie
O'Brien, a comic book artist.

00:03:03.286 --> 00:03:08.906
And she's teaching us
how to make expressions.

00:03:08.906 --> 00:03:11.086
&gt;&gt;It can be a line.

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:12.926
&gt;&gt;And we learned how to draw
some eyes and some mouths,

00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:13.976
so we can make good
facial expressions.

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:17.316
&gt;&gt;And they would start storyboarding
out different ideas to start coming

00:03:17.316 --> 00:03:19.706
up with this little story
about habitat and setting.

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:22.586
So we're taking the content,
making it exciting for the kids,

00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:24.816
and having them make a mini-product

00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:28.416
like in a comic-like
situation on their laptops.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:30.696
If they're creating a
character for the comic life,

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:31.776
they'll do something like this.

00:03:31.946 --> 00:03:32.766
They'll black-line it.

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:35.026
they'll color it.

00:03:35.386 --> 00:03:36.446
They'll scan it.

00:03:36.446 --> 00:03:39.306
And then we'll pop it over here
into a folder called "Drawings."

00:03:39.726 --> 00:03:41.996
And then, here's their character,
and here's their situation.

00:03:42.256 --> 00:03:43.856
They can go over that
on the District server,

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.206
bring it back to their work
space on their desktops

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:49.116
and start to manipulate that.

00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:52.026
As we get so much digital
information in the computer,

00:03:52.026 --> 00:03:53.286
we have to start organizing.

00:03:53.286 --> 00:03:56.436
So typically, we'd have something
like this that we'd create,

00:03:56.686 --> 00:04:01.186
where we'd have a major folder, and
we'd have Social Studies, Science,

00:04:01.186 --> 00:04:04.476
Math folders in that, which would
house the Social Studies information,

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:05.456
the Science information.

00:04:05.696 --> 00:04:09.036
So when it was time to create the
product, we knew exactly where to go.

00:04:09.286 --> 00:04:11.976
&gt;&gt;Do you guys know how to get
to the King Middle website?

00:04:12.046 --> 00:04:15.456
&gt;&gt;It doesn't work well when you ask
kids to learn new technical skills

00:04:15.456 --> 00:04:17.596
at the same time you're
asking them to master content.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:21.636
So what we do is we scaffold
it so that we're asking them

00:04:21.636 --> 00:04:24.526
to learn a new set of
technical skills around content

00:04:24.526 --> 00:04:25.516
that isn't hard for them.

00:04:25.896 --> 00:04:28.566
We might ask them to produce
an organizational structure

00:04:28.566 --> 00:04:31.026
around shooting letters of
the alphabet in the building.

00:04:31.026 --> 00:04:32.626
It's content they already understand.

00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:36.546
Scott asked them to learn the file
structure that they're going to use

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:39.976
in their final product for their
expedition, well in advance

00:04:39.976 --> 00:04:41.686
of ever thinking about how bacteria

00:04:41.686 --> 00:04:43.566
and pamphlets are going
to be put together.

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:47.016
So it's a matter of being smart
about how you plan your teaching,

00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:49.676
scaffolding, collaborating
with your team members,

00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:51.886
and giving kids the confidence

00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:54.206
to build meaningful
products around deep content.

00:04:54.456 --> 00:04:57.316
&gt;&gt;And when I ask the other students
to move out, you're going to slide

00:04:57.316 --> 00:05:03.106
into their spot, open up and show
the scientists your particular piece

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:04.136
that you're working on improving.

00:05:05.726 --> 00:05:07.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: During the
Learning Expedition,

00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:11.616
students present their work and
get feedback from outside experts.

00:05:11.616 --> 00:05:14.276
&gt;&gt;Okay, a de-nitrifier is a superstar

00:05:14.316 --> 00:05:17.656
when bacteria collect organic
nitrogen formed in the biosphere.

00:05:17.656 --> 00:05:18.336
That's correct.

00:05:18.806 --> 00:05:22.126
And then it breaks the
compound down to decompose it.

00:05:22.186 --> 00:05:23.766
I like how you're breaking
the sentences up

00:05:23.766 --> 00:05:25.506
and making it really
easy to understand.

00:05:26.316 --> 00:05:30.006
&gt;&gt;As part of a culminating event,
students distribute their pamphlets

00:05:30.006 --> 00:05:32.946
to local garden centers,
universities,

00:05:32.946 --> 00:05:34.496
and at the main Flower Show.

00:05:35.006 --> 00:05:38.056
&gt;&gt;There's assessment embedded in
everything that we do all along.

00:05:38.326 --> 00:05:42.376
But that final product is out there,
and it's going to be celebrated

00:05:42.376 --> 00:05:44.286
and it's going shared
with the community.

00:05:44.996 --> 00:05:45.716
And it's exciting.

00:05:45.946 --> 00:05:47.656
You know, we get to
hold the kids to that.

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:49.576
We get to hold ourselves to that.

00:05:49.576 --> 00:05:52.986
And someone said once, "If it's
worth doing, it's worth doing well."

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:56.216
And that's kind of our
thoughts around that.

00:05:56.216 --> 00:05:58.076
&gt;&gt;Grammar, spelling, punctuation.

00:05:58.186 --> 00:05:59.956
We'll just think about those things.

00:05:59.956 --> 00:06:01.456
And thank you very much, Kaeleigh.

00:06:01.456 --> 00:06:01.556
[applause]
