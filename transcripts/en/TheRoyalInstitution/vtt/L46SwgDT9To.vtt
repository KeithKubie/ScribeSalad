00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.180
Time seems to flow.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.450
It has a single direction, moving through
us, pulling the future into the past.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.539
British Astronomer Arthur Eddington, described
this process as 'time’s arrow',

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:22.760
and it is this asymmetrical movement of time
that drives the evolution of our universe,

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:27.560
from its origin in the big bang to its predicted
demise.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.320
We use the second law of thermodynamics to
describe this process.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.050
Entropy, which we might call the level of
chaos or disorder,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.579
has been constantly increasing throughout
the universe since the big bang.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.140
That is to say that the universe is acting
to equalsise the distribution of mass and

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.130
energy,

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.480
and though this process it has driven the
birth of stars,

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.810
the formation of galaxies and the chemical
reactions that gave rise to life.

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:59.989
But it also brings with it death and decay.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.039
But what if this wasn’t the case?

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.049
Well the universe as we know it could not
exist.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.520
Without Time’s Arrow, there could be no
stars, no galaxies, and no life.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.509
And at the same time there would be no death,
and no decay.

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.689
The movement of mass and energy that sustain
these could not take place.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.270
And therefore entropy and its description
in the second law is interesting

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.389
because it helps us distinguish the past from
the future, it provides direction for time’s

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:38.950
arrow.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.890
As the limited amount of energy in the universe
continues to disperse,

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.259
it’s predicted that it will eventually reach
equilibrium:

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.459
A perfect distribution in which there is no
free energy,

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:53.669
nothing available for stars, no chemical reactions
and no life.

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:58.649
The universe as we know it will become profoundly
quiet.

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.200
So make the most of it...

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.579
While it lasts.
