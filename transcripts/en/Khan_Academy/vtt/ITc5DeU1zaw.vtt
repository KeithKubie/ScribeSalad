00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.030
We're on problem 96.

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:17.310
It says 1/2 plus, open brackets,
2/3 times 3/8

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.460
divided by 4 minus 9/16.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.570
Do you know order of operations,
and can you deal

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.510
with fractions?

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.380
2/3 times 3/8, the 3's cancel
out, and the 2 and the 8

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.610
become 1/4.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:43.910
1/4 divided by 4, let me write
this, 1/2 plus 1/4 divided by

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:50.300
4, that's the same thing as
times 1/4, minus 9 over 16.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.990
So that is equal to 1/2
plus 1/16 minus 9/16.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.080
And now it doesn't matter what
order we do it in, but since

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.980
everything's in 1/16ths, so let
me write this in 1/16ths.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.780
So this is 8/16 plus
1/16 minus 9/16.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.430
So that's equal to 8 plus 1
minus 9 all over that 16.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.480
That's 9 minus 9,
that equals 0.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.960
Choice E, all that
work to get to 0.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.630
Next problem, 97.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.560
Water consists of hydrogen and
oxygen, and the approximate

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:39.890
ratio by mass of hydrogen to
oxygen is equal to 2:16.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.230
Approximately how many grams
of oxygen are there in 144

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.100
grams of water?

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.000
OK, 144 grams of water, that
means that the oxygen and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.020
hydrogen is equal to 144.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.420
They say 144 grams of water,
not when you have

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.120
144 grams of hydrogen.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.860
So when you add these together,
you have 144.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.340
And then they tell us that
the ratio of hydrogen

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.450
to oxygen is 2:16.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.060
Or another way to write it,
you can say hydrogen over

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.230
oxygen is equal to 2/16, which
is another way of saying 1/8.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.780
And they want to know how many
grams of oxygen, so we want to

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.740
solve for oxygen, so we want
to substitute for hydrogen.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.720
So we could say hydrogen is
equal to 1/8th the oxygen.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.940
I just multiplied both
sides times oxygen.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.630
So if hydrogen is equal to 1/8
oxygen, you have oxygen plus

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.060
1/8 oxygen, let me make
sure that's right.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:47.680
Yeah, hydrogen to oxygen
is equal to 144.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.275
And if you view this as 8/8, 1
oxygen is the same thing as

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:55.800
8/8, so you get 9/8 oxygen
is equal to 144.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:03.430
So you get oxygen is equal
to 144 times 8 over 9.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.662
Does 9 go into 144?

00:03:05.662 --> 00:03:08.610
I think it should, let me see
how many times does 9-- 3

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:09.540
definitely does.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:18.420
This is 12 times 12, so 3 will
go into 144 48 times.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.370
9 goes into 144 1,
9, 54, 16 times.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.290
So this is equal to 16 times
8 over 1, which is what?

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.650
That's equal to 250-- no,
that can't be right.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:51.670
No, you can't have more grams of
oxygen than you do-- let me

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.490
see, I've made a mistake
someplace.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.080
Hydrogen to oxygen is equal
to 2:16, which is 1:8.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.250
Oxygen plus hydrogen is equal
to 144, you get 9/8.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.730
Oh, I see my mistake.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:10.290
That's good.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.915
I've been making a lot of
careless mistakes, maybe I

00:04:11.915 --> 00:04:17.450
need to take a rest. 9/8 oxygen
is equal to 144, so

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.570
oxygen is equal to 144 times
9 over 8-- sorry,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.400
times 8 over 9.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.010
I was doing it right, so
where was my mistake?

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.700
So 144 times 8 over 9, that's
equal to-- oh, I just made a

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.510
mistake at the very last step.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.510
9 goes into 144 16 times.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.620
16 times 8 isn't
256, it's 128.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.790
That was my mistake.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:49.865
So there's 128 grams
of oxygen.

00:04:49.865 --> 00:04:53.290
I just made a mistake right
at that last step.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:54.650
All right.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.010
And that's choice D.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.960
Question 98.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:11.670
If x times 2x plus 1 is equal
to 0, and they also tell us

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:23.250
that x plus 1/2 times 2x minus
3 is equal to 0, then x is

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.620
equal to what?

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.010
So this is interesting.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.580
x times 2x plus 1 is equal to 0,
that means that either x or

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.380
2x plus 1 has to
be equal to 0.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.410
So one of these has
to be equal to 0.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:39.310
But then x plus 1/2 times 2x
plus 3, this tell us that one

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:40.870
of these have to
be equal to 0.

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.860
So if x is equal to 0, then this
has to be the one that's

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:44.530
equal to 0.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:48.170
So either this and that
is equal to zero,

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:51.460
or-- do you see that?

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.070
Well I guess both of these
could be equal to 0.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.950
Let me multiply them out.

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.320
Maybe I'm going down
the wrong path.

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.610
If I multiply these out,
I get 2x squared plus

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.306
2 is equal to 0.

00:06:05.306 --> 00:06:08.600
If I multiply these out, I get
x times 2x, which is 2x

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:14.070
squared, x times minus 3
minus 3x, 1/2 times 2x,

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.400
so it's plus x.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.310
And then 1/2 times minus
3 minus 3/2 is equal

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.790
to 0, so I get what?

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:29.675
2x squared minus 2x.

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:40.290
3x plus x is minus 2x, minus
3/2 is equal to 0.

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.430
Actually I think I made a
mistake, x times 2x plus 1,

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:43.700
that's not right.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:51.440
That's 2x squared plus
x is equal to 0.

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.300
Fair enough.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:58.970
We know 2x squared, so we can
just write that 2x squared is

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:02.340
equal to minus x, and
then substitute this

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:03.260
information in here.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.900
So we get minus x, 2x squared
is equal to minus x.

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:13.710
Minus x minus 2x minus
3/2 is equal to 0.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:20.820
So you get minus 3x, let's
add 3/2 to both

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.040
sides, is equal to 3/2.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:27.700
And then divide both sides by
minus 3, you get x is equal to

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:33.960
3/2 times minus 1/3, so that
equal to minus 1/2.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:35.420
And that is choice B.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:46.470
Next problem, 99.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.820
On a scale that measures the
intensity of a certain

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:56.650
phenomenon, a reading of n
plus 1 corresponds to an

00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.550
intensity that is 10 times the
intensity corresponding to a

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:01.620
reading of n.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.540
So n plus 1 is equal
to 10 times the

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.580
reading of just an n.

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.800
On that scale, the intensity
corresponding to a reading of

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:15.530
8 is how many times as great as
the intensity corresponding

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:18.180
to reading of 3?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:21.580
So if you call a reading
of 3, I don't know,

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:22.620
let's call that a 1.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.430
A reading of 4 is going to be
10 times the reading of 3.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.390
A reading of 5 is going to
be 10 times that, so 100.

00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:34.760
A reading of 6 is going to be
10 times that, or 1,000.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.470
A reading of 7 is going to be
10 times that, or 10,000.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:43.100
And then a reading of 8 would be
10 times that, so it would

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:48.610
be 100,000.

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.510
Which is not one
of the choices.

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.450
Let me make sure I'm
reading that.

00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:53.790
On a scale that measures the
intensity of certain

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.690
phenomenon, a reading of n
plus 1 corresponds to an

00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:59.670
intensity that is 10 times the
intensity corresponding to a

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.750
reading of n.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:04.970
So a reading of 4 is 10 times
the intensity of a reading of

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.290
3, and a reading of 5
is 10 times that.

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:08.820
Fine.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.690
On that scale, the intensity
corresponding to a reading of

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:18.440
8 is how many times as great as
the intensity corresponding

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.250
to a reading of 3?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.220
A reading of 4 would be 10 times
as great, a reading of 5

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.320
would be 100 times as great, a
reading of 6 would be 1,000

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.570
times as great.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:40.240
Oh yeah, 100,000, which
is 10 to the fifth.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.360
10 to the fifth power.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:45.140
Five 0's, so that is choice C.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.640
Confusing myself unnecessarily,

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.090
and I'm out of time.

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:50.070
See you in the next video.

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:52.990
Let me stop this one.
