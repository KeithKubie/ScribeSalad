00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.190
A 3D virtual world has three major components: objects, lights and cameras.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.310
This unit is going to explore lights. The next, cameras. These components are

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.780
on opposite ends of the rendering process. Photons are generated at light

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.347
sources and the photons that reach the camera are what form the image. The

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:18.709
objects in the scene are what ties these two ends of the process together.
