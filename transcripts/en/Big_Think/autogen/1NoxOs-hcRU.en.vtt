00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.370
we've talked about things that are

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380
we've talked about things that are
 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.349
we've talked about things that are
invisible so bacteria are basically

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359
invisible so bacteria are basically
 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.740
invisible so bacteria are basically
invisible to our eyes and yet were

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750
invisible to our eyes and yet were
 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.390
invisible to our eyes and yet were
covered with them they're on us they're

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
covered with them they're on us they're
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.049
covered with them they're on us they're
in us they're everywhere and scientists

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059
in us they're everywhere and scientists
 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.210
in us they're everywhere and scientists
have known about bacteria for almost 400

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220
have known about bacteria for almost 400
 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.390
have known about bacteria for almost 400
years and what bacteria are are these

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
years and what bacteria are are these
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.820
years and what bacteria are are these
primitive single celled organisms but

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830
primitive single celled organisms but
 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.820
primitive single celled organisms but
the way that they grow is they just grow

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830
the way that they grow is they just grow
 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.800
the way that they grow is they just grow
twice their size they cut themselves

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
twice their size they cut themselves
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.259
twice their size they cut themselves
down in the middle and then one becomes

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269
down in the middle and then one becomes
 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.160
down in the middle and then one becomes
two and so for all of these 400 years

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170
two and so for all of these 400 years
 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.150
two and so for all of these 400 years
everyone has thought that these bacteria

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160
everyone has thought that these bacteria
 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.190
everyone has thought that these bacteria
are so primitive that they're just out

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
are so primitive that they're just out
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.720
are so primitive that they're just out
there acting like these little asocial

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
there acting like these little asocial
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.959
there acting like these little asocial
organisms but what we thought about and

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
organisms but what we thought about and
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.459
organisms but what we thought about and
think about now is that there's no

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469
think about now is that there's no
 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.110
think about now is that there's no
possibility that a bacteria could

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
possibility that a bacteria could
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.150
possibility that a bacteria could
accomplish all the things they managed

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160
accomplish all the things they managed
 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.770
accomplish all the things they managed
you most like making us sick i mean lots

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
you most like making us sick i mean lots
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.720
you most like making us sick i mean lots
of terrible things but also lots of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
of terrible things but also lots of
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.000
of terrible things but also lots of
wonderful things if they're just acting

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
wonderful things if they're just acting
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.650
wonderful things if they're just acting
as these little individuals because they

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660
as these little individuals because they
 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.000
as these little individuals because they
couldn't have an influence on the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
couldn't have an influence on the
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.400
couldn't have an influence on the
environment and so what we've shown and

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410
environment and so what we've shown and
 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410
environment and so what we've shown and
what quorum sensing is is that bacteria

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420
what quorum sensing is is that bacteria
 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.990
what quorum sensing is is that bacteria
make and release tiny little molecules

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
make and release tiny little molecules
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.670
make and release tiny little molecules
that you can think of like hormones and

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
that you can think of like hormones and
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.039
that you can think of like hormones and
so as the cells grow in numbers these

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049
so as the cells grow in numbers these
 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.140
so as the cells grow in numbers these
molecules grow on the outside of the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
molecules grow on the outside of the
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.420
molecules grow on the outside of the
cells and when the molecules hit a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
cells and when the molecules hit a
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.730
cells and when the molecules hit a
certain amount which is proportional to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740
certain amount which is proportional to
 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.070
certain amount which is proportional to
cell number the bacteria detect that

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
cell number the bacteria detect that
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.870
cell number the bacteria detect that
those molecules are there so it's a way

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880
those molecules are there so it's a way
 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.270
those molecules are there so it's a way
of counting neighbors and then all the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280
of counting neighbors and then all the
 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820
of counting neighbors and then all the
bacteria change their their behavior in

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830
bacteria change their their behavior in
 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.100
bacteria change their their behavior in
unison and so they start carrying out

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110
unison and so they start carrying out
 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.130
unison and so they start carrying out
tasks as enormous groups instead of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140
tasks as enormous groups instead of
 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.410
tasks as enormous groups instead of
trying to accomplish these tasks as

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
trying to accomplish these tasks as
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.690
trying to accomplish these tasks as
individuals and I mean so it's just like

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
individuals and I mean so it's just like
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.130
individuals and I mean so it's just like
what we do you know if you need to move

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
what we do you know if you need to move
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.469
what we do you know if you need to move
a piano from here to there you don't do

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
a piano from here to there you don't do
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.999
a piano from here to there you don't do
it yourself you wait you get all your

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009
it yourself you wait you get all your
 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.260
it yourself you wait you get all your
friends and then you go one two three

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270
friends and then you go one two three
 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.170
friends and then you go one two three
and everybody does it together and so so

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180
and everybody does it together and so so
 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.639
and everybody does it together and so so
we call it quorum sensing so they sort

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
we call it quorum sensing so they sort
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.039
we call it quorum sensing so they sort
of vote with these chemical votes they

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049
of vote with these chemical votes they
 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.649
of vote with these chemical votes they
count the vote and then they say we have

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
count the vote and then they say we have
 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.660
count the vote and then they say we have
enough to do it and then they do it

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670
enough to do it and then they do it
 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.540
enough to do it and then they do it
whatever it is
