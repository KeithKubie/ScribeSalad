00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.190
Good morning,
Board of Directors.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.220
As all of you know,
from 2000 to 2007,

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:18.020
the US lost four million
acres in cultural land

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.870
to development.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.155
It is really the size
of Massachusetts.

00:00:21.155 --> 00:00:23.890
And although there are
federal policies targeted

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.290
to combat this loss
of farmland, they

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:28.300
are not nearly enough to
deal with this problem

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.780
we have here at home.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.610
And so I'll speak
about three things.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.125
Firstly, what I
intend to find out

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:36.100
on my upcoming trips to
EU, Japan, and Australia,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.290
who I intend to find out
this information from.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.960
Secondly, what opportunities
I see in these trips

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.610
for cross-contextual learning.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.380
And thirdly, what
challenges I anticipate

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.470
translating this learning
to ideas and strategies

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.680
that are really useful
for us here in the US.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.290
So firstly, in these
regions we intend

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.860
to focus on three critical
issues drawn from the problems

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.680
here at home.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.480
We termed the three Ps--

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.920
place, policies, and people.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.569
So firstly, this very strong
geographical notion of place

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:05.710
and a battle for it.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.210
The US is losing its
finest land to development,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.130
and we want to fight
out in these regions

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.370
how they view the trade-off
between development

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.890
and farmland protection,
or if it even exists

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.390
for them in the first place.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.850
Secondly, we want to find out
what policies these regions

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.900
have to combat the development
of farmland into other uses

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.606
and that impact on performance,
and thirdly, the people.

00:01:26.606 --> 00:01:28.480
We want to find out the
cultural institutions

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.857
the cultural mindsets to our
buttressing cases and policies,

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:33.940
essentially what the
stakeholders of these farming

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.310
communities are responding
to the policies that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.380
are being developed.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.630
So who do we intend to find
out this affirmation from?

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.890
We intend to look for
stakeholders' business

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.660
industry that are driving the
interaction between farmland

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.960
and development.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.540
And they will inform us most
about the issues of place.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.470
We also intend to talk to
the chairpersons and culture

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.990
committees in EU member states,
as well as officials in pockets

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.510
of every culture in
Japan, Australia,

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:00.720
to find out about their
experiences, that challenges,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.630
and their successes when
dealing with farmland protection

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.740
policies.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.630
We also plan to
look at the people

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.280
to whom these
effects of policies

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.290
are filtering down to the
members of the farming

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.240
community.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.890
Who through their
individually unique stories,

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.140
as opposed to just
policy memos and big data

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.110
will inform us most
about issues of people.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.910
We need these three
pieces together

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.400
to find out what was
intended, what is happening,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.770
and what it really should be.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.900
So the next idea I'll
would like to talk about

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.600
would be the why I want to
visit these three countries,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.880
what opportunities there are.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.050
Is it really necessary
and valuable endeavor?

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.350
And I would say yes because
these three regions are

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.340
similar enough to
the US to raise

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.490
the possibility of
opportunities for learning,

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.350
and yet different enough to
guarantee these opportunities

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.790
for learning.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.150
So the US the EU,
Japan, Australia,

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.740
they are like the US next
industrialized nations.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.776
If you look beyond the broad
similarities of wealth, power,

00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:57.400
development levels, inference,
a whole host differences appear.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.830
They are located in different
parts of the world--

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.694
the Western Hemisphere, Asia,
and the Southern Hemisphere--

00:03:02.694 --> 00:03:05.110
there are different geographies,
histories, neighborhoods,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.270
contexts, and ideologies.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.970
And these differences drive
cross-contextual learning

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.820
for two reasons.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:14.270
Firstly, they greatly
reduce the learning curve

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.270
for looking at the effects
of different policies

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.600
by providing a test bed with
exposed results as well.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.990
So instead of sitting up with
all of us debating the merits

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.610
and demerits of increased
intervention in farming

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.570
policies, we need
only look at Japan--

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.630
highest-producing support
levels among OECD countries,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.620
overly protective
subsidies that have

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.620
driven average annual
household income

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.280
levels 25% to 30% higher
than the national average

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.130
in Australia, the second
lowest producer support

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.720
levels of OECD
countries and where

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.020
a strong adherence to
market-oriented policies

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.280
has actually created a
different result from Japan.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.960
And secondly, these
countries also

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.060
provide us with different
ideas that we might not

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.404
have considered before.

00:03:56.404 --> 00:03:58.570
For example, the European
Union's common agriculture

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.740
policy contracts with
farmers for the provision

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.730
of ecological services, which is
alternative to the traditional

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.150
notion here in US where
farmland policy is essentially

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.450
meant to protect land
for productive purposes.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.580
So essentially, exposure
to these new ideas

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.410
would provide us
a bigger toolkit

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.970
to develop more
robust strategies

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.401
for farmland protection
here in the US.

00:04:21.401 --> 00:04:22.900
But with these
great opportunities

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.420
also come great challenges
in two forms, essentially--

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.010
differences in institutions
and differences in cultural.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.960
So differences in institutions
like political systems, laws--

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.850
they essentially make policies
not all but irrelevant

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.890
to the United States
in a certain vein.

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.350
In European Union, they
have a greater acceptance

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:44.110
of regional-international
treaties and conventions.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.610
And this has
implications for trying

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.920
to transplant policies across
the Atlantic and culture.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.220
We cannot underestimate the
influx of culture, history,

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.450
and policies.

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.620
For example, after
all, in Japan,

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.540
the reason for the high levels
of producer support can be

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.690
traced back to the memories
shortage that occurred after

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.270
World War II, something that
cannot be said of the US.

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.310
So what may be
popular in my country

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.450
may be wildly
unpopular in another.

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:09.915
So what we intend
to do on our trip

00:05:09.915 --> 00:05:13.290
is not to be transplanters of
these policies back to the US.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.516
We intend to be translators
where we take the spirit

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.015
and not let letter
of these policies

00:05:18.015 --> 00:05:20.431
and combine it with the our
understanding of the realities

00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:24.030
here in the US to develop
a selection of ideas

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.940
that circumvent differences
in institutions and account

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.680
for differences in culture.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.290
That said, even in the
US, the institutions

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.810
do change and cultures do
evolve [INAUDIBLE] at a much

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.950
lower rate.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:37.800
And even within a country,
cultures do vary very widely.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.380
So even ideas that
seem improbable for now

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.090
should not be discarded, but
kept for future reference

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.200
so whenever the time comes, we
are ready to implement them.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.890
So in conclusion, my trips
will have great [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.470
opportunities, but also
affront with challenges,

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.980
but an appreciation that points
that differences in countries

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:58.920
are the drivers of learning,
and not similarities, and also

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:01.940
an appreciation that
policy-learning observations

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.830
are just a start to create
a translation effort

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:07.570
should allow us to reap the
full benefits of our trips.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:09.870
Thank you for attending.
