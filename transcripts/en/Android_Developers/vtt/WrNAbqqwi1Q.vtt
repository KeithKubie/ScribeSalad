ROSS MCLACHLAN: All right.

00:00:01.573 --> 00:00:02.810
So hi, everyone.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.059
Let's start with a quick poll.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.040
How many people here
are user researchers?

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.540
Hand up.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.184
Got a couple.

00:00:08.184 --> 00:00:09.850
How many people here
come from companies

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:12.170
who have user researchers?

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.670
OK.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:13.753
There's a good few of you.

00:00:13.753 --> 00:00:14.705
That's nice.

00:00:14.705 --> 00:00:17.080
So I'm sure that you heard
earlier from some of the talks

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.120
today that improving
the quality of your app

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.850
is a really great way to boost
the star rating or your user

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.260
retention.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.630
Many to the earlier talks
today kind of spoke to that.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:27.671
You would have heard
Ricardo and Alexi talk about

00:00:27.671 --> 00:00:29.440
how app quality was
really important,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.200
and how you can use Android
Vitals to improve the quality

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.870
of your app after launch.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.620
But what I want to
talk to you about today

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.650
is the process that informs
all of that, the process that

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.419
helps you ship a high-quality
app in the first place.

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:43.210
So rather than kind of
going with your gut,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.370
and going to the market
hoping for the best,

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.050
this is about
using user research

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.150
to make sure that the
decisions you make

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.540
are as useful, objective,
and as sensible

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.580
as they possibly can be.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:56.612
So how do you do that?

00:00:56.612 --> 00:00:58.570
We all know that building
a product in a vacuum

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.403
is really not a great
way to create products

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:01.720
that users love.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.030
So as user researchers
on the Google Play team,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.630
it's our job to help the product
teams create experiences that

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.450
are useful, usable,
and desirable,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.802
or even magical for our users.

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:15.260
So what I want to
talk to you today

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.320
is about how to make
the research you're

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.300
doing impactful.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.190
And the real key to
doing impactful research

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.350
is not some silver
bullet method.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.000
It's not some
fancy piece of kit.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.180
It's not necessarily some
really complex process.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.100
The real key to doing
impactful research

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.370
is making sure you get the most
out of the research you do,

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.580
and making sure that that
research gets used in some way.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.040
So this talk is really just
about some insanely practical

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.350
methods and techniques
that will help you go away

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.880
and do better user research.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.234
And your product is going
to be better because of it.

00:01:45.234 --> 00:01:47.150
This is about whatever
you're doing right now,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.510
and making sure that
that investment pays off.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.820
If you get this right,
everything else gets easier.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.110
So how do you do
impactful research?

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.371
What is that?

00:01:58.371 --> 00:01:59.870
So I'm going to
share with you today

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.940
three mistakes that
we commonly see

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.450
people make when approaching
doing user research, and three

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.940
methods and techniques from
my experience as a researcher

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.940
on the Google Play team to
help you mitigate that risk

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.500
and to make the research
you do more impactful.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.950
So the mistakes-- using the
wrong methods at the wrong

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.160
time, separating the research
from the rest of the team,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.920
and asking the wrong questions--

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.860
have fairly
straightforward fixes.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.550
But fixing them will
help you maximize

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.910
the value of the research you
do and make the most of the data

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.200
you collect in order to
make better decisions.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.500
So-- mistake number one,
using the wrong methods

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.160
at the wrong time.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.905
So research is really just
about asking good questions.

00:02:40.905 --> 00:02:43.280
And depending on where you
are in the product life cycle,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.777
you probably have different
questions that need answered.

00:02:45.777 --> 00:02:47.110
That kind of makes sense, right?

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.800
So as your product
or feature evolves,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.800
so do the kind of questions
that you need to ask.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.360
But one mistake
we commonly see is

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.330
people trying to ask either the
same questions again and again

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.737
as their product
evolves, or trying

00:02:58.737 --> 00:03:01.070
to answer different questions
with the same methods that

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.720
really don't fit.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.520
So doing impactful
research is not just

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.209
about using impactful methods.

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.750
It's really about picking the
right methods for the questions

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.980
you have and asking the right
questions at the right time.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.295
So on my team, when we think
about doing user research,

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.420
we start by thinking
whereabouts in the development

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.500
process we are.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.090
And typically at a
high level, there's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.517
only really three questions
that we need to answer.

00:03:23.517 --> 00:03:24.850
The first one is, what to build?

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.570
The second one is,
how to build it?

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.540
And the third one
is, did we succeed?

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.700
And we call this strategic user
research, design user research,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.255
and value to user research.

00:03:39.255 --> 00:03:41.630
So each of these questions
has many, many, many different

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.070
method you can use, and
picking the right method

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.060
is going to help you maximize
how useful that answer is

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.952
to you.

00:03:47.952 --> 00:03:49.910
There's probably too many
methods at each stage

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.993
than I can cover in this
talk, but let me walk you

00:03:51.993 --> 00:03:54.210
through some of the stuff
that we do on Google Play,

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.570
highlighting the kind of
research we do at each stage.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.120
So the first question we do,
or the first question we ask,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.455
is what to build?

00:04:02.455 --> 00:04:04.405
And this is kind of
strategic user research.

00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:05.950
And really, the
goal here is to help

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.680
inform the product direction
and uncover new opportunities.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.800
So what kind of research
can you do at this stage?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.670
What methods can you do
to help you use this?

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.980
So one of our most
powerful tools for this,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.810
on both the developer side
and on the consumer side,

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.346
are what we call immersion
or observational studies.

00:04:24.346 --> 00:04:25.720
And this is really
just basically

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.127
watching people use
your product or feature,

00:04:28.127 --> 00:04:30.460
understanding what they're
doing, and really asking them

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.710
why they're doing what
they're doing already.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.660
The method is really
just watching your users

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.287
and asking them why.

00:04:36.287 --> 00:04:37.870
At this stage in the
process, the goal

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.170
is to discover things you don't
already know and to deep dive

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.990
into topics that really
matter to your users.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.120
Some of you may recognize
my colleague Phil here,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.280
who is a researcher on
the Play Console team.

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.465
He does a lot of these kind
of studies with developers.

00:04:52.465 --> 00:04:53.590
So what is the method here?

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.860
How do you make the most of
these observational studies?

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.870
It can really be as simple
as just sitting down

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.650
with a bunch of your users,
getting them to show you them

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.526
using your product or feature,
and just watching them do it,

00:05:05.526 --> 00:05:06.900
asking them why
they're doing it.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.358
But here's some
few techniques that

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:11.760
can help you make the most
out of those sessions.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.870
The first one is not to
ask leading questions.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.869
This is something we see
people do all the time.

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:18.284
And we invite sort of product
or eng into these sessions,

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:19.700
we see them asking
questions where

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.074
the answer that
they want to hear

00:05:21.074 --> 00:05:23.550
is kind of embedded in the
question that they're asking.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:24.841
So that's a really obvious one.

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:25.792
Don't do that.

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:27.250
The second one is
not really to ask

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.541
questions that can be answered
with a yes or no answer.

00:05:29.541 --> 00:05:32.170
This is something else that
we really commonly see.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.900
Do you want feature
A or B-- yes or no?

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.560
This is not great, as it really
doesn't get you very rich data.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.056
You get one data point.

00:05:39.056 --> 00:05:40.930
If you ask questions
that are more open-ended

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.340
and encourage your
users to talk,

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.151
you'll really get much
richer data out of them.

00:05:45.151 --> 00:05:46.840
And the last thing
that we see people do

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.000
is drawing attention
to specific things

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.186
that they really care about.

00:05:50.186 --> 00:05:52.810
This is bad as well, as it tends
to change users' behavior when

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.045
you're talking to them.

00:05:54.045 --> 00:05:55.420
So don't draw
attention to things

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.270
like features or a
particular interface elements

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.297
that you want to know about.

00:06:00.297 --> 00:06:02.380
You want to see if users
talk about them naturally

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.692
or see if they're
noticing them at all.

00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:07.150
So observing your
users in this way

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:10.120
and understanding why they're
doing what they're doing

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.030
is a really great way to
uncover new opportunities

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.550
and guide the strategic
direction of your product.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.635
So now you kind of have
an idea of what to build.

00:06:19.635 --> 00:06:21.804
The next question we
ask is how you build it.

00:06:21.804 --> 00:06:23.220
And this is the
stage where you're

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.840
trying to explore
design concepts

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.300
and trying to converge
somehow to an ideal solution.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.156
So what research methods
can you use here?

00:06:31.156 --> 00:06:33.780
So a method that we really like
that helps us support or design

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.000
solutions really quickly is
something that we call C-RITE.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.500
C-RITE is a version of
traditional rapid iterative

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.700
testing and evaluative
methodology,

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.190
but it ensures
cross-disciplinary

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.985
collaboration on planning
and executing the research.

00:06:47.985 --> 00:06:50.820
So C-RITE builds on a
traditional RITE methodology,

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:52.250
during which designs
are evaluated

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.900
in the agile,
user-centered framework.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.750
And in RITE studies,
multiple stakeholders

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.090
collaborate in order to
iteratively build and test

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.642
prototypes.

00:07:01.642 --> 00:07:03.600
But in these RITE studies,
stakeholders usually

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.040
have to commit to
maybe one or two

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.010
weeks of involvement,
which can be challenging.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.440
But C-RITE addresses this by
reducing the collaboration

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.510
effort to about 2
and 1/2 days a week.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.000
And in that time, design
problems are researched

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.730
and new ideas are designed
for and prototyped.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.700
With C-RITE you can
go from research

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.140
to new design in one
day, and key stakeholders

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:24.769
collaborate in all UX spaces.

00:07:24.769 --> 00:07:26.060
So what are the strengths here?

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.012
Why is this good?

00:07:27.012 --> 00:07:29.220
The first one is that you
get the entire team engaged

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:30.020
in the process.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.570
And I'm going to talk
about this some more later,

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.194
but that's a really
key thing to making

00:07:33.194 --> 00:07:35.100
your research you do useful.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.059
The second thing is it allows
really, really quick iteration.

00:07:38.059 --> 00:07:39.600
So the research
insights that you get

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.052
are used almost
immediately, which

00:07:41.052 --> 00:07:43.635
ensures that they're going to
be impactful down to the product

00:07:43.635 --> 00:07:45.420
that you're building.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.309
Stakeholders are highly
motivated with the opportunity

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:50.100
to express opinions
about what they've just

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.050
observed in the
research sessions, which

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.199
we find is a great kind
of motivator for people.

00:07:54.199 --> 00:07:55.740
And as the product
[? owner, ?] being

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.980
able to listen to and engage
in discussions with all

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:03.550
stakeholders really creates some
really rich design discussions.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.160
So the key here
with C-RITE is more

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.260
that the insights
are used immediately

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:09.220
and the whole team are
involved in the process.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.886
And that's a really
key thing for making

00:08:10.886 --> 00:08:14.094
this research you do impactful.

00:08:14.094 --> 00:08:16.010
So that's an example of
how you can figure out

00:08:16.010 --> 00:08:18.170
what to build and put
yourself in a good position

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:20.480
to know that you're
building the right thing.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.529
So the next question we
ask is, did we succeed?

00:08:23.529 --> 00:08:25.070
By this point in
the research, you're

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:27.066
probably in a great position.

00:08:27.066 --> 00:08:28.940
You're confident that
your product is serving

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.481
some kind of need,
and you've kind of

00:08:30.481 --> 00:08:33.380
ironed out all the usability
creases and [? have about ?]

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.700
all the usability issues
during C-RITE tests.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.117
So here you don't necessarily
need to do anything complex.

00:08:40.117 --> 00:08:41.658
You really just need
to pick whatever

00:08:41.658 --> 00:08:43.740
it is you measure and
care about, and measure

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.880
it to see if it's gone up.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.560
You're basically, well, in its
simplest form, you're basically

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.319
just asking, did we succeed?

00:08:50.319 --> 00:08:52.610
You can do this with your
analytics or engagement data.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.294
You can do this with
user satisfaction.

00:08:54.294 --> 00:08:56.210
And you're basically
just trying to understand

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:58.010
if users are engaged
with and satisfied

00:08:58.010 --> 00:09:01.560
with the product you built.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.990
So we covered a bunch of
different research methods

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.180
that you can use at each
stage in this process.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.770
And as I said before,
each method has,

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.570
or each question has
many different methods

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.850
that you can use, much
more than I have a chance

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.770
to cover in this talk.

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:14.311
But hopefully we
can kind of give you

00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:16.650
a flavor of how you can
use different research

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.820
methods at each stage.

00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:21.300
But the key here is that
picking the right methods

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.760
to use at the right
time will maximize

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.400
how useful the answer
is to you, and then

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.170
maximize the impact
that that research is

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.470
going to have on your product.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.620
Using the wrong method
at the wrong time

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.940
can make the research
you do more difficult.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:36.500
And the other key
thing with this

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:38.300
is the better job
you do answering each

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.150
of these questions successfully
reduces the amount of work

00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:42.567
you have to do at each stage.

00:09:42.567 --> 00:09:44.400
So if you do really
good strategic research,

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.830
you can go into
your design research

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:47.180
knowing that the
product you're building

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.320
is really serving a need.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.250
You do really good
design research,

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.874
you can go to market knowing
that the usability and design

00:09:52.874 --> 00:09:55.040
creases are all ironed out,
and then you really just

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.706
have to measure in
the evaluative stage.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:02.370
So mistake number two,
separating research

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.720
from the rest of the team.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.546
Among researchers, it's
common to hear research

00:10:07.546 --> 00:10:08.920
being treated as
a separate unit,

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.020
or detached from the rest
of the product and eng

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:13.750
teams, and in that case, for
the product and eng teams

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:16.760
to become disconnected from
the research that's happening.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.750
So in these kind
of situations, it's

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.570
kind of easy for the research
teams and product teams

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:25.360
to fall out of sync, and more
likely that the research that

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.866
gets done either isn't timely
or doesn't answer key questions.

00:10:29.866 --> 00:10:31.570
So the thing that
we do here is really

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.100
to try and make
the methods we use

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.930
as collaborative as possible.

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:36.880
You want your team
members to feel ownership

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.320
over the results.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.910
So good product
research isn't really

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.292
about an academic ivory tower.

00:10:41.292 --> 00:10:43.000
You don't want research
to feel like it's

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.420
being handed down from
above with the product team.

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:49.565
And collaboration is a huge part
of avoiding that disconnect.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:52.000
If you get people
involved in the research,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.500
the research will
be more valuable,

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:56.780
and then it's more
likely to be used.

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.260
So this is an example
picture of the Play Console

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.130
team on a sort of research
trip, research immersion

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:04.300
trip a couple of years ago.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.610
And here we have designer, eng,
eng, BD, product manager, BD,

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.210
eng, product manager and
researcher, all out together

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:15.460
on a trip going to visit
users, and to listen

00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:18.130
to their problems, and try to
figure out product strategy,

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:20.940
and decide where to go.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.930
So why is this good?

00:11:21.930 --> 00:11:25.230
Involving the team is really
valuable for multiple reasons.

00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:28.340
Not only did they get
a first-hand sense

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.500
of the insights, team members
get to meet face-to-face

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:32.550
with users.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.510
There's lots of
cross-functional collaboration,

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.718
which is really good for a
really good enhanced sense

00:11:36.718 --> 00:11:38.030
of team.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.110
So this is a quote from
one of the engineers

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.402
who participated in the study.

00:11:41.402 --> 00:11:43.860
So "these studies are great
and the feedback is invaluable.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:47.820
I hope we can set up some
continuous direct communication

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.369
with developers in addition
to these regular studies."

00:11:51.369 --> 00:11:53.160
We find that it's really
good for engineers

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.310
to be able to have first-hand
contact with their users

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:59.070
as well, as it really makes you
feel good knowing that you're

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:03.390
building something that's making
a difference to someone's life.

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:07.142
So we've covered when
to do research and some

00:12:07.142 --> 00:12:08.850
of the techniques you
can use to increase

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:11.280
the value of your
research every stage.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.080
So finally, I want to
share some techniques

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.230
that you can do to help
focus your research on topics

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:19.234
that you know are
going to be impactful.

00:12:19.234 --> 00:12:20.650
So as I said before,
good research

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.880
is really about
asking good questions.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.020
There's no point in asking the
same question again and again.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.854
There's no point
in asking questions

00:12:27.854 --> 00:12:29.770
that you don't necessarily
need the answer to.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.710
And there's no point in asking
too many questions, that you

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:36.019
collect too much data, that
then you can't action all of it.

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:38.560
So in the Play Console team,
and on the Play team in general,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.018
we have a whole
team of researchers

00:12:40.018 --> 00:12:41.200
that can help with this.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.940
We have experts in
trying to decide

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.550
what research needs to be
done and what doesn't, and how

00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:48.722
to decide which questions
are most valuable.

00:12:48.722 --> 00:12:50.180
And really, a key
thing if you want

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.513
to be able to do impactful
research, a really good thing

00:12:52.513 --> 00:12:54.310
to do is to hire good
user researchers.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.810
You're not going
to be able to learn

00:12:55.810 --> 00:12:57.310
how to code or
learn how to product

00:12:57.310 --> 00:12:59.780
manage from a 20-minute talk.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:03.040
But if you don't have that,
and you don't have a dedicated

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.660
resource, and you're
trying to decide

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.250
where you should invest in
research, how can you do that?

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.660
So a good way to
do this is to be

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.160
looking at the reviews analysis
section on the Google Play

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:14.380
Console.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.330
This is a great technique
to uncover topics

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:18.850
where you can improve your
app based on the star rating

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:21.390
or compared to your competitors.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:23.290
The topic analysis
itself won't tell you

00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.240
how to improve
something, but it will

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.400
let you guide the research
you do to areas where

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.752
you know you can have impact.

00:13:29.752 --> 00:13:31.210
So you can look
for areas where you

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.900
need to understand more, i.e.
why are lots of my bad reviews

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.486
associated with
the topic profile?

00:13:37.486 --> 00:13:38.860
You can find areas
where you want

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.657
to improve your star rating.

00:13:40.657 --> 00:13:42.490
And you can find areas
where you can improve

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:44.319
compared to your competitors.

00:13:44.319 --> 00:13:46.360
As I said, this is a great
way to direct research

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:50.524
to areas that can have
real impact to your app.

00:13:50.524 --> 00:13:51.440
So how do you do that?

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:55.150
So in this section, you can
see how users of your app

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.340
compare to a bunch
of common topics

00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:00.340
against most of the similar
apps in the same Play Store

00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:01.534
category as you.

00:14:01.534 --> 00:14:02.950
So these common
topics can include

00:14:02.950 --> 00:14:06.780
things like design, profile,
resource usage, speed, et

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:07.711
cetera.

00:14:07.711 --> 00:14:10.210
So I'm going to walk through a
few examples of how you might

00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:14.416
do research if you find
that these topics are having

00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:16.290
a negative effect on
your rating in some way.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.070
So as I discussed earlier,
taking deep dives into things

00:14:22.070 --> 00:14:24.200
that really matter
to your users is

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.714
one of the goals of
doing strategic research.

00:14:26.714 --> 00:14:28.130
So it's a great
time to understand

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:30.290
why certain topics,
if you don't know why,

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:32.690
are pulling down your rating.

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.490
So you can use some
of the reasons listed

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:37.460
in the reviews against
something like resource usage

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.890
or uninstalls to understand
why your users are

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:41.530
unhappy with those things.

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:44.930
The chances are if people
have wrote reviews about it,

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:46.430
there'll be something
that users who

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:50.090
participate in your research
will have opinions on as well.

00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.680
And the real key
here is to understand

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.980
what the expectations were,
and whether or not they

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:57.974
were met or unmet.

00:14:57.974 --> 00:14:59.890
For design and usability,
this is a great time

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:02.150
to use something
like C-RITE again.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.630
So you want to
explore design issues.

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.450
You want to explore usability
and explore new design

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:08.776
solutions.

00:15:08.776 --> 00:15:10.150
And again, you
can use the topics

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:11.650
mentioned in the
individual reviews

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.066
to help guide the
actual research.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.410
And then to deep dive
even further into topics

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.000
that are really
specific for your app,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.300
you can look at those
really detailed topics

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:24.732
that come out of your reviews.

00:15:24.732 --> 00:15:27.190
So you can use these as probes
in your research and reviews

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:29.410
to really understand
why users are talking

00:15:29.410 --> 00:15:31.000
about, really,
things that are very

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.810
particular to your own app.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:38.860
So what do I want you to
take away from this talk?

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:40.660
So doing impactful
research is not just

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.171
about some silver
bullet impactful method.

00:15:43.171 --> 00:15:44.920
It's really about
picking the right method

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.277
to use at the right time
in your development process

00:15:47.277 --> 00:15:49.360
to answer impactful questions
that are going to be

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.682
useful for your whole team.

00:15:51.682 --> 00:15:53.140
And as I said
before, if you really

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:54.910
want to invest in good
impactful research,

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:58.470
then it's really great to go
and find good user researchers

00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:59.749
to hire and join your team.

00:15:59.749 --> 00:16:00.790
We're really nice people.

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:02.890
It's really good, honestly.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:06.460
But if you can't do that, or
if you don't have enough user

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.037
research capacity
just now, I hope

00:16:08.037 --> 00:16:10.120
that you'll find the simple
methods and techniques

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.430
in this talk useful
for going away

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.210
to do research that can help you
make your product or app much

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.440
better.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.140
Thank you.
