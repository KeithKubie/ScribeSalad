00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:07.799
Do you have a friend or a sibling

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.277
that's always competing with you

00:00:09.277 --> 00:00:11.294
to see who's the fastest?

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.433
Our alien friends Bleebop and Mark

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:14.655
are having the same debate

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:16.348
with their custom-built rockets,

00:00:16.348 --> 00:00:17.438
and they've asked us

00:00:17.438 --> 00:00:20.188
to be the judge of a space race to their moon.

00:00:20.188 --> 00:00:22.017
The only problem is that they are starting

00:00:22.017 --> 00:00:23.648
from different asteroids.

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:27.287
Bleebop is on an asteroid 240 miles from the moon,

00:00:27.287 --> 00:00:30.524
and Mark is on one 150 miles away.

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:32.820
Don't worry, it's not rocket science.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.297
Solving this equation is as simple as DIRT.

00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:37.739
We can decide who the winner is

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.250
using the D=RT formula, or DIRT.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.748
This stands for distance equals rate times time.

00:00:44.748 --> 00:00:46.650
In the case of Bleebop and Mark,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.728
we will only know the distance they traveled

00:00:48.728 --> 00:00:50.008
and the time it took for them

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:51.293
to get to the finish line.

00:00:51.293 --> 00:00:52.966
It'll be up to us to find the rate

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:54.768
and who is faster.

00:00:54.768 --> 00:00:56.213
Let's turn to the race now

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:57.938
and see what information we get.

00:00:58.614 --> 00:00:59.566
Three,

00:00:59.566 --> 00:01:00.654
two,

00:01:00.654 --> 00:01:01.801
one,

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.187
blast off!

00:01:03.618 --> 00:01:05.349
Bleebop and Mark's rockets go zipping

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:07.444
across the galaxy towards their moon,

00:01:07.444 --> 00:01:08.898
dodging clunky meteorites

00:01:08.898 --> 00:01:11.197
and loopy space buggies.

00:01:11.197 --> 00:01:13.727
After a few close calls with a wandering satellite,

00:01:13.727 --> 00:01:16.640
Mark arrives first in two hours,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.362
and Bleebop gets there one hour later.

00:01:19.362 --> 00:01:21.447
Looks like Mark has the faster rocket,

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:24.526
but let's check out the results with our DIRT equation.

00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:26.568
Begin by setting up a chart.

00:01:26.568 --> 00:01:28.691
Make four columns and three rows.

00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:31.214
Use DIRT to remember what to fill in.

00:01:31.214 --> 00:01:33.054
Each rocket will have information

00:01:33.054 --> 00:01:35.521
for distance, rate, and time.

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:38.146
Mark's rocket went 150 miles,

00:01:38.146 --> 00:01:39.504
we don't know the rate,

00:01:39.504 --> 00:01:41.975
and he got there in 2 hours.

00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:44.803
Bleebop's rocket went 240 miles,

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:45.925
we don't know the rate,

00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:48.142
and the time is 1 hour after Mark,

00:01:48.142 --> 00:01:49.758
or 3 hours.

00:01:49.758 --> 00:01:52.340
Because we don't know Mark or Bleebop's rate,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.137
that number is going to be a variable

00:01:54.137 --> 00:01:55.210
in each equation,

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.429
which we'll represent with x.

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:58.257
We'll solve the equation

00:01:58.257 --> 00:02:00.568
for the variable to find its value.

00:02:01.244 --> 00:02:02.537
Mark finished first,

00:02:02.537 --> 00:02:04.061
so start with his rocket.

00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:07.425
Remembering DIRT, write down D=RT.

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:11.091
150 miles equals x times 2 hours.

00:02:11.091 --> 00:02:13.598
Divide both sides by 2 hours.

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:15.128
This will leave x isolated

00:02:15.128 --> 00:02:17.008
on the right side of the equation.

00:02:17.008 --> 00:02:19.653
150 miles divided by 2 hours

00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:22.452
is 75 miles over 1 hour.

00:02:22.452 --> 00:02:25.175
Mark's rate is 75 miles per hour.

00:02:25.175 --> 00:02:26.538
That's what mph means.

00:02:26.538 --> 00:02:29.436
It's the amount of miles over one hour.

00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:31.130
Still think Mark is faster?

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.408
Let's set up the same equation for Bleebop and see.

00:02:34.408 --> 00:02:36.130
D=RT

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.974
240 miles equals x times 3 hours.

00:02:39.974 --> 00:02:42.577
Divide both sides by 3 hours.

00:02:42.577 --> 00:02:43.913
This will leave x isolated

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.746
on the right side of the equation.

00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:49.075
240 miles divided by 3 hours

00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:50.974
is 80 miles over 1 hour.

00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:53.426
Bleebop's rate is 80 miles per hour.

00:02:53.426 --> 00:02:56.322
Wow, even though Bleebop got there one hour later,

00:02:56.322 --> 00:02:58.264
it turns out he had the faster rocket.

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:00.691
Mark seems pretty upset,

00:03:00.691 --> 00:03:03.345
but with aliens, you can never really tell.

00:03:03.345 --> 00:03:05.728
Thanks to DIRT, you now know how to calculate

00:03:05.728 --> 00:03:06.350
distance,

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.807
rate,

00:03:06.807 --> 00:03:07.717
and time.

00:03:07.717 --> 00:03:08.992
In what other situations

00:03:08.992 --> 00:03:11.267
can you use the distance formula?

00:03:11.267 --> 00:03:13.583
You don't even need to be watching a space race.

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:15.763
As long as you know two pieces of information

00:03:15.763 --> 00:03:18.015
for the formula D=RT,

00:03:18.015 --> 00:03:21.033
you can calculate any moving vehicle or object.

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.760
Now, the next time you're in a car,

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.261
you can let your friends know

00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:25.854
exactly when you'll be arriving,

00:03:25.854 --> 00:03:27.460
how fast you're going,

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:28.680
or the distance you'll travel.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.604
It's as simple as DIRT.
