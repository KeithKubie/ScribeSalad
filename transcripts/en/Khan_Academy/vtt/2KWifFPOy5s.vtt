00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.988
- [Instructor] Estimating sine of 0.4

00:00:01.988 --> 00:00:05.114
using a Maclaurin polynominal,
what is the least degree

00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:09.281
of the polynominal that assures
an error smaller than 0.001?

00:00:11.371 --> 00:00:13.551
So what are we talking about here?

00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:16.255
Well, we could take some function

00:00:16.255 --> 00:00:19.701
and estimate it with an nth
degree Maclaurin polynomial,

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:21.543
in fact, we could talk more generally

00:00:21.543 --> 00:00:23.230
about a Taylor polynominal,
but let's just say

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.950
this is an nth degree
Maclaurin polynomial,

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.970
but this isn't going to be
a perfect approximation,

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.556
there's going to be some
error or some remainder.

00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:33.978
And so we could call this the remainder

00:00:33.978 --> 00:00:37.263
of that nth degree Maclaurin polynomial,

00:00:37.263 --> 00:00:41.032
and it's going to be
dependent for any given x.

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:43.010
Now if we want to use
the specifics of this

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.180
exact problem, we could
phrase it this way.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.989
We want to say, look, if
we're taking the sine of 0.4

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.033
this is going to be
equal to our Maclaurin,

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:57.579
our nth degree Maclaurin
polynomial evaluated at 0.4

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.701
plus whatever the remainder is

00:00:59.701 --> 00:01:03.887
for that nth degree Maclaurin
polynomial evaluated at 0.4,

00:01:03.887 --> 00:01:07.445
and what we really want to
do is figure out for what n,

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:09.760
what is the least degree
of the polynomial?

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.677
So what is,

00:01:13.027 --> 00:01:15.289
let me do this in a different color.

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:20.078
So we want to figure out
what is the smallest n,

00:01:20.078 --> 00:01:21.911
what is the smallest n

00:01:25.578 --> 00:01:27.495
such that the remainder

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.636
of our nth degree Maclaurin
polynomial evaluated at 0.4

00:01:36.636 --> 00:01:40.386
is less than this number,
is less than 0.001?

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.643
So this is just another way
of rephrasing the problem.

00:01:46.643 --> 00:01:49.619
And the way that we
can do it is we can use

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.907
something called the Lagrange error round

00:01:51.907 --> 00:01:53.716
and we have other videos that prove it,

00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:57.616
this is often also called
Taylor's Remainder Theorem.

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:59.447
And I'll first write it out and I'll try

00:01:59.447 --> 00:02:01.114
to explain it while I write
it out, but it'll actually

00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:03.931
become a lot more concrete
when we work it out.

00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:06.826
So Taylor's Remainder Theorem tells us,

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:09.360
or Legrange error bound tells us that

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.715
if the n plus oneth
derivative of our function,

00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:17.650
so f, so this is our n
plus oneth derivative

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.349
of our function, if the
absolute value of that

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.016
is less than or equal to some M

00:02:23.016 --> 00:02:24.766
for an open interval,

00:02:28.286 --> 00:02:30.369
open interval, containing

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.990
where our polynomial is centered,

00:02:37.417 --> 00:02:41.094
in this case it's zero, we're
gonna use the Maclaurin case,

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.844
so it's containing zero, and the x,

00:02:44.844 --> 00:02:47.903
or zero and x, the x that we care about

00:02:47.903 --> 00:02:49.907
in this particular video is 0.4,

00:02:49.907 --> 00:02:51.907
but I'll say generally for any x,

00:02:51.907 --> 00:02:54.760
so if this is true, if our
n plus oneth derivative

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.701
of our function, if the
absolute value of it

00:02:56.701 --> 00:02:59.420
is less than or equal to
M, over an open interval

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.399
containing where we're centered,

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:03.934
this would be C if we're
talking about the general case,

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:07.515
and x, so this x right over here, then,

00:03:07.515 --> 00:03:10.535
and this is the Legrange, this
is the part that's useful,

00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:13.040
we can say that the remainder is bounded,

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.413
the remainder for that
nth degree polynomial.

00:03:15.413 --> 00:03:17.220
So this is the n plus oneth derivative,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.275
that's bounded, then we
can say the remainder

00:03:19.275 --> 00:03:23.361
for the nth degree polynomial
that approximates our function

00:03:23.361 --> 00:03:27.173
is going to be less
than or equal to that M

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:29.590
times x to the n plus one,

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:36.526
over n plus one factorial.

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.860
So how do we apply that to
this particular problem?

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.645
Well think about the derivatives of sine,

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:47.833
we know that the absolute value of sine

00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:51.339
is less than or equal to one,
its derivative is cosine of x,

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.992
the absolute value of that
is going to be bounded,

00:03:53.992 --> 00:03:56.312
is going to be less than or equal to one,

00:03:56.312 --> 00:03:58.680
so no matter how many times
we take the derivative

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.196
of sine of x, the absolute
value of that derivative

00:04:01.196 --> 00:04:03.836
is going to be less than or equal to one.

00:04:03.836 --> 00:04:08.777
So we could write generally
that for this particular f of x,

00:04:08.777 --> 00:04:12.223
so let's say, for this particular
f of x right over here,

00:04:12.223 --> 00:04:15.249
we could say that the absolute value

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.249
of the n plus oneth
derivative, evaluated any x,

00:04:20.755 --> 00:04:24.172
is going to be less than or equal to one.

00:04:25.078 --> 00:04:28.167
And this is the case for where f is sine,

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.391
where f is sine of x, and this is actually

00:04:30.391 --> 00:04:32.482
going to be true over any interval,

00:04:32.482 --> 00:04:34.234
it doesn't even have to be over some type

00:04:34.234 --> 00:04:36.374
of a restricted interval
where we can do this.

00:04:36.374 --> 00:04:38.874
So we know that this is our M,

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:44.169
that sine and its
derivatives are all bounded,

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.527
or their absolute values
are bounded by one.

00:04:47.527 --> 00:04:50.170
And so them we have our M and we can apply

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.258
the Legrange error bound, so we can say

00:04:53.258 --> 00:04:57.425
that the remainder of our nth
degree Maclaurin approximation

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:04.233
at 0.4, so our x in this
particular case is 0.4,

00:05:05.422 --> 00:05:08.361
we don't have to do it
generally for any x here,

00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:11.096
is going to be less than or equal to,

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:13.529
our M is one, so I won't
even write that down,

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.779
our x is 0.4, 0.4 to the n plus one,

00:05:20.245 --> 00:05:23.995
to the n plus one, over
n plus one factorial.

00:05:25.544 --> 00:05:27.921
And we're taking the absolute
value of this whole thing.

00:05:27.921 --> 00:05:30.237
This is Legrange error bound,
and we want to figure out,

00:05:30.237 --> 00:05:32.219
if we can figure out
a situation where this

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:36.213
is less than 0.001, then this for sure

00:05:36.213 --> 00:05:40.435
is going to be less than
0.001, because the remainder

00:05:40.435 --> 00:05:42.427
is less than this, or less than or equal

00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:44.341
to this, which is less than that.

00:05:44.341 --> 00:05:46.221
So how do we do that, how do we figure out

00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:48.823
the smallest n where
this is going to be true?

00:05:48.823 --> 00:05:51.919
Well, we can just try out
some ns and keep increasing

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.415
until this thing actually
becomes smaller than that thing.

00:05:55.415 --> 00:05:59.598
So let's do it, all right,
I'm gonna set up a table here.

00:05:59.598 --> 00:06:02.515
So let me do it relatively cleanly.

00:06:04.445 --> 00:06:07.578
So let's do, this is going to be our n,

00:06:07.578 --> 00:06:09.995
and then this is going to be,

00:06:10.974 --> 00:06:14.474
this is going to be 0.4 to the n plus one,

00:06:15.704 --> 00:06:17.871
over n plus one factorial,

00:06:19.643 --> 00:06:22.511
so let's try it when n is equal to one.

00:06:22.511 --> 00:06:24.784
Well then this is going
to be 0.4 to the two,

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:28.034
so it's 0.4 squared over two factorial,

00:06:29.341 --> 00:06:31.174
this is 0.16 over two,

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:36.889
which is equal to 0.08, that's definitely

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:39.746
not less than one thousandth here.

00:06:39.746 --> 00:06:42.565
So let's try n equals
two, when n equals two,

00:06:42.565 --> 00:06:45.418
it's gonna be 0.4 to the third power,

00:06:45.418 --> 00:06:48.857
over three factorial, and that's equal to,

00:06:48.857 --> 00:06:51.010
what is that, zero point,

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.703
I'm gonna need three
digits behind the decimal,

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:56.620
0.064 over six, well,
this is a little bit more

00:06:57.496 --> 00:07:01.079
than 0.01, so our n
isn't large enough yet.

00:07:02.933 --> 00:07:06.494
So let's try three, so
this is going to be 0.04

00:07:06.494 --> 00:07:10.123
to the three plus one,
so that's going to be

00:07:10.123 --> 00:07:13.540
to the fourth power, over four factorial,

00:07:14.757 --> 00:07:18.400
and let's see, that is
going to be equal to,

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.733
this is going to be, let's
see, we're gonna have

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:25.150
four digits behind the decimal, so 0.0256

00:07:26.587 --> 00:07:29.670
over 24, this is, we're almost there,

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:35.628
this is a little bit, this is
going to be a little bit more

00:07:35.628 --> 00:07:39.628
than 0.001, so that doesn't
do the trick for us.

00:07:40.801 --> 00:07:44.093
So I'm guessing already that n equals four

00:07:44.093 --> 00:07:46.702
is gonna do the trick,
but let's verify that.

00:07:46.702 --> 00:07:50.869
So this is going to be
0.04, or 0.4, I should say,

00:07:52.044 --> 00:07:55.377
to the fifth power, over five factorial,

00:07:56.294 --> 00:07:58.064
and what is this equal to?

00:07:58.064 --> 00:08:00.454
Let's see, four to the fifth is 1024,

00:08:00.454 --> 00:08:03.318
I'm gonna have five
numbers behind the decimal

00:08:03.318 --> 00:08:07.308
and I'm gonna divide it by
five factorial, which is 120.

00:08:07.308 --> 00:08:10.309
And let's see, this right over here, yes,

00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:13.059
this for sure is less than 0.001,

00:08:14.798 --> 00:08:19.153
this is definitely less than
a thousandth right over here.

00:08:19.153 --> 00:08:22.328
So we see that when n is equal to four,

00:08:22.328 --> 00:08:26.747
so we can say that the
remainder for our fourth degree

00:08:26.747 --> 00:08:31.570
polynomial, fourth degree
Maclaurin polynomial, evaluated

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:35.737
at x equals 0.4 is for sure
going to be less than 0.001.

00:08:39.723 --> 00:08:42.806
So there you go, that is the
least degree of the polynomial

00:08:42.806 --> 00:08:45.858
that assures an error
smaller than one thousandth.
