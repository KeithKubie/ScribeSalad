00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.400
In this video and
the next few videos,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.120
we're just really going to be
doing a bunch of calculations

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.640
about this data set
right over here.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.850
And hopefully, just going
through those calculations

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:11.730
will give you an
intuitive sense of what

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.540
the analysis of
variance is all about.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.060
Now, the first thing I
want to do in this video

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.940
is calculate the
total sum of squares.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.740
So I'll call that SST.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.830
SS-- sum of squares total.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.170
And you could view it
as really the numerator

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.450
when you calculate variance.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.700
So you're just going to take
the distance between each

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.427
of these data points and the
mean of all of these data

00:00:33.427 --> 00:00:35.260
points, square them,
and just take that sum.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.660
We're not going to divide by
the degree of freedom, which

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.535
you would normally do
if you were calculating

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:40.920
sample variance.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.180
Now, what is this going to be?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.680
Well, the first
thing we need to do,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.920
we have to figure out the mean
of all of this stuff over here.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.449
And I'm actually going to
call that the grand mean.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.990
And I'm going to
show you in a second

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.140
that it's the same thing as
the mean of the means of each

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.750
of these data sets.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.920
So let's calculate
the grand mean.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:09.990
So it's going to be 3 plus 2
plus 1 plus 5 plus 3 plus 4

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.620
plus 5 plus 6 plus 7.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.430
And then we have
nine data points here

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.540
so we'll divide by 9.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.410
And what is this
going to be equal to?

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.460
3 plus 2 plus 1 is 6.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160
6 plus-- let me just add.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.040
So these are 6.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.010
5 plus 3 plus 4 is 12.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.550
And then 5 plus 6 plus 7 is 18.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.860
And then 6 plus 12 is 18 plus
another 18 is 36, divided by 9

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:45.994
is equal to 4.

00:01:45.994 --> 00:01:48.160
And let me show you that
that's the exact same thing

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.940
as the mean of the means.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.580
So the mean of this
group 1 over here--

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.580
let me do it in
that same green--

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.350
the mean of group 1 over
here is 3 plus 2 plus 1.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.970
That's that 6 right over
here, divided by 3 data

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.600
points so that
will be equal to 2.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.574
The mean of group 2,
the sum here is 12.

00:02:08.574 --> 00:02:09.740
We saw that right over here.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.250
5 plus 3 plus 4 is
12, divided by 3

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.820
is 4 because we have
three data points.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.000
And then the mean
of group 3, 5 plus 6

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.790
plus 7 is 18 divided by 3 is 6.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.100
So if you were to take the
mean of the means, which

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.120
is another way of viewing this
grand mean, you have 2 plus 4

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.040
plus 6, which is 12,
divided by 3 means here.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.530
And once again, you would get 4.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.946
So you could view
this as the mean

00:02:36.946 --> 00:02:38.830
of all of the data
in all of the groups

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.505
or the mean of the means
of each of these groups.

00:02:41.505 --> 00:02:43.380
But either way, now that
we've calculated it,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.780
we can actually figure out
the total sum of squares.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.590
So let's do that.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.950
So it's going to be
equal to 3 minus 4--

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.730
the 4 is this 4 right over
here-- squared plus 2 minus 4

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.280
squared plus 1 minus 4 squared.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.490
Now, I'll do these guys
over here in purple.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:15.270
Plus 5 minus 4 squared plus 3
minus 4 squared plus 4 minus 4

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.770
squared.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.320
Let me scroll over a little bit.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:25.330
Now, we only have three
left, plus 5 minus 4 squared

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.210
plus 6 minus 4 squared
plus 7 minus 4 squared.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.770
And what does this give us?

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.620
So up here, this is going
to be equal to 3 minus 4.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.490
Difference is 1.

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.730
You square it.

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.810
It's actually negative 1,
but you square it, you get 1,

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:48.320
plus you get negative 2 squared
is 4, plus negative 3 squared.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.700
Negative 3 squared is 9.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.570
And then we have here
in the magenta 5 minus 4

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.640
is 1 squared is still 1.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.420
3 minus 4 squared is 1.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.320
You square it again,
you still get 1.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.964
And then 4 minus 4 is just 0.

00:04:00.964 --> 00:04:03.130
So we could-- well, I'll
just write the 0 there just

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.344
to show you that we
actually calculated that.

00:04:05.344 --> 00:04:07.260
And then we have these
last three data points.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.180
5 minus 4 squared.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.760
That's 1.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.800
6 minus 4 squared.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.330
That is 4, right?

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.850
That's 2 squared.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.370
And then plus 7 minus
4 is 3 squared is 9.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.230
So what's this going
to be equal to?

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.760
So I have 1 plus 4
plus 9 right over here.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.110
That's 5 plus 9.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.360
This right over
here is 14, right?

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.110
5 plus-- yup, 14.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.290
And then we also have
another 14 right over here

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.270
because we have a
1 plus 4 plus 9.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.940
So that right over
there is also 14.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.190
And then we have 2 over here.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.720
So it's going to be
28-- 14 times 2, 14

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.738
plus 14 is 28-- plus 2 is 30.

00:04:50.738 --> 00:04:53.380
Is equal to 30.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.770
So our total sum of
squares-- and actually,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.450
if we wanted the
variance here, we

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.760
would divide this by
the degrees of freedom.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.300
And we've learned multiple
times the degrees of freedom

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.840
here so let's say
that we have-- so we

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.710
know that we have
m groups over here.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.800
So let me just write
it as m and I'm not

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.540
going to prove things
rigorously here,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:14.510
but I want to show
you where some

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:17.730
of these strange formulas that
show up in statistics books

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.440
actually come from without
proving it rigorously.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.780
More to give you the intuition.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.460
So we have m groups here.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:32.120
And each group
here has n members.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.180
So how many total
members do we have here?

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.800
Well, we had m
times n or 9, right?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.490
3 times 3 total members.

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.510
So our degrees of
freedom-- and remember,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.930
you have however
many data points

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.310
you had minus 1
degrees of freedom

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:51.070
because if you know
the mean of means,

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:57.885
if you assume you knew
that, then only 9 minus 1,

00:05:57.885 --> 00:06:00.260
only eight of these are going
to give you new information

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.005
because if you know that, you
could calculate the last one.

00:06:03.005 --> 00:06:04.880
Or it really doesn't
have to be the last one.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.629
If you have the other eight,
you could calculate this one.

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:09.420
If you have eight of
them, you could always

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.897
calculate the ninth one
using the mean of means.

00:06:13.897 --> 00:06:15.730
So one way to think
about it is that there's

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.710
only eight independent
measurements here.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:22.470
Or if we want to
talk generally, there

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.810
are m times n-- so that tells
us the total number of samples--

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:30.210
minus 1 degrees of freedom.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.920
And if we were actually
calculating the variance here,

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.640
we would just divide
30 by m times n minus 1

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.960
or this is another way of
saying eight degrees of freedom

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.065
for this exact example.

00:06:46.065 --> 00:06:48.190
We would take 30 divided
by 8 and we would actually

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:50.110
have the variance for
this entire group,

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.964
for the group of nine
when you combine them.

00:06:52.964 --> 00:06:54.380
I'll leave you
here in this video.

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.090
In the next video, we're
going to try to figure out

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.970
how much of this total
variance, how much of this total

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.400
squared sum, total
variation comes

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:09.850
from the variation within
each of these groups

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:13.790
versus the variation
between the groups.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.290
And I think you get
a sense of where

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:17.354
this whole analysis of
variance is coming from.

00:07:17.354 --> 00:07:18.770
It's the sense
that, look, there's

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.890
a variance of this
entire sample of nine,

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.430
but some of that variance--
if these groups are

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.390
different in some way--
might come from the variation

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:30.710
from being in different groups
versus the variation from being

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.350
within a group.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.070
And we're going to
calculate those two things

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:34.528
and we're going to
see that they're

00:07:34.528 --> 00:07:38.000
going to add up to the
total squared sum variation.
