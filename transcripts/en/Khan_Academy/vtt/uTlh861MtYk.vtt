00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.412
For the sake of
simplicity, let's assume

00:00:02.412 --> 00:00:03.870
that the current
conversion rate is

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.690
six Chinese yuan per
for one US dollar.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.750
And at that exchange rate,
China is exporting $50 million

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.410
worth of goods to
the United States

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.330
and the US is
exporting $20 million

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:18.810
worth of goods to China.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.940
So clearly, there's
a trade imbalance.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.370
The US is importing $50
million worth of goods

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.300
and it's exporting $20
million worth of goods.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.670
So it has a $30
million trade deficit.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.565
Now, in this situation,
the Chinese manufacturer

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:36.030
is going to have $50
million that it wants

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.820
to convert from its
revenue in America

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.990
and convert that to
Chinese currency.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.020
The American
manufacturer is going

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.320
to want to convert its
yuan into $20 million.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.430
So the supply of dollars,
which is this $50 million

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.350
right over here, is
going to be much greater

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.570
than the demand, which
is a $20 million.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.290
So if the currencies
were allowed to float,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.040
the dollar would weaken.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.970
The cost of the
dollar would go down.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.280
Its supply is so much
bigger than the demand.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.130
But let's say that the
Chinese central bank does not

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.220
want that to happen.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.950
So this is the
Peoples Bank of China.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.600
They do not want
the Chinese currency

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.475
to strengthen because
if that were to happen,

00:01:24.475 --> 00:01:26.974
then Chinese goods would become
more expensive in the United

00:01:26.974 --> 00:01:29.700
States and it would be harder to
maintain this trade imbalance.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.880
They want it.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.550
So what they do is
they essentially

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.010
make up for the difference
in demand for the dollar.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.170
Right here there's only
demand for $20 million.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.860
There's supply of 50.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.790
So what they do is they
create demand for $30 million.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.590
And the way that they create
demand for $30 million

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.100
at that exchange rate is
that they can literally

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.940
print, create 180.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.710
They could literally
create 180 million yuan.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.414
And then at an exchange
rate of six to one,

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:05.580
that would essentially--
and they would go out there

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.840
into the open markets and try
to convert this into dollars--

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.430
and so this would
create a demand

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.840
for an incremental $30 million.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.740
And so when they do that,
the total demand for dollars

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.600
is their $30 million
plus the $20 million

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.370
from the American manufacturer.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.420
That will completely equal
the supply of dollars

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.810
at that exchange rate.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.660
And so it will not
cause the exchange rate

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.410
to fluctuate or the
balance of trade to change.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.000
So this is clearly a
very simplified example.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.920
The actual numbers are much
larger than in the millions.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.980
They're in the hundreds
of billions of dollars.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.290
But this gives, at
least in my mind,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.640
a respectable idea of how
the Chinese central bank is

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.190
actually keeping its
currency pegged to the dollar

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.600
and how that's helping to
maintain a trade imbalance.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.337

the Khan Academy for CNBC.
