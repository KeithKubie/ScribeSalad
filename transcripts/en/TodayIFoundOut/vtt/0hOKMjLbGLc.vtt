00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.830
Unless you’ve managed to make it this far
in life without setting foot in a store, you’re

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.390
probably aware that jello, popularly known
as jelly by my British compatriots, is a genericization

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.590
of the brand Jell-O which itself was derived
from the word “gelatin”.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.650
(See: The Jiggly History of Jell-O) Gelatin
is a protein derived from collagen via a process

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.930
called hydrolysis, which breaks apart the
bonds of this protein with water.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.790
While hydrolysis may sound complicated, it’s
simply a matter of boiling collagen rich animal

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.890
byproducts, usually bones, connective tissue
and skin, in water for many hours to break

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.890
it down.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.780
The resulting broth is then carefully strained
before the water is evaporated, leaving behind

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.440
gelatin which can either be pressed into sheets
or sold as a powder.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.080
Given that it is made from animal byproducts,
gelatin and products containing it aren’t

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.700
considered to be vegetarian and as a result,
there are several plant-based alternatives

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.170
such as Agar (derived from algae) and carrageenan
(derived from seaweed) available on the market.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.860
(See: Why Seaweed is Sometimes Used in the
Making of Ice Cream)

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.689
Though commonly thought of as being modern,
gelatin based foodstuffs have existed since

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.859
at least around the 15th or 16th centuries.

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.509
Notably, in the late 17th century a Frenchman
called Denis Papin invented a device he dubbed,

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.740
“The Digester of Bones” (marketing genius
that one).

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.000
Papin’s original intention was to create
a device not too dissimilar from a modern

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.619
pressure cooker which utilized steam to boil
down bones either for thickening gravies or

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.060
creating a paste that could be readily consumed
by the poor.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.880
Despite his noble intentions for the less
affluent among us, the device ended up being

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.670
too expensive for all but the wealthiest individuals
to afford.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.229
In the end, the French (and eventually English)
elite became enthralled with the jellies it

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.859
produced, with one English observer noting:
“The hardest bones of beef and mutton were

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:09.920
made as soft as cheese, producing an incredible
quantity of gravy and for close of all, a

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.260
jelly made from the bones of beef, which makes
a good relish, the most delicious I have ever

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.260
tasted.”

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.500
The English are also credited with creating
one of the earliest known recipes containing

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.689
gelatin – a dish called “calf’s foot
jelly” – which was, unsurprisingly, made

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.110
from calf’s feet, though the feet of deer,
sheep or another similar animal could be substituted

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.660
if necessary.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.480
The exact recipe states: “Take two calf’s
feet, and add to them one gallon of water;

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.360
boil down to one quart; strain, and when cold,
skim off the fat; add to this the white of

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.200
six or eight eggs well beaten, a pint of wine,
half a pound of loaf sugar, and the juice

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.079
of four lemons, and let them be well mixed.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:52.500
Boil the whole for a few minutes, stirring
constantly, and then strain through a flannel.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.799
This forms a very nutritious article of diet
for the sick, and for those recovering from

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:57.799
disease.

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:00.590
The wine may be omitted or added according
to choice.”

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.450
Originally designated as a food for “invalids”,
like many other gelatin-based foods, the dish

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.580
became something of a delicacy amongst the
upper classes.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.360
Later, its supposed high nutritional value
saw various gelatin-based foods become popular

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.799
with soldiers during the Napoleonic wars.

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.670
So where do pineapples come into this and
why can’t you put them in jello?

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.099
Well, to begin with, it’s not true you can’t
put any pineapples in jello.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:29.969
You just shouldn’t put unprocessed pineapples
in it, unless you like the jello to stay in

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.079
its liquid form.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:35.780
You see, since gelatin is a protein, it is
very susceptible to breaking down into its

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.120
amino acid building blocks when it encounters
enzymes known as proteases.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.340
As a result of this break down, the proteins
are unable to tangle together to create a

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.090
partially solid structure.

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.480
Bottom line, without this linking, the jello
never sets up.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.859
In regards to pineapples, they contain bromelain
which itself contains sulfhydryl protease

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:57.099
enzymes.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.230
As such, gelatin with unprocessed pineapple
added to it will not set.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.340
However, since heating typically renders the
protease enzymes in bromelain inactive, canned

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.879
pineapple can be added to jello, as it is
heated sufficiently as part of the canning

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.879
process.

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.660
You might be wondering at this point if there
are any other common foodstuffs that similarly

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.190
prevent jello from setting?

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:24.190
Well, the short answer is yes- anything containing
protease enzymes is a no-no in your jello.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.910
This includes several fruits such as papaya,
mango, guava, pawpaw and kiwi as well as figs

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:29.910
and ginger root.

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.610
In addition to this, protease enzymes are
also found in broccoli, mushrooms, spinach,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.430
wheat and soy beans, none of which you’re
likely to add to jello, but hey, at least

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:39.620
now you know.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.060
Finally, meat tenderizer, which is usually
made from either the aforementioned bromelain

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.260
or papain (derived from papayas) will, of
course, stop jello from setting.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.350
As with the pineapple, however, if the food
items in question are first heated sufficiently

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:00.180
to inactivate the offending enzymes (in the
case of bromelain, heated to above 70°C or

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.360
158°F), they will then be fine to use in
your latest jello creation.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.990
J-E-L-L-O, it’s alivvvve!

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.720
Well, actually, technically, jello is alive
– at least according to a 1974 experiment

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.900
performed by Dr. Adrian Upton.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.850
Dr. Upton attached an EEG, electroencephalogram,
machine to a dome of lime green jello.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.670
The jello produced alpha waves in much the
same way an awake and alive human would produce.

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.280
This experiment set the science world aflutter.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.220
But what Dr. Upton was really trying to prove
is that an EEG should not be the only method

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:40.390
used to determine if a human is alive or not.

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.940
Since chemicals like bromelain break down
protein, they’re remarkably effective at

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.740
tenderizing meat and there’s “some”
evidence to support the idea that eating them

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.080
can aid in the digestion of protein.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.590
Whether there is actually any positive effect
or not, pineapple and similar protease rich

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:14.220
fruits have become popular with bodybuilders
for 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.780
this reason.
