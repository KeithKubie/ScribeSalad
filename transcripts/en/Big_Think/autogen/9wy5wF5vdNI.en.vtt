like the president going to Cairo or
something like that but what's actually

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510
something like that but what's actually
 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.599
something like that but what's actually
every bit is compelling to me is what

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609
every bit is compelling to me is what
 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:16.110
every bit is compelling to me is what
we're doing on a far more local basis so

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120
we're doing on a far more local basis so
 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.170
we're doing on a far more local basis so
that our embassy in Lesotho for example

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180
that our embassy in Lesotho for example
 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.679
that our embassy in Lesotho for example
can use social media in Lesotho to

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689
can use social media in Lesotho to
 

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:25.559
can use social media in Lesotho to
engage the people there and create a

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569
engage the people there and create a
 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.860
engage the people there and create a
smaller community of engagement a more

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870
smaller community of engagement a more
 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:31.289
smaller community of engagement a more
specialized community of engagement and

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299
specialized community of engagement and
 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.129
specialized community of engagement and
some conversations that are more organic

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139
some conversations that are more organic
 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.289
some conversations that are more organic
that are more reflective of what the

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299
that are more reflective of what the
 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.339
that are more reflective of what the
real local interests and concerns are so

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349
real local interests and concerns are so
 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:45.499
real local interests and concerns are so
social media has this two contrasting

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:45.509
 
 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:47.699
 
possibilities on the one hand it can

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709
possibilities on the one hand it can
 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.719
possibilities on the one hand it can
help us engage much larger numbers of

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:51.729
help us engage much larger numbers of
 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:54.330
help us engage much larger numbers of
people than we have traditionally so our

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340
people than we have traditionally so our
 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.240
people than we have traditionally so our
audience really are the six billion

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.699
audience really are the six billion
people on the planet but on the other

people on the planet but on the other
 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.209
people on the planet but on the other
hand it allows us to engage people much

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:03.219
hand it allows us to engage people much
 

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:06.199
hand it allows us to engage people much
more locally and much more organically

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209
more locally and much more organically
 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.449
more locally and much more organically

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:10.860
than perhaps we'd ever done when our
communications were driven exclusively

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870
communications were driven exclusively
 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.099

called one economy the purpose of which

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:35.800
called one economy the purpose of which
 

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:38.460
called one economy the purpose of which
was to connect people around the globe

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:38.470
was to connect people around the globe
 

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:40.799
was to connect people around the globe
to these technologies and and we went

00:09:40.799 --> 00:09:40.809
to these technologies and and we went
 

00:09:40.809 --> 00:09:42.900
to these technologies and and we went
from hip for guys in a basement actually

00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:42.910
from hip for guys in a basement actually
 

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:44.579

points that people need to bear in mind
 

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.069
points that people need to bear in mind
is that the way that people actually

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079
is that the way that people actually
 

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:17.579

right now in the developing world people

00:10:35.819 --> 00:10:35.829
right now in the developing world people
 

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:38.579
right now in the developing world people
are skipping sort of the desktop as the

doing a lot of work right now is in the
 

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.329
doing a lot of work right now is in the
Democratic Republic of Congo which is

00:10:51.329 --> 00:10:51.339
Democratic Republic of Congo which is
 

00:10:51.339 --> 00:10:55.169

examining the feasibility of this you

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:21.850
examining the feasibility of this you
 

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.790
examining the feasibility of this you
know I said oh you know it sounds great

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:23.800
know I said oh you know it sounds great
 

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.400
know I said oh you know it sounds great
but you know is that naive you know

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:26.410
but you know is that naive you know
 

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.360

number one is there can people use cell

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:30.370
number one is there can people use cell
 

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.160
number one is there can people use cell
phones are they using them what about

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:32.170
phones are they using them what about
 

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.670

literacy gaps and one of the things that

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680
literacy gaps and one of the things that
 

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.410

I learned was that today at this moment

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420
I learned was that today at this moment
 

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.540

of the things that's different in the

00:12:03.869 --> 00:12:03.879
of the things that's different in the
 

00:12:03.879 --> 00:12:05.489

has their own phone but in the Congo

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:10.660
has their own phone but in the Congo
 

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.840

it's normal actually for three or four

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:12.850
it's normal actually for three or four
 

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:15.540
it's normal actually for three or four
people to share the same phone and so if

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:15.550
people to share the same phone and so if
 

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:18.629
people to share the same phone and so if
you just do the math all right today 14

three users per phone what that means is
 

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.999

the people are connecting to the network
 

00:12:40.149 --> 00:12:43.019
the people are connecting to the network
and so that for me is is great

00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:43.029
and so that for me is is great

affirmation that we should be pushing

00:12:45.869 --> 00:12:45.879
affirmation that we should be pushing
 

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:48.960
affirmation that we should be pushing
these technologies into the developing

these technologies into the developing
world and further we should be thinking

world and further we should be thinking
 

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.540
world and further we should be thinking
about how 21st century technology can

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:54.550
about how 21st century technology can
 

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.040
about how 21st century technology can
help solve some of our most intractable

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:58.050
help solve some of our most intractable
 

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.829
help solve some of our most intractable
development challenges and will there be

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839
development challenges and will there be
 

00:13:01.839 --> 00:13:05.699
development challenges and will there be
places where we go where people simply

00:13:05.699 --> 00:13:05.709
places where we go where people simply
 

00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:07.710

aren't using cell phones where there's
no mobile coverage where the literacy

00:13:11.429 --> 00:13:11.439
no mobile coverage where the literacy

level is such that people just can't
 

00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:15.689
level is such that people just can't
figure it out sure but I think that

00:13:15.689 --> 00:13:15.699
figure it out sure but I think that
 

00:13:15.699 --> 00:13:18.269
