Alright Andy, what do you want to build,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.290
or what kind of report do you want to make?

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.880
&gt;&gt; I really like those little needle sort of, you know, the one that

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.650
actually shows up in your car dashboard and says like, oh you spent this

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.790
much. And if it's green you're really happy, but that would have to do

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.160
with, you know, have you made as much money as you were hoping for?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.680
&gt;&gt; So, I think you're talking about an odometer in your car.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:19.910
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.755
&gt;&gt; And then what you're talking about in Salesforce would be a gauge chart.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.690
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's make a gauge chart with a needle.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.040
So, in order to do that for total revenue on the entire festival,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.950
we need to go down to the attendee and create a formula field first

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.930
on how much each attendee spent. Because we know how many tickets we have,

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.880
or how many tickets they purchased, and we know how much a ticket costs.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.355
&gt;&gt; Remember they also have different ticket prices, so like the

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:47.113
V.I.P. ticket will be like a $100 and general admission $50.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:48.920
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And so that's probably why a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.930
formula field would make the most sense in order

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.660
to store that data around that conditional use case.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.080
&gt;&gt; Okay, so add a formula on attendees

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.850
to figure how much money each one's spending?

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:59.810
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's start off that.
