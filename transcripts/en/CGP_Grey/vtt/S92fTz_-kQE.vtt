00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.650
Can Texas Secede from the Union?

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.340
America's second most populated and second
largest state is always first to remind you

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.339
that it was once an independent nation: The
Republic of Texas.

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.379
Unlike California's three-week, almost accidental
flirt with independence (and a hideous flag)

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:19.630
the Republic of Texas was a real country with
its own presidents, and laws and currency

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.599
for a decade from 1836 until 1846 when it
joined the Union to become the 28th state,

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.130
thankfully evening out the number of stars.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.300
This happy marriage led pretty much immediately
to the Mexican-American war over the question

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.100
of over how big Texas was.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
America, as the victor, got to decide the
answer: very big.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.920
While Texas gave up its complete independence
to join The Union, it didn't give up its independent

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.649
streak -- and filed for divorce, along with
several other states, a scant 15 years later.

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.040
This domestic dispute was settled not with
flowers but with force, something that many

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.210
are still grumbly about today.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.219
But History aside in modern times could Texas
still be a real country?

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.260
In other words: could Texas succeed if it
secedes?

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.260
In terms of population, an independent Texas
would be the world's 46th largest country

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.090
with 26 million citizens.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.620
And, those citizens would make Texas the 13th
largest economy.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.620
So the New Texas Republic would be comparable
to Australia, except in the size department.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.090
But what about the Federal money that goes
to Texas?

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.510
Those interstate highways don't build themselves,
you know.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.580
For a majority of states, independence would
be a financial problem.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.070
Mississippi, for example get two dollars from
Washington for every one it sends in taxes

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.360
so an independent Magnolia Republic would
be bankrupt almost instantly.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.670
But not Texas, which gives more money to the
federal government in taxes than it gets back.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:41.250
There's no reason why independent Texas couldn't
keep those highways paved *and* give its citizens

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.920
a small happy-Texapendency-day Tax cut.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.390
So from a financial perspective: The New Texas
Republic gets a check.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.950
Now the question is can Texas legally secede?

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.220
And the answer is... no... not at all.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.860
Despite popular belief, even by politicians
who should know better, the Texas constitution

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.200
does not include a get-out-of-The-Union-free
clause no matter how much Texans, or citizens

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.860
of other states, wish that it did.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.610
However, the Texas Constitution does have
a weird clause that allows it to divide itself

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.240
into five states without the approval of congress.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.870
So Texas could, any moment, explode into the
states perhaps named North Texas, South Texas,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.120
East Texas, West Texas and Austin -- which
would quintuple its power in the Senate -- but

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.620
not necessarily help it gain independence
because there is no legal process for a state

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.950
to exit The Union.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.440
Though the constitution is mute on the issue,
secession has come before the supreme court

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.340
and, shockingly, the Supreme Court of the
United States decided that States can't leave

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.379
the United States.

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.560
But the legal question is, weirdly sort of
moot.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.420
After all, the First Texas Republic didn't
pop into existence out of nowhere -- Texas

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.180
was originally a State of Mexico, which didn't
allow Texas to leave, but leave Texas did

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.969
anyway, though under less than harmonious
circumstances.

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:51.680
While it's hard to imagine war between the
New Texas Republic and the United States it

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.730
isn't hard to imagine who would win that fight.

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.020
Texas does have its own military, but seriously,
nobody beats America in the war business.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.120
So the only way Texas is leaving is if it
can convince the United States to change its

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.499
laws to let it leave.

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:10.750
Which only as a chance of being discussed
seriously if a majority of Texans want independence,

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.450
which isn't remotely the case.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.299
So while a New Texas Republic is interesting
to think about -- particularly for some non-Texans,

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.360
as of now it's a long way from becoming a
reality.
