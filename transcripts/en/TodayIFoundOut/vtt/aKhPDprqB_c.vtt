00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.500
When the green and blue uniformed athletes
of the University of Notre Dame run on to

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.960
the field or court, their fans are rooting
for the “Fighting Irish.”

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.880
Represented by a small green leprechaun- hat
tilted with his fists up, ready to fight-

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.210
the athletic teams of this South Bend, Indiana
Catholic school have been playing under this

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.109
moniker for, officially, 87 years.

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.710
But here’s the thing: the school was actually
founded by French Catholic priests, not Irish

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:36.710
Catholics.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.520
So, how did Notre Dame become the “Fighting
Irish?”

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.140
Shouldn’t they be called the “Fighting
French?”

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.620
In November 1842, eight members of the newly-established
Congregation of Holy Cross, based in a small

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.430
village outside of Le Mans, France, were given
524 acres of land by the Bishop of Vincennes

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.059
in the, at the time, 35-year-old state of
Indiana.

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.900
Within two years, they had established a school
on the land.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.289
A 29-year-old French priest, Edward Sorin,
named the school “L’Université de Notre

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:09.350
Dame du Lac,” or the “University of Our
Lady of the Lake.”

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.979
The school was Catholic and all-male (and
would stay that way for 128 years, until 1972

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.369
when it became coed).

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.090
In 1879, a fire destroyed the Main Building.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.090
Always a religious man, Sorin said,

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.700
I came here as a young man and dreamed of
building a great university in honor of Our

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.700
Lady.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.479
But I built it too small, and she had to burn
it to the ground to make the point.

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.750
So, tomorrow, as soon as the bricks cool,
we will rebuild it, bigger and better than

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.750
ever.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.009
And they did rebuild, indeed making the school
bigger and better than before as was vowed.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.479
Less than a decade later, in 1887, the athletic
department even established a football team.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.020
The game of (American) football has its origins
in rugby, first played in English public schools

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.780
during the mid-19th century.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.650
The rules and how the game was played varied
from place to place, but when the game made

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.840
its way over to America, it developed into
something a little different.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.940
Many historians believe that American football
can be traced back to a game played between

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.950
Rutgers University and Princeton in 1869.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.720
Using modified London Football Association
rules, the game quickly took off among eastern

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.720
colleges.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.129
In 1876, Walter Camp, a Yale grad and coach
who would become known as the “Father of

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:24.939
American Football,” proposed a line of scrimmage,
as well as down and distance rules, forever

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:26.610
separating it from rugby.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.469
The game expanded very quickly, gaining favor
on the east coast all the way to the Midwest.

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:36.370
In 1880, there were only eight universities
that fielded collegiate football teams.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.030
By the turn of the century, there were 43.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.490
One of those was Notre Dame.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.340
On November 23, 1887, Notre Dame and Michigan
matched up.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.319
127 years later, their rivalry is still going.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:52.900
On that November day, Michigan won eight to
zero, though as the Scholastic, the University’s

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.959
student magazine, pointed out, it was never
meant to be a particularly competitive game:

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.840
It was not considered a match contest, as
the home team had been organized only a few

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.370
weeks, and the Michigan boys, the champions
of the West, came more to instruct them in

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.500
the points of the Rugby game than to win fresh
laurels.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.549
Over the next twelve seasons, the Notre Dame
football team compiled a 25-11-3 record against

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.599
the other intercollegiate teams under the
nickname the “Catholics.”

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.519
Many of these other college teams they beat
were also Catholic schools- Boston College,

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.069
Fordham, and Holy Cross just to name a few.

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:29.219
As opposed to Notre Dame’s French background,
they were founded by, and intended for, recently

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:31.250
immigrated Irish Catholics.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.030
The Irish Potato Famine of 1845 convinced
many to make their way across the Atlantic

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.310
to America.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.120
As they settled in eastern cities, they desired
a place for, or at least to aspire to, a higher

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120
education.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.700
These colleges represented upward mobility
and the ability for anyone to make it in America.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.450
As recent immigrants to this country, the
view of the Irish were colored by pretty jingoistic

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.450
views.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.319
They were known as drunks and “brutes,”
while possessing a violent temper.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.170
Even future President Theodore Roosevelt,
while a New York State Assembly Member, had

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.669
some choice words to say about the Irish,
“The average Catholic Irishman of the first

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:12.090
generation, as represented in the Assembly
[is a] low, venal, corrupt, and unintelligent

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.090
brute.”

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.040
To call someone Irish was to imply that they
were uncivilized, violent, and un-American.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.190
In other words, it was an insult.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.560
So this brings us to the nickname.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.890
It seems that not even the University itself
is exactly sure how this rather odd nickname

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:32.480
came to be, though there are some popular
theories and with the documented evidence

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.780
at hand we can mostly piece together in general
how it came to be.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.660
To start, one legend states it was 1899 when,
during the second half of a game between Notre

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.460
Dame and Northwestern with Notre Dame leading
five to nothing in Evanston, Illinois, the

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.980
fans started chanting “Kill the Fighting
Irish, Kill the Fighting Irish.”

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.530
Whether they failed to realize that Notre
Dame was French Catholic or simply just didn’t

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.450
care and were looking for a choice insult,
it didn’t matter.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.020
The nickname supposedly stuck from there.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.790
Another story, albeit a much kinder representation
of the nickname, goes that the name came from

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.980
the Union Army’s Fighting Irish 69th Regiment.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:13.960
Part of the larger Irish Brigade, they fought
with valor, bravery, and were brutally effective.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.280
They went into every battle with their colorfully
designed green battle flag.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.870
Legend has it that when President Lincoln
paid them a visit, he picked up a corner of

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.000
the green Irish flag, kissed it, and said,
“God bless the Irish flag.”

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.290
So, when the press saw these Notre Dame football
players play with toughness, courage, and

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.000
assuming they were also Irish, the nickname
that once belonged to the beloved 69th Regiment

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.220
was given.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.170
Yet another theory of how the nickname came
to be, this one with at least a tiny bit of

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.460
documented evidence, was from a game featuring
Notre Dame and Michigan in 1909.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.750
With Notre Dame trailing at the half to their
rivals, a player turned to some of his “Irish”

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.120
teammates (or at least had Irish names like
Dolan, Kelly, Glynn, and Duffy) and yelled

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.590
“”What’s the matter with you guys?

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.760
You’re all Irish and you’re not fighting
worth a lick.”

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.660
The team went on to win the game eleven to
three and the press attributed the victory

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.800
to the “Fighting Irish.”

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.380
After this 1909 match, Sportswriter E.A.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.840
Batchelor, supposedly having overheard the
aforementioned exchange, published an article

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.910
in the Detroit Free Press titled, “‘Shorty’
Longman’s Fighting Irishmen Humble the Wolverines

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:22.160
to Tune of 11 to 3,” giving us the first
known documented evidence of the team being

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.780
called by this nickname.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.080
He went on to write,

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:28.070
Eleven Fighting Irishman wrecked the Yost
machine this afternoon.

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.830
Three sons of Erin, individually and collectively
representing the University of Notre Dame,

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.860
not only beat the Michigan team, but dashed
some of Michigan’s greatest hopes and shattered

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.860
Michigan’s fairest dreams.

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.770
In the end, whether Batchelor really overheard
such an exchange; came up with the nickname

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.250
himself; or, perhaps more likely given he
uses the nickname casually as if the reader

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.560
should know exactly who he’s talking about,
had heard it elsewhere, the generally accepted

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.420
genesis of the name lies in the previously
mentioned popular association between Catholics

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.670
and the Irish.

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:01.650
Given Notre Dame had around this time gone
by the “Catholics,” among other monikers

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.970
like the “Terriers,” (with an Irish Terrier
during this time supposedly a staple on the

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:10.600
sidelines), it’s perhaps not much of a leap
to see how someone, perhaps Batchelor, perhaps

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:16.050
not, could have made the jump to “Irish,”
despite the school’s French origins and

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:17.740
mixed heritage athletes.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.080
This is particularly the case if it was indeed
initially meant as an insult, as it would

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:23.080
seem.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.310
Whatever the case, as you’d expect given
the prejudices of the day, the nickname was

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.550
not looked upon favorably by the University
brass.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.000
Besides the fact that it seemingly was originally
meant as an insult, this was a French Catholic

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.770
University, not Irish Catholic.

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:40.990
However, a little over a decade after Batchelor’s
article, the President of the University,

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:46.340
Father Bums, stated that even though the moniker
had been “discountenanced by the authorities

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:51.471
of the University,” at this point in time,
its “usage [was] in a playful spirit, no

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.250
offense being intended…”

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:57.180
With the nickname firmly embraced, despite
the negative connotations, soon, students,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.770
players, media, and even legendary coach Knute
Rockne were calling their beloved team the

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:02.190
“Fighting Irish.”

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:07.060
Noted Notre Dame alumnus Francis Wallace also
did his part in widely popularizing the moniker,

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.400
commonly using it in his 1920s New York Daily
News articles.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.340
With little choice and a nod to the complementary
aspects of the nickname- referring to the

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.550
athletes’ never say die spirit and scrappy
determination- University President Rev. Matthew

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:36.669
Walsh adopted “Fighting Irish” as Notre
Dame’s official nickname 

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:53.069
in 1927.
