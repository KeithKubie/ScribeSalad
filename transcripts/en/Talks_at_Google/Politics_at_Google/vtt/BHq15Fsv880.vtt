00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:09.740
MIKE DIAMOND: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.950
And thank you all for
coming to today's talk.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.400
My name is Mike Diamond, and
I'm a manager in the Google

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.410
Advertiser Platforms
Division, focusing

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.104
on programmatic strategy.

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.520
And I'm really
excited and honored

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.370
to be moderating today's talk.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.710
I've been a member of
the leadership council

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.500
for an organization
called Upwardly Global

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.900
for the past nine or so years.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.070
The organization helps
refugees and immigrants

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.440
find meaningful work
in the US that's

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.020
requisite with their
skills and experience.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.662
And when I think
about when I first

00:00:45.662 --> 00:00:47.120
got involved with
the organization,

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.960
it's amazing, because there
was really very little coverage

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.780
of refugees and immigrants.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.110
It took me a matter
of 5, 10 minutes

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.040
to truly explain the
organization's mission.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.800
But over the past year, with
the deluge of media attention,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.120
there's been an increasing focus
on refugees and immigrants,

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.030
not only in the US,
but around the world.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.830
And it's been quite a tumultuous
time for both of those groups.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.390
And refugees, in
particular, have

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.910
been in the spotlight,
both here and abroad,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.550
and for good reason.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.420
Worldwide displacement is
an absolute all-time high

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.250
with, simply, record numbers.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.120
They're staggering.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.040
One in nearly every 122
people around the globe

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.650
is either a refugee, internally
displaced, or seeking asylum.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.120
65 and 1/2 million people
have been forcibly displaced,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.160
which is a 60% increase
from just a decade ago.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.580
And over 22 million
of those are refugees.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.850
So today, we welcome
two guests who

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.210
can help us better
contextualize and understand

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.720
emerging stories in the media,
as well as our country's

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.350
rhetoric and policies
towards newcomers, really,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.440
new Americans.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.560
Our discussion today is going
to be focused on both refugees

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.510
and immigrants-- really who they
are, the workforce issues that

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.970
surround them, and our
country's policies towards them.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.540
We're going to hope to cover
US policy, as well as practices

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.290
with regards to resettlement of
both refugees and immigrants.

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.550
We'll talk about the differences
between refugees, asylum

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.440
seekers, migrants,
and immigrants,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.600
as we often don't
talk about the nuance

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.660
between those different groups
and finally, talk about some

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.510
of the support systems that
are here in America to support

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.717
these communities.

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:47.550
So without further ado,
let me introduce you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.730
to our two guests.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.970
First, Sussan Khozouri is the
Senior Director of Philanthropy

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.440
and Partnerships at the American
Jewish Joint Distribution

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.960
Committee, also
known as the JDC.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.390
She's had over 25 years
of experience working

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.736
in the refugee
humanitarian field

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:07.110
and, in the course
of her career,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.600
has worked for three of the nine
resettlement agencies in the US

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.350
in managing various aspects of
their resettlement programs.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.516
She attended Wellesley College
and also received her degree

00:03:25.516 --> 00:03:27.390
from the Fletcher School
of Law and Diplomacy

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.490
at Tufts University.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.210
Sitting next to me
is Nikki Cicerani,

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.250
who I've known for
many years and is

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.680
the CEO of Upwardly
Global, where she's worked

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.940
for the past eight-plus years.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.250
As we'll hear
later, Up-Glo's work

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.040
grew out of the
resettlement system

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.860
and is the first and
longest-serving organization

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.240
to support the integration of
skilled refugees and immigrants

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.970
into the US workforce.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.440
Nikki has received
her MBA from Columbia

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.400
and has a bachelor's degree in
policy analysis from Cornell.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.790
So to kick things off, I'd like
to just baseline a little bit

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.740
on resettlement as
a topic, in general.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.175
I'm going to turn to Sussan.

00:04:13.175 --> 00:04:17.200
I would love you to help us get
an understanding of the refugee

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.470
situation, both globally,
and here in the US,

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.250
and start to understand
why displacement

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.222
has grown so much over the past,
particularly, 10 years or so.

00:04:28.222 --> 00:04:30.010
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: OK.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.600
Hello, everybody.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.710
So I'll focus on
resettlement in the US.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.250
But just for perspective, the
situation right now in Syria

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:46.330
is definitely the thing
that has turned the pendulum

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.010
and really ramped up the
desperation and the situation

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.630
for refugees worldwide.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.510
But really, we live in
a world where there's

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.270
much less peace building.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.580
There's so much more
persecution than ever before.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.560
But also, we don't
address the root causes

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.080
so that people can go back.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.160
I mean, many of us remember
situations in Vietnam,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.100
in Bosnia, in Rwanda
where refugees

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.930
returned to their homes.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.950
There is less and
less of that today.

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.270
So today, we still see
millions of refugees

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.130
that have left Afghanistan.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.770
How many of you even remember
when Afghanistan happened?

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.080
That was way back in the 1980s.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.120
Some of you weren't even born.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.730
Sudan, Somalia--
all these things--

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.610
these refugee crises
were so protracted,

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.270
and we haven't dealt with the
peace building side of it.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.330
And so refugees are
just basically--

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.580
some of my colleagues
call it "warehoused"--

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.700
in refugee camps or in
cities around the world,

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.170
in poor countries, and
neighboring countries,

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.920
and that's just
persisted for so long.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.520
So there's been a build up, but
very few solutions at the root

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.650
causes.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.470
Very few refugees are resettled.

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.100
So of the numbers you
mentioned, Mike, maybe 1% only

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:03.950
get resettled.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.970
And it's like a
lottery in a sense.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.610
If you get out of
your country and have

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.420
a chance at third-country
resettlement, many refugees--

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.270
most of them, the bulk of them--
are in neighboring countries

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.210
where, really, it's
hard to welcome them

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.180
because the neighboring
countries are poor.

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.510
And it's just such
millions and millions

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:30.040
of people who need
jobs, need livelihoods,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.600
need food, clothing, et cetera.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.090
And refugees don't want to
be recipients of welfare.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.790
They want to be able to
have a chance at continuing

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:40.970
their lives.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.270
That's why organizations
like yours are so important,

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:46.120
but all of our work
is so important.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.080
So in the US, the US
Resettlement Program

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.930
traditionally has been
different than other countries

00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:00.020
because our focus is employment,
almost to our detriment.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.610
So the agencies-- there's
nine resettlement agencies

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:04.360
in America.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.290
There were more before
the fall of communism,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:09.640
but now there's nine.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.530
Most of them are faith-based,
and three of them are not.

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:19.120
So their Church World Service,
Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.300
Lutheran Immigration Refugee
Services, US Catholic

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.350
Conference, World Relief--

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.230
the evangelical group.

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:27.940
They don't proselytize.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.190
But the reason
they're important is

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.710
that there are churches
and constituents

00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:35.710
all over the country
that welcome refugees.

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:38.440
And the other three that
are nondenominational

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.720
are the International
Rescue Committee,

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.620
US Conference for Refugees, and
there is an Ethiopian group--

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:47.290
Ethiopian Community
and Development group

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.150
that does the same work--

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:50.380
committee.

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:55.450
So all of them have sponsors
around the country that

00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.770
help with the resettlement.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:59.650
So they have professional
staff and sponsor.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.840
Because the resettlement
program in America

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:04.420
is a private-public partnership.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:08.230
The idea is, it's so
important to welcome refugees

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:09.640
in your community.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:14.380
And you don't want to impact any
one community in the country.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.670
Usually, if refugees
had their choices,

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:19.390
they'd all go to
Florida, California--

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:21.760
because they're warm
in their minds--

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.700
and maybe New York
because it's so receptive.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.030
But welfare is such, in
some of these states,

00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:33.169
that it's so generous that,
really, the system is geared

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.320
in such a way that refugees
who don't have family members

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.039
usually have to go to
states where they have

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.320
hospitable communities
to welcome them

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.640
and to work with a professional
staff like these nine agencies.

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.280
And what we're
responsible for doing

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.910
is refugees are recognized as
refugees by state departments

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:55.430
overseas.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:58.670
It's asylum seekers that
come to the US borders,

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:00.830
but refugees are recognized.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:03.830
It's part of the
US foreign policy

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:07.560
to recognize people of
humanitarian concern to the US.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.240
So it's usually countries
that America realizes

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.300
are persecuting its
own populations.

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.820
The President of the
United States and Congress

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.480
set the ceilings, the numbers
of people who get to come in.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.900
And basically, they're
processed overseas.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.120
It's a long, long, long process.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:31.810
All of you have heard that
screening people for admissions

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.330
to the US is very
complicated because you

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:37.840
have to go through a lot
of security clearances.

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.320
Basically, you go through a
UN agency called the UN High

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.290
Commissioner for Refugees,
who, then, refers you

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:48.190
for resettlement to one of
many countries in the world.

00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.780
Your papers go through.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:52.550
Some refugees have
been there 10, 20,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:55.040
30 years before they
even arrive to America,

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.850
especially those
coming in from Africa.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.380
Some come in about
two, three years,

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:03.460
which is considered
very fast after waiting.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.480
And they come here.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.280
We receive them.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.250
The resettlement agencies,
basically, receive them

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:11.050
with sponsors in America.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:14.350
The responsibilities
are to get people

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.490
employed as soon as possible.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.270
And for that
reason, they usually

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.210
take very low-paying jobs.

00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:25.810
The bar is to try and get jobs
that will help people become

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:26.950
self-sufficient--

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.860
enough money to
pay for your rent.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.220
And basically, over
a longer time frame--

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.200
a longer arc in your life--

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.300
you start learning
the English, you

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.370
start doing all
those other things,

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:42.930
and you slowly, slowly
move up the ladder.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.370
So it's a difficult
thing, but that's

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:47.680
the emphasis of the US program.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.900
In some of the
countries in Europe,

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:52.570
they would rather a
refugee go on welfare

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.730
than get the job
of a local person.

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.100
But in the States, that's
not the way we do it.

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.910
We do it with a real emphasis
on early self-sufficiency.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.600
And so when refugees come in,
the resettlement agencies,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.450
within 90 to 120 days,
have to get you a job,

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.810
help you with an apartment.

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.490
And remember, it's not just
through state department money,

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:20.230
it's a lot of the goodwill of
American people and neighbors

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:21.760
and communities.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.880
Get you jobs, social
security numbers,

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.870
help enroll kids in school, help
connect you to your community

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:32.500
because nobody wants refugees
to live in isolation.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.310
You both want a host
community and a community

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.790
that might be existing--
like an ethnic community that

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:43.600
can speak the same language so
they can have access to food

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.350
that's familiar to them.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:49.180
So basically, the program
runs, for the most part,

00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:53.530
really beautifully, but with
the idea that you give people

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.060
the minimum.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:58.840
Over the long term, there
are other social services

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.670
that refugees can access--

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:04.640
state employment programs,
ESL programs, et cetera.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.760
And that goes on
for a long time.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.480
But it takes organizations
like Upwardly Global

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:15.040
that have that specific
understanding of what

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.360
kind of support system somebody
trying to get a new job

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.390
and move up in the
market really requires.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.580
And so organizations
like this are

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.660
more and more important to
make sure that refugees are not

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.440
an underclass.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.050
Because as Mike said,
they're new Americans.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.140
They are not refugees
when they arrive here.

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.210
We've selected them
as people who will

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.490
be part of our communities.

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:44.390
And many, many
contribute immediately.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.042
Sorry it was a long, long
response, but it's a big issue.

00:12:48.042 --> 00:12:50.000
MIKE DIAMOND: Can you
tell us a little bit more

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.280
about the profile of refugees?

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.610
So are they families,
Individuals--

00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.770
what does that look like?

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:57.650
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: OK.

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.840
So in general, it's a
difficult question to answer.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.760
The UN High Commissioner
for Refugees

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.232
used to have these posters and
says, "These are Refugees."

00:13:09.232 --> 00:13:10.940
And there would be
these little puppets--

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.860
pictures of anybody
you can imagine.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:18.030
So because, basically, when
you have a refugee crisis,

00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.250
it's everybody.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:23.360
So it could be anyone
who's a Muslim, anyone

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.750
who's a Christian, anyone who's
a Jew, and from all classes.

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:29.330
It doesn't discriminate.

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:32.390
Governments don't
discriminate just by class.

00:13:32.390 --> 00:13:35.270
So it's basically everyone.

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:38.900
More than half are
probably children.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.720
Most coming to the
US are families.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.980
There are situations and places
where single people are coming

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:51.890
primarily because of,
maybe, specific persecution

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.810
that a government has
inflicted on a certain group.

00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:56.780
But generally, it's
mostly families.

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:58.430
But it's everybody.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:02.840
It's carpenters, it's
journalists, it's everybody.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.557
It's anybody.

00:14:05.557 --> 00:14:07.140
MIKE DIAMOND: You
started mentioning--

00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:08.150
I know you've
worked for a number

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.710
of the resettlement
organizations.

00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:11.626
Can you tell us a little
bit about the process

00:14:11.626 --> 00:14:13.860
that those organizations go
through to help families,

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:14.967
to help individuals?

00:14:14.967 --> 00:14:15.800
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: OK.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:19.790
So most important is
having volunteers--

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.810
having people to
support refugees.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.020
That's one of the
most important things.

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.960
We usually rely-- so
again, another aspect

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:30.050
of the American program,
vis a vis refugees,

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.330
is priority is
given to people who

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.570
have family members in the
US, because they're obviously

00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:36.990
the biggest support system.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:39.680
And then your community
and volunteers

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.540
are the other support system.

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.120
So for church-based
organizations,

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.720
you can have many churches
helping with sponsorship--

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:53.600
so mentoring kids in
school, mentoring families,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.870
helping families-- there's
a lot of psychosocial issues

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.390
that maybe people are
suffering from-- isolation,

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:05.750
depression-- so it really
helps to be integrated.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:08.330
The church-based agencies
I've worked for often

00:15:08.330 --> 00:15:12.680
have used church sponsors
or community connections.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.860
But a church agency will
also work with a mosque

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.670
if you bring in a lot
of interfaith groups.

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:24.290
Because you don't want people
to just be labeled and just

00:15:24.290 --> 00:15:25.970
be ghettoized when they come.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.950
It's really so important.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:30.740
As many more people as you can
bring in, the more important

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.430
it is.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:33.920
And maybe the single
most important aspect

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.130
is financial, which is
helping people get jobs,

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.820
helping women with, maybe,
five children find childcare.

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:45.020
So they really-- the agencies
help with all of that very much

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.120
in the beginning.

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.940
The expectations of the
organizations are all the same.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:53.330
So whether I worked for
a church-based agency

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:55.790
or the International
Rescue Committee,

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:59.720
the basic fact is,
we all have to give

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.360
a certain standard of
service to make sure

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.560
that people are
self-sufficient or know

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.780
where to go and get services
so they're not on their own.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.500
Because there are a lot of
support systems from the state

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.890
that also are
available to people.

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:17.390
MIKE DIAMOND: And just a quick
follow-up-- how long do those

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:18.910
support systems last?

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:20.075
Does it differ?

00:16:20.075 --> 00:16:22.130
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: So
it's very short in terms

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:25.220
of the contract with which,
let's say, the resettlement

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.240
agencies have with
state departments.

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:32.190
So it's between 90 to 120 days
that the relationship really

00:16:32.190 --> 00:16:32.690
is there.

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:35.930
And then the rest of it
is referrals and passing

00:16:35.930 --> 00:16:39.890
things on to state and city
actors or private actors

00:16:39.890 --> 00:16:44.540
like Upwardly Global who come
in, and help out, and pick

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:48.590
people up to the next
step and next level.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.850
And some of the organizations
have longer-term contracts.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.740
They may have employment
contracts from the state

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:55.670
or from the city.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.000
Because there is an
understanding by many states

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.650
and cities that you require a
specific kind of understanding

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.190
and language
experience and cultural

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:11.145
experience to help
with these things.

00:17:11.145 --> 00:17:12.520
MIKE DIAMOND: In
your experience,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.519
what do you think some
of the biggest challenges

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:17.040
that the organizations
face as they're trying

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:18.567
to help some of these groups?

00:17:18.567 --> 00:17:19.400
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: OK.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:23.400
So today-- and I bet everyone
would have the same response

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:24.480
is--

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.720
it's just this feeling
of fear and feeling

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.130
that you're not welcome.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.620
I should also tell
you that refugees,

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.230
when they're fleeing
their countries,

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:39.580
very often don't want to
go to a Western country.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:40.871
And most people think they do.

00:17:40.871 --> 00:17:41.370
No.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.780
They want to be
right by their homes

00:17:43.780 --> 00:17:46.590
so they can go
back home tomorrow.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:49.590
And the fact is, after
10, 20 years, 5 years,

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:52.590
you stop thinking that, even
with the Syrian refugees.

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:55.830
It was very, very difficult
for the Western world

00:17:55.830 --> 00:18:00.290
to convince them that you
have been so persecuted,

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:02.980
you are unlikely
to go back home.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.520
You know, resettlement might
be the right thing for you.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.440
You have a chance at a new life.

00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.680
And most people make those
decisions for their children

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:15.810
because they know that
going back is not an option.

00:18:15.810 --> 00:18:21.740
So the challenges, to me,
are isolating people, fear,

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:25.880
which is part of what's
happening in today's rhetoric

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:26.900
about refugees.

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.170
I mean, the idea that you
can have a bag of Skittles

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:34.190
and one of them can
be dangerous is--

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.640
that creates fear.

00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.610
And that's not been
the history of America.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.090
So we talk about refugees,
but in America, there

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:44.960
have been so many groups that
have come in for hundreds

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.380
and hundreds of years.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.150
Even before there was an
official enactment of refugee

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.670
law, we've had
immigrants and refugees

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:54.920
coming since this
country started.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.430
And there's been backlash--
backlash against the Chinese,

00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:03.080
backlash against the Irish
backlash against the Italians--

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.710
I mean, hatred and vitriol
like we hear today--

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.000
so actually, I'm very positive.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.200
I feel this is part of a
trend that will change.

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.840
But I feel that there are
moments in our history

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.820
that this happens.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.520
But I really believe, and
what I've seen everywhere,

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:22.940
is there is something
unbelievable in America

00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:26.960
in terms of how America
welcomes the stranger because so

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.570
many Americans have had
the experience of being

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:34.430
a stranger themselves,
and it's unbelievable.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.040
So many of us and
our family members

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:40.550
have been recipients of
that kind of kindness.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.390
MIKE DIAMOND: It's nice to
hear some of that optimism.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:44.500
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: Yeah.

00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:46.379
I believe that genuinely.

00:19:46.379 --> 00:19:48.670
MIKE DIAMOND: One of the
things that's really struck me

00:19:48.670 --> 00:19:50.740
through my experience
with Upward Global was

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.550
how many refugees and
immigrants are highly educated

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.310
and are coming to this
country with years

00:19:57.310 --> 00:20:00.420
and years of experience
and university degrees.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.540
A stat that I've learned is,
roughly 28% of that community

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:06.320
has bachelor's
degrees or higher,

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.470
which is compared to roughly
29% of the US population.

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:14.680
The interesting thing is
that, despite that expertise,

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.315
despite that experience,
so many of these immigrants

00:20:18.315 --> 00:20:20.320
and refugees are
either unemployed

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.980
or, as Sussan alluded,
are underemployed,

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.160
which is a term we don't
really talk about a lot.

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.330
And so many of them
end up being very poor,

00:20:31.330 --> 00:20:36.440
and that is certainly not a
situation that they deserve.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:38.420
And so when I think
about Upwardly Global--

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:40.900
I want to kind of
transition over to Nikki

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:44.410
to talk about why
that problem exists,

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.396
and how do you think
you've addressed it,

00:20:46.396 --> 00:20:48.520
and how can other organizations
kind of address it?

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.590
NIKKI CICERANI: Sure, sure.

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:54.010
So I think it's easiest to talk
about the founding of Upwardly

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:55.280
Global because our founder--

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.160
and I'm not the founder
of the organization--

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.410
was working in
refugee resettlement.

00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:01.324
And while resettlement
happens through nine

00:21:01.324 --> 00:21:03.490
different volunteer agencies
throughout the country,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.070
the government also has
some national services

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.750
that help all of those volunteer
agencies do their jobs,

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:11.890
particularly with respect to,
as Sussan said, employment.

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.760
Our founder was working in that
employment technical assistance

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.460
to the volunteer agencies when
the first wave of Bosnians

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.510
came over.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:25.030
Now the Bosnian refugee cohort
was relatively highly educated.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.240
And it was in seeing that
the system was set up

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.850
to do, what Sussan said,
rapid-attachment jobs.

00:21:30.850 --> 00:21:34.180
Those jobs tended to be
low wage, low skill work.

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:36.460
And it was her experience
watching, literally,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:39.940
surgeons and engineers wind up
in the front lines of chicken

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:43.690
processing plants where they
were considered the best

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:48.010
employees in the organization,
but there was nothing left

00:21:48.010 --> 00:21:51.220
in the system to help them get
back into their trained fields.

00:21:51.220 --> 00:21:53.560
And our founder was sort
of spinning the narrative

00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:55.750
on its head, which
is, not only is it

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:59.020
an old, romanticized narrative
that the first generation comes

00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:01.660
and sacrifices so that the
next generation can enjoy

00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:03.304
the opportunities
of this country,

00:22:03.304 --> 00:22:05.220
and that that's a detriment
to the individual,

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.460
but that that's also a
detriment to the country.

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.010
So this was really at
the beginning in which--

00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.900
I mean, we've talked
more and more-- certainly

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.220
over the last decade
when I've been

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.680
with Upwardly Global-- about
a skills gap in the country.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.490
But the vision of our
founder was exactly that.

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:22.150
We're losing out on two sides
when we accept underemployment

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:24.730
and when the narrative
we build is encouraging

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:27.010
those who are coming
with skills to accept

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:28.449
their new station in life.

00:22:28.449 --> 00:22:30.490
And that was part of what
happened in the system,

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:32.530
that there was a bit of
a narrative that says,

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:34.540
look, your education
from your home country

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.040
may just not count here.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:39.070
Or the quicker you accept
your new station in life,

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:41.020
the better your
integration is going to go.

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.450
And Upwardly Global was
founded for that niche

00:22:43.450 --> 00:22:45.610
of the population
where we were trying

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.740
to change that
narrative by proving

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.950
that better outcomes were
possible for refugees and then,

00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:53.080
as we grew as an
organization, realizing

00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.320
that the problem existed
for a much broader swath

00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.600
of the immigrant population.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.750
So we exist because--

00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:03.340
despite the media
having you believe

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:05.800
that every immigrant in the
country might be undocumented

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.540
or coming through
the H1B process,

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.800
most people don't know--

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.840
we legally allow
about a million people

00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.720
into the country every year
through our regular immigration

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.350
channels.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.110
And so our primary immigration
policy in the country

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:19.000
is family reunification.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.640
We also, of course, have a
policy of refugee resettlement,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.400
where you're getting a skilled
population coming through,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:26.627
and then also, the
diversity card lottery.

00:23:26.627 --> 00:23:28.210
So through those
three channels alone,

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:29.980
you get a million
people coming in a year.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.470
And of the adult population
of that larger group,

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:36.100
you've got 48% who have
a bachelor's or better,

00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.860
and you have drastic
underemployment.

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.850
So on the whole, if you look at
everybody coming in, about one

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.610
in four wind up
under or unemployed.

00:23:45.610 --> 00:23:48.280
And then, if you look at
subgroups like refugees, those

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.150
coming from Africa,
Latin America,

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.950
Middle East-- it's much
more drastic than that.

00:23:53.950 --> 00:23:56.300
Why does that happen?

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.050
So if you start to think
about your own trajectory

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:02.260
as a professional, and you start
to think about what you needed

00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.614
in order to get where you're
going, some of those things

00:24:05.614 --> 00:24:07.780
will not be there for
somebody coming to the country

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.730
after they've been educated
and started their career.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:13.360
So the biggest thing that could
possibly be missing, of course,

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.040
is English language skills.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:17.230
And that's true for
about half the population

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.020
that wind up under or unemployed
is that their English is simply

00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.780
not sufficient.

00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:23.530
Now, that doesn't mean
that they're not fluent.

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:26.350
It means that, actually,
there's a big difference

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.700
between being good at English
and what they call very good.

00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.920
And I promise you, these
are technical terms.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.452
Good is where you can
actually be very conversant.

00:24:35.452 --> 00:24:36.910
Somebody understands
what you need,

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:38.830
understands how to give
it to you because you

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.450
can make yourself understood.

00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:42.857
Being very good actually
transgresses that,

00:24:42.857 --> 00:24:45.190
and it means you've actually
achieved a level of English

00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:47.106
where you're as likely
to speak it in the home

00:24:47.106 --> 00:24:49.499
as you are your home
country language.

00:24:49.499 --> 00:24:51.040
And it also means
that you understand

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.810
the contextualized
English of your field.

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.504
And so when you have
English barriers,

00:24:55.504 --> 00:24:57.670
I don't want everybody to
think that you have people

00:24:57.670 --> 00:24:59.230
who don't speak English at all.

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.990
That part of the problem is that
English is not moving people

00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:04.340
from that good to very good.

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.490
In addition to that, one
of the biggest barriers

00:25:06.490 --> 00:25:10.670
that newcomers face is a lack
of a professional network.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:15.220
Think about how you found
your job here at Google.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.887
It could be that a recruiter saw
you on LinkedIn and called you.

00:25:17.887 --> 00:25:20.053
It could be that they found
that profile on LinkedIn

00:25:20.053 --> 00:25:22.450
through somebody else they
were looking at on LinkedIn.

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:24.699
But in most cases, as we
progress through our careers,

00:25:24.699 --> 00:25:27.280
we use our network to find
our next job or an opening

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.210
in that job.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:29.140
When you come
through resettlement,

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.970
when you come through
family reunification,

00:25:30.970 --> 00:25:34.190
you are less likely to have
that professional network.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.670
And then, there's
other barriers.

00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:39.070
Acculturation--
the job search is

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.750
very different here
in the US than it

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.220
may be in other countries.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:44.077
So a very classic example--

00:25:44.077 --> 00:25:46.660
I don't know if we have anybody
who's educated outside the US,

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.660
experience outside the US--
but your résumé may have its

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:54.350
picture on it, marital
status, religious affiliation.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.010
It's not atypical to
have a five, six, seven,

00:25:57.010 --> 00:25:59.980
even eight-page résumé from
certain parts of the world.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.440
And then, if you just start
to think about the nuance

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.510
of American culture--

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:10.150
we are typically self-promoting,
meaning that we don't shy away

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.140
from talking about
accomplishments of yourself

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:14.040
or your team--

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.940
but that you have
to actually do that.

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.790
We express enthusiasm
about a job.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:21.590
We tend not to be as
hierarchical as other cultures.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:23.380
So our interview
processes require

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.050
that we ask the interviewer
questions-- things that

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.930
may feel odd coming from
other types of cultures

00:26:29.930 --> 00:26:32.110
where that's just not
done in the job search.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.810
And so what you have
is this no network,

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.630
résumé and a set of job search
skills that are not working

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.610
here, and then,
finally what you have,

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.544
is you have a misunderstanding
of foreign education.

00:26:42.544 --> 00:26:44.335
Foreign degrees just
simply, in most cases,

00:26:44.335 --> 00:26:48.820
is not as highly prized and/or
understood as a US degree.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.450
And so when you're coming
with a Middle Eastern name

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.880
and the University of
Baghdad on your resume,

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.920
an employer may see
that and simply not know

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.160
what to do with it.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.810
And that's the kind
of innocuous version.

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:04.510
And then the non-innocuous
one is subconscious and even

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:05.264
conscious bias.

00:27:05.264 --> 00:27:06.430
We're here in New York City.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.316
Sometimes it's hard for us to
really grasp that that happens.

00:27:09.316 --> 00:27:11.440
But I can tell you, we work
throughout the country,

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.620
Upwardly Global, and we
see, routinely, simply

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:16.910
bias in the hiring process.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:20.260
So that's why the problem
exists and who it exists for.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.060
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: The
refugees in America

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.760
are resettled in some 300
communities across the country.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.690
So you can imagine where
some of this plays out.

00:27:31.317 --> 00:27:33.400
MIKE DIAMOND: So one of
the interesting things is,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.660
there's been a big focus in
previous administrations,

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:39.430
particularly Obama
administration,

00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:44.460
around economic opportunity
and placing refugees

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.350
into their fields--

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.590
a program called
Partnership for Refugees.

00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:53.390
With nearly 6 million
open jobs in the country,

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:54.479
why do you think--

00:27:54.479 --> 00:27:56.020
what are some more
of the reasons why

00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.470
you feel like it's so difficult
for refugees to get placed,

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:00.290
both on the--

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:02.290
well, we've talked a lot
about the refugee side,

00:28:02.290 --> 00:28:04.498
but even more so, potentially,
on the corporate side,

00:28:04.498 --> 00:28:06.910
from your experience working
with some of the biggest

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:08.491
companies?

00:28:08.491 --> 00:28:09.490
NIKKI CICERANI: So yeah.

00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:11.781
So just to sort of juxtapose--
the Obama administration

00:28:11.781 --> 00:28:16.310
was very interested in immigrant
integration in the workforce.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.619
And so there was a
larger effort, broadly,

00:28:18.619 --> 00:28:20.410
for immigrants and
then, very specifically,

00:28:20.410 --> 00:28:24.220
to bring companies to
the refugee crisis--

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:27.176
a corporate response called
Partnership for Refugees.

00:28:27.176 --> 00:28:29.050
I think, largely,
companies don't necessarily

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.571
find this population as readily,
particularly the refugees,

00:28:31.571 --> 00:28:32.570
for a number of reasons.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.247
One is, they tend to have a
gap at the top of their resume.

00:28:35.247 --> 00:28:36.580
It could be a handful of months.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:39.560
It could be a number of years.

00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:44.290
And so if their most recent
job is actually stocking shoes

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:49.700
at Payless when, in fact, they
are an engineer of some sort--

00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.700
and we see all kinds--

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:56.290
it's unlikely that somebody
reviewing a résumé pool is

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.510
going to understand
why that gap exists.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.200
And we may make certain
assumptions about that gap.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.370
And simply, we're in
competitive markets, right?

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.560
How do we screen
lots of résumés?

00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.130
The second is, again, I think
a very large misunderstanding

00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:12.490
about the work authorization
of certain immigrant classes.

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.350
Refugees have a green card.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:16.270
They work without
visa sponsorship,

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:18.730
as do a number of
immigrant classes.

00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:22.300
So I can't tell you
how many times we've

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.480
worked with big companies,
Fortune 15 companies, that

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.760
have said to me, we
can only hire citizens.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.680
And I have to
delicately say, that's

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.900
actually an EEO violation.

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:35.710
Unless the position requires
security clearance where

00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:39.310
citizenship is necessary, for
most positions in the economy,

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:40.780
you're not allowed
to discriminate

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:42.809
between a green card
and citizenship.

00:29:42.809 --> 00:29:44.350
And so the
misunderstanding when they

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:47.200
see a foreign name
and a foreign degree

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.900
is that this person
will need sponsorship,

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.774
and we don't do that.

00:29:52.774 --> 00:29:54.940
And then the other thing
is, where are the channels?

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:59.320
Where are our companies
going for their talent?

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.780
So you work within networks.

00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.460
I'm sure, even here
at Google, right,

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:05.350
there's a strong
referral culture--

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:08.089
refer your friends-- if
you're smart and motivated.

00:30:08.089 --> 00:30:09.130
And they're coming again.

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:11.910
So what helps refugees
in the beginning

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:13.990
are ethnic enclaves--
that support them

00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:16.270
in language acquisition,
getting their kids in school,

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:17.950
ethnic groceries--
can also become

00:30:17.950 --> 00:30:21.520
isolating when they're not
connected to the mainstream.

00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:24.970
And so you do find this
gap between where they are

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:27.580
and companies saying
that they want talent,

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.130
but not necessarily knowing
where and how and how

00:30:30.130 --> 00:30:33.040
to evaluate within the
existing processes,

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.590
the talent pool that lies
within these 2 million highly

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:37.173
skilled, but
underemployed, immigrants

00:30:37.173 --> 00:30:38.714
and refugees in the country.

00:30:38.714 --> 00:30:40.380
MIKE DIAMOND: So I
guess, as a follow-up

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.560
to that, what are some of the
ways in which, at a policy

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:45.810
level, we're educating
corporate leaders to be

00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:47.490
able to understand
those groups better?

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:49.140
NIKKI CICERANI: Right.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.210
I think the larger
conversation right now is

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.707
about finding talent, period.

00:30:53.707 --> 00:30:55.290
So I think you see
a couple of things.

00:30:55.290 --> 00:30:56.910
I think you see
a larger movement

00:30:56.910 --> 00:31:00.262
to understanding that
diversity and inclusion happens

00:31:00.262 --> 00:31:02.220
in a lot of ways, that
we have to source talent

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.920
from a lot of venues.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.290
And in addition to that,
it's, I think, really

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:13.090
about companies embracing bias
as we see them trying to do

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:16.292
and really understanding
where they may have that bias.

00:31:16.292 --> 00:31:18.750
And then I think it's really
about understanding recruiting

00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.470
processes, and how often are
we really creating diversity

00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:25.800
through our processes
versus screening it out.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.330
But from a policy
standpoint, it's

00:31:27.330 --> 00:31:29.550
still at an individual
company level.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:32.040
This administration
has not sought

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.930
to catalyze the corporate
sector in, maybe,

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:36.420
the same way that the
last administration did.

00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:39.420
And so it's still at a very
individual company level.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.060
I think it's still under the
broader umbrella of companies

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.160
seeking talent and
being in a moment

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.630
where, how do you assess that?

00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:47.088
Could it come from
foreign degrees?

00:31:47.088 --> 00:31:48.240
Can it come from no degree?

00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.280
And we're seeing
this broader idea

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.530
that maybe we don't need
a degree for certain jobs

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.110
in the economy, and
we're just inflating

00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:57.450
what is necessary in
educational attainment

00:31:57.450 --> 00:32:00.550
to achieve certain
in-demand jobs.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:04.030
So I think that we're just
trying to thread ourselves

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.970
and the population into
the larger narrative

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.710
right now about where
talent is and how

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.196
we access it-- the things
we have to do to get at it.

00:32:11.196 --> 00:32:12.820
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: I
would just say that,

00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:16.870
at a really basic level, the
fear that's going on right

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:23.820
now-- this vilifying
immigrant communities,

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:26.820
this sense that
they're pariahs--

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:31.050
rather than looking
at people as assets--

00:32:31.050 --> 00:32:36.570
bringing in assets, bringing in
degrees, bringing in diversity,

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.760
bringing in diversity
in ethnicity,

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.990
but bringing in
diversity even in age.

00:32:42.990 --> 00:32:45.150
You know, America has
been very, very lucky

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:47.280
because we're a
young country because

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.540
of this influx of a million
new people every year.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.650
We're not Japan.

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:53.730
We're not Italy.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.360
We're not suffering
from a workforce

00:32:57.360 --> 00:32:59.940
to retirement ratio
like other countries.

00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:02.710
Because of this, there
are so many-- and in many,

00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:03.390
many places--

00:33:03.390 --> 00:33:04.890
I don't know where
you are all from,

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.260
but there are many
cities in America

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:10.050
that can talk about
being revitalized because

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:13.890
of new ethnic communities that
have come in, and are working,

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:18.570
and have brought work, and have
invested in private businesses.

00:33:18.570 --> 00:33:21.710
And so all of that's not
part of the conversation now.

00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:24.780
And really, I hear,
even from people--

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:29.430
I met recently with a couple
of people who are from Google

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:33.170
and whose husbands and
wives don't have jobs.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.330
But people are afraid to go
out now and look for jobs.

00:33:36.330 --> 00:33:39.180
Everyone is so afraid
of discrimination.

00:33:41.924 --> 00:33:44.340
NIKKI CICERANI: I'm not going
to overstate this statistic,

00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:46.500
understanding that
I'm at Google.

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.670
But we did start to
track-- we partner

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:49.920
with employers in our program.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.050
Our program focuses
largely on the soft skills

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.240
that immigrants need--
job search skills, resume,

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.310
interviewing, networking.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:34:00.240
And we've made those things
such that they can do them

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.030
in a self-paced way or that they
can have one-on-one advisory

00:34:03.030 --> 00:34:04.025
through our program.

00:34:04.025 --> 00:34:06.150
And then on the employer
side, we engage employers.

00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:08.100
We do training for them
on who the population is,

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:09.360
we do some anti-bias training.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:12.270
But we also engage employers
in volunteer opportunities.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:15.000
We've done it with Google
where employees actually

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.090
work as mock interviewers
to newcomers,

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:19.767
and they teach
them, really, what

00:34:19.767 --> 00:34:21.600
was good in the interview,
what wasn't, they

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:25.540
get formalized feedback, it goes
into their advisory process.

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:27.900
But we do also believe
in contact theory.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:29.460
And even in these
major markets--

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.730
Upwardly Global has a
footprint of about seven cities

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.440
throughout the US--
some like New York

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.400
and some like Boise, Idaho.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.730
And what's incredible is
that, uniformly across that,

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.530
contact theory holds--

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:45.540
that people will change their
minds and their attitudes

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.969
about a certain
population after having

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:50.977
had a personal experience
interacting with them.

00:34:50.977 --> 00:34:53.310
And what we have found is
that some companies come to us

00:34:53.310 --> 00:34:55.851
and say, we don't want to do
any of this employee engagement.

00:34:55.851 --> 00:34:56.750
Show us talent.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.500
And we've actually
measured how many times

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.750
we present a candidate
to how many times

00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.550
they, then, interview
a candidate presented.

00:35:03.550 --> 00:35:07.380
And we've, then, later gone
on to have employee engagement

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:12.030
with that company and measured
the present-to-interview ratio

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:15.990
and see enormous growth in
the present-to-interview ratio

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:18.240
once we have employee
engagement, meaning,

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.360
their employees or are
interacting with our job

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.570
seekers in a meaningful way.

00:35:25.276 --> 00:35:27.490
MIKE DIAMOND: One last
question before we open it up.

00:35:27.490 --> 00:35:29.670
And I think one of
the amazing things

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:31.420
has been watching
Upwardly Global's growth

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:33.910
over the past 10-plus
years, just in terms

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:35.620
of the amount of
job seekers they've

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.950
supported from
hundreds to thousands

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.082
in an individual year.

00:35:41.082 --> 00:35:42.790
I know that you've
done a lot of thinking

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:46.025
about how to scale the program
beyond that contact-specific

00:35:46.025 --> 00:35:46.525
piece.

00:35:46.525 --> 00:35:47.110
NIKKI CICERANI: Sure.

00:35:47.110 --> 00:35:47.960
MIKE DIAMOND: How
have you done that?

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:49.650
And with a Google
audience, we always

00:35:49.650 --> 00:35:52.987
think about bringing our
product to a wider audience.

00:35:52.987 --> 00:35:54.070
So how have you done that?

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:56.950
NIKKI CICERANI: Yeah, great.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:59.460
We did as any 21st century
company is doing it.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.730
We used to more technology.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:03.760
So a program that was started
out being very much in person

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.290
with training-- we
realized we have

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:08.570
a population that is very
inclined to use technology.

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:13.120
They are highly skilled
in their home countries.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.460
Anywhere between 30% and 40%
of them, in any given year,

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:18.510
have a master's or
better that work with us.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:20.930
And so we didn't have to
do trainings in person.

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.350
We could absolutely use
the best of online learning

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:24.530
and the best of technology.

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:27.010
So we've really tried
to take everything

00:36:27.010 --> 00:36:29.110
we were doing that we knew
were critical elements

00:36:29.110 --> 00:36:32.350
of the program and do as much
of what didn't need a human

00:36:32.350 --> 00:36:35.710
to do through
automation, technology,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:38.530
robust platforms, and robust
online learning management

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:39.427
functionality--

00:36:39.427 --> 00:36:41.260
I mean, to the point
where we actually now--

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:45.130
we were spending hours of human
time taking foreign resumes

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:46.900
and making them look
like US resumes.

00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.210
And now we just built
our resume builder tool.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:52.930
It just pulls it into a US-style
format, like, drop the picture,

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.090
and then interactive
trainings that teach you

00:36:55.090 --> 00:36:57.400
what information goes
where so that, at least,

00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:00.500
you can compete for the job.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.560
Our job is not to
get anybody a job.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.390
It's to give them
the tools to compete

00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:08.290
for the job, which I think
is very inherently American.

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:10.810
And we're now doing that
with a technology platform

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.940
and a portal that we
can license to partners

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:14.740
like the resettlement system.

00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.980
So if you are IRC and you
have X number of organizations

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:20.355
on the ground,
some of those will

00:37:20.355 --> 00:37:23.440
be receiving higher
volume of refugees

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.000
that are highly skilled.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.470
But the system's
not really set up,

00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:28.330
as we heard from
Sussan, to do that work.

00:37:28.330 --> 00:37:31.090
But some of them are
coming ready to go, today.

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.670
The Iraqis have all been
educated in English.

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:37.060
They speak English very well
if they went to university.

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:39.820
They don't need, necessarily,
to take a survival job.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.320
Some of them are
coming because they

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.880
served the US military forces.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:45.610
They know US culture
relatively well.

00:37:45.610 --> 00:37:47.410
So you can have
tools that, now, you

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:49.810
can just embed in the
existing system-- community

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:54.460
colleges, libraries, even the
federal workforce system is

00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.480
really geared towards
helping people get really

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.090
low-skill work or
mid-skill work now.

00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:03.610
You can actually offer
it through the system.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.610
They license the portal,
they license the resources,

00:38:06.610 --> 00:38:08.650
and we're scaling
our growth that way

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:12.170
through productizing
what we've done.

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:14.120
And I just want to say this--

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.220
keeping data on all
of it since day one.

00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.230
So the most fun
part of what we do--

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:20.000
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: I
was going to say that.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.541
NIKKI CICERANI:
--and that I'm really

00:38:21.541 --> 00:38:23.510
excited about for the
future, is that it's

00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:26.360
like these mini pathways for
those who come to the US.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.130
And the more data you
have, the more time

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:31.190
you can help them avoid
pathways that didn't work.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:33.980
A doctor who comes to
the US of a certain age,

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:36.530
with a certain background,
and a certain specialty

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:40.160
may have decision points
in their journey in the US.

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:41.780
Should they relicense
as a physician?

00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:44.360
Should they find
an alternate degree

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:46.185
that may take less time
and fewer resources

00:38:46.185 --> 00:38:48.510
and have a higher
degree of success?

00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:50.990
And we're going to start
to have enough data to look

00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.990
at where are they in the US--

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:54.200
where were they educated?

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:57.470
How long ago-- to give
them some analysis of what

00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:59.870
are the best ways for
them to pathway back

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.690
into professional careers
that use their skills

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:03.890
and their experience.

00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:06.230
And there, we are
doing a little test

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:09.140
with a Google big data product.

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.900
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: I would say
the data that distinguishes

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:15.680
Upwardly Global is incredible,
and it's the only way

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:19.340
to counter those stories
that keep circulating.

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.890
I mean, I'm a huge
fan because of this.

00:39:21.890 --> 00:39:24.680
I mean, it really
distinguishes Upwardly Global

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:28.510
from any other service provider
in this field, I think,

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:30.476
in this niche.

00:39:30.476 --> 00:39:32.970
MIKE DIAMOND: Really
exciting stuff.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.860
So I do want to open it
up for audience questions.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.030
And feel free to
please come to the mic

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:40.730
because we are
recording this talk.

00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:43.050
So we'll open it up to you guys.

00:39:45.654 --> 00:39:46.500
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.850
That was so great.

00:39:47.850 --> 00:39:51.860
So my question is, do you
guys have a clear end goal

00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:54.980
that you're trying to
achieve for any given refugee

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.060
or immigrant?

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.800
What would be
considered a success?

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.160
Would it be a success if,
say, this doctor who came over

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.720
became a lab tech?

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:06.407
Would it be only a success
if he was still working

00:40:06.407 --> 00:40:07.490
in the medical profession?

00:40:07.490 --> 00:40:09.800
Or maybe, would it be
considered a success

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:13.070
if maybe his kids eventually
went to a really great college

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:17.090
and eventually went
on to medical school?

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:18.905
How are you measuring
your progress?

00:40:18.905 --> 00:40:22.102
NIKKI CICERANI: That's
a great question.

00:40:22.102 --> 00:40:24.310
So we've thought about this
problem a number of ways.

00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:28.190
And I'm sort of trained
with an economics brain,

00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:30.080
so mine is like optimization.

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:32.420
When are we optimized?

00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:33.982
We have decided,
as Upwardly Global,

00:40:33.982 --> 00:40:35.690
that we're sort of in
a turn of the wheel

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.930
where our goal is at least
creating a high-quality system

00:40:38.930 --> 00:40:40.820
of nonvulnerable support.

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.410
And that's a fancy
way of saying,

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:44.480
no matter where
you land in the US,

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.240
you should not be without a
resource that can support you,

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.250
understanding where
and how to rebuild

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.780
your professional career.

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:52.629
And so this is sort
of the phase we're in.

00:40:52.629 --> 00:40:54.920
While we've done that, though,
and because of the data,

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:57.620
what we have is a large
body of information

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.470
on licensing and relicensing.

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.800
What are the barriers, who's
relicensing, how easily?

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:06.290
Because remember for professions
like doctors, dentists,

00:41:06.290 --> 00:41:08.720
lawyers, civil engineers--

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:10.790
and it's governed by state.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:14.990
It's not even a national policy
that, where you land in the US,

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.050
may predict the ease with
which you can relicense.

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:20.900
And so I think, for us,
this first turn of the wheel

00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:24.440
is about getting what we have
into the system in a way that

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:26.390
is not vulnerable and
ubiquitous and to be

00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:28.460
able to collect the data on it.

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:30.230
And the second turn
of the wheel would

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:33.500
be optimizing for
understanding the policies

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.770
around certification.

00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:38.300
So who's getting jobs?

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.470
Who needs to recertify?

00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:42.260
And if they are in in-demand
fields where certification

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:45.710
is necessary, what and
how is most helping them

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:47.180
obtain those certifications?

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:49.430
In some cases, it's
financial support.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:41:53.330
They don't have the $800
to take a Coursera course.

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:56.840
Again, we're being supported by
Google to sort of fix that gap.

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.390
In some cases, it's a
little more sophisticated.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:03.080
It's just simply a very long,
arduous process to recertify,

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:06.500
and there's not necessarily a
benefit to the recertification.

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.810
It's that the
professional bodies

00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:11.900
that govern these industries
stand in the way--

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.910
so a very classic example--

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:16.730
not to throw the physician's
assistance under the bus--

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:19.712
but a doctor could easily
apply their training

00:42:19.712 --> 00:42:21.920
in their home country to
become a physician assistant

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.420
in the US.

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:24.230
Where the four
years that somebody

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:26.960
with no medical training
would need could be shortened.

00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.250
But the physician assistant
professional industry group

00:42:31.250 --> 00:42:35.000
holds tight that none of that
previous medical training

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.690
or experience can apply towards
a physician assistant degree.

00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:40.580
And there, hopefully,
over time, our data

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:44.210
will help, if there's a
movement in the advocacy world

00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:47.570
to be pushing for the
relicensing barriers

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:48.530
to be lowered.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.600
For me, it would be
that, wherever somebody

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:53.900
has a skill that can
contribute to the economy,

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.786
we're not letting an issue of
their ability to compete stand

00:42:56.786 --> 00:42:58.160
in the way, and
we're not letting

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.070
an issue of financial resources
to obtain the proper licensing

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.152
stand in the way.

00:43:02.152 --> 00:43:03.860
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: If
I could just respond.

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:05.960
So I would responded
a little bit more

00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:08.540
broadly about the
settlement, right?

00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:10.730
It's also about integration.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:13.410
And I can't emphasize
that enough.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:15.710
So what Nikki's
addressing is something

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:19.910
much more as a systematic
response overall, right?

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:23.180
The resettlement agencies
may get some people certified

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:27.950
because some of the
volunteers or support groups

00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:29.960
may have that extra
money to do this.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.940
But she doesn't want it
to be something ad hoc.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:37.330
She wants this to be something
systematic that people have.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:42.910
But the arc, the trajectory that
the resettlement agencies have

00:43:42.910 --> 00:43:44.890
is the long term,
which is, we've

00:43:44.890 --> 00:43:49.060
seen refugees and immigrant
communities over a long term.

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:52.770
So I always say to
refugees, yesterday was bad,

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:55.180
today may be bad, but
tomorrow will be better.

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.600
It's that idea of the
improvement is gradual,

00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.340
but it happens,
and they definitely

00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:01.730
see it with their families.

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:06.040
But not letting people be
isolated is so critical.

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.010
Because America will
suffer if we make

00:44:09.010 --> 00:44:11.110
people afraid and isolated.

00:44:11.110 --> 00:44:13.250
And we're seeing that
in countries in Europe.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.460
And the reason we don't
have those problems

00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.660
is we have absorbed people
well for hundreds of years.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:22.810
We shouldn't be afraid
of absorbing people.

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:24.352
AUDIENCE: Well, thank you.

00:44:24.352 --> 00:44:25.336
NIKKI CICERANI: Thanks.

00:44:25.336 --> 00:44:26.100
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:44:30.010 --> 00:44:34.370
I would guess that the more
time people spend languishing

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:36.230
in refugee camps,
probably the worse it

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:37.790
is for the eventual outcomes.

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:39.885
Is that something you've
seen from the evidence?

00:44:39.885 --> 00:44:40.760
NIKKI CICERANI: Yeah.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.790
Particularly the older they
are when their journey starts.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.750
So young people do better.

00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:49.570
We've seen young folks
complete university pre

00:44:49.570 --> 00:44:53.030
or during, even, time
in a refugee camp,

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:54.281
and then come out.

00:44:54.281 --> 00:44:56.030
And because they're
still young, companies

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:57.560
will take a chance on them.

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.370
Those-- our experience
and our data,

00:44:59.370 --> 00:45:00.460
I'm talking-- you can
probably talk about the field,

00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:00.580
in general.

00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:01.790
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: I'll let
him finish his question.

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:03.290
NIKKI CICERANI: --is
that we've seen,

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.000
the older they are when
they get in a refugee camp,

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.980
and the longer they stay
there, it is, indeed, harder

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:07.820
when they get out.

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.071
That's what we've experienced.

00:45:09.071 --> 00:45:10.653
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: Is
that the question?

00:45:10.653 --> 00:45:12.350
Were you going to
add something else?

00:45:12.350 --> 00:45:12.933
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:45:12.933 --> 00:45:16.730
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: So there
are more and more programs

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:21.140
overseas that we call
livelihoods programs.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:24.330
People are so anxious,
even psychologically.

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:25.610
So imagine if you're in a--

00:45:25.610 --> 00:45:28.250
not just a camp,
but even a city--

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:32.120
where you're just a
welfare recipient.

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:34.130
And you just want
to be in control

00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:35.960
of your life and your family.

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.520
You want a chance at a skill,
at a job, at something.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:44.210
And actually, Google supports
a lot of workforce livelihood

00:45:44.210 --> 00:45:46.800
programs all around the world.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:48.770
My organization,
even in a program

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:54.320
in Israel for minorities in that
country, has Google support.

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:58.220
But it's so important for
people, even psychologically,

00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.080
to feel they have a
skill, to have a chance.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:05.570
But the need is so much
greater than the resources

00:46:05.570 --> 00:46:08.360
out there to give
people, either the skills

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:10.262
or the jobs that they need.

00:46:10.262 --> 00:46:10.970
But you're right.

00:46:10.970 --> 00:46:13.970
And adolescents are
particularly vulnerable, right?

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:17.300
Because they're growing
up in this vacuum.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.110
And that's so scary
because idle adolescents,

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:23.430
even in our own homes,
aren't a good thing.

00:46:23.430 --> 00:46:26.377
Can you imagine in that
kind of environment?

00:46:26.377 --> 00:46:27.210
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:27.210 --> 00:46:28.065
NIKKI CICERANI: Exactly right.

00:46:28.065 --> 00:46:29.439
SUSSAN KHOZOURI:
Or young adults.

00:46:31.947 --> 00:46:33.530
AUDIENCE: I just
want to say thank you

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:35.690
because your outlook on
this is very positive,

00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:36.890
and it's a great
narrative, actually.

00:46:36.890 --> 00:46:38.973
As somebody who's worked
with adolescent refugees,

00:46:38.973 --> 00:46:41.576
it's pretty dire.

00:46:41.576 --> 00:46:42.950
Obviously, there's
a lot that can

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:46.442
be done with data and technology
and the idea of building

00:46:46.442 --> 00:46:47.900
resumes and all of
this, but I want

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.490
to touch a little
bit more, again,

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:50.570
on what you were
talking about in terms

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:51.569
of networking and stuff.

00:46:51.569 --> 00:46:53.900
Because I feel like even
for people born here

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.400
and everything,
that's a huge issue.

00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:58.130
And their getting jobs-- and if
you could go a little bit more

00:46:58.130 --> 00:47:01.820
into the work that you do and,
potentially, the more work that

00:47:01.820 --> 00:47:04.820
could be done in terms of
working with the refugees,

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:08.600
integrating, creating networking
opportunities for them.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:10.875
Because you could be the
best qualified person

00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:13.270
and have a Spic and
Span resume, and if you

00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:15.020
don't know the right
people, it's just not

00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:16.019
going to happen for you.

00:47:16.019 --> 00:47:18.810
NIKKI CICERANI: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:22.720
I mean, I'll talk
about two things there.

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.620
One is just teaching.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.920
Again, the gap in the system
is helping newcomers understand

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:31.110
that networking is
necessary, that it's

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:33.120
a part of how we look
for jobs, and we do it

00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:35.940
outside of our family or
our immediate community.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:38.190
So in other cultures,
networking might happen,

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.310
but it might happen in
a little bit more of--

00:47:40.310 --> 00:47:42.450
it's family or it's
immediate community.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.520
So education is a
piece of the puzzle--

00:47:44.520 --> 00:47:47.580
just that it's done, getting
people comfortable with doing

00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:51.700
it with US expectations.

00:47:51.700 --> 00:47:54.490
Two, is the use of LinkedIn
from an educational standpoint.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.130
So again, we just do training
on how to use LinkedIn,

00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:59.600
how to do your profile, how
to optimize your profile.

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.530
LinkedIn helps us with that.

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:07.410
I think the third about
networks is a little bit more

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:08.950
of a systematic too.

00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:13.330
When we see, like, how are you
going to get people hooked in?

00:48:13.330 --> 00:48:14.449
And so I think two things.

00:48:14.449 --> 00:48:16.240
I think that there's
a systematic response,

00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.910
and I think there's a
community or movement response.

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:20.770
The systematic
response would be,

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:23.860
wouldn't it be great if the
resettlement system could

00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:27.359
get everybody a LinkedIn profile
as they're starting, right?

00:48:27.359 --> 00:48:28.900
And I think that
the badging movement

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.360
might start to help similarly.

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.090
But in the same way, you
have to have communities

00:48:34.090 --> 00:48:37.090
that are opening their arms
and saying, we're here to help.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:39.970
It's got to be a community
or movement-type response.

00:48:39.970 --> 00:48:42.370
And I actually do think
you see that response.

00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:45.747
Companies were very engaged
after the refugee crisis here

00:48:45.747 --> 00:48:47.830
and, in some cases,
internationally, about saying,

00:48:47.830 --> 00:48:49.500
how can we help?

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:51.250
And I think that idea
that you're actually

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:55.270
extending a hand, specifically,
as social capital--

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:57.410
first, in helping them
understand what's expected,

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.950
but then, in extending
social capital.

00:48:59.950 --> 00:49:01.630
And I know it's
exactly as you say.

00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:03.640
It's not technology.

00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:05.530
It is the part of
the work that still

00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:07.870
has to be done because
it's values-based,

00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:09.850
it's what we believe
is right to do,

00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:13.810
and because we're acting as
communities that are being

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:17.530
compassionate as
well as thoughtful

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:20.114
about economic integration
and its benefits.

00:49:20.114 --> 00:49:21.780
I don't know if you
want to add to that.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:23.740
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: So
tell me the emphasis

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.325
of your question again.

00:49:25.325 --> 00:49:29.120
AUDIENCE: Just the idea
of how you can take this--

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.200
it's almost the most ephemeral
part of getting someone a job

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:32.980
in the US.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:34.280
And you can't just figure--

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:37.030
there's no specific
process to it,

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:39.616
no matter how you try in terms
of networking and helping

00:49:39.616 --> 00:49:40.990
people with jobs
that way, given,

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:44.860
so much success in terms
of hiring and all of that

00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:46.695
is driven by that very element.

00:49:46.695 --> 00:49:49.570
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: So
I think maybe Nikki

00:49:49.570 --> 00:49:52.480
was alluding to it when she
said the community response.

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:55.540
But living in New
York, you really

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:59.870
see these themes of
different communities

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:01.440
that have specific jobs.

00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.590
So the superintendents are--

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:05.100
I don't want to
say these things--

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:06.950
but are from a
certain ethnic group.

00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:14.400
Or the people who work in places
that might be in the gas places

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:14.900
are from--

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.600
so people talk to each other--

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:19.940
technology, social
media has helped.

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.740
WhatsApp really helps.

00:50:21.740 --> 00:50:25.130
And organizations,
humanitarian organizations,

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:27.260
resettlement
agencies like IRC are

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:31.430
trying to work very hard in
using technology to really help

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:35.090
people in terms
of locating jobs,

00:50:35.090 --> 00:50:38.150
helping people in many,
many creative ways.

00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:40.120
But I think people really--

00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:43.040
so the really neat things
is refugees and immigrants

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:45.420
are resourceful, and
they're so smart,

00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.930
and they know how to
survive and succeed.

00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:51.230
We just have to be careful that
they're not so afraid to be

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:55.150
here, right, and so that
they don't turn inward,

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:58.130
but that they go ahead and
embrace the challenges that

00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.937
are out there.

00:50:59.937 --> 00:51:02.020
I don't know if I answered
you, but I think that--

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:02.990
AUDIENCE: You did.

00:51:02.990 --> 00:51:06.650
There's a whole other question
about empathy from the existing

00:51:06.650 --> 00:51:09.300
communities here, but that's
for a huge dissertation.

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.758
SUSSAN KHOZOURI:
But I have to say,

00:51:10.758 --> 00:51:12.980
again, I would say,
on the positive side--

00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:16.370
so all the agencies
that do this work--

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:18.470
and definitely the
resettlement agencies,

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:22.070
but I'm guessing even the
agencies that go beyond

00:51:22.070 --> 00:51:23.630
resettlement--

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:27.530
the amount of support
that the American people

00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:32.000
gave with their hands and
feet in terms of volunteers

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.850
and with their pockets
in terms of money--

00:51:34.850 --> 00:51:38.300
when the rhetoric is ramping
up, the support systems

00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.670
for refugees really are amazing.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:44.120
They're just not aware of it
because it doesn't get press.

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:46.440
They just keep hearing
all the bad stuff.

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:50.630
But in America, the protections,
the support systems--

00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:54.110
it's incredible, the
goodwill of America

00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:57.990
towards these
individuals, I think.

00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:59.030
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:02.853
I hope you're right.

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:03.469
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:03.469 --> 00:52:04.260
NIKKI CICERANI: Hi.

00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:05.093
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: Hi.

00:52:05.093 --> 00:52:07.730
AUDIENCE: Do you have hard
or soft on what employers

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:10.940
find are the challenges in
terms of considering refugees

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.000
or immigrants into bringing
them into their organizations?

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.750
And is that something that
you've been able to write down?

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.030
Or is that found in a
certain location, in terms

00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:22.145
of what challenges,
on the employer side?

00:52:22.145 --> 00:52:23.570
NIKKI CICERANI: Yeah.

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:25.580
AUDIENCE: And do you
have any particular--

00:52:25.580 --> 00:52:25.963
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: You
start, and I'll--

00:52:25.963 --> 00:52:26.754
NIKKI CICERANI: OK.

00:52:26.754 --> 00:52:27.350
Sure.

00:52:27.350 --> 00:52:29.090
Yeah.

00:52:29.090 --> 00:52:31.250
And to your question
about hard or soft data,

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:32.540
it's been soft until now.

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.240
We just did the first
sort of official report.

00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.982
Oliver Wyman, actually, did a
third-party report on it first.

00:52:37.982 --> 00:52:39.690
That's embargoed for
a couple more weeks.

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:41.835
But I can give
you some headlines

00:52:41.835 --> 00:52:43.870
to what we thought
was going to be there

00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:45.370
and that we've heard
over the years.

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.470
One is that, it's very hard to
take an alternative candidate

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:49.460
and advocate for them.

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:52.682
There is risk involved
in that as an HR manager

00:52:52.682 --> 00:52:54.140
and, even, sometimes
as an employee

00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.910
who's advocating
for a candidate.

00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:59.490
So that gap at the top of
the resume, that education--

00:52:59.490 --> 00:53:02.430
there's no US professional
experience on their resume.

00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:05.900
So making a case for that
candidate feels risky.

00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:07.610
And in fact, one of
the things that we've

00:53:07.610 --> 00:53:10.190
experimented with
significantly over the years

00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:13.700
is pushing for contract
work and measuring

00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:17.090
how much of our contract work
turns into full-time work

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:18.710
for our job seekers.

00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:22.400
And so we've seen about a 69%
conversion rate over the years

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.020
from contract to full time.

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:27.290
And that's because people
perceive lower risk

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:29.720
with time-bound contract work.

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.750
And so that risk
perception is very high.

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:34.917
And getting somebody
who feels safe bringing

00:53:34.917 --> 00:53:37.250
an alternative candidate in,
and making a case for them,

00:53:37.250 --> 00:53:39.890
and probably who feels
safe failing at having

00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:41.840
somebody fully integrate.

00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.870
Then the practical challenge of
it, after that, I think really

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:48.600
has to do with acculturation
and mentorship.

00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:52.239
So is there a culture of
mentorship within that company?

00:53:52.239 --> 00:53:54.530
We've found where there's a
real culture of mentorship,

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:56.121
they do a lot better.

00:53:56.121 --> 00:53:57.620
We've also found
that companies that

00:53:57.620 --> 00:54:01.460
have a lot of internationally
trained people at the top

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.480
just--

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.130
the accent is not a problem.

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:05.870
The fact that
"their" and "there"

00:54:05.870 --> 00:54:08.180
gets spelled wrong and
emails is not a problem--

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:10.449
like what may be--

00:54:10.449 --> 00:54:11.740
my mother's an English teacher.

00:54:11.740 --> 00:54:13.910
And even when I say confusing
"their" with "there,"

00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:16.264
I'm like-- my
anxiety rises, right?

00:54:16.264 --> 00:54:17.930
But you know, we work
with a major bank.

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:19.310
They're an international bank.

00:54:19.310 --> 00:54:23.576
And they hire folks
like crazy, like crazy.

00:54:23.576 --> 00:54:25.700
Because it's just not--
those things are different.

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.610
And the culture of mentorship
is very strong there.

00:54:28.610 --> 00:54:32.000
I think on the true side,
communication and acculturation

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.580
is a long and, in some
cases, slow process.

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.120
And so, I think, where
we've seen employers tell us

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:42.290
they're struggling is
the job seeker is in,

00:54:42.290 --> 00:54:46.250
but they're not doing
particularly well in advancing.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:47.780
They're staying right there.

00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:49.490
And so it's because
they don't understand

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:52.460
the nuance of managing up,
or they don't understand

00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:55.910
the nuance of communications,
or because more communications

00:54:55.910 --> 00:54:57.890
has to be done remotely.

00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:59.644
And it's just not been
a long enough time,

00:54:59.644 --> 00:55:01.310
or they're not coming
along fast enough.

00:55:01.310 --> 00:55:03.070
And that's just a reality.

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:06.680
So part of, as we've
grown, what we've done

00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:10.490
is to put more in our
resources for, both companies

00:55:10.490 --> 00:55:12.914
and for the immigrants,
once they have their job.

00:55:12.914 --> 00:55:13.580
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:14.080
OK, great.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:15.620
So there are resources for once

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.220
you've actually
confirmed [? that-- ?]

00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.720
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:20.720
NIKKI CICERANI: Exactly.

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:23.810
Well, we've got
5,000 alumni now,

00:55:23.810 --> 00:55:26.307
and we're adding them at
a clip about 1,000 a year.

00:55:26.307 --> 00:55:28.140
And that's when we were
sort of like, uh-oh.

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:29.500
We have a new problem.

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:32.630
We've got alumni who have to
succeed in order to make way

00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:35.644
for those coming in.

00:55:35.644 --> 00:55:38.040
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: I think some
of what Nikki talked about

00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:42.980
is also true for American-born
people who are struggling

00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:45.050
in these survival jobs.

00:55:45.050 --> 00:55:47.720
I would just say, from a
resettlement perspective,

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.800
I think the mentoring
is very important.

00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:52.700
But many resettlement
agencies try

00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:55.550
to work with companies
or employers that

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:58.370
will accept a liaison
for a period to make

00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:59.980
sure there aren't any problems.

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:02.210
And a lot of
employers would like

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:05.240
to have somebody to go to
and talk about these things.

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.190
And then you bring
in people who, maybe,

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:10.710
somebody who's wearing hijab or
somebody wants to go to pray.

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:15.790
And for these communities,
it's nice to have other people

00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:18.380
from their parts of the
world at that same place

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.650
so that they're not
the only ones there.

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:21.482
But that's just--

00:56:21.482 --> 00:56:23.315
AUDIENCE: Are there
resources to help set up

00:56:23.315 --> 00:56:27.370
those liaisons between foreign
companies and stuff like that?

00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:28.994
Or is that something
that companies

00:56:28.994 --> 00:56:29.910
define for themselves?

00:56:29.910 --> 00:56:31.878
How does that--

00:56:31.878 --> 00:56:36.070
NIKKI CICERANI: We do that in
a very bespoke way right now.

00:56:36.070 --> 00:56:38.760
As we've evolved our
model to be technology,

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.130
and they've all been scalable.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.129
We focus, first, on the
job-seeker side of this,

00:56:42.129 --> 00:56:44.610
and then we still
do custom stuff

00:56:44.610 --> 00:56:45.841
like that with our companies.

00:56:45.841 --> 00:56:47.382
Whereas, the second
turn of the wheel

00:56:47.382 --> 00:56:50.000
is about enabling companies
to have a playbook

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.610
and/or resources that would
do training internally--

00:56:53.610 --> 00:56:56.210
cross-cultural training
for those who are

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:58.630
going to play that liaise role.

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:00.702
SUSSAN KHOZOURI:
So the newcomers,

00:57:00.702 --> 00:57:03.700
and refugees in particular,
the resettlement agency, very

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:06.200
often, will try to do this.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:09.270
And also, the whole push
for, take your first job

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:12.430
so you have some record of
having that job showing up

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:15.820
to work, to us, is so important
in the beginning, right?

00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:20.370
It's a very different place than
by the time Nikki may see them.

00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:22.754
AUDIENCE: I guess this is
kind of related to what

00:57:22.754 --> 00:57:23.920
you were just talking about.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:27.462
When you were mentioning
the eight-page resume with

00:57:27.462 --> 00:57:32.716
the details that an interviewer
cannot legally ask about.

00:57:32.716 --> 00:57:36.020
It makes me wonder
because I am the child

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:37.323
of Italian immigrants.

00:57:37.323 --> 00:57:41.770
And even now, I sometimes
have a difficult time

00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:48.260
explaining to them how
certain things work here, even

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:51.470
as opposed to my previous job.

00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:58.010
Google [AUDIO OUT] slow ramp
up in comparison [AUDIO OUT]

00:57:58.010 --> 00:58:02.030
other software firms that
I've worked for in the past.

00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:07.010
So my question is,
how difficult is it

00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:16.028
to teach the job seekers how
different American customs,

00:58:16.028 --> 00:58:19.880
regarding employment are,
and how difficult is it

00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:24.570
for that information
to be retained?

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:27.024
I'm not sure how
else to explain it.

00:58:27.024 --> 00:58:28.190
SUSSAN KHOZOURI: [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:29.390
NIKKI CICERANI: Yeah.

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:32.590
Well, adults are
experiential learners.

00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:35.780
And so when we say we try to
make as much available online

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:39.245
that they can be self-paced in
and use the time that we have

00:58:39.245 --> 00:58:41.620
with the humans that we have
to raise money for and pay--

00:58:41.620 --> 00:58:43.020
to practice.

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:45.320
And in fact, many of the
things that we practice

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.960
are the things that
feel unnatural.

00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:53.690
So like you said, Italians--
and I'm speaking as one--

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:56.720
if we were coming over from
Italy, perhaps the ways

00:58:56.720 --> 00:58:58.560
in which we would
approach a job search,

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.185
we would have to turn
some things down,

00:59:00.185 --> 00:59:03.170
amp some things up, and
those are the things

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:04.580
that we spend time practicing.

00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:07.095
Because we found-- and it
is largely documented--

00:59:07.095 --> 00:59:10.530
that adults learn by doing.

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:14.370
So we did a lot of
information sharing

00:59:14.370 --> 00:59:15.510
through online learning.

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:18.060
We spend a lot of our
in-person human resource

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:21.410
time on the practice in order
to ingrain those behaviors.

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:23.290
And in fact, we
continue to try to use,

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:24.665
and are looking
forward to using,

00:59:24.665 --> 00:59:27.050
more technology that gives
positive feedback when

00:59:27.050 --> 00:59:30.330
the right behaviors
are demonstrated.

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:33.460
So when you say,
how hard is it, it

00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.650
does also become a
very individual thing.

00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:39.000
I've seen 67-year-old
engineers come to us

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:43.140
and just decide they get
it, and they're gonna do it,

00:59:43.140 --> 00:59:46.290
and they have a job quickly.

00:59:46.290 --> 00:59:50.720
And I've seen a
30-year-old Iraqi man--

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:52.895
you know, just-- he's
not in this space.

00:59:52.895 --> 00:59:57.717
He's-- usually, a refugee,
and they're struggling.

00:59:57.717 --> 00:59:59.300
They're struggling
with acculturation,

00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.996
it's not their
moment, and I've seen

01:00:00.996 --> 01:00:02.790
them take a very long
time in the program.

01:00:02.790 --> 01:00:05.340
They're simply not
ready yet to accept

01:00:05.340 --> 01:00:07.520
that this is the way it
is or something like that.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:11.470
So I would hate to make
generalizations based on age.

01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:15.522
I tend to think it's about where
we meet people in there journey

01:00:15.522 --> 01:00:17.160
or in their process.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:19.570
But that, it is always,
for me, what I've seen

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:23.183
is practice and time on task
for adults yields results.

01:00:23.183 --> 01:00:26.890
AUDIENCE: And then
when you say that,

01:00:26.890 --> 01:00:30.718
but also talking about
these automated tools that

01:00:30.718 --> 01:00:34.500
you're building like the
résumé builder, like--

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:39.590
somebody gives on a résumé their
religious affiliation on it,

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:44.280
you have to say, you can't have
that on an American résumé.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.020
And that's different,
because now,

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:53.300
you're not really doing anything
personal with them directly.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.270
How do you deal
with that scenario?

01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:59.340
NIKKI CICERANI: [? Best of ?]
online learning is my response

01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:01.015
and then an advisor.

01:01:01.015 --> 01:01:02.370
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:04.670
NIKKI CICERANI: Like,
online learning--

01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:05.630
it's interactive.

01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:08.260
They see a person come on,
and they say, look, in the US,

01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:12.380
we tend not to share
personal information.

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:14.480
This is what a US
résumé would look like.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:16.600
And then, we have a help line.

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:19.130
So if somebody's not
progressing in their training,

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:20.750
we get a notification
they've stopped.

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:23.108
We then use part of
our help-line capacity

01:01:23.108 --> 01:01:25.370
to understand why
they've stopped.

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:28.560
And if it's that, again,
they're not trusting,

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.530
they need to hear a human
voice for a second--

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:31.532
we've had that happen.

01:01:31.532 --> 01:01:33.822
I had somebody who--
he told me, he's

01:01:33.822 --> 01:01:36.206
like, you guys don't know
what you're talking about.

01:01:36.206 --> 01:01:39.370
I even remember his summary.

01:01:39.370 --> 01:01:41.940
He wrote-- and I don't
know where it went wrong

01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:45.660
in the translation, but his lead
in was, I'm an awkward leader.

01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:48.070
And I tried desperately
to say, the picture has

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:49.400
got to come off, and awkward--

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.950
I think we're going for
a different word here.

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.002
And he didn't get a response
from the job market.

01:01:55.002 --> 01:01:58.295
And he came back a couple
of weeks later, [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:58.295 --> 01:02:00.770
AUDIENCE: I can relate to that.

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:03.740
Thank you.

01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:06.710
MIKE DIAMOND: So are
there any more questions?

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:13.400
If not-- I just want thank you.
[? Thank you ?] for coming.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.750
[APPLAUSE]
