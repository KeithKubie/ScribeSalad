00:00:00.303 --> 00:00:02.341
Let's say that we've got the function

00:00:02.341 --> 00:00:06.302
f of x is equal to eight times the
natural log of x minus x squared

00:00:06.302 --> 00:00:09.400
and it is defined over the closed
interval between one and four,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:10.500
so it's a closed interval.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.431
it also includes one and it includes four.

00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:16.006
You can view this as the
domain of our function

00:00:16.006 --> 00:00:17.806
as we have defined it.

00:00:17.806 --> 00:00:20.998
So given this, given this
information, this function definition,

00:00:20.998 --> 00:00:23.465
what I would like you
to do is come up with

00:00:23.465 --> 00:00:33.650
the absolute, absolute
maximum value, value of f,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.922
of f as defined where f is
defined right over here,

00:00:37.922 --> 00:00:40.173
where f is defined on
this closed interval.

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.283
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:42.283 --> 00:00:45.200
and think about it on your own.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.965
So the extreme value theorem tells us,

00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.528
look, we've got some closed
interval - I'm going to

00:00:50.528 --> 00:00:53.471
speak in generalities here -
so let's say that's our X axis

00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:55.426
and let's say we have some
function that's defined

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:57.169
on a closed interval.

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:58.807
We have a couple of
different scenarios for what

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:01.851
that function might look
like on that closed interval.

00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:05.030
So, we might hit a maximum
point, we might hit a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.874
maximum point, at the
beginning of the interval,

00:01:07.874 --> 00:01:09.529
something like that.

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:12.203
We might hit an absolute
maximum point at the end

00:01:12.203 --> 00:01:15.843
of the interval, so it might
look something like this,

00:01:15.843 --> 00:01:17.721
so that's at the end of the interval.

00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:21.979
Or, we might hit an absolute
maximum point someplace in between

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.479
and that could look something like this,

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.391
it could look like this,

00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:30.566
and at this maximum
point, the slope of the

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:35.872
tangent line is zero, so
here the derivative is zero,

00:01:35.872 --> 00:01:38.403
or we could have a maximum
point someplace in between

00:01:38.403 --> 00:01:40.874
that looks like this.

00:01:40.874 --> 00:01:44.342
And if it looks like this,
then here the derivative

00:01:44.342 --> 00:01:45.488
would be undefined.

00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:47.649
There's a lot of different tangent lines

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.021
that you could place, that you
could place right over there.

00:01:52.021 --> 00:01:54.309
So, what we need to do is, let's test.

00:01:54.309 --> 00:01:55.962
Let's test the different endpoints.

00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:58.005
Let's test the function at the beginning,

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:00.259
let's test the function at
the end of the interval,

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.764
and then let's see if there's any points

00:02:01.764 --> 00:02:03.749
where the derivative is either zero or

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:06.294
the derivative is undefined.

00:02:06.294 --> 00:02:07.825
And these points where
the derivative is either

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:10.377
zero it is undefined,
we've seen them before,

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:12.830
we call these, of
course, critical numbers.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.028
So this would be either,
in either case actually,

00:02:15.028 --> 00:02:17.334
if we assume that that's
happening to the same number,

00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:19.851
we would call that a critical number.

00:02:19.851 --> 00:02:22.893
Critical - a critical number.

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:24.273
So those are the different candidates.

00:02:24.273 --> 00:02:26.880
Now you could have a critical
number in between that,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.976
where, say, the slope is
zero, say something like this,

00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:30.569
but it is at the maximum or minimum.

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.360
But what we can do is, if we can
find all the critical numbers,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.385
we can then test the affect,
the function of the value

00:02:37.385 --> 00:02:38.869
of the critical numbers and the function

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.107
of the value at the
endpoints and we can see

00:02:40.107 --> 00:02:41.145
which of those are the largest.

00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:43.664
All of those are the
possible candidates for

00:02:43.664 --> 00:02:46.599
where f hits a maximum value.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.586
So, first we could think about
- well actually, let's just,

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:52.962
let's find the critical numbers
first, since we have to do it.

00:02:52.962 --> 00:02:54.201
So, let's take the derivative of f.

00:02:54.201 --> 00:02:56.487
f prime of x is going to be equal to the

00:02:56.487 --> 00:02:58.961
derivative of the natural
log of x is one over x.

00:02:58.961 --> 00:03:02.057
so it's going to be eight over x minus 2x

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.427
and let's set that equal to zero.

00:03:04.427 --> 00:03:08.388
So if we focus on this part
right over here, we could add

00:03:08.388 --> 00:03:12.732
2x to both sides and we would
get eight over x is equal to 2x.

00:03:12.732 --> 00:03:15.420
Multiply both sides by x,

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.765
we get eight is equal to 2x squared.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:23.096
Divide both sides by two, you
get four is equal to x squared.

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:25.132
And if we were just purely
solving this equation,

00:03:25.132 --> 00:03:28.203
we would get x is equal
to plus or minus two.

00:03:28.203 --> 00:03:30.297
Now, we are saying that the
function is only defined

00:03:30.297 --> 00:03:33.555
over this interval, so negative
two is a part of its domain,

00:03:33.555 --> 00:03:37.023
so we are only going to
focus on x is equal to two.

00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:41.159
This right over here is
definitely a critical number.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.667
Now, have we found all
of the critical numbers?

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:44.370
Critical numbers.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.765
Well, this is the only number
other than negative two,

00:03:46.765 --> 00:03:48.434
the only number in the
interval that will make

00:03:48.434 --> 00:03:50.980
f prime of x equal to zero.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.892
What about where it's undefined?

00:03:52.892 --> 00:03:55.110
Well, f prime of x would be
undefined, the only place where

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.723
it would be undefined is if you
stuck a zero right over here

00:03:57.723 --> 00:04:01.426
in the denominator, but zero is
not in the interval, so the only

00:04:01.426 --> 00:04:04.274
critical number in the
interval is x equals two.

00:04:04.274 --> 00:04:07.601
So, now we just have to test f
at the different endpoints and

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.952
at the critical number and see
which of those is the highest.

00:04:09.952 --> 00:04:13.242
So, we're going to test
f of one, f of one,

00:04:13.242 --> 00:04:16.324
which is equal to eight
times the natural log of one

00:04:16.324 --> 00:04:18.269
minus one squared.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.851
We'll test f of four,
which is equal to eight

00:04:21.851 --> 00:04:25.868
times the natural log of
four minus four squared,

00:04:25.868 --> 00:04:29.111
which is, of course, 16, which is 16.

00:04:29.111 --> 00:04:31.226
And we're going to test f of 2.

00:04:31.226 --> 00:04:33.412
So these are the endpoints
and this is a critical number.

00:04:33.412 --> 00:04:40.164
Eight times the natural log
of two minus two squared.

00:04:40.164 --> 00:04:43.309
Now, which of these is
going to be the largest?

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:44.573
And it might be tempting
to get a calculator out,

00:04:44.573 --> 00:04:46.739
but actually let's see if we
can get a little intuition here.

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:51.947
So this is, the natural log of
one is zero, e to the zero power

00:04:51.947 --> 00:04:53.378
is equal to one.

00:04:53.378 --> 00:04:57.705
So eight times zero is zero, so
this evaluates to negative one.

00:04:57.705 --> 00:04:59.534
Now, let's see, what
does this evaluate to?

00:04:59.534 --> 00:05:05.786
The natural log of four, e is two
point seven, on and on and on,

00:05:05.786 --> 00:05:09.999
so this number is going
to be between one and two

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:13.395
so it's going to be between one and two,

00:05:13.395 --> 00:05:15.506
and it's actually going to
be, well, between one and two,

00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:17.217
you multiply that times
eight and you're going

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.555
to be between eight and 16,

00:05:19.555 --> 00:05:23.499
and then you subtract
16, so that means you're

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:27.683
going to be between
zero and negative eight.

00:05:27.683 --> 00:05:30.604
So, okay, so that, it's not
clear, at least not without using

00:05:30.604 --> 00:05:33.254
a calculator, or this very rough
way, which of these is larger.

00:05:33.254 --> 00:05:35.427
Both of these are
negative numbers, though.

00:05:35.427 --> 00:05:36.666
Now, what about this?

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:38.003
The natural log of two.

00:05:38.003 --> 00:05:40.621
The natural log of two is
going to be some fraction.

00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:45.860
It's going to be more than half,
it's going to be more than half,

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.493
And since it's more than
half, this whole thing

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:48.984
is going to be more than four, which means

00:05:48.984 --> 00:05:51.635
this whole thing is going to be positive.

00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:54.502
So this is negative, this is
negative, this is positive.

00:05:54.502 --> 00:05:56.380
And these are only critical
numbers, these are only

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:58.513
candidates for our maximum value,

00:05:58.513 --> 00:05:59.613
so I would go with this one.

00:05:59.613 --> 00:06:02.200
Our maximum, our maximum value happens

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.613
when x is equal to two,
and that maximum value is

00:06:05.613 --> 00:06:09.228
eight natural log of two minus four.

00:06:09.228 --> 00:06:14.930
That is the absolute maximum
value, absolute max value

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.773
over the interval, or I guess we could say

00:06:16.773 --> 00:06:19.218
over the domain that this
function has defined.

00:06:19.218 --> 00:06:23.016
If we want to verify it with a
calculator we, of course, could.

00:06:23.016 --> 00:06:26.000
So, we already figured out this
one, but let's see, f of four,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.377
eight natural log of four minus
16 is equal to negative five.

00:06:34.377 --> 00:06:37.903
So that's, that's, this is definitely not,

00:06:37.903 --> 00:06:40.639
this one is definitely
not the maximum value.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:46.863
And then f of two is eight
natural log of two minus four

00:06:46.863 --> 00:06:51.115
which, as we said, is
indeed a positive number.

00:06:51.115 --> 00:06:54.940
So feel pretty good about what we did.
