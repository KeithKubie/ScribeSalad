00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.041
The greatest challenge a vampire hunter 
can take on

00:00:11.041 --> 00:00:14.631
is to bring sunlight 
into a vampire's lair.

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:18.921
You’ve stealthily descended into the 
darkness of a vampire cave,

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:22.299
setting a sequence of mirrors as you go.

00:00:22.299 --> 00:00:25.219
When the sun reaches 
the right angle in the sky,

00:00:25.219 --> 00:00:28.919
a focused beam of light will ricochet 
along the mirrors,

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:30.459
strike your diffuser,

00:00:30.459 --> 00:00:34.499
and illuminate the great chamber 
where the vampires sleep.

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:36.099
You set the final mirror

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:40.009
and sneak through an opening 
in the corner of the great chamber.

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:42.169
The diffuser must be wall-mounted,

00:00:42.169 --> 00:00:44.749
but the walls are crowded with coffins,

00:00:44.749 --> 00:00:46.799
which you don’t dare disturb.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.549
The only open spots are in the other 
three corners of the room.

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:56.165
The light will enter through the southwest
corner at a 45 degree angle

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:59.615
and bounce off the perfectly smooth 
metallic walls

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:02.605
until it hits one of the 
other three corners.

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:04.345
But which corner will it hit?

00:01:04.345 --> 00:01:10.845
You know the room is a rectangle 49 meters
wide and 78 meters long.

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:12.740
You could probably find the answer

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.070
by drawing a scale model of the room 
and tracing the path of the light,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.803
but the sun will be in its 
place in just minutes,

00:01:19.803 --> 00:01:22.513
and you’ve got no time to spare.

00:01:22.513 --> 00:01:25.483
Fortunately, there’s a different way
to solve this puzzle

00:01:25.483 --> 00:01:28.103
that’s both simple and elegant.

00:01:28.103 --> 00:01:31.263
So in which corner should 
you place the diffuser

00:01:31.263 --> 00:01:34.213
to flood the vampire lair with sunlight?

00:01:34.213 --> 00:01:36.933
Pause the video if you want to figure
it out for yourself.

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:38.933
Answer in 2

00:01:38.933 --> 00:01:41.273
Answer in 1

00:01:42.025 --> 00:01:45.385
You could tackle this problem 
by examining smaller rooms,

00:01:45.385 --> 00:01:48.215
and you’d find a lot 
of interesting patterns.

00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:53.485
But there’s one insight that can unravel 
this riddle in almost no time at all.

00:01:53.485 --> 00:01:56.006
Let’s draw the chamber 
on a coordinate grid,

00:01:56.006 --> 00:01:59.056
with the Southwest corner 
at the point (0,0).

00:01:59.056 --> 00:02:00.846
The light passes through grid points

00:02:00.846 --> 00:02:05.256
with coordinates that are either 
both even or both odd.

00:02:05.256 --> 00:02:10.181
This is true even after it bounces off 
one or more walls.

00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:12.654
Another way of thinking about it is this:

00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:16.034
since the light travels at a 
45 degree angle,

00:02:16.034 --> 00:02:19.764
it always crosses the diagonal 
of a unit square.

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:23.394
Traveling 1 meter horizontally 
changes the x coordinate

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:26.324
from even to odd or vice versa.

00:02:26.324 --> 00:02:29.444
Traveling 1 meter vertically 
changes the y coordinate

00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:31.994
from even to odd or vice versa.

00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:36.944
Traveling diagonally – as the light 
does here – does both at once,

00:02:36.944 --> 00:02:41.334
so the x and y coordinates of any points 
the light passes through

00:02:41.334 --> 00:02:44.742
must be both even, or both odd.

00:02:44.742 --> 00:02:48.100
This observation is more 
powerful than it seems.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.310
In particular, it means that we have a 
way to identify the kinds of points

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.472
the light won’t ever go through

00:02:54.472 --> 00:02:57.692
If one of the coordinates is even 
and the other is odd,

00:02:57.692 --> 00:02:59.112
the light will miss them.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.472
That means it’ll miss the top 
two corners of the room,

00:03:02.472 --> 00:03:06.412
since those points have one even 
and one odd coordinate.

00:03:06.412 --> 00:03:10.732
The Southeast corner is the 
only option for the diffuser.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:14.442
And indeed, when that precious 
beam of sunlight enters the hall,

00:03:14.442 --> 00:03:15.972
it bounces between the walls

00:03:15.972 --> 00:03:19.342
and strikes the Southeast corner, spot on.

00:03:19.342 --> 00:03:21.632
The vampires, sensing the intrusion,

00:03:21.632 --> 00:03:25.282
burst from their coffins 
and turn to dust in the light.

00:03:25.282 --> 00:03:27.682
It was a “high stakes” test,

00:03:27.682 --> 00:03:31.132
and you passed with flying colors.
