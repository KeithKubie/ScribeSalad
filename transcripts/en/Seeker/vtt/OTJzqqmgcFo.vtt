“You darn kids with your e-pads and your
i-books!

00:00:03.289 --> 00:00:08.700
In my day words were on dead trees and they
didn’t keep us up all night!”

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.410
Calm down angry grandpa I just made up, the
right e-reader will still let you get to bed

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.679
by 6 pm.

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.840
Hello bibliophiles, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.560
You’ve probably seen some stories recently
warning you that your e-reader is plotting

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.130
to give you insomnia and maybe cancer.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.039
These articles are stemming from a recent
study published December 22nd in the Proceedings

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.960
of the National Academy of Sciences.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.020
In the study 12 subjects each read books either
in paper form or an ipad for 4 hours a night,

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.250
5 nights in a row.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.640
The next week they would switch to the other
format and spend another 5 nights reading

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.060
for 4 hours before bed.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.600
Talk about a great excuse to re-read the Harry
Potter series.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.020
The study found that those who read on the
newfangled ipads took longer to fall asleep,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.149
spent less time in REM, and woke up feeling
more tired.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.559
The hypothesis is the short-wavelength or
blue light from the ipad inhibited the release

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.250
of melatonin in the subjects, and this is
all based on solid science.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.560
Melatonin is a hormone synthesized from the
amino acid tryptophan and it makes you feel

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.560
sleepy.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.520
If you’re American you’re probably familiar
with the myth that thanksgiving turkey makes

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.340
you sleepy because of the tryptophan.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.790
Let’s put that rumor to bed right now, because
turkey actually has slightly less tryptophan

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.790
than chicken.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.780
Anyway, an enzyme with a really long name
I can’t pronounce so we’ll call it AANAT

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.590
is key for turning tryptophan into melatonin.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.270
And as it turns out, AANAT’s gene responds
directly to light.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.930
Given recent evidence of a link between melatonin
suppression and increased risk of breast cancer,

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.400
colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer, the
researchers of this study warn that using

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.689
an e-reader like an ipad before bed could
have bigger impacts than grogginess the next

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:45.689
day.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.939
But before everyone freaks out and sets their
kindles on fire, there is an important nuance

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:54.200
that David Meyer of Gigaom points out; this
study only uses an ipad, at full brightness.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.720
It doesn’t examine other e-readers like
my ancient kindle that still needs a reading

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.200
lamp, or newer devices that are front-lit
like the Kindle Paperwite or the Nook GlowLight.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.900
We don’t know if these other ebooks are
better, but it’s not fair to lump them all

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.869
together because they don’t work the same.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.120
The study didn’t dial down the backlight
of the ipads either, so it’s possible that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.920
dimming them down will allow more melatonin
to be released.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.760
As we love to say here on DNews, more research
is needed.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.650
Of course if you notice you’ve been having
trouble sleeping after reading off your tablet,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.540
maybe try one of the other methods or tone
the brightness down a little.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.370
If you’re still having trouble, try reading
your school’s required books.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.849
Those always knocked me right out.

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.370
Of course an e-book will always be missing
something we just love about their paper predecessors;

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.980
that old book smell.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.660
Trace explains why we like that over here.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.660
Have you guys had trouble sleeping after using
a dedicated ebook?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.459
Or have you had trouble retaining information
when you didn’t with regular books?

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.099
Let us know in the comments and I’ll see
you next time on DNews.
