00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.759
think of my world you and I think that

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769
think of my world you and I think that
 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.669
think of my world you and I think that

in itself sounds quite grand but I think
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.019
in itself sounds quite grand but I think
that if I were to say anything about the

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029
that if I were to say anything about the
 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.900
that if I were to say anything about the
way that I see the wall I think that one

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
way that I see the wall I think that one
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.750
way that I see the wall I think that one
of the most important elements to

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
of the most important elements to
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.290
of the most important elements to
remember is cultural sensitivity that

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300
remember is cultural sensitivity that
 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.080
remember is cultural sensitivity that
when we deal with when we have

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
when we deal with when we have
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.510
when we deal with when we have
relationships with other people in other

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520
relationships with other people in other
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.389
relationships with other people in other
parts of the world I think that we can

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399
parts of the world I think that we can
 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.030
parts of the world I think that we can
never assume that what we think we're

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
never assume that what we think we're
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.479
never assume that what we think we're
communicating is in fact how they see it

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
communicating is in fact how they see it
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.000
communicating is in fact how they see it
but I think it that's what I've learned

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010
but I think it that's what I've learned
 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.670
but I think it that's what I've learned
from living in different places around

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680
from living in different places around
 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.600
from living in different places around
the world and also being of I guess by

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610
the world and also being of I guess by
 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.330
the world and also being of I guess by
cultural being bicultural I think that

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340
cultural being bicultural I think that
 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.040
cultural being bicultural I think that
that's the one thing that has influenced

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050
that's the one thing that has influenced
 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.229
that's the one thing that has influenced
all of the work that I do I think that

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
all of the work that I do I think that
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.679
all of the work that I do I think that
one of the one of the interesting things

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
one of the one of the interesting things
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.200
one of the one of the interesting things
about working with people who are based

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210
about working with people who are based
 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.080
about working with people who are based
across the world is the way that you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
across the world is the way that you
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.890
across the world is the way that you
have to modify either your behavior or

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900
have to modify either your behavior or
 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.249
have to modify either your behavior or
the way that you communicate to suit

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259
the way that you communicate to suit
 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.590
the way that you communicate to suit
that local environment and I think that

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600
that local environment and I think that
 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.609
that local environment and I think that
especially in Asia where people are

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619
especially in Asia where people are
 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.950
especially in Asia where people are
often coming from a totally different

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
often coming from a totally different
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.840
often coming from a totally different
cultural background with totally

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
cultural background with totally
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.580
cultural background with totally
different expectations of how you might

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
different expectations of how you might
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.280
different expectations of how you might
behave I think that that's both one of

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290
behave I think that that's both one of
 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.980
behave I think that that's both one of
the challenges of what what we do but

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990
the challenges of what what we do but
 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.630
the challenges of what what we do but
also one of the wonderful kind of

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640
also one of the wonderful kind of
 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.450
also one of the wonderful kind of
abilities to engage with others while

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
abilities to engage with others while
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.359
abilities to engage with others while
there might not be one specific instance

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
there might not be one specific instance
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.069
there might not be one specific instance
I would say that it's more about

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079
I would say that it's more about
 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:07.730
I would say that it's more about
learning how to kind of fun how to fit

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
learning how to kind of fun how to fit
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:16.140
learning how to kind of fun how to fit
in a different

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.209
you
