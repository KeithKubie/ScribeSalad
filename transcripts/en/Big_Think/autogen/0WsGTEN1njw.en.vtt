at what data can do I think right now we

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
at what data can do I think right now we
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090
at what data can do I think right now we
have people on the gun on one side of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
have people on the gun on one side of
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.240

both those arguments would seem to be a
 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.950
both those arguments would seem to be a
little bit naive but we can't really get

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
little bit naive but we can't really get
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.510
little bit naive but we can't really get
to a better place because we don't have

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
to a better place because we don't have
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.390
