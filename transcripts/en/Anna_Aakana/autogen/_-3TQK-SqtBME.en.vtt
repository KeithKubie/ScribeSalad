00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:03.800
Are you gonna tell us where the bomb is?

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.960
Or are we gonna have to beat it out of you?

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.780
No.  No, you don't have to beat me.  Please.  I'll tell you.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.880
It's four three two

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.840
nine two

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.200
eight one two one nine.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:14.600
...what?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.040
I...what?

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.980
The coordinates.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.120
(gasps) Oh...shoot.

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.920
Did you write that down?

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.180
No, I thought he was just like giving us his phone number or something.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.720
I don't have a pen and paper, do you have one?

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.920
No, I left my purse in the car.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.400
Uhm.  The bomb is going to go off in like a minute.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.180
The only thing I asked you to bring today was a pen and paper.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.780
I know!  But there's like nowhere to put it!  This thing is so tight.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.400
I don't know--in your bra!

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.260
That would give me a boob bulge.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.880
You know, I just want to point out that a lot of people are going to die if we don't disarm this bomb soon.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.080
Ok, ok!  Yes.  So maybe--could you just repeat those coordinates one more time?

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.900
Yea yea, totally.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.680
432-92-81219

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.780
432-81...

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.080
I think it was 91.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.320
This is so many numbers to memorize, we're never gonna do it.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.720
Oh!  Why don't we turn it into as song?

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.120
(gasps) I love songs!

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.940
Ok, sorry.  Could you just repeat it one more time?

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.060
432.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.440
432!

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.060
92.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.600
92!

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.300
81219.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.240
(together) 81219!

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.380
432! 92! 81219!

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.320
Oh shit.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.120
That's not where he was.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.860
Wow.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.960
*sigh*

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.920
We should go find the bomb!

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.560
Oh!  Let's find that bomb!

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.120
Are you sure this is right?

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.800
Yes!  431-92-81219

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.460
*explosion and screaming*

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.380
*police sirens*
