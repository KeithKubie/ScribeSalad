00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.280
So let's have a small quiz and see whether you can remember why can testing

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.250
guarantee that that a refactoring is behavior is

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.590
preserving. So why testing can only show the

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.080
absence of defects and not their presence?

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.960
Is that because testing and refactoring are different

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.980
activities? Because testing is inherently incomplete? Or, just

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.560
because testers are often inexperienced? Make your choice.
