00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:23.570
We’ve talked before about animals who’ve
gone above and beyond what you’d normally

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.190
expect animals to be capable of like that
cat that works for the British government

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:32.090
and a baboon who worked as a (surprisingly
good) signalman for a railway company.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.829
In each case special accommodations were made
for the animals to better help them do their

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.199
duties; but what accommodations are made when
an animal has, shall we say, higher aspirations

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:43.839
and enters the world of politics?

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.149
As it turns out, not all that many.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.960
This is largely because, in every example
of an animal being elected to office we could

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.059
find, the position the animal held was ceremonial
in nature.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.710
And in perhaps the most famous case, saying
the animal is even the honorary mayor is somewhat

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.760
of a stretch.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.729
Case in point, you may have heard of Stubbs,
a cat who has supposedly been the elected

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.980
mayor of a small town in Alaska called Talkeetna
since 1997.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.140
There are several variations of Stubbs’
story though the most commonly touted version

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.640
is that Stubbs became mayor after residents,
dissatisfied with the human candidates running

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.780
for office, elected him as a write in candidate.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.430
In actuality Stubbs holds no official position;
the whole him-being-mayor-thing is, as one

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.799
Alaskan resident bluntly put it, “a PR scam”.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.540
Stubbs was never elected on any write-in ballot
because there was never an election in the

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.540
first place.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.920
Stubbs isn’t the elected mayor, or even
the elected honorary mayor.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.420
He’s a marketing stunt perpetrated by the
townsfolk of Talkeetna thanks to a small,

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.439
but thriving cottage industry that has sprung
up around their most famous feline resident.

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.509
Along with some stores selling souvenirs with
Stubbs’ face on them, the town has also

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.329
seen an uptick in tourism to the tune of 30
or 40 people a day hoping to meet the “mayor”.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.600
In other words, it’s in the best interests
of Talkeetna to play up to the notoriety of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.299
being a town with an elected feline mayor.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.799
A similar story is that of Bosco Ramos, a
black lab rottweiler mix who was genuinely

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.110
elected mayor of an unincorporated census-designated
place in California called Sunol in 1981,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.250
serving in the role for 13 years until his
death.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.390
How he got into the job in the first place
was simply that his owner thought the whole

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.421
thing would be funny, so entered him in the
race under the platform “Dogs are People

00:02:21.421 --> 00:02:26.890
Too” and with campaign promises including,
“A bone in every dish, a cat in every tree,

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.970
and a fire hydrant on every corner.”

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:33.680
Unlike Stubbs, Bosco was elected and even
ran against two human beings, both of whom

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.670
he beat in a landslide.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.190
However, his position was described as being
“purely ceremonial” in nature.

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.150
The same can be said of Duke, a dog who became
the honorary mayor of a small town in Minnesota,

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.730
winning by 9 votes.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.520
It should be noted here that the town only
had 12 residents, meaning I guess he technical

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.930
won by a landslide.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.000
Funny enough, the individual who ran against
Duke, one Richard Sherbrook, even claims he

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.060
voted for the dog, rather than himself.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.190
Again, Duke’s position was ceremonial but,
the residents of the town were happy to have

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.190
him as mayor, with Sherbrook describing the
idea of having a dog as mayor as “pretty

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:07.190
cool”.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.970
Cool or not, since the animals only hold ceremonial
positions, there are no official mayoral duties

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.300
expected of them, nor are there any salaries,
assistants, or similar trappings, though the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:21.570
animals are seemingly taken much better care
of than most of their respective species.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.510
However, just because nobody expects a canine
mayor to do anything, it doesn’t mean their

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.140
terms in office aren’t gleefully noted by
the local populace as if the animal did function

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.090
as an actual, official mayor.

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.050
Going to back to Bosco for a moment, while
he was in office, the doggy mayor would regularly

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.350
meet with the citizens of Sunol, taking daily
strolls about the town to meet with his constituents.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.300
While serving as mayor, Bosco became something
of a celebrity, appearing on TV (earning $2,000

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.630
to his owner in one such appearance) and at
one point caused an international incident

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.150
when Chinese newspapers widely reported on
his election as an example of the shortcomings

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.430
of democracy and why it should be avoided.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.760
Bosco (literally) took all this in stride
and when the Tiananmen square incident happened

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.680
in 1989, was invited to join protests organised
by students at Berkeley and Stanford in front

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.290
of the Chinese embassy as an honored guest.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.730
His owner accepted the offer.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.550
Bosco also led the Halloween parade every
year and attended formal events wearing a

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.090
doggy tuxedo.

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.340
When he wasn’t being formal, Bosco was recognisable
due to his habit of wearing a red bandana.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.760
Bosco_the_Dog_Mayor_of_SunolShareShareShareShareShareIt
wasn’t all smooth sailing for Bosco though

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.870
and his tenure wasn’t without controversy,
one of the most infamous being his liaisons

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.790
with numerous female dogs while on the clock,
resulting in numerous illegitimate pups being

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.790
sired.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.740
In addition, Bosco also went missing for a
week in 1987, turning up a week later with

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.420
a stick in his mouth; he never revealed where
he went, so it’s assumed he was enjoying

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.070
a raunchy rendezvous with a female dog.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.120
Bosco also frequently got caught being bribed
with ice cream and would act aggressively

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.580
when people withheld his favourite treat,
beef jerky.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:55.860
After his death in 1994, the people of Sunol
paid tribute to Bosco by erecting a bronze

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.570
bust of “the world’s first canine mayor”.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.510
Despite his well-known love of formal clothing,
the artist responsible for Bosco’s statue

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.190
chose to depict him in his everyday attire.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.310
So to sum up, when you hear a story about
an animal becoming mayor, chances are the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.340
position is purely ceremonial and the animal
has no official duties to speak of so they

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.180
don’t need all that much help to carry them
out.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.590
And in some cases, the animal in question
may not have even been elected at all, just

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.820
given their position as something of a publicity
stunt.

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.610
In the Japanese town of Kinokawa the “station
master” for Kishi Station is a female calico

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.920
cat called Tama.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.740
Tama was a stray that lived near the station
and was regularly fed by an employee there.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.270
When the station became automated in 2007
to cut costs, Tama was “hired” and given

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.310
food instead of a salary so that she wouldn’t
starve.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.830
News of Tama’s hiring quickly spread and
the station saw an increase in traffic as

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.150
people travelled to the station just to see
her.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.110
Tama is tasked with greeting passengers and
even wears a tiny station master hat while

00:05:52.110 --> 00:06:27.259
working.
