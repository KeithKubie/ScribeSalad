00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.020
Where we had left off, we
had used the information

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.679
from these two lines to
figure out two vectors,

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.720
which are really just
almost, you could just say,

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.040
two position vectors
lying in this white plane.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.720
And we took their cross
product to find a vector that's

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.050
perpendicular, that's normal
to this entire white plane.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.490
And that was vector d there.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:27.214
And vector d will have to sit,
especially to visualize it,

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.880
if you start the
vector-- you can always

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:30.820
position a vector
anywhere you want--

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.490
but if you start it at 0, it
will clearly sit in that plane.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.490
But since you could always
position it anywhere,

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.740
you could say, OK,
let's start it at 0.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.190
So it will sit in
this yellow plane

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.580
that we need to find
the equation for.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.180
And we know vector d sits in it.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360
We already know that
vector a sits in it.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.320
We got that early on in the
first video on this problem.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.620
And so we could take the
cross product of d and a

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.630
to find a normal vector to it.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.550
And then using
that normal vector,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.050
and then thinking about
what an arbitrary point,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.630
or what an arbitrary
vector on this plane

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.080
might look like, we
can then figure out

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.160
the equation for
this yellow plane.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.060
And we already touched
on it a little bit

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.440
in the linear algebra
playlist, if any of this stuff

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.364
makes you confused.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:14.280
And just a reminder, we
take the cross product

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.157
of two vectors in three
dimensional space,

00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:19.740
it will give you a third vector
that is perpendicular to both.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.500
That's the whole tool that
we're using over here.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.960
So let's just take the
cross product of d and a.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.360
So this is going to be
equal to-- so for the i,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.430
we have 1 times 4, which
is 4, minus 3 times 10.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.640
So 4 minus 30 is negative 26.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.300
So we have negative 26i.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.690
And then we have
negative or minus for j.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.340
We have to swap signs for the j.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.540
And so we have negative
8 times 4 is negative 32.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.010
Negative 32 minus 2 times 10,
so minus 20, is negative 52.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:59.750
So we put a negative 52 here.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.680
Or we could just
say positive 52.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.120
Because it's minus
negative 52, which

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.570
is the same thing as plus 52j.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.820
And finally, for the
k-- cross out that row,

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.520
that column-- negative 8 times
3 is negative 24, minus 2 times

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.020
1.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.270
So minus 2, it's negative 26.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.780
So minus 26k.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.980
So this normal vector
right here or an a vector

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.940
that is normal to the
yellow plane, the plane

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.570
that we have to find the
equation of, is this over here.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.200
And just because it kind of
pops out at me that all of these

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.150
are divisible by 26,
I'm going to define

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.067
another normal vector.

00:02:39.067 --> 00:02:41.400
I don't know, let's call it--
we could call it anything.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.230
Let me call it-- I don't
know, let's call it p.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.160
Or let's call it-- I don't
know, let's call it normal 1.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.990
I mean, just to show
it's a different vector.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.279
I'm just going to divide--
although essentially it's

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.570
pointing in the same direction.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.778
It has the same direction,
just different magnitude--

00:02:59.778 --> 00:03:03.500
I'm just going to divide
all of these by negative 26.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.170
So if I divide all of
these by negative 26,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.400
I'm just scaling the vector.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.960
But it's still going to
go in the same direction.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.370
Because that's
what I care about.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.120
I care about just
finding any vector that

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.817
is normal to this
yellow plane right here.

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:20.900
I want to find any vector.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:21.764
I already found one.

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:23.180
And now I'm just
going to scale it

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.820
down so that it's
a simpler vector.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.140
So if I divide everything
by negative 26,

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:36.760
I get i plus-- or I should
say, minus 2j plus k.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:40.400
So that might look something
like this right over there.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.900
So this is our n1 vector
that is normal to this.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.990
Now, just using this,
we can now figure out

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.380
the equation of this
plane right here.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.170
So let's just think
about it a little bit.

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.040
Let's just say I have a
point, or I could even

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.070
say a position vector, x, y, z.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.990
And I know x, y, z
sits on this plane.

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.880
So x, y, z.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.700
It sits on this plane.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.200
And we know that the point
0, 0, 0 is on the plane.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.200
So we also know that
the position vector

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.491
xi plus yj plus zk have to
sit on this yellow plane

00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:19.990
in question.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.080
I'm assuming that x, y, z
is a point on this plane.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.724
I could have put
little 0's here just

00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:28.140
to make sure that--
you know, this

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.190
could be a particular
point on this plane.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.950
I'm saying this is
just any point that I'm

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.260
defining to be on this plane.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.730
Now, this position vector
will then be on this plane.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.060
And since this vector is normal
to this position vector right

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.549
here, or another way to
say it, it's perpendicular,

00:04:44.549 --> 00:04:45.340
or it's orthogonal.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.290
If I were to take the dot
product, if I were to take that

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.894
and then dot it with this
vector right over here,

00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:57.810
and dot it with that
vector right over there--

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:06.360
so I would take the dot product
of that and this-- yj plus zk.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.400
If I take the dot product
of these two things,

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.540
it has to be equal to 0.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.740
If I take the dot product
of two vectors that

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.894
are orthogonal to each
other-- and by definition,

00:05:17.894 --> 00:05:18.810
these two vectors are.

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:22.560
I'm saying that this
guy is in the plane.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.680
This vector, we
already figured out,

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.110
is perpendicular to the plane.

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:28.620
Which means it's
perpendicular, it's

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.730
orthogonal to
everything in the plane.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.490
So if we take their dot
product, it will be equal to 0.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:35.830
So what does that give us?

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.070
So if we take their dot
product, we get x times 1.

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.650
So if we take-- let me
just go term by term.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.340
So if we take x times--
the coefficient there is 1.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:53.670
So we have x plus
y times negative 2.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.870
So I should really
call that-- well, I

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.930
could just call
that negative 2y.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.010
And then finally,
I have z times 1.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.530
There's a 1 in front of this k.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.920
It's implicitly there.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.960
So z times 1.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.020
So plus z.

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.280
That's the dot product.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.042
And that has to be equal to 0.

00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:17.000
Or another way to write
it, just to simplify it

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.480
a little bit, is that x minus
2y plus z is equal to 0.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.474
And that is the equation
of our plane in question.

00:06:26.474 --> 00:06:28.140
Or I should actually
write it in yellow,

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.590
because it's the yellow plane.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.719
x minus 2y plus z is equal to 0.

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:35.260
And I know this might have been
a little daunting or a little

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:37.612
confusing, and if you actually
had to do this in exam,

00:06:37.612 --> 00:06:39.570
you wouldn't have to do
all of the explanation.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.050
But just to visualize
what we did,

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.410
we used these two lines--
you can kind of view

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:47.787
the vectors we used as kind
of the slopes of these lines

00:06:47.787 --> 00:06:48.620
in three dimensions.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:51.000
Don't worry about it
if that confuses you.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.410
But we used the vectors
in-- both of these

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.020
specify a different vector.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:57.770
You could keep scaling
them into whatever.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.520
But we just took
their cross product

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.340
to find a vector that is normal
to this entire white plane.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.810
And it would have to
sit in the yellow plane.

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.429
Now, if it sits on
the yellow plane,

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:09.970
we could take the cross product
of that with the first vector

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:12.090
that we found that was
in the yellow plane.

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.486
A vector that sat
on that line, or you

00:07:14.486 --> 00:07:15.860
could almost view
it as the slope

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.809
of that line in
three dimensions.

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:19.600
And if you take the
cross product of that--

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600
it's not exactly the slope.

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.840
I don't want you
all to nit-pick me.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:22.710
So no, it's not
exactly the slope.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:24.390
But a vector in
three dimensions is

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:26.030
kind of specifying
a direction, which

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.510
is analogous to a slope
in two dimensions.

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.930
But if we take the cross product
of these two vectors now,

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.280
we'll get a normal vector.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.950
That's what we started
this video doing.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:38.050
I scaled back this normal vector
just to simplify the math.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:40.300
And I said, OK, if I
have this normal vector,

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.890
and any arbitrary vector
on this plane, when

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.510
I take their dot
product it'll be 0.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:46.930
And so what that
allowed us to do

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:51.640
is figure out what are the
constraints on that x, y and z.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:53.630
Any x, y and z that's
on the plane, when

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.160
I take the dot product
of that position vector

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.480
with the normal vector,
it has to be equal to 0.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.300
So that gave us the actual
constraints for the plane.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.910
Anyway, hopefully
you found that fun.
