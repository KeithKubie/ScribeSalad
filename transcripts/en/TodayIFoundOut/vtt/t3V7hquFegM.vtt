00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:20.449
A form of nickname has been around since the
early 14th century- eke name, literally meaning

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.500
“an additional name.”

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.680
Eke is an even older word, dating back to
about 1200 meaning “to increase.”

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.590
(Eke also meant “to lengthen,” and it
was this meaning that eventually became the

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.340
meaning of to eke out or make just enough.)

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.839
The first documented instance of “eke name”
comes from the 1303 Middle English devotional

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:43.269
Handlyng Synne, by Robert Manning of Brunne.

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.269
In it, he states on line 1531 to 1534, “As
moche þan he ys to blame Þat ȝeueþ a man

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:45.269
a vyle ekename Ȝyf hys ryȝt name be withdrawe
Gostlychë…”

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.899
So how did we get “nickname” from “ekename”?

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.160
This is one of the numerous examples of metanalysis
or rebracketing.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.410
In this case, “an ekename” became “a
nekename” and ultimately, today, “a nickname.”

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.570
We can see this transformation starting in
the 1440 work Promptorium Parvulorum (“Storehouse

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.850
for Children,” the first English to Latin
dictionary) by Geoffrey the Grammarian of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.460
England, where it states “Neke name, or
eke name, agnomen.”

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.850
Similarly, the 1483 English to Latin dictionary
Catholicon Anglicum has an entry: “An Ekname,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:17.850
agnomen.”

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.330
We see another incarnation of this in Sir
Thomas More’s Confutation of Tyndale’s

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.620
Answer published in 1532:

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.930
I shoulde here call Tindall by another name:‥it
were no nyck name at all and yet would there

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.250
some then say that it were not honest so to
do; and this will some such folk say as in

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.060
the villainous words of his spoken by this
blessed sacrament will find no fault at all.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.690
But meseemeth surely that at the first hearing
of such a shameful word spoken by the mouth

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.280
of such a shameless heretic by this holy sacrament
of Christ, the whole Christian company present

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.280
should not be able to contain themselves from
calling him “knave” all with one voice

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.020
at once.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.390
Fast-forwarding a bit to the 17th century,
we find several instances of the more modern

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.860
“nick-” spelling, such as in the 1617
Itinerary by Fynes Moryson, where it states,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.200
“James Fitz-thomas‥was by a nicke-name
called the Suggon Earle…”

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.940
Within a century of this, “nick-name,”
“nick name,” and “nickname” became

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.250
relatively commonly used in place of older
variants and the original “eke name,”

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.260
with the latter being phased out completely.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.630
A similar example of this type of rebracketing
can be seen in how we got “another” (and,

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.890
sometimes “nother” in such phrases as
“a whole nother”) from “an other.”

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.420
Or going the other way, how we got “apron”
from the original “napron” (“a napron”

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.270
being rebracketed to “an apron”) and “umpire”
from “noumpere” (“a noumpere” being

00:02:46.270 --> 00:03:03.920
rebracketed to “an oumpere”).
