00:00:03.736 --> 00:00:06.372
[ MOTOR WHIRRING ]

00:00:06.372 --> 00:00:08.708
Narrator: THE LAWNMOWER.

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:11.911
HOW DOES THIS BACKYARD WORKHORSE

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.281
CUT THROUGH THE THICKEST GRASS
ON ALL TERRAINS

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.384
WITHOUT JAMMING?

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:23.389
MORE THAN 350 COMPONENTS

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:25.425
WORK TOGETHER.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:28.961
THE ENGINE TURNS THE BLADES
50 TIMES A SECOND

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.531
TO PULVERIZE THE GRASS.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:34.868
IF IT SLOWS DOWN,
THE GRASS WON'T CUT CLEANLY,

00:00:34.868 --> 00:00:37.270
AND THE MOWER WILL CLOG UP.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.938
SO THERE'S A HIDDEN MECHANISM

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:42.742
TO KEEP THE BLADE SPINNING
AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT SPEED.

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:47.714
IT'S CALLED THE GOVERNOR,

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:50.150
AND IT'S THE LAWNMOWER'S
CRUISE CONTROL.

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:54.153
IT USES FLYWEIGHTS

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:57.290
TO DETECT THE SPEED
OF THE BLADE.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.792
IF THE CRANKSHAFT SLOWS DOWN,

00:00:59.792 --> 00:01:01.795
THE FLYWEIGHTS DECELERATE,

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:04.831
FALL INWARDS,
AND TRIGGER A LEVER...

00:01:06.265 --> 00:01:10.870
...TO OPEN THE THROTTLE
AND PUMP IN MORE FUEL.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.539
THIS BOOSTS THE ENGINE'S POWER

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:17.243
AND SPINS THE BLADE BACK UP
TO THE PERFECT CUTTING SPEED

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:21.814
OF 3,000 TIMES A MINUTE.

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:26.552
NOW, IF A BLADE HITS A ROCK
AT OVER 200 MILES PER HOUR,

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:31.090
IT CAN CARRY ON CUTTING
WITH HARDLY A SCRATCH.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.726
WITH SO MUCH METAL
CRAMMED UNDER ITS SKIN,

00:01:33.726 --> 00:01:36.896
YOU'D EXPECT THIS MACHINE
TO FEEL HEAVY.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:39.666
SO HOW DO MOWERS
MAKE PUSHING UPHILL EASY?

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.837
THE SECRET
IS SELF-POWERED WHEELS.

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:51.444
ONE ENGINE DRIVES BOTH THE BLADE
AND THE WHEELS.

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:58.551
AS THE BLADE SPINS
AT 3,000 TIMES A MINUTE,

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:02.287
A BELT CARRIES
THIS BREAKNECK SPEED

00:02:02.287 --> 00:02:04.056
TO THE GEARBOX,

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:09.495
WHICH STEPS DOWN THE SPEED
SEVEN TIMES.

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:12.832
A CABLE CONNECTED TO A LEVER
ON THE HANDLEBAR

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:16.035
ALLOWS THE DRIVER
TO FINE-TUNE THE SPEED

00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:19.205
BY ADJUSTING THE BELT'S TENSION.

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:22.508
THESE INNOVATIONS MAKE SURE
THIS FOUR-WHEEL DRIVE

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:25.078
ALWAYS MOVES
AT THE PERFECT PACE.
