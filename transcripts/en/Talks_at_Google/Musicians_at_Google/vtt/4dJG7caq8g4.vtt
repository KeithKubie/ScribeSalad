HAROLD MABERN: Thank you.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.940
This is going to be a
short enjoy, you guys,

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.750
because we have to be
through at 25 after,

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.630
so we have to short [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.250
This first composition
is a dedication

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.260
to the late great
John William Coltrane.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.670
We affectionately
call him the Chief.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.137

Thank you very much.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.970
Thank you.

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.820
Thank you so much.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.490
Thanks for coming out, and
you're very fortunate because,

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.179
just so you know, this music
was created in this country.

00:04:30.179 --> 00:04:31.220
So you're very fortunate.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.820
However, sometimes it's more
appreciated all over the world,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:36.275
but it was created here.

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.240
Now here's a song.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.910
The title is funny,
but it was dedicated

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.480
to probably the greatest
musicians that ever played,

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.980
Art Blakely and the
Jazz Messengers.

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.024

Benny, Jymie, Lee Bu."

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.050
to close with the title
theme from the album which

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:10.250
is "Afro Blue."

Unfortunately, Mr. Gregory

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.214
but we have Mr.
Kurt Elling here.

00:10:15.214 --> 00:10:17.089
So we we're going to
give you a short version

00:10:17.089 --> 00:10:20.582

to introduce our vocalist

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.950
today who's going to join us
for the interview as well.

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:20.930
He was born in Chicago.

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.550
He grew up in
Rockford, Illinois.

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.520
He's one of the world's
foremost jazz vocalists.

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.920
He has one the Critics Poll
in "DownBeat" magazine.

00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.370
He had a run of 14
consecutive years,

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:35.650
was named male
singer of the year

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:38.450
eight times during that span.

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:44.807
He, in addition to all of those
awards, won a Grammy in 2009,

00:16:44.807 --> 00:16:46.640
and actually every album
that he's ever made

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:49.410
has been nominated for a Grammy.

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.620
He has his own album
that was released

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:56.950

it's called "Passion World."

MALE SPEAKER: All
right, so, Harold, I'd

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:22.500
love to talk to you a bit about
just the topic of education

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.490
and learning.

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.329
I think your background
is so interesting,

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:27.829
coming from Memphis.

00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:30.630
You're considered a
self-taught pianist,

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:34.582
but you also have made so many
contributions at the college

00:17:34.582 --> 00:17:36.290
level over the years
at William Paterson,

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:39.250
and I know you've worked with
Stanford as well as Harvard

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:40.296
this year.

00:17:40.296 --> 00:17:42.670
But tell me a little bit about
your experience growing up

00:17:42.670 --> 00:17:43.170
in Memphis.

00:17:43.170 --> 00:17:46.430
I know you transferred
into Manassas.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:47.509
How did that happen?

00:17:47.509 --> 00:17:50.050
HAROLD MABERN: Well, long story
short, I group up in Memphis,

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:55.020
Tennessee and graduated from
a school that's music program

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.180
was started by the late
great Jimmie Lunceford back

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:02.410
in the early '40s, late '30s.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:06.210
And when I transferred
to Manassas,

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.340
I didn't choose music.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.810
It sounds corny, but it
chose me because when

00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:13.940
people were studying Chopin
etudes-- no shame in my game,

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.490
as BB King talked about.

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.600
I was chopping and picking
and pulling cotton.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:21.790
So one day I heard a little girl
play a song on all the black

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:26.800
keys called, "I Stuck my
Dolly-- D-O-L-L-Y-- in the Mud,"

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.040
and that's the first thing
I learned. (HUMMING SONG)

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:33.580
So when I got to Frank Strozier,
one of my closest friends,

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.780
told me, why don't you come
to Manassas High School?

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:40.340
And I transferred from
Douglas to Manassas,

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.110
of my classmates were Booker
Little, George Coleman, Frank

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.860
Storzier, Charles Lord,
Hank Crawford, Lewis Smith.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:49.330
Isaac Hayes was later.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.180
And we were taught by a
man named Matthew Garrett,

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.246
and he had a daughter.

00:18:54.246 --> 00:18:57.010
Her name was Denise Gary,
who's now Dee Dee Bridgewater.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.350
Dee Dee Bridgewater's father
was our band director.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.240
So anyway, I knew three songs.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.560
1951 is when I started.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.280
And when I moved
to Chicago I've met

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.740
Spike Lee's father, Bill Lee.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.200
Bill Lee, one of the
greatest all-around

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.290
geniuses that ever
lived, but he's always

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:16.590
been anti-amplification,
and so he

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:17.860
wasn't born with a big sound.

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.430
But when I went to
Chicago-- that's

00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:21.390
one the greatest
cities in the world.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:24.986
That's how I learned how
to conceptualize music.

00:19:24.986 --> 00:19:26.360
Then, when I moved
to New York, I

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:28.720
had a better
understanding about it.

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.740
And as I said, the first
night in New York City,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.070
Cannonball introduced me
to Harry "Sweets" Edison.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.920
And old timers
then, they assumed

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.850
if you're a musician--
Kurt can tell you--

00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:39.850
you get on the [INAUDIBLE],
you know everything.

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.610
So Sweet says to me,
you want to play?

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:44.320
I said, yeah.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.837
So he said, "Habit,"
eight by interjection.

00:19:46.837 --> 00:19:48.420
I said, well what
the heck is "Habit"?

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.120
I knew how play eight
by interjection.

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.042
The song was "Getting
to be a Habit with You."

00:19:52.042 --> 00:19:53.000
never played it before.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.960
I fumbled.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.100
Second chorus I had it.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:56.190
He said, you got the get.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:58.260
He took me right
back to Chicago.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.030
I made $250 a week
at the Blue Note.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:04.970
Now in case you young people
don't know how money that was,

00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:08.290
in 1959 I had $5,000.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.920
$2,500 in this shoe,
and $2,500 in that shoe.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.420
Why?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.960
Because that was so long ago,
you know these Ziploc bags

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.297
that you take for granted?

00:20:17.297 --> 00:20:18.630
They weren't on the market then.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:20.709
They were being tested.

00:20:20.709 --> 00:20:22.375
And to show you how
much money that was,

00:20:22.375 --> 00:20:25.100
I'm going to fast forward
because once I get to talking,

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.460
you can't stop me.

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.480
The Four Seasons hotel which
starts at $750 a night,

00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:33.480
was $50 a week.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.400
The legendary
[INAUDIBLE] was 99 cents.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.600
That was the cover charge.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:40.410
So anyway, fast forward, and
I was blessed because I came.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.250
I was hustling.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.510
I promoted myself,
and I got a call

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:46.160
to teach at William
Paterson in 1981,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.670
and I've been there
since that time.

00:20:48.670 --> 00:20:52.770
And I must say, this gentleman
and the young man on the drums,

00:20:52.770 --> 00:20:54.850
two of my prized
students, and I'm still

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.800
teaching, because when
you teach, you learn.

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.425
And I'm going to turn it
over to somebody else.

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:00.800
MALE SPEAKER:
Thank you for that.

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.340
Just on the topic of
learning, I guess,

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.310
Harold was Eric's teacher.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:13.261
He was my teacher, and
one of the ideas in jazz

00:21:13.261 --> 00:21:15.260
and just kind of the way
that the music evolves,

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.060
it's if you hear
it, you can have it.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:21.220
It's this idea that
everything's right there for you

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:24.390
to learn and try to
incorporate into your playing,

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.976
and people just added ideas.

00:21:26.976 --> 00:21:28.600
They find a way to
make them their own.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:33.640
And over time, you get some
really unique contributions

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:34.210
to the music.

00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:38.060
And it sounds a
little bit like-- I

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:40.910
guess I'll make an internet
analogy-- there's open source

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:41.420
code.

00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:43.950
There's things like Wikipedia
with a lot of people

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:47.350
just kind of
collectively contributing

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.940
in similar way as music.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.420
So tell me a little bit
about your experience

00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:57.240
working with Eric.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.370
I know you guys
met when Eric was

00:21:59.370 --> 00:22:01.800
in school at William
Paterson, but you've

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.900
gone on to work a lot together.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.000
HAROLD MABERN: Yeah, he
left Indiana University

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:11.980
and professor Dave
Baker told Rufus Reid.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.764
Rufus was a professor there.

00:22:13.764 --> 00:22:15.430
Then we got a young
tenor player coming,

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.950
and we'd like for you
to see what you can do.

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.180
So Rufus assigned
him to my class.

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:22.240
And I always tell
the students, you

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.650
should always have a
tape recorder with you

00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:26.560
and some manuscript paper.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.680
So Eric came in.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.560
I had him play
"Embraceable You."

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.260
He'd never played it before in
his life, and what he played,

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:36.300
believe me, was a
complete masterpiece.

00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:38.610
And unfortunately, I
didn't follow my own advice

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.440
because I couldn't document it.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.724
And he was playing like Dexter
Gordon there, which is great.

00:22:44.724 --> 00:22:46.390
And I knew then, I
said to myself, well,

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.440
this is an A student, really.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.790
And I told him three things.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:52.420
I said learn all your
standards in all the keys,

00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:54.690
and go see George
Coleman, and he did.

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:56.785
He took two lessons,
and the rest

00:22:56.785 --> 00:22:59.720
is history, as they say--
very smart young man.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.230
And please don't try to pay
me, because I'm serious.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.980
This is one of the
smartest young man

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.260
playing any kind of music.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.170
and he plays piano--
Ravel and Debussy and all.

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.670
So it's a pleasure
working with him,

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:12.878
and we learn from each other.

00:23:12.878 --> 00:23:15.750
Now we've been-- how many
CDs have we done together?

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.554
On [INAUDIBLE], I'd say
we've made at least 20.

00:23:18.554 --> 00:23:20.845
ERIC ALEXANDER: But we've
probably been on at least 70.

00:23:20.845 --> 00:23:23.095
HAROLD MABERN: At least 70
together with other people,

00:23:23.095 --> 00:23:25.010
so I'm going to let him talk.

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.610
And he's an expert skier.

00:23:29.492 --> 00:23:31.950
ERIC ALEXANDER: You know, I
want to backtrack for a moment,

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:32.560
if that's OK.

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.532
That tune you mentioned, "I
Stuck My Dolly in the Mud?"

00:23:37.532 --> 00:23:39.060
See, I had a
different upbringing.

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:41.236
We called that "Salvadore
Dali in the Mud."

00:23:41.236 --> 00:23:42.152
HAROLD MABERN: Really?

00:23:42.152 --> 00:23:42.916
ERIC ALEXANDER: Yeah.

00:23:42.916 --> 00:23:44.499
HAROLD MABERN: So
you know about this?

00:23:44.499 --> 00:23:45.699
I didn't know that.

00:23:45.699 --> 00:23:48.240
ERIC ALEXANDER: And what am I
supposed to be addressing here,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.680
Andrew?

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.835
Harold was-- this is
his show, so let's keep.

00:23:52.835 --> 00:23:54.210
HAROLD MABERN:
No, it's our show.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.010
ERIC ALEXANDER:
Well, he's certainly

00:23:56.010 --> 00:23:59.740
the most influential
musical mentor

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.130
that I've ever encountered.

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.660
He took me, despite what
he says, from a point

00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:10.390
where I was absolutely green,
and saw some something in there

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.730
and was always willing to
help and show me new ideas,

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:16.950
and he's really the primary
reason for whatever I'm

00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:18.890
doing today or however I play.

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.600
I thank Harold every day,
at least, in my mind,

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.060
sometimes not to your face.

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:25.670
I do.

00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:29.310
And it's funny; we've actually
been around each other now,

00:24:29.310 --> 00:24:32.410
if I think about the
years since I started

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.650
working as a professional, I've
probably been next to this man

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:40.130
more than any other person on
the planet, including my wife,

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:41.640
and that probably
pisses her off.

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:45.650
We're always on the
road doing something.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:46.634
It's really amazing.

00:24:46.634 --> 00:24:47.800
It's like a dream come true.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.940
I don't know what to say.

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:55.310
Teaching and learning in jazz
is very different from other art

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:59.290
forms or, in particular,
Western classical art music

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:01.970
because it's not as pedagogical.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:04.500
Like Andrew said,
it's more about

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.130
if you can hear
it and figure out

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.370
what it is in sort of an
intuitive and personal way,

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.600
then you can make it your own.

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.930
And it just takes somebody to
continually show you things.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.770
They don't tell you how
to do it necessarily,

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:22.640
but they show you
what it sounds like,

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:25.400
and then eventually you
start to pick it up,

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.240
and that's what he's been
doing for me for 25 years.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:31.110
MALE SPEAKER: Great, thank you.

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:35.367
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:40.220
I want to talk to Kurt as well
about his new album "Passion

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:41.130
World."

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:45.632
And jazz is music that, like
Harold said before, it's

00:25:45.632 --> 00:25:48.090
from the United States, but it
just has a tremendous appeal

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:49.380
globally.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.110
These guys will tell you,
they keep a very busy touring

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:56.690
schedule, going to Asia and
Europe and all over the place.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:26:00.900
And Kurt's latest album
has a very global focus.

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.420
I know people love jazz
all over the world,

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.250
but it also has influence
some of the material

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:10.170
that jazz musicians play
in the United States.

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:12.950
And also there are great
musicians everywhere,

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:17.420
and I think Kurt's latest
album captures a lot of that.

00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.832
So what can you tell us
about how that came together?

00:26:20.832 --> 00:26:22.790
KURT ELLING: Well, first
of all, hi, everybody.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.610
Happy to be here.

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:28.779
Harold Mabern, great genius,
happy to be his side man

00:26:28.779 --> 00:26:29.320
this evening.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.106
It's wonderful.

00:26:30.106 --> 00:26:31.730
I'm happy to have a
little bit of time.

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.730
It's an honor for me.

00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:36.760
Jazz is the ultimate
syncratic art

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.770
form, which means
that any music,

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:45.050
any sound that it encounters,
any rhythm any tradition,

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.310
anything that it encounters
that it finds valuable,

00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:51.320
it can adopt and transform.

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:53.284
And it transforms
itself, and it transforms

00:26:53.284 --> 00:26:54.325
that which it encounters.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:01.550
As Harold said, it was
born in the United States,

00:27:01.550 --> 00:27:04.830
but it was born of so many
different countries and so many

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:05.830
different traditions.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.740
It was born of the collision
of cultures, largely, but not

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.070
exclusively in New Orleans.

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:16.320
It grew up in Chicago,
yet more collision

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:20.000
of cultures-- collision
of African-- vast

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.610
over-generalization--
collision of African rhythms

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:28.510
with European harmonic
ideas and instrumentation.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:32.420
And it continues to
seek out new ideas,

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.920
and it continues to grow in
all these different countries,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.350
having grown up in America.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:42.600
Dizzy Gillespie, back in
the day, goes down to Cuba

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:45.770
and moves from hard
swinging everything

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:48.640
to a whole new way
of thinking of music

00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:51.850
and calls it Afro Cuban music.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:57.080
And it puts a whole new gloss on
what he was about as an artist.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.600
And these days you have
artists around the world who

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.530
have encountered jazz-- "jazz,"
quote unquote, American style--

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.460
who have encountered
it, who have fallen

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.110
in love with the great
pillar heroes of the music,

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:14.840
and yet have brought their own
sensibilities to the music.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.270
So you have a whole
Scandinavian realm

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:21.430
of artists who sound only like
themselves, who are informed

00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:24.740
by the American tradition but
bring their own identities

00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:27.250
to the music and have a
signature event that's

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:28.520
happening up there.

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.440
You have people in France
who make beautiful gypsy

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.580
kind of sounding
jazz music, who swing

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.910
in a way that belongs to them.

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:36.860
You have cats now
who are working

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.830
with Indian poly-rhythms, who
are a mixture of American cats

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.350
and cats from India who are in
just moving the music forward

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:48.560
in ways that nobody had
thought of even 10 years ago.

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.790
And it's from the creative
juxtaposition of ideas

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:54.730
that a lot of the
greatest sounds happen.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:58.350
So on my recording
"Passion World," since I've

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:01.780
been out touring not nearly
as long as Dr. Mabern here,

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.957
but I've been out for
about 20 years now,

00:29:03.957 --> 00:29:06.040
and I go to Europe all the
time, and I go to Asia,

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.500
and I go to South
America and try

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:11.455
to learn wherever I go,
who are the great players.

00:29:11.455 --> 00:29:13.830
Fans will come up afterwards,
oh, man, thank you so much.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:15.080
I say, hey, who's around here?

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.890
Who can I stay
awake for tonight?

00:29:17.890 --> 00:29:20.680
And as I've done that I've
collected certain compositions,

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:22.940
certain ways of
thinking about things

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:25.230
and certain
international heroes,

00:29:25.230 --> 00:29:29.590
and I wanted to include them in
my own sound, in my own world,

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:31.930
and I wanted to feature
them in a certain kind

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:33.350
of a way in the United States.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:36.330
So on this recording we have
Till Bronner from Germany.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:41.060
We have Arturo Sandoval,
who's obviously many decades

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.330
ago now moved up from
Cuba, Richard Galliano,

00:29:45.330 --> 00:29:49.310
incredible virtuoso
French accordion player.

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:52.430
As a Chicagoan, I can always
hear the accordion [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:55.940
all the Chicago cats because
of the Polish connection.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:57.330
Got a beautiful
thing from Poland

00:29:57.330 --> 00:30:01.430
from Pat Metheny,
orchestra from Germany.

00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:06.880
So we are Americans
who encounter the world

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.630
and try to continue
learning, just

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.780
as Dr. Mabern here continues
to learn from his students.

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.239
And it's also
romantic, which is good

00:30:15.239 --> 00:30:17.030
because you know I'm
on your team for that.

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:18.656
I want that to happen.

00:30:18.656 --> 00:30:22.624
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:24.454 --> 00:30:25.870
MALE SPEAKER: And
bringing it back

00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:30.250
to "Afro Blue" for a
moment, just, of course,

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:32.780
this is improvised music,
and there's a structure,

00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:37.230
but what these guys are doing is
basically composing on the fly.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.350
And I heard a story
about one of the tunes

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:45.410
that you did with Harold that
wasn't planned to happen.

00:30:45.410 --> 00:30:47.490
KURT ELLING: Yes, we
had several things,

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.090
and I was so proud to get
the call in the first place,

00:30:51.090 --> 00:30:52.760
to jump in on a
couple of things that

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.940
are more traditional that we'll
be doing a little bit later.

00:30:55.940 --> 00:31:01.044
But then, as I had my coat on--
this was January sometime--

00:31:01.044 --> 00:31:01.960
HAROLD MABERN: August.

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:02.580
KURT ELLING: Was it August?

00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:04.038
I thought I was
putting my coat on.

00:31:04.038 --> 00:31:05.735
Really?

00:31:05.735 --> 00:31:07.597
HAROLD MABERN: That's OK.

00:31:07.597 --> 00:31:08.096
It's--

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:14.154
KURT ELLING: It's what
we call a schmear.

00:31:14.154 --> 00:31:16.640
ERIC ALEXANDER: You might
have been hiding something.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:18.090
KURT ELLING: Maybe I was.

00:31:18.090 --> 00:31:22.550
I'm always hiding something,
So anyway, I was on my way out,

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:25.400
and Harold started to--
I heard you talking

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.797
about this other tune
that you want to do,

00:31:27.797 --> 00:31:29.880
and I don't remember how
it wasn't going to happen

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:31.940
or was going to happen,
but you started playing.

00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:37.180
HAROLD MABERN: Originally
I had Norah Jones in mind.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:40.550
This is a true story, folks.

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:42.740
Is it on?

00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:46.990
Originally this song is called
"You Needed Me" by Anne Murray,

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:48.990
and George Coleman
kind of instigated this

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.170
because he said, hey, Mabe.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.280
My friends call me Mabe.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:54.210
He said, do you ever play
that song "You Needed Me?"

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:55.600
And I said, yeah.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.630
So we got to the day,
and I wanted Norah Jones,

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:01.805
but Paul Stache felt that
maybe, stylistically speaking,

00:32:01.805 --> 00:32:03.057
it wouldn't be good for Norah.

00:32:03.057 --> 00:32:03.640
So I said, OK.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.944
So I told her.

00:32:04.944 --> 00:32:06.360
We call him Big
Red affectionately

00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.360
because of his red hair.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.010
So I said, well, come on, Big
Red, we've got to do this song.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:12.640
I said, you've got
to do Boots Randolph,

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.680
because I was
determined-- true story.

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.680
I guess you could say it
was kind of like, what,

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.520
serendipity?

00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.730
Kurt had his-- he did his two
songs, thank you very much.

00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:23.350
He was walking out the door,
so we started playing it.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.770
He walks over to the piano.

00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.220
He starts singing, (SINGING)
you took-- (SPEAKING) I said,

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.030
uh-oh, and the rest is history.

00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.250
And he nailed it.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.080
That's how that happened.

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:35.380
That's why I say this
music is telepathic.

00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:36.650
You have to think.

00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:40.010
Jazz musicians-- let
me just throw this out.

00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:41.920
No offense to anybody--
what you don't know

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:45.540
is jazz musicians are some
of the smartest people

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:47.825
in the world outside from this.

00:32:47.825 --> 00:32:48.700
You probably didn't--

00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:49.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:52.427
No, no-- [INAUDIBLE]
speaks fluent Japanese.

00:32:52.427 --> 00:32:54.010
Now he's starting
the Korean language,

00:32:54.010 --> 00:32:55.430
which is totally different.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:57.420
Dr. Willie Ross,
speaks seven languages.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:00.490
He's been at Yale
for over 60 years.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:04.220
Dr. Don Byrd had four--
you heard of Don Byrd.

00:33:04.220 --> 00:33:07.310
He had four earned
degrees-- no honorary-- plus

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:11.790
he had a law degree, plus
he was an airplane pilot.

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:14.310
Keith Jarrett did the
"Goldberg Variations,"

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:15.277
so forth and so on.

00:33:15.277 --> 00:33:15.860
I could go on.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:17.120
We don't have enough time.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.090
Josh Redman has two
degrees-- MIT and Harvard.

00:33:21.090 --> 00:33:23.630
So what I'm saying
is to play this music

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:24.800
you've got to be a thinker.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.220
You have to think fast,
quick on your feet.

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.070
And, as I said before,
not to be redundant,

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:34.690
it's a pleasure to have all
these great artists on my CD.

00:33:34.690 --> 00:33:36.840
They made me look
good and sound good,

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.150
and I just want to share
that with you again.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.676
Thanks for your support.

00:33:40.676 --> 00:33:41.800
Now you can finish talking.

00:33:43.722 --> 00:33:45.055
MALE SPEAKER: I think that's it.

00:33:45.055 --> 00:33:47.990
We want to save some time
for the vocal performance,

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:50.407
so we can get to that
now, but thank you all.

00:33:50.407 --> 00:33:51.990
HAROLD MABERN: All
right, let's do it.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:54.435

00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:25.110
KURT ELLING: Here's a
lovely, lovely composition.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:30.180
This one was written as the
theme to a David O. Selznick

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:37.020
produced film in 1948-- a really
strange and unusual fantasy

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:38.160
film.

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.710
It was a romance, of course, but
it involved a young woman who

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:46.260
worked in an office, a young
man who worked in an office,

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:48.135
and he fell in love with
this young woman who

00:38:48.135 --> 00:38:50.660
he kept seeing in
Central Park, and she

00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.064
got strangely and kind of a
little bit of a Benjamin Button

00:38:54.064 --> 00:38:54.730
kind of a thing.

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:58.130
She kept getting older
at an accelerated rate,

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:01.570
and she, at the same
time, was living

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:07.270
as though she was in a time
that was 50, 100 years earlier

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:09.210
and referring to
news events that

00:39:09.210 --> 00:39:11.720
happened 50, 100 years earlier.

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:13.650
And it's a tragedy.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:17.420
It's gotta be a tragedy,
and yet it brought out

00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:19.584
this lovely, wonderful song.

has questions.

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.520
This was just an
incredible performance,

00:50:42.520 --> 00:50:44.800
as I knew would be, so
thanks to the musicians.

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:47.507
But if anybody has questions,
please come up to the mic here.

thing as a stupid question.

00:50:49.923 --> 00:50:51.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:53.360
I'm serious, so
don't hold back now.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:57.288
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

Who's got a question about
anything-- what we do,

00:51:00.970 --> 00:51:01.830
why we do it?

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:10.160
The first time I
was able to make

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.245
an album as a leader-- that's
a good question-- was in 1968,

00:51:13.245 --> 00:51:17.770
I think, and I
signed with Prestige.

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:20.930
And the record producer, he
didn't have much faith in me.

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:23.005
He said, well, we'll
sign you, and he give me

00:51:23.005 --> 00:51:25.480
a $100 advance,
which was an insult.

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:27.820
I should have given it back
to him, but I needed it,

00:51:27.820 --> 00:51:29.640
and I wanted to do a record.

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:32.240
He said, I don't expect
you to sell by 500 records.

00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.450
I said, OK.

00:51:33.450 --> 00:51:36.630
So during that time,
we had "Record World."

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:38.690
We had the "Billboard"
and there was one other.

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.704
So I sent a letter to
40 distributors saying,

00:51:41.704 --> 00:51:42.370
I have a new CD.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:44.350
It's called "A Few
Miles from Memphis."

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:46.391
The first statement I got
from the record company

00:51:46.391 --> 00:51:48.520
was 3,500 copies.

00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.050
I said, uh-oh, you didn't
say I would sell but 500.

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:52.700
But that was something
for me because I

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.441
needed to get a product out.

00:51:54.441 --> 00:51:55.940
And it was a good
experience for me,

00:51:55.940 --> 00:51:59.237
but the thing I found out--
and if any musicians here,

00:51:59.237 --> 00:52:01.820
when you go in the studio, tried
to be as prepared as you can.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.890
When I went in, I made sure
all the notes were right,

00:52:04.890 --> 00:52:06.260
so we didn't lose a lot of time.

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:09.220
Because when you're losing time,
changing notes, and doing this,

00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:11.260
that costs the record
company a lot of money.

00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:14.420
So that was my first venture
of doing something on my own.

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.879
The record is called "A
Few Miles From Memphis."

00:52:17.879 --> 00:52:18.420
Anybody else?

00:52:25.714 --> 00:52:27.222
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] Memphis--

00:52:27.222 --> 00:52:28.930
HAROLD MABERN: I'm
sorry, say that again.

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:30.330
MALE SPEAKER: Here.

00:52:30.330 --> 00:52:32.680
AUDIENCE: I'm super interested
in both blues and jazz.

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.040
[INAUDIBLE] Memphis,
how does [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:38.030
HAROLD MABERN: Well, they
said that New Orleans

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.110
is the city of jazz.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:41.250
Memphis is the
home of the blues.

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:44.110
You see, blues, here's
the thing about the blues.

00:52:44.110 --> 00:52:47.280
Mr. Kurt Elling said something
that was so eloquently put,

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.990
I wish I could've recorded
it to for my own teaching.

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:55.690
Here's the thing; the blues
form this is the first thing you

00:52:55.690 --> 00:52:58.065
learn when you start playing
jazz. (SINGING) I saw

00:52:58.065 --> 00:52:59.940
my baby walking down--
(SPEAKING) [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:01.430
one, four, five.

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:04.350
But as you get older, you
realize it becomes the hardest.

00:53:04.350 --> 00:53:05.230
Why?

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:10.050
Because you can't teach
somebody how to play the blues.

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:10.982
You can't do it.

00:53:10.982 --> 00:53:13.190
I could write down some
notes, but it's not the same.

00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:14.790
It has to come from here.

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:16.890
Now, Eric Alexander learned
how to play the blues

00:53:16.890 --> 00:53:21.100
because he worked with an
organ player named you see.

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.770
So when you hit a certain
environment, in other words,

00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:27.760
if you want to be a great
three point shooter,

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.445
you've got a practice like Larry
Bird and like Magic Johnson,

00:53:30.445 --> 00:53:35.200
like Michael Jordan
and not Labron James.

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.010
So when we started,
we hated the blues.

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:38.620
We wanted to play Bebop.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:41.029
But as we grew older, we
realized how important

00:53:41.029 --> 00:53:41.570
the blues is.

00:53:41.570 --> 00:53:45.490
See jazz comes from the blues
not the other way around.

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:46.540
You know what I'm saying?

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:48.581
When you hear the blues,
you think about BB King,

00:53:48.581 --> 00:53:51.850
you think about Little
Milton Campbell,

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:55.600
you think about Joe Williams,
you think about Clarence T-Bone

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:57.080
Walker.

00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:58.530
So the blues is a special part.

00:53:58.530 --> 00:54:01.230
The great Dizzy Gillespie, the
co-progenitor of this music

00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:03.661
said, the difference
between me and Bird-- Bird

00:54:03.661 --> 00:54:04.410
is Charlie Parker.

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:06.420
He said, Byrd can play
the blues and I couldn't.

00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:06.840
He's right.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.030
He couldn't play the blues.

00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:10.530
He could play a
blues lick, you see.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:13.540
The blues-- like there's a
great pianist named Gene Harris.

00:54:13.540 --> 00:54:15.400
Anybody ever hear
of Gene Harris?

00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.010
Now, if I could play
the blues like him,

00:54:18.010 --> 00:54:19.732
I could stick my chest out.

00:54:19.732 --> 00:54:20.940
Now, he could play the blues.

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:24.400
And he said one time, I'm a
blues piano player with chops.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.440
People ask me; I said,
I'm a blues piano player

00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:29.530
that understands the
philosophy of jazz, which

00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:30.907
means I can play the blues.

00:54:30.907 --> 00:54:32.740
I can play the boogie
woogie, but I can also

00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:34.420
play the old milestone.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.240
I can also play [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.640
So the blues is very special.

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.890
Because all over
the world, no matter

00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:43.540
what your nationality is,
people understand the blues

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:46.540
all over the world or
anything that's bluesy.

00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.420
Gene Ammons, Stanley
Turrentine-- bluesy.

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.420
You see what I'm saying?

00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.230
So when you can understand
the blues and play it,

00:54:53.230 --> 00:54:54.460
you're in the right role.

00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.930
I hope that answers
your question.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:59.540
Anybody else?

00:54:59.540 --> 00:55:00.840
Come on now, don't be shy.

00:55:08.610 --> 00:55:11.142
AUDIENCE: How old were you
when you started playing music?

00:55:11.142 --> 00:55:11.500
HAROLD MABERN: Good question.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.500
How old was I?

00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:16.870
As I said before, I was
15 and 1/2, 16 years old.

00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:20.080
As I said before,
no shame in my game.

00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:23.960
When guys were
taking Chopin etudes,

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.130
I was chopping, picking,
and pulling cotton.

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:29.080
BB King talked about that--
that that is the blues.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.580
And the first thing I learned
how to play, as I said before,

00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.560
is a song called "I Stuck
My Dolly-- D-O-L-L-Y--

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:38.190
dolly's a little baby
doll-- in the Mud."

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:40.120
And the reason why
I know it's true

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.455
is because I met a young
lady five years ago up

00:55:42.455 --> 00:55:43.080
at [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.969
She said, Mr. Mabern, how long
have you been playing, and what

00:55:45.969 --> 00:55:47.260
was the first-- and I told her.

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:48.860
She said, oh, I know that song.

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:52.180
She said, it's called "I
Stuck My Dolly in the Dirt."

00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:54.430
so it's the same
song with different--

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:56.575
but I think it comes
from something that Ravel

00:55:56.575 --> 00:55:57.740
that Debussy wrote.

00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:00.451
Let me play it for you quickly.

00:56:00.451 --> 00:56:03.433
This is the first song
that I ever played.

00:56:03.433 --> 00:56:11.385
[MUSIC HAROLD MABERN, " I STUCK
 MY DOLLY IN THE DIRT"]

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:23.000
So that was my introduction--

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:23.879
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:23.879 --> 00:56:25.420
I never had formal
training, but see,

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.240
I believe we are all born
with some kind of gift.

00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:31.780
It's up to you to find out and
then grab it when it comes.

00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:34.271
Sometimes you might miss
it, so sprinkle, sprinkle.

00:56:34.271 --> 00:56:36.770
I heard a little girl playing
that, and I went to the piano,

00:56:36.770 --> 00:56:38.230
and learned two songs.

00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:41.060
When I moved to Chicago
and met Spike Lee's dad,

00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:43.117
that's when I really
got into music

00:56:43.117 --> 00:56:44.950
because we were practicing
and playing music

00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:47.960
12 hours a day every
day for five years.

00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.830
OK, anybody else?

00:56:49.830 --> 00:56:50.996
Speak up-- don't be shy.

00:56:50.996 --> 00:56:53.287
MALE SPEAKER: Looks like
there's one more on the right.

00:56:57.190 --> 00:57:00.070
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for playing today.

00:57:00.070 --> 00:57:02.960
I find it very interesting
that you're self-taught,

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.540
yet you ended up in
academia teaching

00:57:05.540 --> 00:57:07.212
at William Paterson University.

00:57:07.212 --> 00:57:09.170
I feel like you've seen
both sides of the coin,

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:10.628
being self-taught,
and you probably

00:57:10.628 --> 00:57:13.110
see tons of students who
have a formal education.

00:57:13.110 --> 00:57:15.920
What would you say are the
advantages and disadvantages

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.850
of each-- school learning
how to play music

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:21.034
and learning how to play jazz?

00:57:21.034 --> 00:57:22.450
HAROLD MABERN:
Very good question.

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:24.950
Well, see, even though I've
been in the university for theta

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:27.570
34 years-- I taught Joe
Farnsworth, Eric Alexander,

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:31.160
Bill Stewart, Tyshawn Sorey, and
Alexis Cole, the young lady my

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.330
[INAUDIBLE].

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:35.160
See, this music comes
from what I call

00:57:35.160 --> 00:57:39.160
the 'university of the streets.'
You don't have to go to school

00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.460
to learn it.

00:57:40.460 --> 00:57:42.846
Going to school is
just an enhancement.

00:57:42.846 --> 00:57:43.720
You know what I mean?

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.870
I'm the proof of that.

00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:47.650
But I've learned
how to be-- see,

00:57:47.650 --> 00:57:50.040
jazz musicians are
very ubiquitous.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.230
I wish I had more
time for examples.

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:53.790
We've heard of the
great Bill Rossi.

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:55.956
You know that guy that
played with the Seltzers that

00:57:55.956 --> 00:57:57.280
don't sign autographs.

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:59.861
His best and closest friend
was Julian Cannonball Adderley.

00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:01.110
You didn't know that, did you?

00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:03.170
I wonder why.

00:58:03.170 --> 00:58:05.030
Why would-- Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:07.730
You know who his
best friend was?

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:10.240
"Freddie" Dewayne Hubbard.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.340
One of my closest friends
is Dr. Dick Barnett

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:14.250
who used to play with
the Knickerbockers.

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:16.770
I wrote a song called "Too
Late, Fall Back, Baby."

00:58:16.770 --> 00:58:18.900
So what I'm saying,
to play this music

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.260
you don't have to go to school.

00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:21.718
You can get all
the books you want.

00:58:21.718 --> 00:58:22.870
It's not the same.

00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:24.060
It comes from the street.

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:25.480
This is street music.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:30.290
For example, we can
go outside of the box.

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:31.830
Other musicians can't do this.

00:58:31.830 --> 00:58:32.670
We can.

00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:34.854
We can play this.

00:58:34.854 --> 00:58:38.291
[MUSIC - "FRAGILE"]

00:59:01.552 --> 00:59:02.510
Anybody know that song?

00:59:05.350 --> 00:59:06.240
What was that?

00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:06.940
Sting.

00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:08.170
You see what I'm saying?

00:59:10.571 --> 00:59:12.821
But also, here's the thing--
we don't have a whole lot

00:59:12.821 --> 00:59:14.520
of time-- very little.

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:18.180
When you get yourself involved
with jazz, even if you don't

00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.920
play, if you take a course
in Jazz Appreciation,

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.960
being a jazz musician
will teach you

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:26.272
how to make decisions
in your real life.

00:59:26.272 --> 00:59:27.730
It might sound
funny because you've

00:59:27.730 --> 00:59:29.310
got to be very perceptive.

00:59:29.310 --> 00:59:31.930
You've got to be very
ubiquitous in your thoughts

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:33.720
and how you make
decisions and stuff.

00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:35.970
So every day I wake
up, I say, dear lord,

00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:38.170
thank you for making
a jazz musician.

00:59:38.170 --> 00:59:40.090
Because I didn't
choose it; it chose me,

00:59:40.090 --> 00:59:42.130
as I said before,
not to be redundant.

00:59:42.130 --> 00:59:45.380
We all are born with some
special kind of gift.

00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:47.200
But it's up to you to
find out what it is.

00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:50.570
And when it comes, sometimes
it might be just a quick flash.

00:59:50.570 --> 00:59:52.060
You've got to grab it.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:53.690
So I hope that
answered your question.

00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:55.287
I thank you for coming out.

00:59:55.287 --> 00:59:56.620
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you, Harold.

00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:58.328
HAROLD MABERN: I hope
we can do it again.

00:59:58.328 --> 01:00:02.670
[APPLAUSE]
