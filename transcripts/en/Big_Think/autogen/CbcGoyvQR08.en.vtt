00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:09.180
 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.210
yeah I mean I wrote a whole book on

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.220
yeah I mean I wrote a whole book on
 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.920
yeah I mean I wrote a whole book on
checklist he'd be you know why in the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930
checklist he'd be you know why in the
 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.270
checklist he'd be you know why in the
world would anybody write a whole book

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
world would anybody write a whole book
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.000
world would anybody write a whole book
on checklist and it was the last thing I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010
on checklist and it was the last thing I
 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.190
on checklist and it was the last thing I
thought I would be writing about but

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200
thought I would be writing about but
 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.400
thought I would be writing about but
I've been fascinated by how we grapple

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410
I've been fascinated by how we grapple
 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.679
I've been fascinated by how we grapple
with risk and complexity in medicine and

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689
with risk and complexity in medicine and
 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.230
with risk and complexity in medicine and
i got assigned a project to try to find

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240
i got assigned a project to try to find
 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.850
i got assigned a project to try to find
a way to reduce deaths and surgery we

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860
a way to reduce deaths and surgery we
 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.740
a way to reduce deaths and surgery we
have been struggling with our

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
have been struggling with our
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.750
have been struggling with our
performance and so I started looking at

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
performance and so I started looking at
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.290
performance and so I started looking at
how people in other fields grapple with

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300
how people in other fields grapple with
 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.180
how people in other fields grapple with
the enormously increasing complexity

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
the enormously increasing complexity
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.460
the enormously increasing complexity
that people in professional worlds are

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470
that people in professional worlds are
 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.850
that people in professional worlds are
dealing with and what I found was in the

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860
dealing with and what I found was in the
 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.250
dealing with and what I found was in the
aviation and skyscraper building and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
aviation and skyscraper building and
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500
aviation and skyscraper building and
other lines of work that there was

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510
other lines of work that there was
 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.139
other lines of work that there was
something really fundamental going on we

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149
something really fundamental going on we
 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.600
something really fundamental going on we
had transformed from a world where

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
had transformed from a world where
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.910
had transformed from a world where
ignorance was our biggest struggle as

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
ignorance was our biggest struggle as
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.619
ignorance was our biggest struggle as
human beings this is the way it was for

human beings this is the way it was for
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.660
human beings this is the way it was for
millennia we didn't understand why the

and when I looked to see how people who

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060
and when I looked to see how people who
 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.280
and when I looked to see how people who
actually are solving these problems

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290
actually are solving these problems
 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.100
actually are solving these problems
we're solving it I thought you'd find

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110
we're solving it I thought you'd find
 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.960
we're solving it I thought you'd find
that they had just trained in a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970
that they had just trained in a
 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.180
that they had just trained in a
different way or they had been they were

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190
different way or they had been they were
 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.979
different way or they had been they were
training longer and harder they had a

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989
training longer and harder they had a
 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.930
training longer and harder they had a
different kind of use of technology

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940
different kind of use of technology
 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.960
different kind of use of technology
instead what I found over and over again

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970
instead what I found over and over again
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.550
instead what I found over and over again
was they use checklists

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560
was they use checklists
 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.280
was they use checklists
as simple and mundane as it sounds that

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290
as simple and mundane as it sounds that
 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.729
as simple and mundane as it sounds that
the checklist in a way filled in for

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739
the checklist in a way filled in for
 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.860
the checklist in a way filled in for
weaknesses in people's brains things

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870
weaknesses in people's brains things
 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.220
weaknesses in people's brains things
that they forgot it also filled in for

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
that they forgot it also filled in for
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.490
that they forgot it also filled in for
weaknesses and making teams work teams

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
weaknesses and making teams work teams
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.710
weaknesses and making teams work teams
constantly drop stuff between the cracks

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720
constantly drop stuff between the cracks
 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.990
constantly drop stuff between the cracks
and so we made a checklist based on what

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000
and so we made a checklist based on what
 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.610
and so we made a checklist based on what
I learned actually I've got folks from

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
I learned actually I've got folks from
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.559
I learned actually I've got folks from
Boeing to help us out how do you make a

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569
Boeing to help us out how do you make a
 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.030
Boeing to help us out how do you make a
checklist I didn't think that that would

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040
checklist I didn't think that that would
 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.350
checklist I didn't think that that would
be all that hard it turned out to be

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360
be all that hard it turned out to be
 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.860
be all that hard it turned out to be
hard and one of the things they showed

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870
hard and one of the things they showed
 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.170
hard and one of the things they showed
us was how to how to really focus on

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
us was how to how to really focus on
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.020
us was how to how to really focus on
making it Swift and usable we made a

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030
making it Swift and usable we made a
 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.259
making it Swift and usable we made a
two-minute surgery checklist had just 19

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269
two-minute surgery checklist had just 19
 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.240
two-minute surgery checklist had just 19
items some of them were just make sure

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250
items some of them were just make sure
 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.890
items some of them were just make sure
you don't forget dumb stuff make sure

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
you don't forget dumb stuff make sure
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.880
you don't forget dumb stuff make sure
you gave antibiotics make sure you have

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890
you gave antibiotics make sure you have
 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.559
you gave antibiotics make sure you have
blood ready for a high blood loss case

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569
blood ready for a high blood loss case
 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.210
blood ready for a high blood loss case
and then there were other interesting

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220
and then there were other interesting
 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.339
and then there were other interesting
parts make sure everything in the room

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349
parts make sure everything in the room
 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.009
parts make sure everything in the room
has been introduced by name and roll

make sure the surgeon actually explained

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390
make sure the surgeon actually explained
 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.930

explain their plans for the operation I
 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.949
explain their plans for the operation I
put we put that checklist in eight

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959
put we put that checklist in eight
 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.870
put we put that checklist in eight
hospitals around the world ranging from

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880
hospitals around the world ranging from
 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.319
hospitals around the world ranging from
rural tanzania to Toronto and Seattle

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329
rural tanzania to Toronto and Seattle
 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.170
rural tanzania to Toronto and Seattle
and every single Hospital put it in and

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180
and every single Hospital put it in and
 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.550
and every single Hospital put it in and
had a double digit reduction in

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560
had a double digit reduction in
 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.590
had a double digit reduction in
complications the average reduction in

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600
complications the average reduction in
 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.150
complications the average reduction in
death was forty six percent that made me

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160
death was forty six percent that made me
 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.309
death was forty six percent that made me
realize there was something much deeper

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319
realize there was something much deeper
 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.559
realize there was something much deeper
and more important going on here about

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569
and more important going on here about
 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.470
and more important going on here about
the set of problems we're grappling with

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480
the set of problems we're grappling with
 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.460

in the modern world

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470
 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:05.160
well on the one hand you'd say 0% when

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170
well on the one hand you'd say 0% when
 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.760
well on the one hand you'd say 0% when
you look at we have about 13,000

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770
you look at we have about 13,000
 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:11.070
you look at we have about 13,000
