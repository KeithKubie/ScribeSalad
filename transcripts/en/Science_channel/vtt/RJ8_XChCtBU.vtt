00:00:05.801 --> 00:00:08.701
Narrator:
THE HEADS OF THESE GOLF CLUBS

00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:12.968
ARE MADE FROM AEROSPACE-GRADE
STAINLESS STEEL.

00:00:12.968 --> 00:00:14.267
TO PRODUCE THEM,

00:00:14.267 --> 00:00:18.234
THE FACTORY BEGINS WITH
A WAX REPLICA OF THE CLUBHEAD.

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:20.734
TO MAKE THIS WAX PATTERN,
AS IT'S CALLED,

00:00:20.734 --> 00:00:23.701
THEY INJECT HOT WAX INTO A MOLD.

00:00:23.701 --> 00:00:26.167
THEY EXTRACT THE PATTERN

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.667
AND SNIP OFF THE BULK
OF THE EXCESS WAX.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.868
USING HOT WAX AS AN ADHESIVE,

00:00:33.868 --> 00:00:37.133
A ROBOT JOINS SEVERAL PATTERNS
TO OTHER WAX PARTS

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:39.234
IN THE SHAPE OF GATES
AND RUNNERS,

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:40.567
THE TERM FOR THE CHANNELS

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.434
THAT GUIDE MOLTEN METAL
INTO THE CASTING MOLD.

00:00:44.968 --> 00:00:47.334
THEN THE ROBOT DIPS
THESE PATTERNS

00:00:47.334 --> 00:00:50.033
INTO LIQUID CERAMIC MATERIAL
FOUR TIMES,

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:53.734
WITH A SHOWER OF SILICA SAND
IN BETWEEN EACH COAT.

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.801
THE CERAMIC AND SAND HARDEN,

00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:58.834
FORMING A SHELL
AROUND THE WAX PATTERNS.

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:01.667
THEN THE FACTORY
MELTS OUT THE WAX.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:03.667
THE SHELL IS NOW A MOLD

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:07.200
WITH WHICH TO CAST
THE METAL CLUBHEADS.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.634
ON THE CASTING FLOOR,

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:12.968
A FURNACE HEATS STEEL BARS
TO 3,000 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT --

00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:15.734
WELL BEYOND THE MELTING POINT.

00:01:15.734 --> 00:01:18.100
THE POURING TECHNIQUE
IS CRITICAL.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.367
THE METAL MUST FLOW
AT A CONSISTENT RATE

00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:24.834
TO PREVENT THE FORMATION
OF AIR BUBBLES.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.501
AFTER FIVE HOURS,

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:29.300
A PNEUMATIC HAMMER
BREAKS APART THE MOLD.

00:01:33.267 --> 00:01:36.200
WORKERS SAW OFF THE GATES
AND RUNNERS,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.501
SEPARATING THE CLUBHEADS.

00:01:39.501 --> 00:01:41.000
THEN THEY GRIND OFF

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.033
THE LAST REMNANTS
OF THE GATES AND RUNNERS.

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:52.801
A TURNTABLE RUNS THE CLUBHEADS
THROUGH A SANDBLASTER,

00:01:52.801 --> 00:01:55.567
WHICH GIVES THE METAL
A PARTICULAR FINISH.

00:01:59.634 --> 00:02:02.234
NEXT, THEY STICK ON
A METAL BADGE

00:02:02.234 --> 00:02:05.234
BEARING THE CLUB'S MODEL NAME.

00:02:05.234 --> 00:02:07.968
THEY APPLY
A DOT OF AUTOMOTIVE PAINT.

00:02:07.968 --> 00:02:10.868
THE COLOR IDENTIFIES
THE ANGLE OF THE CLUB.

00:02:10.868 --> 00:02:13.534
THERE ARE 12 DIFFERENT ANGLES.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:19.300
NOW THEY LINE THE NECK
OF THE CLUBHEAD WITH EPOXY,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.701
THEN COAT THE END OF THE SHAFT
WITH EPOXY

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:24.567
AND SLIP IT INTO THE NECK.

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:28.901
A PNEUMATIC HAMMER PUSHES THE
SHAFT IN AS FAR AS IT CAN GO.

00:02:28.901 --> 00:02:33.267
THE SHAFT IS MADE OF EITHER
EXTRUDED STEEL OR CARBON FIBER.

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:39.133
NOW IT'S TIME
TO WORK ON THE SHAFT.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:41.601
FIRST, THEY CUT IT
TO THE RIGHT LENGTH,

00:02:41.601 --> 00:02:44.767
DEPENDING ON THE MODEL.

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.033
THEN THEY PUT THE SHAFT
ON A SPINDLE

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.868
AND WRAP THE TOP 10 INCHES
IN DOUBLE-SIDED TAPE

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:52.434
TO HOLD THE CLUB'S RUBBER GRIP.

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:02.033
THEY LUBRICATE THE TAPE
AND THE INSIDE OF THE GRIP

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:04.634
BEFORE SLIDING THE GRIP
OVER THE SHAFT.

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:08.467
A LASER LINE HELPS THEM ALIGN
THE GRIP IN THE RIGHT POSITION.

00:03:08.467 --> 00:03:11.701
THIS IS CRITICAL, BECAUSE
THE GRIP IS THE GOLFER'S GUIDE

00:03:11.701 --> 00:03:13.167
TO CORRECT HAND POSITIONING,

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:16.501
WHICH IS ESSENTIAL
TO A GOOD SWING.

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:20.167
NEXT, A COMPUTER READS THE LIE,

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:23.701
THE TERM FOR THE CLUBHEAD'S
ANGLE RELATIVE TO THE GROUND.

00:03:23.701 --> 00:03:25.501
THEN IT READS THE LOFT --

00:03:25.501 --> 00:03:28.701
THE TERM FOR THE ANGLE
OF THE CLUBHEAD'S FACE.

00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:30.634
THE COMPUTER THEN TELLS
THE TECHNICIAN

00:03:30.634 --> 00:03:32.801
WHAT ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE.

00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:34.701
ONCE HE'S MADE THE ADJUSTMENTS,

00:03:34.701 --> 00:03:37.701
THE COMPUTER REANALYZES
THE NEW LOFT AND LIE

00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:41.434
TO ENSURE THEY'RE PERFECT.

00:03:41.434 --> 00:03:44.968
IT'S THIS TYPE OF PRECISION
THAT ENSURE THESE GOLF CLUBS

00:03:44.968 --> 00:03:48.968
FIT THE QUALITY SPECIFICATIONS
TO A "T." [tee]
