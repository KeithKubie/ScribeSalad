00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.540
- What do we got here?

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.790
Well, we get a couple of what
I refer to as the neo-classics.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.790
The one on the left
is a Mercury Cougar.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.210
OK.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.880
But the one on the right--
no, you know what?

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.710
I think that's a Spartan.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.000
Why am I sitting here looking?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.210
We should just go
in there and look.

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.540
Yeah, let's see.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:18.960
Let's see, man.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.170
Oh, they got a
Corvette right there too.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.710
And it's an '82
Pepto-Bismol pink.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.250
[laughing]

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.040
If you're sick to your
stomach and you look at this,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.880
it only makes you sicker.
- Right.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.040
So that's not good.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.250
You might throw
up in your mouth.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.540
These I find
bizarrely interesting.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.830
And that one's got
T-tops on it too.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.580
That little blue
one's kinda cool, man.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.000
Classic Tiffany.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.750
OK, that's a Tiffany.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.750
I want to see if anybody's home
before I make anybody nervous.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.420
Where's the front
door in this place?

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.080
Is it through the gates?
- I think so.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.210
Here we go.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.080
- Maybe there's a bell--
- Maybe.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.880
[knocking]

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.750
Well, you know, if I
start looking at the cars,

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.460
I bet you they'll come out.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.420
Excuse me, but, uh, could
you read this word for me

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.790
here on the grill?

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.210
- Could I?
- Yes.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.960
Ha-ha.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.460
Spartan.
Thank you.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.080
You were right on the money.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.920
With the T-tops, it could
be a Mustang or a Cougar,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.120
'cause Cougar did
do T-tops as well.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.540
But it's probably
a Mustang, right?

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.290
Hi.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.750
Is this your house?

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.120
Well, darling,
then this is perfect.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.710
I'm Danny.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.960
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.420
All right, all right.
- I'm Kevin.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.460
This is Kevin.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.040
What's your name?

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.210
Monique Brewster, it's
indeed a pleasure to meet you.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.540
Right back at you.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.000
I hope you don't mind,
we're car people.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.580
What in the world are you doing
with a Tiffany and a Spartan?

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.290
Well, you got good taste.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.120
Nice.
All right.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.170
You speak it like I speak it.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.330
It's their face.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.000
They're gorgeous.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.170
Neo-classics like the
Spartan and Tiffany are cool.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.170
Some consider them
gaudy and inauthentic,

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.000
and I can appreciate that
side of the discussion.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.170
But Spartan cars were the
brainchild of auto designer Ron

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.420
Sparks, who built these cars
in San Marcos, California

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.420
in the 1980s and the '90s.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.170
Now, the 1920s-style
bodies are made

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.500
from aluminum and fiberglass,
and they sit on top

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.290
of a Datsun 280Z chassis.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.960
Now, the Tiffanys, they were
built around the Mercury

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.000
Cougars by the Classic Motor
Carriage Company in Miami,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.960
which is one of the biggest kit
car manufacturers in the world.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.330
Some take issue with calling
these Frankencars kit cars,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.830
because unlike
those do it yourself

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.210
models, neo-classics like
the Tiffany and Spartan

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.880
were assembled in factories.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.670
So call them whatever
you like, these

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.830
are unique rides
that will no doubt

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.540
have heads turning and
scratching wherever they go.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.790
How long have you had them?

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.880
I've had this
one for about six

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.960
and this one for about eight.
- All right.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.460
You know there's
only 500 of these--

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.620
Of the Spartans.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:02.460
--made in the
whole wide world.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.460
See, I called that.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.540
I'm like, that's a Spartan.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:05.880
He did call it.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.830
Then there was only
1,500 of these made.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.250
Of the Tiffanys, yeah.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.040
And when was the last
time either one of them

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.920
were on the road?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.580
I just drove this one
maybe about an hour ago.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.000
Oh, really?
[laughing]

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.250
That one's up and
running and driving.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.420
- And this one runs too.
- OK.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.420
I got you.
That's all good stuff.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.750
I love them both, but these
Spartans are really cool.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.580
What year is it?
- '86.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.670
The 280Z is what they
built them off of.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.250
That's where the
T-tops came from.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:32.710
There you go.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.250
I'm just curious, would
you ever sell this car?

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:40.080
Someone came around and asked
me, and I was really like, no.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.580
But I'm kind of--
- Thinking about it?

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.880
--in the wings of that.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.540
So as far as just
getting information

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.210
and keeping that in mind.
- I got you.

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.250
We can talk, right?

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.750
Yes, absolutely.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.750
Well, let me do this.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.580
Let me trade some info with you.
- OK, awesome.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.120
You think about it.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.790
And we'll talk again.
- OK.

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.540
- Thank you.
- Awesome, god bless.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.880
Thank you for taking the time
and talking about your cars.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.750
Thank you very much.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.790
Very nice to meet you.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.790
Absolutely.
