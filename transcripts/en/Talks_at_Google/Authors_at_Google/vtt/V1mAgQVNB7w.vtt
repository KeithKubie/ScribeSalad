[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.374 --> 00:00:06.790
GABE SHERMAN: Thank
you, Gretchen,

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:07.780
for making time for us.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.620
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Well,
thank you so much.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.750
I wish I could take
credit for the timing.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.000
I mean, I guess in a more
subtle way, I can in a way

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.520
that coming forward
15 months ago

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.664
has started this floodgate
of other women feeling

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:24.580
the confidence and the
bravery and the courage

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.585
to do the same thing.

00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:26.376
GABE SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:00:26.376 --> 00:00:28.420
So I imagine--
maybe, maybe not--

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.480
we have some Fox News
viewers in the room

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.740
or watching on live stream.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.096
But for those who didn't
watch Fox, and this is really

00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:37.720
may be your first
time seeing Gretchen,

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.260
can you tell everyone
what motivated

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.210
you to write the book?

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.891
Obviously last year you were
in the middle of a crazy media

00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:46.390
storm.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.412
And now here you are, the
public face of this issue.

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:52.870
GRETCHEN CARLSON: So after I
jumped off the cliff by myself

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.720
on July 6, 2016,
where my story broke

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.110
and I filed a lawsuit
against my former boss

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.030
at the company where
I was working--

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.120
I mean, I had no idea what would
happen to me the next minute

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.290
or the next day.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.010
So it was really an
out-of-body experience

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.310
as it started to unfold
and develop really quickly,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.760
with the results
of my boss being

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.160
forced from the company and
other women coming forward.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.579
I could have never,
ever predicted that.

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.620
And also, what started
happening at the same time

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.350
was that I started hearing
from thousands of women

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.030
all across the
country who started

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.670
sharing their own personal
stories of pain and shame

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.510
with me as well.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.010
And I soon realized that
this was a pervasive epidemic

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.130
in our country, that it
wasn't just sexual harassment

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.950
in the television
industry or in Hollywood.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.220
This was from all walks
of life, from single moms

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.790
who were working two jobs to
make ends meet as a waitress

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.820
to members of our military
to teachers to accountants.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.670
I mean, it was every profession.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.310
I grew up in the midwest where
my parents always encouraged me

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.644
to write back to people
and correspond and write

00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:03.310
thank you notes.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.580
So I started responding
to all these women.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.190
And what I found out
was that they all

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.740
felt so grateful that I
was giving them a voice

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.750
because nobody had ever listened
to them or to their story.

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.470
And from that, I felt a sense
of duty to put together a book,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.060
not only to honor
these voiceless women,

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.580
but also to give
practical advice

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.100
and move the ball
forward on this issue.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.110
And look where we are today.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.260
In a short period of
time, as you just said,

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.865
this is the national
dialogue right now.

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:35.800
GABE SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.980
So I know you can't discuss the
specifics of your time at Fox.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.180
But can you take us a little
bit inside your state of mind

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.390
when you filed the lawsuit
against Roger Ailes, who

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.080
we should remember was the
most powerful man in media.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.050
He had helped elect
three presidents,

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.660
was a kingmaker in
the Republican party,

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.230
and presided over a
ruthless media company that

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.080
was known for
attacking anyone inside

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.970
and outside the company
who questioned Fox.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.370
And here you were, going to
file a lawsuit naming him

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.870
personally.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.295
What was going
through your mind?

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:12.670
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Well, courage
building is not something

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.100
that you do overnight.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.620
I think it has a lot to
do with how you're raised.

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.384
Fortunately I had
parents who told me

00:03:19.384 --> 00:03:21.550
I could be anything I wanted
to be every single day,

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.730
and that helped me to build
courage from a young age.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.480
Still, when you decide to
do something like this,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.160
it's a process.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.310
And the final nail
in the coffin for me

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.670
was when I realized that
my job was coming to an end

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.880
after 25 years in the business.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.190
And it was coming to an
end that wasn't my choice

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.920
to come to an end--

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.380
that I decided, if I
don't step up and speak up

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.480
about this issue and have
conviction on it, then

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.010
who else is going to do it?

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.420
And most important to me,
Gabe-- and you're a new father--

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.570
is I have a 12-year-old son
and a 14-year-old daughter.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.530
And I don't want them to face
the same indignities that I've

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.030
gone through in my career.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.850
And I was shocked that it
was still existing in 2017.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.370
But I wanted to
eradicate it for them,

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.510
or at least do my
part to do that.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:16.510
GABE SHERMAN: And I think
one of the things that

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.930
was unique to your situation is
that a lot of women, when they

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.720
come forward, are worried about
their stories being questioned

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.995
or shamed or doubted.

00:04:23.995 --> 00:04:25.870
And I think what was
unique in your situation

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:27.820
is that your
colleagues, that there

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:30.880
was an orchestrated campaign
to discredit your story.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.490
What did that feel like when
people that you worked with

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.520
were casting doubt
on your claims?

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.370
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Well, you
find out who your friends are.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:44.200
I mean, not only coworkers,
but you find out in life.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.410
It was really fascinating.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.826
You know, some
people who I hadn't

00:04:46.826 --> 00:04:49.030
heard from in 30 years
reached out to me,

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.410
and that meant a lot to me.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:53.800
Some people who lived
on my street never did.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.805
So it was interesting
because as time went on,

00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:57.430
people would approach
me and say, well,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.230
I didn't want to bother you,
or I didn't know what to say.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.520
You know, it's kind of
like when somebody dies,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.680
people feel tongue tied.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.907
And it would have been
just nice if they just

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.740
would have sent one
little line in an email,

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.080
like thinking of you or
whatever, because trust me,

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.090
when you do something
like this, you have

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.370
a lot of incredibly dark days.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.347
And the only other thing I
would add to either the trolls

00:05:21.347 --> 00:05:23.930
on social media-- or however you
want to describe those people

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.013
that you just brought up--

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.870
you can't waste too
much time worrying

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.342
about those who malign
you because really what

00:05:34.342 --> 00:05:36.800
I wanted to do with this mission
was move the ball forward.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.417
And it doesn't do any good
to sit around and worry

00:05:40.417 --> 00:05:42.125
about people who said,
really bad things.

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:43.583
GABE SHERMAN: Just
this week we had

00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:47.330
more revelations about
Harvey Weinstein,

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:49.250
other prominent
members in Hollywood,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.490
and your former
colleague, Bill O'Reilly.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.350
Sort of from the
30,000 foot view,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.230
where are we in
this conversation

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.199
that your story, now
your book helped ignite?

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.490
GRETCHEN CARLSON: So I think
it's absolutely horrifying

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.380
that any company would protect
a harasser, a serial harasser,

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.670
for 30 plus years.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.280
I mean, listen,
harassers don't continue

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.870
to be able to do
that in the workplace

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.820
unless they have help.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.650
So enablers,
lawyers, assistants.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.650
These were all people who
helped in the cover-up

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.420
and the shutting
up of the victims.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:31.220
And we should all believe that
that is absolutely outrageous.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.180
So from 30,000 feet,
what I'm saying now

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.100
is that women are
finally feeling

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.550
the courage and the bravery
to say, enough already.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.710
We're not going to
take this anymore.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:45.490
And looking at that MeToo
hashtag for me was just--

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:47.710
that was so empowering
just for me.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.750
Even though the
stories were so awful,

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.900
it showed that every
woman, number one,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.040
has a story, unfortunately,
but also that we're not

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.470
ashamed to speak up about it.

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.380
And we're shifting the shame
from the woman, where it never

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.490
should have been, to the
harasser where it belongs.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:08.950
I've been fascinated by the
fact that we're still having

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:10.139
this national conversation.

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:10.930
GABE SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.220
And do you think--

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.150
we were just talking before
we sat down about Anita Hill.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:19.420
And in a certain respect, sexual
harassment in the workplace

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.544
is not a new thing.

00:07:20.544 --> 00:07:22.210
It's been something
our culture has been

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:25.690
grappling with for decades.

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:29.650
But sadly, here we
are in 2017, and we

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.130
realize that someone
like Harvey Weinstein,

00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:36.100
who was exposed to be a
serial predator, quote,

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.490
people knew this was going on
for years and it didn't stop.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:44.600
I mean, to me as a reporter
who covered Ailes's downfall,

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.130
am always shocked that this
behavior could have gone on

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.800
with such high profile people,
and no one said, wait a minute,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.859
this isn't right.

00:07:51.859 --> 00:07:52.900
GRETCHEN CARLSON: I know.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.270
In fact, in
Weinstein's contract,

00:07:55.270 --> 00:08:00.100
allegedly the board allowed
him to go on harassing.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.270
They knew it was happening.

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.520
And they just said, well,
if another case comes up

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.710
you'll have to pay us a fine.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.090
I mean, really?

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.410
The board of directors-- by the
way, none of them are women--

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:18.160
allowed that kind of pervasive
misogyny to continue.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.430
That is absolutely
outrageous and horrifying.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.980
GABE SHERMAN: That's where the
focus of my reporting-- a lot

00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.220
of it has been on the
systems and the power that

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.630
allowed this behavior to go on.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:32.110
And at Fox, a lot
of it was a system

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.620
that Ailes set up
to silence victims

00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.250
through legal settlements, out
of court settlements, NDAs,

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.679
which we've talked about.

00:08:40.679 --> 00:08:42.640
So to me, this is--

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.240
like with the Catholic
Church abuse scandal--

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.100
the focus should be on the
power, not the individuals.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.010
It's the system that allowed
this abuse to take place.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:57.850
Can you talk a little bit
about O'Reilly to the degree

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:58.450
that you can?

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.670
We learned, according
to "The New York Times"

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.730
that Fox News signed
him to a new contract

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:06.820
after knowing he made multiple
out-of-court settlements.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:10.470
Does that indicate that the
company was taking seriously

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:12.970
protecting women, or were they
willing to look the other way

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.307
for ratings?

00:09:14.307 --> 00:09:16.390
GRETCHEN CARLSON: So if
you read in the newspapers

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:20.160
after my story, there was
going to be a new beginning.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.430
And I'll let you make
your own assumption

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:26.650
about that, since
they resigned him well

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.552
after my story had broken.

00:09:28.552 --> 00:09:30.010
You know, what I
can say about that

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:34.630
is that for any company
to re-sign an individual

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.740
who had been dismissed for
sexual harassment allegations

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.110
and known settlements
already, and then

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.720
invite him to come back on
the air just last month,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.440
that is absolutely horrifying.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.660
And to think that there
was a cleanup on the way,

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.611
I don't think I'd
call that a cleanup.

00:09:51.611 --> 00:09:53.110
GABE SHERMAN: And
the number itself.

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:57.130
I mean, a $32 million
private settlement.

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:00.670
O'Reilly has been out
there saying it's all BS

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.530
and it's not true.

00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:03.490
And I think the number
speaks for itself.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.950
Nobody spends that
amount of money

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.014
to settle a claim if there's
not some merit to it.

00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:11.680
GRETCHEN CARLSON: That's exactly
what I tweeted the other night.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.290
I just said, I don't care
how much money you have,

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.370
nobody pays $32 million
for false allegations.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:21.490
And it was, I think, the most
re-tweeted Tweet that I've ever

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.720
sent in my entire life.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.970
I didn't even intend for that.

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.939
It was just my general
reaction that--

00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:30.230
and here's part of the problem.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:31.210
And I know you know
this, Gabe, but I

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:33.070
want to make sure
we're clear about this.

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:34.660
When you sign a
settlement or you're

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.610
forced into arbitration, which
is also a secret chamber,

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:40.900
these are the two ways in
which our country has deemed

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.160
that we resolve these issues.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:45.340
They're both in
silence for women.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.950
What happens is that the
perpetrator can go out and say

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:51.284
whatever they want publicly.

00:10:51.284 --> 00:10:52.450
And the women can't respond.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.430
So is that fair?

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:00.220
That's just bias like you've
never even heard of before,

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:05.170
where the harasser can
go out and say whatever.

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.600
None of the
allegations are true.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.350
And the woman can't speak
up because if she does,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.650
then she'll lose the
settlement that she received

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.700
or she'll get in trouble
some other way legally.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.910
So it's a flawed
system, and none of it

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:23.810
benefits the women at all.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.810
GABE SHERMAN: We talked
a little bit about that.

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:27.340
We'll circle back to your story.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.710
But you're touching on
kind of the public policy

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.410
aspect of this, which I find
really fascinating in the work

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:34.090
that you're doing.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:38.350
To the degree that
there are laws in place,

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.370
how can we change the system so
that women in the workplace who

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:46.570
experience harassment
have a safe venue

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:50.350
to both air these claims
and get some sort of justice

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.317
or recourse?

00:11:51.317 --> 00:11:52.900
GRETCHEN CARLSON:
So one of the things

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.560
I focus on in the book "Be
Fierce" is, should we really

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.580
have these claims and complaints
going to human resources?

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.480
And when I started
talking about this,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.510
I did hear from a
lot of great people

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.095
who work in HR departments.

00:12:06.095 --> 00:12:08.470
So I don't want to say negative
things about all of them,

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:10.345
because they said look,
we're trying to help.

00:12:10.345 --> 00:12:12.170
And so I see that.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:15.760
However, I think we need to
really be cognizant of the fact

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.540
that when the harasser could be
the top person of the country

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.930
who's signing the
paycheck, is really

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:25.090
the safest place to go to HR?

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.580
Isn't that a
conflict of interest?

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.000
I say that it is.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.100
So in "Be Fierce", I advocate
a couple of new measures

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:36.970
that would maybe help more
women to come forward and keep

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.720
it a more independent process.

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.800
So one of them is to
hire an ombudsman, who

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.680
would be an independent, safe
person, maybe even anonymously,

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.970
that you would go to.

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.220
And you wouldn't feel
like you're walking down

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:50.770
your hallway looking over your
back knowing that you just

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:54.160
filed a complaint with somebody,
who many times the HR people go

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.290
right to the harasser
and tell them

00:12:56.290 --> 00:13:00.190
that you filed a claim to make
your life even more miserable.

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.350
So that's one thing
that I proposed.

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.934
The second is, after
the Anita Hill case--

00:13:06.934 --> 00:13:08.350
actually, that was
the first story

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:10.960
I covered as a
journalist, ironically,

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:15.370
and shortly thereafter,
I was harassed on the job

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.830
by a cameraman in a
rural part of Virginia

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.230
who talked to me
when we got back

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:21.820
in the car about
how I felt when he

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:26.240
touched my breasts by
putting the microphone on me.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.770
And I actually envisioned
myself rolling out

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:30.290
of the passenger side door--

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:32.641
this was before cell
phones-- because I was so

00:13:32.641 --> 00:13:33.890
panicked to get away from him.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.590
So I've had other
experiences in my life

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:41.050
where I was sexually
harassed before my last place

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:41.750
of employment.

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.440
But basically, in a
nutshell, it drains you

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.060
of all the
self-confidence you've

00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:50.380
built up in your entire life
to be known as a sex object

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:54.580
instead of for your brain
and for your talents.

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:56.470
So what I think happened
after Anita Hill is

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.110
that a lot of companies
decided to incorporate

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.020
sexual harassment training, have
that be part of their policy.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:05.650
But what I found out in my
research is that a lot of times

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.901
it's just a cover your ass
facade for litigious reasons

00:14:08.901 --> 00:14:10.900
and otherwise, for the
company to be able to say

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.836
we provide this.

00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:14.710
So one of the things I
propose in "Be Fierce"

00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:17.920
is we should really take the
focus of sexual harassment

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.330
training and move it to
more bystander training.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:26.560
How do we encourage
other employees

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.290
who know that this is
happening, may witness it,

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:32.410
or have been told by a colleague
that it's happening to also

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:35.920
have the courage to come forward
and not feel that they will

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.350
also be retaliated against?

00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.140
We should really
refocus the training

00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:44.770
on how do we celebrate the
people who have the courage

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:46.750
to come forward and say
it's not a safe working

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.880
environment instead of
just focusing on hey,

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.490
here's some case studies
of sexual harassment,

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:54.275
and sign on the
dotted line so that we

00:14:54.275 --> 00:14:55.900
know for sure you
came to this training

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.750
so that we're off the hook.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.930
Let's really put effort
into getting the enablers

00:15:01.930 --> 00:15:04.830
and bystanders to
become our allies.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:08.800
GABE SHERMAN: And in many
cases, the harassers themselves

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.750
use the HR departments as a foil
to say that well, no one came

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.190
forward to make allegations.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:17.530
How could these claims be
true because there's never

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:18.680
been a formal process?

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.880
But I think that speaks to
what Gretchen is talking about,

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.650
that a lot of people don't
feel that HR is a safe place

00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:27.710
to make these claims.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.770
So instead they bottle
them up, and then

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:32.810
the only recourse they
have is through litigation.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.821
And that obviously
has its own problems.

00:15:34.821 --> 00:15:36.820
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Well,
because most of the time

00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.560
you don't take a
sexual harassment

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.210
case to an open court.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.710
Why?

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.410
Because prevalent now
in employee contracts

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.760
are these arbitration clauses.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.120
GABE SHERMAN: So talk about
secret corporate courts,

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.084
as you call them, and the
way in which our employment

00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:55.750
contracts-- and perhaps a lot of
people here at Google have them

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.010
as well--

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.800
when you work for a
big company and you

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.290
have a claim, that you
can't sue them in court.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.520
You have to deal with it in a
secret, off the record court.

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.520
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Right.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.900
And so this was
never the intention

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:08.990
of an arbitration clause.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:11.410
When the Supreme Court ruled
on this over 20 years ago,

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.710
it really was to
not clog the courts,

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:17.680
but not intended for
sexual harassment claims

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.640
or discrimination claims.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:22.360
And then that's where they're
being utilized, though.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.210
So what happens is that
you basically sign away

00:16:25.210 --> 00:16:27.790
your Seventh Amendment right
to an open jury process when

00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:28.930
you start your job.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:31.360
And listen, nobody starts a
job and thinks to themselves,

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.430
wow, I expect to
get into a dispute.

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.710
I mean, I know I didn't.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:41.020
But it's a dark day when
you find out in a dispute

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.980
that you can never tell
anyone what happened ever.

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.170
And that's what arbitration is.

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:49.670
So it's secret,
first and foremost.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.930
So here's a hypothetical.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:52.930
The woman is being sexually
harassed on the job.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:53.980
She files a complaint.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:56.230
They immediately put
her into arbitration.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:01.000
The company's going, whew,
we don't have to tell anyone.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.420
The woman loses her job.

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.450
In arbitration you don't
get the same amount

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:08.500
of witnesses or depositions.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.460
The company usually picks
the arbitrator, and only 20%

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.790
of the time does the
employee actually win.

00:17:15.790 --> 00:17:18.530
And there's no appeal.

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:21.109
Does that sound fair?

00:17:21.109 --> 00:17:24.319
So what ends up happening is
the woman is out of the job.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.300
She can never tell
anyone what happened

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:28.790
or that she went
through this process.

00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:31.400
And the harasser, many
times, gets to stay,

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.630
and nobody knows about it.

00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:37.190
And that's been going on for
the last couple of decades.

00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:41.660
It's why even I didn't realize
how pervasive this issue is

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:45.264
in the workplace because we
don't hear about these cases.

00:17:45.264 --> 00:17:47.180
But the reason we don't
hear about these cases

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.150
is because they're being
forced into secrecy.

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:51.830
GABE SHERMAN: And
when I was reporting

00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:55.280
on the Fox News sexual
harassment scandal last summer,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.190
one of the women I
interviewed, RudI Bakhtiar, who

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:04.070
was a correspondent at Fox News
years ago, she broke her NDA.

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.160
And she was very courageous.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.031
She was the first woman to
come forward on the record

00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:11.030
and give an interview to
me about her experience

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.380
of harassment after signing
an arbitration settlement.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:19.190
And she told me the night
before her interview

00:18:19.190 --> 00:18:24.470
that she needed to transfer
money, basically take

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.140
all of her life savings and move
it to a different bank account

00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:30.200
because she was so terrified
that Roger Ailes or Fox

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.370
News would come after her
after her interview with me.

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:37.070
And she thankfully was brave
enough to share her story,

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:41.510
and that really helped catalyze
and bring the Fox News scandal

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.350
into the light.

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.280
But I think that speaks to
the fear that these NDAs have,

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.140
that they inspire in victims.

00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:51.350
And I guess what I wanted to ask
you is, do you think companies

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:54.170
should, now that we're in the
middle of this conversation,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:57.770
basically say if you've
experienced harassment,

00:18:57.770 --> 00:19:00.050
we think this is an important
public issue to discuss

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.900
and we should release
you from NDAs.

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.390
That That would be very big
of companies to do that.

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:07.160
I think we should
all demand that.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.785
Let me just say a
little bit about Rudy

00:19:08.785 --> 00:19:11.300
because she was so
brave in doing that,

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.460
and she was an amazing reporter.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.360
She was from Iran.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.020
She was covering foreign
policy for us at Fox

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.357
and did a great job.

00:19:19.357 --> 00:19:20.940
And suddenly she
wasn't there anymore.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.560
And I always wondered,
what happened to Rudy?

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.630
10 years later,
when she came out

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.220
to defend me and
tell her own story,

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.200
I guess I found out
what happened to Rudy.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.750
And I tell that
story because she's

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.920
the microcosm of the
macrocosm of all these women

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.050
who've had the American
dream taken away

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:44.420
from them for no reason except
because of some random jerk.

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.120
And that's why we should
all be concerned about this.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:51.440
As far as NDAs, there's
now a national call

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.140
for the Weinstein Company
and for other companies

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.290
to release women from them.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:01.430
I urge all of you
to join that mission

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:05.210
because I'm not asking
for businesses to not

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:07.730
have NDAs for business secrets.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.400
We all understand that.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.440
I feel comfortable signing
an NDA that I'm not

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.140
going to talk about
some new technology

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.600
that you're developing
or some big news

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:21.110
story that we were only privy
to at our place of employment.

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.790
That makes sense.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:28.980
But not about issues that
are violating a human being.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:32.570
So I think that we should all
have a national call for NDAs

00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:34.484
to not exist anymore.

00:20:34.484 --> 00:20:35.900
Let's see if
companies will do it.

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.200
GABE SHERMAN: Yeah.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.020
But I agree.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.850
I think companies have
twisted the use of NDAs

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.760
to cover up violations
of human rights

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.070
rather than protecting corporate
secrets or trade practices.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:50.240
So I think that clearly is
something that hopefully

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.250
would galvanize support.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:55.190
I want to circle
back to your story,

00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:58.160
because I've had the
privilege of learning more

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.620
about you and your life.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:01.880
And for all of you
out there, Gretchen

00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.790
is a remarkably
impressive woman.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.660
She was trained as
a concert violinist.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:11.420
She was, obviously
famously, Miss America.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.820
And she went to
Stanford University.

00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:15.861
She is somebody who has
set her goals on things

00:21:15.861 --> 00:21:16.610
and achieved them.

00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:21.800
And I want to talk about how
you approached your lawsuit

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.970
and making sure that your claims
would be serious and taken

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:29.180
seriously, and advice you
have for other women who

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.150
are possibly thinking about
coming forward, what steps they

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.340
can take to make sure
that they're protected

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:35.979
and be disciplined
in how they do it.

00:21:35.979 --> 00:21:38.270
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Well, thank
you for bringing that up.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:41.270
By the way, we should mention
that I was always forbidden

00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:42.800
from ever knowing Gabe.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:45.650
I was never supposed
to ever meet Gabe, know

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:48.170
who Gabe was
because he was doing

00:21:48.170 --> 00:21:50.480
a lot of investigative work.

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:55.010
And I do think it's ironic
that we have become friends.

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.040
Whoever thought I'd be sitting
on stage with Gabe Sherman?

00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:00.740
So that in and of itself, thank
you, Gabe, for all the work

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:03.430
that you have done.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.139
In Chapter Four of
my book "Be Fierce",

00:22:05.139 --> 00:22:06.680
I wanted to make
sure that I laid out

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.040
a playbook for women, and
for men, who go through this.

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.262
So it's my 12-point plan.

00:22:12.262 --> 00:22:13.970
I don't think it's
ever been done before,

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:15.770
and what I'm
encouraging women to do

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:17.480
is just take it
right out of the book

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.880
and put it in the back
pocket, because oftentimes

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.680
what happens to women
in these situations

00:22:22.680 --> 00:22:27.760
is we think we can beat
this if we just work harder.

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.280
We think the
harassment will stop.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.950
They'll finally really
appreciate us for our brains.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.550
And so we keep
persevering and we

00:22:35.550 --> 00:22:37.840
keep persevering and
putting up with it.

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.600
And one day we
finally just combust,

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.229
and we might go
file a complaint.

00:22:41.229 --> 00:22:43.020
And you know what the
problem with that is?

00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.540
We don't have a plan.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.750
So my playbook is a plan.

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.500
You can't put the genie
back in the bottle

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.900
once you go and
make that complaint.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.700
I'll tell you my
top three things

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.690
in the plan of 12 points.

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:59.280
Number one, you have
to call a lawyer first.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:01.470
There are resources
in the back of my book

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:04.009
that can show you exactly
where you can call somebody.

00:23:04.009 --> 00:23:05.550
They'll take the
call for 10 minutes.

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.260
Tell them what
your situation is.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.210
They'll let you know
the laws in your state,

00:23:09.210 --> 00:23:11.250
because they're
different, and what

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:14.490
your statute of
limitations are, and also

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:18.570
other really important things,
like can you have evidence?

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:19.650
Can you record?

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:23.070
In 11 states it's illegal
to one party consent record.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.820
So you need to know what
the laws are in your state.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:30.220
Number two, document.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:32.520
Document, document, document.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.490
I talked to a bunch of women in
my book who had done just that.

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:37.230
They wrote a journal about
what was happening to them.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.100
They saved e-mails.

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.080
They saved texts so
that they had evidence.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.520
And then they were
fired and they

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.700
couldn't go back to their office
where they kept all that stuff.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:45.750
So take it home.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:49.330
Number three.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:53.740
I know it's so hard, but tell
at least two trusted colleagues

00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:55.990
because you're going
to need the witnesses.

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.807
We still live in a he
said, she said culture.

00:23:58.807 --> 00:24:01.390
Even though we've seen a lot of
change over the last 15 months

00:24:01.390 --> 00:24:03.940
that I'm so
appreciative of, you're

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:05.560
still not going to be believed.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.143
And you're probably
going to be called

00:24:07.143 --> 00:24:10.390
a liar and a troublemaker, and
you just can't take a joke.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.190
So tell two trusted colleagues.

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.790
And I would recommend
telling a man

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:19.690
because, I hate to say it,
that's going to probably carry

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:25.750
more weight if, in fact, the man
says, I saw it or I heard it,

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:31.480
or she told me on December 5,
2017 that this happened to her.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:36.040
At least then you have
people defending you

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.106
instead of feeling
like you're 100% alone.

00:24:39.106 --> 00:24:40.480
Anyway, there are
nine other tips

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.270
that are in Chapter Four of
my playbook, "Be Fierce".

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:47.422
I think it's essential
that women and men get this

00:24:47.422 --> 00:24:48.880
into their hands,
and that you pass

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.520
along this same gift of
courage to other people

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.910
that you know that may be facing
any injustice in their life.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.620
This is not just about
sexual harassment.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:59.560
This is about being fierce and
standing up and speaking up

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.330
about any way in
which you don't feel

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.970
you're being treated fairly,
whether that's pay in equity

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:05.980
or bullying in
school for our kids,

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:07.842
or not getting a seat
in the boardroom,

00:25:07.842 --> 00:25:09.550
or not getting the
promotion you deserve.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:14.590
This is about a movement of
standing up and speaking up

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:18.010
for you to be the best
person you can be.

00:25:18.010 --> 00:25:20.260
GABE SHERMAN: We've
seen, obviously,

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.520
the swiftness of the downfall
of, say, a Harvey Weinstein.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.780
Do you think now we're at
a place where companies

00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:32.050
do have a zero tolerance policy
when a powerful executive has

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.910
been exposed for his behavior?

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.410
Or do you think,
unfortunately, this

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.410
may be kind of a
fleeting moment,

00:25:38.410 --> 00:25:40.886
and we'll revert
to the status quo?

00:25:40.886 --> 00:25:42.260
GRETCHEN CARLSON:
I am surprised,

00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:44.440
based on how our news
cycles change so quickly now

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.570
and our attention
spans are so limited,

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:49.630
that we are still talking
about this three weeks

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:51.190
after the Weinstein story broke.

00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:53.350
But I am so heartened
that we are,

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:56.080
because it means that all of
the work that I've been doing

00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.121
and others have been doing
for the last 15 months

00:25:58.121 --> 00:26:00.070
is paying off.

00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:03.220
You know, when you think
about cultural shifts

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:07.450
with race relations or gay and
lesbian and transgender issues,

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.560
they don't happen overnight.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.480
So the idea that we have come
this far in 15 months, Gabe,

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.974
I really feel--

00:26:14.974 --> 00:26:16.390
I tend to be an
optimistic person,

00:26:16.390 --> 00:26:20.470
but I really think
that this is amazing.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:24.547
And I don't think we're
going to turn back.

00:26:24.547 --> 00:26:25.630
Look at what happened now.

00:26:25.630 --> 00:26:27.670
You have the Amazon
Studios executives.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:29.680
You have the other
Hollywood director

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.360
with all those complaints.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.530
GABE SHERMAN: 200 women.

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:33.040
GRETCHEN CARLSON: 200 women.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.680
GABE SHERMAN: I was blown
away when I saw that LA Times

00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:37.320
headline where
the director James

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:41.980
Toback had been accused
originally in an article

00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:42.950
by 30 women.

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:45.050
And then several days
later, the newspaper

00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:48.080
had heard from
more than 100 more,

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.230
and I think the
total was over 200.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.710
Two things I felt as a
reporter, that it was shocking

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:56.890
that this was out there
and he wasn't in jail.

00:26:56.890 --> 00:27:00.130
I mean, the guy seems like a
straight up sexual predator.

00:27:00.130 --> 00:27:02.590
And then secondly,
that now women

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:05.260
have the courage to just
come forward and call it out.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:08.980
I think men will not
be able to sort of do

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:14.484
that pervasive behavior without
the fear of exposure now.

00:27:14.484 --> 00:27:16.900
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Well, and
ones who have already done it,

00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.260
they're in the fetal
position right now.

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:22.690
They're just waiting
for the women

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:26.210
to be emboldened at their
place of employment.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.350
So I do see this as
a cascading effect.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:33.370
What my hope is is that
media will continue

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.830
to cover this and cover the
stories of the women that

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:41.660
are not famous because that's
the majority of the women.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.160
A young woman in
Boise, Idaho, you know?

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.200
GABE SHERMAN: Talk a
little bit about some

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.510
of the women you've
heard from who, again,

00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.750
are everyday Americans
working either in the service

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.176
industry, in the
restaurant industry,

00:27:56.176 --> 00:27:57.800
and what their
experience has been like

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.284
and how they've tried
to seek justice.

00:28:00.284 --> 00:28:02.450
GRETCHEN CARLSON: So
basically, all of their stories

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.130
were nobody would
ever listen to me.

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:06.560
I never had a voice.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.280
I was maligned.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:08.780
I mean, it's the
same sort of story.

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.610
And I would just
wait for it as I

00:28:10.610 --> 00:28:12.590
would respond to
all of these women,

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.586
and then eventually get on the
phone with them for the book.

00:28:15.586 --> 00:28:17.210
Without failure, all
of them would say,

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:20.150
my industry is an old boys club.

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:21.740
It didn't matter what it was.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.290
Even female-oriented
business areas

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:29.190
like retail or the
cosmetic industry.

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:35.560
And I think the one thing that
they felt so fearful of was,

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.997
can I really come forward,
because I need my paycheck.

00:28:38.997 --> 00:28:41.330
And one of the questions that
really gnawed at me, Gabe,

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.310
and gave me a lot
of sleepless nights

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:49.047
was how do I help the single
mom who can't afford to do this,

00:28:49.047 --> 00:28:50.630
doesn't have the
resources that I had,

00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:53.270
doesn't have the national
platform that I had.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:58.640
And so through my fund that
I've set up, Gift of Courage,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.700
I've now started the Gretchen
Carlson Leadership Initiative,

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:05.450
which will kick off next month,
November, in Dallas Fort Worth.

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:07.940
It's a nine-city
tour, three days

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.020
of workshops in each city
for underserved women

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.900
where they can come
for free and learn

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.730
about sexual harassment,
domestic violence,

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.610
get legal advice,
and learn how to have

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.890
a voice civically
and politically

00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:25.880
in life, because what tends
to happen when you are going

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.432
through something like this
in your life, you feel alone

00:29:28.432 --> 00:29:30.140
and you feel like you
don't have a voice,

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.160
not just on that issue.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.020
You feel like you don't
have a voice on anything.

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:37.490
And I want to be able to provide
these women the opportunity

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:39.260
to become involved
in their communities

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.830
and get out of the shadows
of becoming a victim.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:46.130
So I'm incredibly proud to
be financing that leadership

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.100
initiative as the
start to helping

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.500
more women to have a voice.

00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.170
GABE SHERMAN: And you know,
obviously we can't have

00:29:54.170 --> 00:29:56.810
this conversation in a vacuum.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:30:01.880
And I think we have to look
at the national political

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:04.220
landscape that
we're all living in.

00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.160
And we have a president
in the United States

00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:11.930
who himself has been accused
by multiple women of very

00:30:11.930 --> 00:30:14.630
similar types of
unwanted advances

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:17.480
and himself was caught on tape,
the famous "Access Hollywood"

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.310
tape, boasting about
what he does with women.

00:30:22.310 --> 00:30:26.180
Are you surprised or--

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.750
I guess what I'm
trying to get at is,

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.110
do you think you know
the election in November

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:33.080
was sort of the last gasp
of that old culture where

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.310
that behavior was tolerated?

00:30:35.310 --> 00:30:37.220
Or do you think
somehow politics is

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.260
different than
corporate America,

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.260
where people are willing to look
the other way because they care

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:43.910
about x, y, or z
issue, and they just

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:45.680
want to vote for their party?

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:48.560
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Well, I
think that until recently it

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.020
was similar in
the sense that you

00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:53.150
had a lot of people
covering up, and also

00:30:53.150 --> 00:30:56.600
that people put
political policies ahead

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.850
of human decency.

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:01.931
For me, listening to that tape,
sorry, it was really personal.

00:31:01.931 --> 00:31:03.680
GABE SHERMAN: Well,
you know Donald Trump.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.400
GRETCHEN CARLSON: I
know Donald Trump.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.860
I've known him for 27 years.

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:11.330
And a week after my story
broke, he came out against me

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:15.590
and said that from
everything he had read,

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.920
that he didn't believe me.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.590
So it was personal for me when
I heard the "Access Hollywood"

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.060
tape.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.970
And I feature, actually, Natasha
Stoynoff, the "People" magazine

00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:28.790
writer who accused him
of unwanted advances,

00:31:28.790 --> 00:31:30.500
in my book "Be Fierce".

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:32.630
I felt it was important
to give her a voice.

00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.180
You know, that "Access
Hollywood" tape,

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.680
if you're a parent, I hope you
used it as a teachable moment

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.140
for your kids.

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.870
I know I did for mine.

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:49.620
And again, forget
political policy.

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:52.950
It's my opinion that the way
in which we treat human beings

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:54.630
supersedes that.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.520
And that's all I cared
about with that tape.

00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.500
I wanted my kids to know, this
is not how you treat people.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.990
Now here's the difference.

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:08.810
When powerful people in
private companies are exposed,

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:09.590
they can be fired.

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.830
But we can't fire politicians
who've been elected.

00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:18.740
That's just up
for the next vote.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.290
So I guess, in a way, you can.

00:32:21.290 --> 00:32:26.630
But it's not something that
would happen as swiftly.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:28.760
So I guess we'll just
have to wait and see

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:32.124
how this all flushes out and
what reaction that will have

00:32:32.124 --> 00:32:33.290
amongst the American people.

00:32:33.290 --> 00:32:35.330
Everyone still has a vote.

00:32:35.330 --> 00:32:38.960
GABE SHERMAN: So I would love
to open it up to the audience.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:43.300
If anyone has questions,
you can please step to,

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:47.420
I think there's two microphones,
and just say your name,

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:49.940
and you're free to ask
questions if you have them.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.792
GRETCHEN CARLSON: There's
our first brave soul.

00:32:54.792 --> 00:32:57.250
AUDIENCE: Gretchen, thank you
so much for being here today.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.270
Your words are
incredibly inspiring.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:02.630
And I'm so appreciative
you've taken a stand

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:04.672
to represent women who
really do need this voice.

00:33:04.672 --> 00:33:05.838
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Thank you.

00:33:05.838 --> 00:33:08.210
AUDIENCE: One question I
had for you in Chapter Four

00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:10.820
was the idea of
training in civility.

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.550
Can you give us some examples
of companies that have done this

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:17.270
and have been successful
with that effort?

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:20.030
GRETCHEN CARLSON: So there is an
international cosmetic company

00:33:20.030 --> 00:33:24.440
which has really gone way
beyond in being progressive

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:27.186
about this bystander training.

00:33:27.186 --> 00:33:29.060
And that's really what
I mean about civility.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.330
It's about let's teach
employees what to do

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.850
instead of what not to do.

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.964
That is the essence of it.

00:33:36.964 --> 00:33:39.380
And the interesting thing that
I learned from this company

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:43.762
was that they're 70% female
employed around the world.

00:33:43.762 --> 00:33:46.220
And even though they have these
incredibly progressive ways

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.480
to report it--

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.580
and once a week this
committee gets together

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.290
and listens to all
the complaints,

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:52.850
and they handle
them immediately.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.200
But here's what they told me.

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.020
They don't really have a lot of
sexual harassment complaints.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:59.720
And I was like, wow,
how simple is that?

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.800
I said, why?

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.640
They said, well, 70% of
our company is women.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.090
So that led me to really
start thinking about, wow,

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:10.610
wouldn't it be
fabulous if we just

00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:15.350
started employing more women, as
we should be, into these roles

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.840
and put them into
positions of power

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.179
so that this type of
activity doesn't happen.

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:22.550
You see, this is
how it prospers is

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.159
that we don't have enough
women in those positions

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:26.960
being able to say stop.

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:31.909
But it's why I'm calling on men
especially to help us with that

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:34.969
because as long as men dominate
running the Fortune 500

00:34:34.969 --> 00:34:38.270
companies right now--
what is it, 94%--

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:39.600
we need them.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.860
And we want them.

00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.030
And by the way, in "Be Fierce",
I have an entire chapter on men

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.400
because I found so
many great men already

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.960
out there doing fantastic work.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.820
It's my longest chapter.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:51.590
So most men want to help us.

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.429
Most men want a safe work
environment for women.

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:58.400
We just have to convince them
to take that little extra step

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:01.130
of courage and stop
being the bystander

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:06.020
and stop being the enabler,
and help us in being an ally.

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.310
Thank you.

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:08.570
AUDIENCE: My name is Kelsey.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:11.111
I just wanted to thank you so
much for being here and sharing

00:35:11.111 --> 00:35:15.770
your story, and telling us
how to be fierce, I guess.

00:35:15.770 --> 00:35:18.490
And you spoke a lot about
harassment in the workplace.

00:35:18.490 --> 00:35:20.990
Obviously that what your book
is about and that's your story

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:24.860
is, and speaking with the
women about the industries

00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:26.760
being a boys club.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:30.590
In my experience, I feel like
our society is a boys club.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:33.500
And I was wondering
if you have any advice

00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:37.280
or for women that are harassed
in public on the street.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:39.920
I know every day I face that.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:42.710
And it's really hard to
be catcalled and harrassed

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:45.890
just going home or coming to
work, or anywhere that I go.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:47.870
And I feel like I'm
losing my power.

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:51.020
And I know that your book is all
about taking your power back.

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:54.600
So I feel safe at work,
obviously-- thanks, Google--

00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.190
but what advice do you have for
women to take their power back

00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:59.720
in public or in the street?

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.720
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Right.

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.710
And that happens because they
feel like they can, right?

00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:07.340
To me it's the
insecurity of that person

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:10.814
calling out and trying to
take away your confidence.

00:36:10.814 --> 00:36:12.980
So it's one of the things
that I say in the playbook

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.817
that you can also do in the
workplace, is to take offense.

00:36:15.817 --> 00:36:17.150
Not that I'm not a funny person.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:20.540
Listen, I like to have more fun
than anyone that I really know.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:22.670
It's not that I
can't take a joke.

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:25.800
It's that you need to take back
your self-esteem and your pride

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.300
and just say, oh,
thank you so much.

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.925
I don't really
appreciate that, though.

00:36:28.925 --> 00:36:31.830
You can say it in a
non-threatening way.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:33.470
But the other
really central thing

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:35.930
that I think changes society
is the way in which we

00:36:35.930 --> 00:36:37.897
choose to raise our children.

00:36:37.897 --> 00:36:39.980
And at the end of the book,
I have a whole chapter

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.270
on parenting.

00:36:41.270 --> 00:36:43.130
And really what I
think is crucial

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:46.580
is how we raise our sons.

00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:50.750
I think it's imperative that
we teach gender equality

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:52.942
within the family
unit, whether that's

00:36:52.942 --> 00:36:55.400
a husband or wife together, or
partners, or single parents,

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.430
or whatever the case
is, they're watching us

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.740
and they're hearing us.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.312
And if you're showing
respect for gender at home,

00:37:03.312 --> 00:37:05.270
that's what they're going
to carry through when

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:06.840
they get to the workplace.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.147
So I think it's really central.

00:37:08.147 --> 00:37:09.980
I think we should be
doing sexual harassment

00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:13.694
training and classes
for middle school kids,

00:37:13.694 --> 00:37:15.110
and moving on up
into high school.

00:37:15.110 --> 00:37:17.660
I'm doing a college campus
tour with my book "Be Fierce"

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:21.140
because especially on college
campuses, one in five women

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.420
are going to faced
sexual assault.

00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.379
And what does the
Greek system do?

00:37:26.379 --> 00:37:28.670
What kind of messages-- not
to narc on them completely,

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:33.080
but what does that teach our
young men about how to be?

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.530
And then they go right from
there to the workforce.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:40.970
So I really think that
getting to our young people

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:45.620
is essential and crucial to
moving the needle forward

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.560
for ultimate respect for women
once we get into the workplace

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.891
and on the streets.

00:37:49.891 --> 00:37:50.640
Thank you, Kelsey.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:51.806
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:37:51.806 --> 00:37:53.099
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Thanks.

00:37:53.099 --> 00:37:53.640
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.370
Thank you so much for coming
today and for so bravely

00:37:56.370 --> 00:37:59.790
sharing your story, because this
is a system that perpetuates

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:02.310
in secrecy and shame.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:04.980
And I don't know how much
you can answer this question,

00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:07.350
and I don't mean it to
sounds politically pointed.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:10.860
But having spent time
in a media environment,

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:16.200
which arguably has actively
perpetuated objectification

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:19.830
of women and a very
rape-supportive culture with

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:23.610
the active endorsement and
promotion of our now president,

00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:28.000
who's advocated sexual
violence against women--

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.690
how do you reflect on your
time and participation

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.450
in that system and your
experience of then being

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:36.487
so publicly rejected from it?

00:38:36.487 --> 00:38:38.070
GRETCHEN CARLSON:
Well, what I can say

00:38:38.070 --> 00:38:42.180
is that, to a certain
extent, all people

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:44.730
can fall into cultish behavior.

00:38:44.730 --> 00:38:48.570
I've always been a
supporter of women, always.

00:38:48.570 --> 00:38:49.320
Call my mom up.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.620
She used to get so bugged by me
calling her early in my career

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:55.760
and throughout and saying, women
aren't paid fairly, et cetera.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.260
And she'd be like,
why do you always

00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.926
have to talk about
women's rights stuff?

00:38:58.926 --> 00:39:00.960
And I'm like, 'cause
I'm living it.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:03.300
And then when she started
running a company later

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.720
in her life, in her 60s,
and still today at 76,

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.120
she calls me every
day and says, now

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:12.120
I know you're talking about.

00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.810
That's the extent of what I
can say about my last 11 years.

00:39:15.810 --> 00:39:18.540
But please know
that I have always

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.156
been an advocate for women.

00:39:20.156 --> 00:39:22.530
GABE SHERMAN: Well, and you
mentioned just on that point,

00:39:22.530 --> 00:39:24.405
on Twitter, I think,
recently I saw you said,

00:39:24.405 --> 00:39:27.300
you don't know what
my parameters were.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:29.370
So I guess that was
alluding to how,

00:39:29.370 --> 00:39:31.800
even within the system
at Fox, you were trying

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.304
to carve out your own space.

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.470
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Thank you.

00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:35.730
You can say that.

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.009
Thank you.

00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:38.550
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.925
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:39:39.925 --> 00:39:42.557
Your words are very inspiring,
and we're in a moment

00:39:42.557 --> 00:39:44.640
right now where more women
are feeling the courage

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.570
to come forward.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:48.785
I was struck by your
comment around finally

00:39:48.785 --> 00:39:50.910
the day when you're recognized
for your brains, not

00:39:50.910 --> 00:39:51.874
your beauty.

00:39:51.874 --> 00:39:53.790
And I am sure many women
in the room, and men,

00:39:53.790 --> 00:39:56.040
can relate to that,
of being complimented

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.650
on your looks instead
of your talents.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.800
I had a colleague toast a
big project, and in front

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.950
of 40 people, comment
on how good I looked

00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:07.090
as well as being
talented on the project.

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:08.970
And at that moment,
I realized, wow,

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.030
no one would ever say
that to a male colleague.

00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:12.960
You wouldn't say he's
so great at his job,

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.780
and he looks so great.

00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:16.240
You would never hear that.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.730
So how do you think we
can more proactively model

00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:24.090
emphasizing talents over
looks in the worth of women

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:24.799
in the workplace?

00:40:24.799 --> 00:40:26.839
GRETCHEN CARLSON: I mean,
again, it starts young.

00:40:26.839 --> 00:40:29.277
Your story reminds me of
Senator Kirsten Gillibrand

00:40:29.277 --> 00:40:30.360
from this state, actually.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.909
I interviewed her for the book.

00:40:31.909 --> 00:40:33.450
And she was telling
a story about how

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:36.800
when she was at her law firm
before she ran for office,

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.230
that similarly, she
had won this huge case.

00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:44.444
And at the toast, they talked
about her great new haircut.

00:40:44.444 --> 00:40:45.610
She was like, wait a minute.

00:40:45.610 --> 00:40:48.570
I just had this huge win.

00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:51.720
And it was so demoralizing,
and your self-worth just

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.780
drains in quick fashion.

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.700
I don't know, there's
something in our society

00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.910
that doesn't allow
us yet to honor

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:03.000
a woman who happens to
be attractive, smart,

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:03.750
and talented.

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:05.791
There must be something
wrong with her, you know?

00:41:05.791 --> 00:41:09.662
So we focus, then,
on the looks first.

00:41:09.662 --> 00:41:11.370
Now I'm going to be
the first to tell you

00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:14.400
that I think media
plays into that.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.130
I don't really
watch TV that much.

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:19.002
I just really have
been a news junkie.

00:41:19.002 --> 00:41:20.460
And over the last
couple of months,

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.920
when I turn on
prime time TV, I'm

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.830
horrified that my kids might
be watching this stuff,

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:27.580
and the sexualization of women.

00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.540
So I think that's
where it comes from.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:33.810
And as parents, I don't know
how we completely control that.

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:36.490
You can control it in your house
as much as you possibly can,

00:41:36.490 --> 00:41:40.290
but they go to school and they
do live in the outside world.

00:41:40.290 --> 00:41:43.140
And are we really going to
be able to change the imagery

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.830
that we're putting out to our
kids, not to mention porn?

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:50.400
So to me, the way to
really try to combat that

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.400
is to raise our
sons differently.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.910
I come back to that point.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:56.640
GABE SHERMAN: And
I just want to jump

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.070
in on that, because I
notice in a lot of the news

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:02.760
accounts of the Weinstein
and these other scandals,

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.750
people would come
forward and say, oh,

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.300
for my daughter I'm
going to do this.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:09.420
And as a father
of a new daughter,

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:10.800
I know the intention is there.

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:14.190
But to me, I also find that
language diminishing of women,

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:17.870
because it shouldn't
just be for daughters.

00:42:17.870 --> 00:42:18.946
They're equal to men.

00:42:18.946 --> 00:42:20.070
It should be a human issue.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.950
And whether you have
a son or a daughter,

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:27.450
I want to raise my
children to be respectful.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:30.270
And I'm not speaking out, or
I don't report on this issue

00:42:30.270 --> 00:42:32.060
because I have a daughter.

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.060
GRETCHEN CARLSON: Right.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.724
I mean, I will give
cred to the men who

00:42:35.724 --> 00:42:37.890
stop me on the streets of
New York and shake my hand

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:40.180
and do say thank you
for my daughters.

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:42.824
I think it hits home
for fathers more

00:42:42.824 --> 00:42:45.490
when they hear these stories and
they do have daughters at home.

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:47.880
And if that ignites them
to be part of this "Be

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.710
Fierce" movement, fantastic.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:51.240
But you're exactly right.

00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:54.430
I have often said I
worked more for my son

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:56.830
than I did for my daughter.

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.260
And what I meant
by that was that I

00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:02.630
wanted him to see
what I did every day

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:04.690
and respect his eventual
female colleagues

00:43:04.690 --> 00:43:08.260
in the workplace in the same way
in which he looked at his mom.

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:12.760
So I do agree that the
parity is essential.

00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.790
And actually, more of the
focus should be on the sons

00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:18.130
than the daughters.

00:43:18.130 --> 00:43:20.530
AUDIENCE: So actually, as
a mother to a daughter,

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:25.730
my question was about just the
conversation with a daughter.

00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:27.147
She's eight years old.

00:43:27.147 --> 00:43:29.230
And I think one of the
most difficult times for me

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:31.644
as a parent was
election night, just

00:43:31.644 --> 00:43:33.310
knowing that in the
morning I would have

00:43:33.310 --> 00:43:37.270
to break this news of
this horrible bully

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.980
that she'd come to
kind of understand

00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:44.337
was now elected popularly,
or not popularly, whatever.

00:43:44.337 --> 00:43:45.670
GABE SHERMAN: Electoral college.

00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:46.060
AUDIENCE: As the
leader of this country.

00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:48.160
GRETCHEN CARLSON:
Electoral college, right?

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.084
GABE SHERMAN: Constitutionally
he was elected.

00:43:51.084 --> 00:43:53.000
AUDIENCE: So I had to
explain all this to her.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.010
I've never felt so
much fear and just

00:43:57.010 --> 00:44:01.090
devastation in trying to
explain a happening to her.

00:44:01.090 --> 00:44:02.735
And I was just
trying really hard

00:44:02.735 --> 00:44:04.860
not to break down in front
of her, and to tell her,

00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.360
this is going to be OK.

00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.770
But anyway, so just
listening to this,

00:44:08.770 --> 00:44:10.510
and having had my
own experiences,

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:14.140
and watching all of
this come forward,

00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:17.590
I wonder about how to
talk to her about what

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:22.150
may end up, unfortunately, being
her experiences in the future.

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:25.390
And I just wanted to get your
thoughts on what would you

00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:26.540
say to a daughter?

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.706
I don't actually know if
you have a daughter or not.

00:44:28.706 --> 00:44:32.410
But what can we do
to protect our girls

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:34.525
and help them to
protect themselves?

00:44:34.525 --> 00:44:36.650
GRETCHEN CARLSON: So I have
a 14-year-old daughter,

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:39.250
who actually I just took with
me on my LA part of my book tour

00:44:39.250 --> 00:44:41.880
because I thought it was really
important for her to see me

00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:43.690
out-- well, she also
thought LA was cool--

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:46.000
but to even take
her out of school

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.320
to show her what mom was doing.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.380
And I think it's imperative
that our kids see

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:56.650
us standing up and speaking
up and being courageous,

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.990
because I can tell you what,
it transferred to my kids

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:01.000
almost immediately.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.230
My greatest concern was how
will my kids fare through this?

00:45:05.230 --> 00:45:09.340
And I've seen the bravery
in my kids transplanted.

00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:10.790
It's contagious.

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:12.790
So my daughter finally
had the courage

00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:15.860
to speak up at school about
some kids who were bugging her,

00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.390
and came home and said, mom, I
did it because I saw you do it.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:22.030
That is how it starts.

00:45:22.030 --> 00:45:26.870
And as far as being however
you felt about the election,

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:30.880
I really want to turn it around
and say that it's a positive.

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.990
This is our chance to be able
to have a voice on these issues

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:38.110
and speak about
them more openly.

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:40.240
I have to look at
it optimistically,

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.130
and currently, where
we are right now,

00:45:42.130 --> 00:45:44.770
I do think it's optimistic
that we're talking

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:46.390
about these issues so much.

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:50.540
And third, I would just say
that eight years old may

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.070
be a little young, but I played
the "Access Hollywood" tape

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:59.320
for my kids on purpose
because I wanted them to hear

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:02.420
how you don't treat people.

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:04.600
And I think that's the way
in which we move forward

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.939
on this issue is to be
open and honest about it.

00:46:07.939 --> 00:46:08.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.220
Steph Hoffman.

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.880
Thank you for being here.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.910
So my question for you is I
feel a greater sense of urgency

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:17.890
than just the role
modeling for our children.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:19.600
I couldn't agree with you more.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.016
I have a four-year-old daughter
and an eight-year-old son,

00:46:22.016 --> 00:46:24.910
and I believe so strongly
in the best thing I can do

00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:27.852
is role model the behavior
I want to see in them.

00:46:27.852 --> 00:46:29.560
But to the point of
urgency, because it's

00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.101
going to be a long
time until they're

00:46:31.101 --> 00:46:35.280
in middle school and high
school and in the workforce,

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:36.951
you talked about parameters.

00:46:36.951 --> 00:46:38.700
And I'm sure you can't
share specifically.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:40.700
Maybe you can talk
about it hypothetically

00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:41.922
or in the abstract.

00:46:41.922 --> 00:46:43.130
What guidance would you have?

00:46:43.130 --> 00:46:45.020
I feel very privileged
working at Google.

00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:47.395
I'm not saying we're perfect,
but I feel very privileged.

00:46:47.395 --> 00:46:50.790
So I'm curious to hear
from you perspective

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.390
on parameters or grassroots
things that we could do.

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:58.650
I'm just horrified by what
you're describing in contracts

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:01.620
that people sign and
awareness that you

00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:03.570
hope to bring through
this movement, what

00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.020
I would call a movement.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.050
What can we do from a
grassroots standpoint

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:08.410
to help catalyze change?

00:47:08.410 --> 00:47:09.910
GRETCHEN CARLSON:
One of the things,

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.330
especially at progressive
companies like Google,

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:15.240
I think it it's really
important to put together

00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:18.300
group discussions of employees
and talk about whether or not

00:47:18.300 --> 00:47:20.310
you have arbitration
clauses, and whether or not

00:47:20.310 --> 00:47:22.430
you can work with
HR to possibly,

00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:25.950
let's talk about amending these,
or at least taking the secrecy

00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:30.090
out of arbitration, or at
least giving your employees

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.830
the choice of
whether or not they

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:34.170
want it to be secret or not.

00:47:34.170 --> 00:47:37.380
Start group discussions about
that in progressive companies

00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.480
that are willing to really
listen to their employees.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.740
I think that that is one
way to start, and to also

00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:46.710
look at your sexual
harassment training policies.

00:47:46.710 --> 00:47:49.194
I know that what
happened to me over time

00:47:49.194 --> 00:47:50.610
was that they
eventually just came

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:53.340
through compliance on your
computer, and you just had to--

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.090
instead of actually
going to the training,

00:47:55.090 --> 00:47:56.760
we just had to check off boxes.

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.600
And everyone pretty much just
did it as fast as they could.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:02.520
But really lobby
within your company

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:05.510
for changing the way in which
you are training people,

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:07.410
specifically, to what
we were talking before,

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:10.170
about bystander training.

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:12.390
Don't just teach us about
what sexual harassment is

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:15.780
and give us case studies and
say here's what bad people do.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.080
Teach us about how do we
empower people to come forward

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.740
and help.

00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.980
That's really the
essential training.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:26.687
So those two things
I would encourage

00:48:26.687 --> 00:48:28.770
you to have, just like you
might have a book club,

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:29.960
but to come together.

00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:31.460
I've already heard
from young people

00:48:31.460 --> 00:48:33.690
all across the country, since
I've been on tour, that they're

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:35.310
starting these
kinds of movements

00:48:35.310 --> 00:48:37.320
within their own companies.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.450
And also I would have,
thirdly, the discussion

00:48:39.450 --> 00:48:42.210
about the
confidentiality clauses.

00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:44.400
Yes, let's protect business
secrets, especially

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.705
at a place like Google.

00:48:45.705 --> 00:48:47.080
I know you're on
the cutting edge

00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:49.320
and nobody wants
to violate that.

00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:52.650
But do we really have to
be secret about everything?

00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:54.690
Let's give a voice
back to our employees

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.600
because that is so
incredibly empowering.

00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:00.090
And that only makes the
employee want to work here more

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.490
and stay here for a long time
if they know that they're

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.380
in a safe environment.

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.245
Thank you.

00:49:06.245 --> 00:49:08.620
GABE SHERMAN: I think this is
all the time we have today.

00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:11.730
Thank you so much for
participating in this very

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:12.840
important discussion.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.480
And let's all give round
of applause for Gretchen.

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:18.480
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.730
as
