00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.860
Hands down, Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the
most versatile actors in Hollywood today.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.280
And over the course of his career has had
the opportunity to play characters from all

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.280
over the map.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.630
Since becoming a household name in the mid
nineties, the actor’s work has only gotten

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.630
better.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.300
So it feels like now is the right time to
take a look at The Amazing Evolution of Leonardo

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.570
DiCaprio in Famous Hollywood Movies.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.449
After playing a series of minor parts on the
small screen, DiCaprio really got the audience’s

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.670
attention for the first time with his performance
in 1993’s Whats Eating Gilbert Grape.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.810
The actor took on the role of Arnie, and played
the younger brother to Johnny Depp’s titular

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:39.810
character.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.570
Viewers were blown away by DiCaprio’s convincing
portrayal, and at the age of 19, was nominated

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.570
for an Oscar because of it.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:45.570
In the big scheme of things, the movie isn’t
the highest grossing of his career, but it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.570
might be the most important.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.780
After the entertainment bigwigs started to
take notice of the talented young actor, Leo

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.610
did what 99% of actors do: Shakespeare.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.870
And what great actor doesn’t have a little
Shakespeare in their background?

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.780
In 1996, he was cast as the lead in Baz Luhrmann’s
modern take on Romeo + Juliet.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.780
Working opposite Claire Danes, the film is
a total audiovisual trip.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.140
The main obstacle people run into when reading
William Shakespeare’s works is the language

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.000
structure.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.860
And while the original dialogue remains intact,
the contemporary setting bridged the gap.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.290
Making this one of the most accessible versions
of the story, even if the contrast seems jarring.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.720
As a result of it’s approachability, the
movie was a big hit with audiences.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.190
And suddenly people became a lot more interested
in what DiCaprio would do next.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.880
It’s a good thing viewers liked him, because
in the following year, his stardom would be

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.979
inescapable.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.690
To say that Titanic kicked ass at the box
office would be a gross understatement.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.229
The 1997 cinematic juggernaut smashed records
that hadn’t even been set yet, and to this

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.659
day remains the most successful film on DiCaprio’s
resume.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.780
And is second only to Avatar when talking
about the highest worldwide grosses of all

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:48.780
time.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.549
There isn’t a fan out there who doesn’t
have the lyrics to Celine Dion’s “My Heart

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.130
Will Go On” memorized.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.900
As Jack, Leo is a third-class passenger who
falls for a first-class lady named Rose.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.840
DiCaprio and co-star Kate Winslet are so perfect
together, that even the happy moments their

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.760
characters share are heartbreaking.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.740
Director James Cameron brought stunningly
realistic visuals to the screen like the public

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.619
had never experienced before.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.540
Playing Jack put Leonardo DiCaprio on a trajectory
that ultimately made him the star he is today.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.480
Like we’ve said before, if you want something
done right, just hire Tom Hanks.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.040
The man can do no wrong.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.810
And DiCaprio was along for the ride as Frank
Abagnale Jr. in 2002’s Catch Me If You Can.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.450
Based on the story of a real-life conman,
the movie follows Leo’s character as his

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.410
deceptions become increasingly sophisticated.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.370
With Hanks alongside as the man obsessed with
taking him down, their cat and mouse dynamic

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.170
is so engaging that you can’t help but root
for them both.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.670
But just days earlier, audiences were watching
the actor in a different movie.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.730
Once in a blue moon, a powerful actor attracts
a powerful director, and together they perform

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.060
motion picture witchcraft.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.520
In 2002, Martin Scorsese tagged DiCaprio to
play the protagonist in his movie Gangs of

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.520
New York.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.819
Released five days before Catch Me If You
Can, 2002 was shaping up to be a pretty good

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:54.819
year for Leo.

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.540
The famous director is known for having very
specific criteria during the casting process

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.921
for his films, so being hand-picked by him
is kind of a big deal.

00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:05.459
Since the Scorsese train stops for nobody,
the actor hopped aboard at his first opportunity.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.680
And as we’ll see, this collaboration marks
the beginning of a beautiful big-screen friendship.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.370
When Scorsese needed someone to play the eccentric
Howard Hughes in 2004, he knocked on Leo’s

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.370
door.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.020
Clocking in at nearly three hours, The Aviator
won five of the eleven Oscars it was nominated

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.020
for.

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.379
And DiCaprio even took home a Golden Globe
for Best Actor.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.600
The critics who were able to hold their bladders
long enough to make it to the end praised

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.250
the complexity of his performance.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.400
And those who used the movie’s runtime as
an excuse not to see it must be forgetting

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.220
that Titanic was almost a half hour longer,
and we didn’t hear any complaining back

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.220
then.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.970
It seems, the dynamic duo of Scorsese and
DiCaprio can’t lose.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.440
And quite frankly, their friendship is good
for everyone.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.310
Some fans argue that the actor does his best
work under Scorsese, and the two have created

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.610
some phenomenal movies together.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.680
But the one that finally bagged Scorsese an
Oscar was 2006’s The Departed.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.599
Stacked with talent from top to bottom, the
film saw DiCaprio holding his own beside major-league

00:03:53.599 --> 00:04:00.209
talents Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, and the
delightfully foul-mouthed Mark Wahlberg.

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.480
Anyone who still thought Leonardo DiCaprio
was doomed to a life of pretty boy romance

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.909
acting was proven so wrong by this movie.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.180
As an undercover cop, his assignment is to
gain access to an Irish gang.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.660
In case you haven’t seen it, we don’t
want to spoil the plot.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.519
But seriously, you should probably get on
that.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.629
2010 was another banner year for the actor.

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:18.100
He reunited with Scorsese for the thriller
Shutter Island.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.900
And again audiences were captivated.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.160
But DiCaprio also made a new friend that year.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.810
A man who happens to be responsible for some
of the most enthralling movies ever made;

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.810
Christopher Nolan.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.440
A writer, producer, and director, Nolan is
a Tinseltown triple threat.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.970
And while there’s a fiery debate between
fans about which movie is his best, Inception

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.970
has to be the coolest.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.970
It’s a complete ocular spectacle, and DiCaprio
carries the audience effortlessly through

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:40.340
the labyrinthine dream levels.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.630
He gives his character Cobb a depth, and is
probably the only actor who can completely

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.910
lose his shit and handle his shit, all at
the same time.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:50.710
Speaking of losing his shit, the actor got
the opportunity to do so as the depraved Calvin

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.990
Candie in 2012’s Django Unchained.

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.120
The Quentin Tarantino flick follows two men
as they try to recover one of Candie’s slaves.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.860
His performance is genuinely unsettling.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.340
And he got so into it that while filming an
intense scene, the actor smashed a real glass,

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.840
and sliced his hand wide open.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.440
But, ever the professional, DiCaprio doesn’t
miss a beat.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.970
It’s an intense moment, and it’s made
even crazier by the rabid, strung out look

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.070
on his face.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.180
In 2013, the actor reunited with Scorsese
and the world was introduced to a little movie

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.740
called The Wolf of Wall Street.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.280
The story of excess not only jumpstarted Margot
Robbie’s career, but certain governments

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.070
think the movie is so offensive, that it’s
even been banned in multiple countries.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.470
Nevertheless, it tells the story of Jordan
Belfort, a crooked stockbroker with unorthodox

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.470
taste.

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:33.330
Sex, drugs, parties, The Wolf of Wall Street
has it all.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.009
And when he lost out to Matthew McConaughey
in the best actor category at that year’s

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.480
Oscars, fans were pissed.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.460
Thankfully they didn’t have to stay that
way for long.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.380
Because in 2015, after appearing in nearly
thirty movies, the actor finally went home

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.930
with a trophy from the Academy for his work
on The Revenant.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:48.540
It was well earned, too.

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.580
The filming conditions were horrible, and
DiCaprio underwent a complete physical transformation.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.780
He’s hardly recognizable as Hugh Glass,
a man who gets attacked by a bear then left

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:57.780
for dead by his group.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.220
A lot of people think he won an Oscar for
the wrong movie, but we’ll leave that up

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.220
to you.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:03.220
So what do you think of our video?

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.970

DiCaprio moments?
