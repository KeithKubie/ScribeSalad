00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And in none of these cases is the probability of a fair coin given the data less than 0.5.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We know this simply because the probability of having a loaded coin at all is zero.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So if that doesn't make intuitive sense we can apply Bayes' Rule since P of loaded is zero

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:31.000
P of fair is one and so P of flips given fair is always going to be equal to

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
P of flips because that's the only way you can get the flips.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The alternative is zero and so this whole expression will always be one.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You could also do this with the reverse in P of loaded and you'd see

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
it would always come out to be zero because this term will be zero.
