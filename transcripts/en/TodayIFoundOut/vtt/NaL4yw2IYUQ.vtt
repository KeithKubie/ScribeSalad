00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.420
With rents for even the smallest quarters
exceeding the equivalent of $1000 monthly,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.210
a relatively large number of working class
people in Asia’s largest cities have become,

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.270
essentially, homeless.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.880
Rather than being completely destitute, as
many homeless are, a not inconsiderable number

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.289
of these individuals earn enough to otherwise
support themselves outside of being able to

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.710
afford housing.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.120
To solve the problem of lack of funds for
more traditional accommodations, many have

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.199
turned to 24-hour establishments for a place
to spend the night and catch a few Zs, including,

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.630
in particular, McDonald’s and Manga cafes.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.690
The McDonald’s crowd is particularly prevalent
in China and Hong Kong, where they are sometimes

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.210
called McRefugees or McSleepers; photographs
of people slumped over in booths or on table

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.360
tops, surrounded by the remains of their purchases,
abound.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.190
Some overnight businesses seem to encourage
the practice – particularly as McSleepers

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.560
tend to be consistent customers who otherwise
cause no trouble.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.550
As a McDonald’s Hong Kong representative
officially noted: “We welcome all walks

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.670
of life to visit our restaurants any time.”

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.540
Hong Kong is a particular difficult place
to find affordable housing, as between 2008

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.580
and 2015 prices have grown by 130%.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.170
Today, according to Expatistan, rent for a
480 square foot studio costs between HK$22,867

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.930
and HK$15,150 (roughly $1900 and $3000) a
month.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.520
In 2015, Hong Kong was estimated to have around
1,000 McRefugees, though it’s noted that

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.740
official government numbers here are likely
massively underestimating the extent of the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.740
problem.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.460
On that note, the working homeless situation
came to the forefront that year with reports

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.530
that a middle-aged woman lay dead in a McDonald’s
for seven hours before anyone bothered to

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.470
check on her; employees thought she was sleeping.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.229
Tokyo has a similar issue with monthly rent
for a similarly small studio ranging from

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.890
¥96,000 to ¥185,000 (about $850-$1640).

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:06.780
However, the reports from Japan are ever so
slightly less disheartening, as it appears

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.940
that its working homeless have cobbled together
a somewhat more comfortable combination of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.490
all night businesses in which to sleep.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.160
In fact, as far back as 2007, it was reported
that approximately 5,400 Tokyo residents spent

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.520
at least half of their weeks staying in internet
cafes; more recently, Manga Cafes (so named

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.490
due to the addition of extensive manga libraries
on the premises) have become very popular.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.650
More comfortable than McDonald’s, at least,
customers at manga cafes enjoy a private booth

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.720
with a computer, unlimited internet, access
to a DVD and manga library and a reclining,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.070
office-style chair.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.270
Soft drinks are usually provided for free,
while food (generally of the greasy variety)

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.690
is available to purchase at modest prices.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.730
For reference here, the fee for a cubicle
in one of these establishments generally ranges

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.000
from around ¥1400 to ¥2400 ($12-$21) for
up to 12 hours.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.110
capsule hotelAs you can imagine, however,
sleeping in such accommodations isn’t exactly

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.010
the most comfortable thing in the world and
chronic back pain tends to be the name of

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.800
the game for many of these individuals.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.640
For those who can splurge on occasion, however,
to round out their weeks, some of these cyber-homeless

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.450
rely on other reasonably priced all night
services for a slightly more restful night’s

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.650
sleep, such as capsule hotels.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.160
Not for the claustrophobic, for the equivalent
of about ¥3000 to ¥6000 (roughly $25-$50)

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.709
a night, at a capsule hotel the lodger receives
an encapsulate bunk bed along with access

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.560
to communal locker rooms and bathing facilities.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.590
Another option Tokyo’s working homeless
sometimes turn to are public baths, which

00:03:35.590 --> 00:04:01.810
can cost anywhere from a few hundred to a
few thousand yen a night (roughly a 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.940
few dollars to $40).
