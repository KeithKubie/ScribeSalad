00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:05.088
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; It actually wouldn't be an equation at all. If we substitute 0 into the spots

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:09.786
for A and B, in the equation we would get 0x and 0y equals C and if the left

00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:14.646
hand side is just equal to 0 and that would require C to be 0 as well, but the

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:20.094
questions specifies that c is specifically not 0. This can not work. This is not

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:20.992
an equation.
