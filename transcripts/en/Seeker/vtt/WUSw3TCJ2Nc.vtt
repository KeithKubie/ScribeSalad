00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.440
You can catch a disease if it's contagious,
but surprisingly, you can catch a behavior

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.440
too.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:16.520
Suicides, homicides and mass shootings are
ALSO contagiousâ€¦

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.520
ðŸ˜¬

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.790
We're all familiar with the idea that the
flu is contagious.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.910
I sneeze on you, you get the virus, and you
get sick.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.540
But behaviors can also be contagious, and
for a number of reasons.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.750
Yawning is agreat example.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.810
Simply SAYING yawn can trigger yawning -- did
you yawn yet?

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.550
*YAWN* That's a contagious behavior, if an
innocuous one.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.500
Scientists THINK it has to do with the empathy,
the understanding and sharing the feelings

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.460
of another, but after a major study in 2014
they're still scratching their heads.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.200
Speaking of scratching, me talking about itches
might make you itchâ€¦ do you have one?

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.790
Itching behavior is ALSO contagious, and so
is laughter; especially when things are awkward!

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.510
Laugh tracks are Hollywood's way of triggering
that empathetic humor response!

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.610
In one study, researchers from the University
of Hawaii showed videos of people describing

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:12.150
a positive or negative memory and when showing
that video they found people FELT more akin

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.920
to the nonverbal emotion the person was feeling,
not the things they were saying.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.210
Basically, if you feel emotion when talking
to a person, it's possible the person is feeling

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.210
the same emotion!

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.080
Our brain's contain mirror neurons which are
specifically for mimicking the behavior of

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.490
our social peers.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.340
When people watch sports and see a player
throw the ball, their brain sends signals

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.280
to their arm that mimic that movement; it's
both psychological AND physiological.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.730
Unfortunately, this can go well beyond sports
or movies.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.090
Research on "suicide contagion" is as old
as recorded history.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.400
As much as five percent of all suicides may
be a result of contagious behavior.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.790
When suicides happen in school, or when celebrities
commit suicide, suicide clusters begin usually

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.610
in teens and young adults.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.950
Gladwell wrote extensively about contagious
behavior in his book, The Tipping Point.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.920
We're social animals, so when we see behavior
happening, we emulate it; physiologically,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.880
emotionally and, apparently, violently.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.060
Since 1991, the rates of murder, robbery,
rape, assault are all downâ€¦

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.120
In fact, these crimes are lower today than
at any time in the last 50 years.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.810
The number of mass shootings, however, has
sharply increased since 2000 according to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.810
the FBI.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.470
There are now an average of around 16 mass
shootings a year in the U.S.; or perhaps as

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.090
many as one every 12.5 days depending how
you count them.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.400
Using this data, a paper in PlosONE found
on average, one school shooting inspires point-22

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.370
more school shootings; and a mass shooting
inspires point-3 more mass shootings peaking

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.980
every 13 days.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.569
Mathematically, if you have 4 mass shootings
in a short period, chances are one of those

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.730
was inspired by one of the others.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.050
When shootings include more than three people,
it was more sensational, had increased media

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.540
coverage, and could then be considered a contagious
behavior.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.980
Combating the negativity of contagious behavior
may be as simple as holding each other accountable

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.849
for our actions before we get there- Being
open, clear and honest about the negative

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:07.910
effects.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.230
For example, after Kurt Cobain's suicide in
1991 the media focused on the effect on his

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:19.400
surviving family, and the sadness of his friends
and fans -- LOWERING the suicide rate.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.209
This was shocking, but made sense.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.700
A positive behavioral contagion beat the negative
one.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:32.050
Health researchers have long studied peers
positive motivation being contagious in exercise

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.430
and healthy habits.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.599
Perhaps these darker behaviors are susceptible
as well.

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.879
There hasn't been a ton of research on gun
violence in the U.S., in part because Congress

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.790
banned federal funding for gun violence research
in 1997; that ban remains in place today,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.220
however, if more research can uncover HOW
violent behavior like suicide and mass killing

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.069
is contagious; the implications are huge!

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.159
As usual, more research is definitely needed.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:03.690
One of my other shows, TestTube News has talked
a lot about gun violence and mass shootings

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:14.269
in 
the past, so make sure you check that video

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.199
out here.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.569
But on a happier note, NASA is about to fly-by
Pluto and we're doing a live Google Hangout

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:25.729
with our space producer Ian O'Neill and a
special guest INSIDE MISSION CONTROL.

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.129
It's going to be awesome.

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:33.270
Come join on July 14 at 1pm Pacific 4pm Eastern
and RSVP on the event page for a reminder!

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:41.319
There's a link in the description too!
