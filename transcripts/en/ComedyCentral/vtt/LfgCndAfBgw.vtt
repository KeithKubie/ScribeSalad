00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:03.402
- Daddy, what's a shiv?

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:05.538
- Where'd you hear that word?

00:00:05.538 --> 00:00:06.706
- From that man over there.

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:09.342 align:start size:84% position:16%
He said he was
gonna give you one.

00:00:09.342 --> 00:00:10.275
- Well honey,

00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:12.344
shiv is like a homemade knife.

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:14.413
You can make it out of a comb

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:17.683
or a toothbrush or
a piece of wood.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:20.453
- So he made it for you?

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:21.254
- Mm hmm.

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:22.522
(kissing noise)

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.524
We've known each
other a long time.

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.458
- [Little girl] I'm
gonna make a shiv

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.927
for my teacher at school.

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:29.862
- That's nice.

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:32.365
Okay, let's go kiddo.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:33.700
- [Little girl] Bye Frank.
