00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.710
- Hello, and welcome to Khan Academy's

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.450
International Women's Day fireside chat.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.440
I am Rachel Cooke, the
senior communications manager

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.770
here at Khan Academy,

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.850
and you are in for a treat today

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.570
because we have some
amazing conversation on deck

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.200
with some two badass tech
chicks from Khan Academy.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.110
Super excited to introduce them

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.250
and talk with them today.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.760
I wanted to say hello to our
international team members

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.143
in Brazil, Mexico, India, Peru.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.760
Thinking of them, I
think that's it, right?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.320
So hello to all of you
who are watching later on.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.970
Those of you who should
be sleeping, go to sleep.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.840
I wanna let everyone
know that you can submit

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.860
your questions on Facebook

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.190
if you have questions for
this amazing panel here.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.730
So we're gonna get right started.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.320
To my left, I have May-Li Khoe,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.050
who is our VP of design
here at Khan Academy.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.290
She hails from great companies,

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.043
like Apple, and LeapFrog, and IBM.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.083
We also have Marta, oops.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.220
Marta, I always forget
how to say your last name.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.500
Marta Kosarchyn.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.333
- Perfect.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:03.610
- Who's our VP of engineering.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.360
She hails from HP and Intuit.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.760
And in case you don't know,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.280
Khan Academy is huge,
huge fans of Harry Potter.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.230
So May-Li is representing
House Slytherin today,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.251
and Marta is representing
House Gryffindor.

00:02:18.251 --> 00:02:19.330
(audience laughs)

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.240
By the end of this chat,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.240
you can guess which house I belong into.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.000
So I'm a really big fan of
sort of classic movies, right?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.040
And one of my favorite
lines comes from Casablanca,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.330
which is like, in all the gin joints,

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.320
in all the towns, and all of the world,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.050
you happen to walk into mine.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.773
So ladies, tell me what
brought you to Khan Academy?

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.543
- Should I start?

00:02:44.543 --> 00:02:46.270
- [Rachel] Yeah, yeah.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.970
- What brought me to Khan Academy?

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.590
Well, a long journey of many different,

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.590
many different roles and
things through my life.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.580
Khan Academy is, you know,

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:59.680
we've chatted about this,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.600
just kinda I always say it
feels like full circle to me

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.450
because I started off studying math

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.630
and teaching math, finding
out sort of along the journey

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.430
that I enjoyed teaching,
which I didn't think I would

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.070
when I was being told that math education

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.180
was the only thing I
could do with mathematics

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.590
as a girl, back in the day.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.040
And I was just a math major,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.930
so I had to kinda make it anyway

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.853
to find out I did enjoy teaching.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.030
Eventually found out I loved programming.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.940
So the story kind of is

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.850
I then worked in tech for over 20 years,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.050
and now full circle, I'm
back with Khan Academy,

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:41.560
where I fell in love with
Khan Academy math videos

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.660
because I could point to them

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.840
and tell my friends, so there's this guy

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.570
who can explain all this
way better than I can,

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.003
so don't ask me.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.673
- [Rachel] That's very funny.

00:03:50.673 --> 00:03:51.820
I remember when I told my mom

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.880
I was coming to Khan Academy,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.040
I'm like, so there's this guy,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.710
and she's just like, what?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.543
You're moving to California for who?

00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:57.376
And I'm like, no, no, no.

00:03:57.376 --> 00:03:59.204
It's Sal Khan, it's
legit, it's totally fine.

00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:01.720
(everyone laughing)

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.330
All right, all right.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:04.750
May-Li, go ahead, yeah.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.810
- Yeah, also a long and winding road.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.940
I studied computer science
and electrical engineering

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.930
as an undergrad and I
had wanted to study art

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.890
as a high school student,
but my parents disapproved,

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:17.840
and I thought at the time

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.930
that I needed to do what they said,

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.600
so I didn't study art.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.830
I figured I would study engineering

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.530
and then go study art and do that later.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:25.450
But straight out of school,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.580
I insisted on trying to get a design job

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.400
straight out of school
with an engineering degree.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.810
So I went to the only company

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.426
that let me design
stuff and then build it.

00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:37.540
So I could have those sorts of trade-offs

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.440
with myself, which is hard.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.150
But so we did that,

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.130
and then had a long journey
through other things.

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.300
I think LeapFrog was another moment

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.800
where I was kind of combining the design,

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.400
the engineering, and education.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.150
Went on to Microsoft, Apple,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.620
and while I was working at Apple

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:56.490
on new methods of human input,

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.170
I kept on prototyping things
that had to do with learning,

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.260
so I was like, let's play with this

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.017
fancy new input device for learning.

00:05:03.017 --> 00:05:03.850
(Rachel laughs)

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.980
And that happened so many times

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.260
that after a while I thought,

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.780
well, maybe I should
just focus on that part.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.280
- Right, that's amazing.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.440
Yeah, I think, so both of you sort of have

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.910
these moments when you
were learning in school,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.660
and you're just like you
had some kind of spark,

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.510
something kind of started in you.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.040
And I think Women's History
Month is so important

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.360
because we get to kind of look back

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.410
at the pioneers and
people who have shaped us

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:26.310
to kind of where we are today.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.590
And so for both of you,

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.274
is there a teacher or a pioneer

00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:31.360
that particularly has inspired you

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.883
to kind of go down this path?

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.400
- You start this one.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.233
- Sure, I can.

00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:39.010
I'll start this one by, I do wanna think,

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.380
somehow I subconsciously
found a lot of female mentors

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:44.690
in the department I was in.

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.960
I don't think I realized I
was doing it at the time.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.730
I only realized it in retrospect, like,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:51.770
wait, how did I wind up with only

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.690
female-identified advisors
in this major where,

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:59.852
I mean, oftentimes that is
one in 60 kind of ratios.

00:05:59.852 --> 00:06:01.140
- [Rachel] Yeah.

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.100
- So Patty Maes who was at the Media Lab,

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.220
who is at the Media Lab, Karen Sollins,

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.850
and Julie Dorsey were all
advisors of mine during that time.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.590
And I think I didn't realize I needed it.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:11.423
I think at that time I was like,

00:06:11.423 --> 00:06:13.170
no, I just got to power through everything

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:15.010
on my own, I don't need any whatevers,

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.333
but actually I did and was
clearly reaching out to them.

00:06:19.382 --> 00:06:21.300
And then I think I've always been,

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.670
I really got into both
programming and design

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.430
because I was lucky to get
a Mac when I was a kid.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.050
And Susan Kare's work, obviously,

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.883
has always really inspired me.

00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:32.470
I think as far as design work,

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.220
there was recently a Charles
and Ray Eames exhibit

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.023
at the Oakland Museum.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.230
Shout out to Oakland Museum.
- Eames chair.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.240
- Yeah, and Ray Eames' work is
also really inspiring to me.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.180
Also very at the intersection
of science and design--

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.540
- And Ray's the woman?

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.442
- And Ray is a woman, yes.

00:06:49.442 --> 00:06:51.630
(all laughing)

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.463
- Important facts.

00:06:52.463 --> 00:06:54.130
- Important facts, yeah, we
recently heard somebody say,

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.290
yeah, Charles and his brother.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.563
And we're like, no.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:01.780
- [Rachel] And Marta, any pioneers,

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.770
teachers that have inspired you?

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.060
- Yeah, well, all of the women pioneers

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.713
certainly have inspired me.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:12.360
Again, sort of I harken
back to studying math first

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.096
and just devouring histories
of women mathematicians

00:07:17.096 --> 00:07:18.463
because it was so rare.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.500
So that was always super inspirational

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.633
because they existed, which was something.

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:32.550
And yeah, Grace Hopper,
certainly is inspirational.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:35.560
I think the things she accomplished

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:38.600
and also just a lot of her famous quotes,

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:41.447
like, "You don't manage
people, you manage things.

00:07:41.447 --> 00:07:42.660
"You lead people."

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.910
A lot of things that have
become philosophy for me

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.350
as I've grown in leadership roles.

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:51.880
So yeah, there's a lot of inspiration

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.350
in the women who have gone before us.

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:55.183
- That's amazing.

00:07:55.183 --> 00:07:57.140
We're gonna come back to
your leadership style later,

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:58.463
I promise, good questions.

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.860
So I think for anyone
who's probably watching

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.630
on Facebook or internet land,

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:06.540
or watching here in the room,

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.220
they might look at you and be like,

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.450
these two people have it all, right?

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:12.780
They're super smart,
they're super talented,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.163
they're in a dream job,
they're super gorgeous.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.720
Could you tell me of maybe a time

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.117
where something like didn't go your way,

00:08:21.117 --> 00:08:23.020
and like how did you handle that?

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.060
Or maybe like a struggle,

00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.440
that those of us who are still
struggling can relate to?

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.323
Things like that.

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:31.560
- Yeah, for sure.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.993
I think we probably both
have a lot of those stories.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.470
I guess one that's appropriate
to share today would be

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.230
I remember the very first time

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:47.063
that I was promoted
into a management role,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.420
a leadership role, a
managing leading people role

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.820
as opposed to just an
individual contributor,

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:59.820
and at least three men came up to me

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:03.020
and said, yeah, you got that
job because you're a woman.

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:04.780
- [Rachel] Oh, no.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.410
- Which, as we know, if you're
an underrepresented group

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:10.350
in anything, how frustrating that is

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:12.650
because the truth is
just the opposite, right?

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.540
So yeah, hearing those kinds of things

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.010
and then saying these are my colleagues

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:19.960
and these are folks
that I have to mobilize

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.990
and motivate and keep working with

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.023
and stay positive, that's a challenge.

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:26.440
- And so what did you do?

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.610
Were you just like, I'm
just gonna show them

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.180
how talented, and how amazing,
just gonna do the work,

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:32.703
or did you, what did you do?

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.090
- Yeah, you know, fortunately I was able

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.090
to just say like, yeah, that's not true.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.560
I got this job because I was
the best person for this job.

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.843
And yeah, just kept moving forward.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.583
- [Rachel] Right, hater's gonna hate.

00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:51.416
- Yeah.

00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.220
- [Rachel] And May-Li, what about you?

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.840
Tell us like a challenge, a struggle,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.403
that you faced and kind
of how you overcame it.

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.203
- Yeah, I was thinking
about that, it was funny.

00:10:04.424 --> 00:10:06.350
I think the way that we had talked

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.870
a little bit about the
question, being like,

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.427
well, when did you not get your way?

00:10:09.427 --> 00:10:12.400
And I was talking with my
partner about this last night,

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.035
and he said, "Are there times
when you don't get your way?"

00:10:16.035 --> 00:10:19.533
(audience laughs)

00:10:19.533 --> 00:10:20.473
I was like, yeah.

00:10:20.473 --> 00:10:22.470
I think the two things
that came to mind for me

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.563
were actually being turned down for jobs.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.170
That definitely hurt.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.920
It's happened a bunch of times,

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.833
especially earlier on in my career.

00:10:35.938 --> 00:10:36.771
I think there's kind of,

00:10:36.771 --> 00:10:39.020
there's a couple things that I do.

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:42.740
One of them was I know
myself well enough by now

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.320
to know that I always
look back with gratitude.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.500
So no matter what happens,

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.300
I know that I will have
a positive hindsight

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:52.820
and feel like something
happened for a reason.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.070
Whether or not that's actually true,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.120
I mean, I don't know,

00:10:57.844 --> 00:10:59.180
but it feels like it happened for a reason

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.013
'cause at the end of the day,

00:11:00.013 --> 00:11:00.880
I usually wind up being grateful

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.420
for the experiences that I do have.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.680
I think another thing has been

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:08.540
just laser focusing on where

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.143
I might need to learn something.

00:11:12.072 --> 00:11:15.080
And just saying like, okay,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.170
well, were there actually
reasons behind this?

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.330
Is there something that
I could have done better?

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.270
And making sure as heck

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:25.213
that I've gone and filled those things.

00:11:26.336 --> 00:11:28.980
And so in the instances
that I have in mind

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.830
of being turned down after an interview

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.080
with a team or something,

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.160
I know that like several years later,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.250
the people that had doubted me

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.770
were coming after me and saying like,

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:40.853
oh, I really need you for this project.

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:44.060
So that was like, okay, well,

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.560
I feel like I've filled
whatever that gap was,

00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.760
or maybe there wasn't a gap,

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.880
in which case, it's on them,

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.980
and they should just regret not hiring me.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.270
- I kind of feel like both of you

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:55.370
might be like a little bit sort of humbled

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:57.970
about your career and
the challenges you faced.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.640
I don't think anyone sort of imagined

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.040
being a woman in tech might be

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.640
the easiest thing to do, right?

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:05.480
There's certainly a lot of,

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.870
sort of pot holes to
navigate, we'll say that.

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:14.870
So in your career, how have
you navigated those things?

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.010
Like how do you sort of keep on the path

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.010
that you wanna go on?

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.520
Like if you were like,
this is my end goal,

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.560
this is where I wanna get to,

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.930
and I know that a career is
never just always upwards,

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.607
but maybe you had to take some
left turns or some detours.

00:12:28.607 --> 00:12:31.833
Can you talk about that, your
overall career experience?

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.790
- I feel like it's all
detours all the time.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:39.550
- For sure, it's a meander.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:43.973
My career has been a meander
more than a straight path,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.250
and discovery, and learning,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.550
and learning something new about myself,

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:51.993
learning something new
about what I enjoy doing.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.320
You know, we at Khan Academy

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:56.390
really believe in a learning mindset,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:58.100
and I think that's what
May-Li was talking about.

00:12:58.100 --> 00:13:00.190
That's true in whatever
we're trying to learn,

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:02.700
whether it's a subject we're
studying on Khan Academy,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.990
whether it's learning how
to be a better leader,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:07.510
some aspect of leadership.

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.830
And one thing that I think is interesting,

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:13.420
May-Li just wanted to, to
just kinda double-down on,

00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:14.900
what a great learner she is.

00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:16.720
She's always asking for like,

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.860
well, how do you do that?

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:19.820
And can you teach me how to do that?

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.070
And one of the things
that I think we both do

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.470
is we learn from each other

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.250
and from all of our colleagues a lot here,

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.493
which is what makes this such
an amazing environment for me.

00:13:29.493 --> 00:13:30.326
- [Rachel] For sure.

00:13:30.326 --> 00:13:33.061
- Because we just, kind of at that,

00:13:33.061 --> 00:13:35.610
you know, we're meta-learning all the time

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.990
in every way, yeah.
- For sure, yeah.

00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:41.200
All right, yeah, I think
the wonderful thing

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.370
about Khan Academy, I think,

00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.790
is like you have this
really amazing perception

00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:48.030
of the organization from the outside.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.947
And then you kind of come in,

00:13:48.947 --> 00:13:51.190
you're like, wow, this is really legit.

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:53.540
Like people are always trying to learn

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.070
and do better and improve upon themselves

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.330
and it's always really amazing to me,

00:13:58.330 --> 00:14:01.340
sort of the caliber of human beings

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.910
that we have collected here.

00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:05.620
And so May-Li, any other war stories

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:06.800
or anything that you'd like to share

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.950
from your career experience?

00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:08.783
- War stories.

00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:12.430
Yeah, I think that some
of what stands out to me

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.430
is just being in the environment
with such disproportion.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.990
I had a long time in my career

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.823
where I was the only woman

00:14:20.823 --> 00:14:23.560
and the only non-white person in the room,

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.100
and whenever we had the larger meetings,

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.840
it was, again, goes back to almost like

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.250
during degree time when
it was 60 men and me,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:35.050
and just this feeling of
constantly having to prove

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.903
that I deserved to be there.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:41.660
I think some of the coping
mechanisms, just to share,

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:43.830
one of them was I think when I was younger

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.690
I tried to blend in and I tried
to tone down my femininity,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.490
and I tried to tone down
anything that made me stand out,

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:50.880
and at some point in time I realized,

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.640
and this is also as a designer,

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.593
that I should just enjoy
that and play it up.

00:14:57.593 --> 00:14:58.426
- [Rachel] Right.

00:14:58.426 --> 00:15:00.240
- And so I would go to executive meetings

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.030
wearing all of the hardware,

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:05.010
biggest earrings I could
find, tons of rings,

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:09.460
and it was a lot of demos
that seeing my hands

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:10.640
and it was just like, no,

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.680
you're going to get used to this.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.850
This is the future,

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.260
and we're gonna just style
it up and enjoy ourselves

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.380
because I'm not trying to shrink myself.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.060
So that was one.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.680
And then also, just to
be super honest about it,

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.800
I think there are times when

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.350
just some of the day-to-day difficulties

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.370
would be too much and I would go and cry.

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.590
I had a place where I went to cry,

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:35.040
and I think that's, you know,

00:15:36.013 --> 00:15:37.150
we can talk about it a
little bit more later,

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:39.520
but for me, I think it's
very natural to cry,

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:43.000
and I think it's a natural,
physical, healthy response.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.533
And so now if I have to cry,

00:15:44.533 --> 00:15:47.570
I just tell people, look,
water's gonna come on my face,

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:49.300
we're gonna just keep
having this conversation.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.133
Everything is fine.

00:15:50.133 --> 00:15:51.860
This is like a natural physical response.

00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:54.170
Let's keep talking. (laughs)

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.120
- [Rachel] For the record, we're not just

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:57.130
like all sobbing here at Khan Academy

00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.797
during meetings.
- No, no, no.

00:15:58.797 --> 00:16:00.140
- Okay.
- No, this is part

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.723
of my answer to the original question.

00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:06.073
Although it's fine to cry if you need to.

00:16:06.073 --> 00:16:07.893
- I mean, yeah sure, you can cry.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:11.650
Yeah, I think it's so important

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:15.070
for women especially to sort of understand

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:18.010
amazing benefits of foraging your own path

00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:19.780
and being a pioneer in your own field,

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.570
wherever that might be, but also there's

00:16:21.570 --> 00:16:23.910
like real challenges and struggles

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.920
that you have to overcome.

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.120
And many of us aren't
given like a guide book

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.953
of how to navigate it.

00:16:28.953 --> 00:16:31.460
It's kind of all a case by case basis,

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.753
and it sounds like both of you

00:16:32.753 --> 00:16:36.520
have kind of overcome a lot
of very different things.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.370
And I think, hopefully,
have come out better

00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:41.600
on the other side, so
that's very great as well.

00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.490
And so I guess from that perspective,

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:46.440
what advice would you give to someone

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.560
who's coming up in the field now

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.470
who is interested in a career in tech,

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.010
or interested in being an engineer,

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:54.430
or interested in being
an amazing designer?

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:57.203
Like what advice would
you give them today?

00:16:58.714 --> 00:17:00.606
- Yeah, that's a great question,

00:17:00.606 --> 00:17:02.473
and often asked question, of course.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:05.470
And I always answer
sort of the two things,

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:08.350
two pieces of advice that I share.

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:10.580
One is, it's a cliche, but it's true,

00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.470
you have to be passionate
about what you're doing.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.140
If you really love what you're doing,

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.010
if you're passionate
about what you're doing,

00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:17.563
it shows in your work.

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:20.786
It leads to success.

00:17:20.786 --> 00:17:22.477
And just believing in that

00:17:22.477 --> 00:17:24.350
and the fact if I'm passionate about it,

00:17:24.350 --> 00:17:26.220
I will get good at this,

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:27.490
even if I'm not good yet,

00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.700
and just sort of keep going,

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.573
to May-Li's point of
learning all the time.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.138
So I think that's important.

00:17:35.138 --> 00:17:36.880
And the second point I make

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.280
is actually related kind
of to the first point.

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.360
I think, for me, I learned
you have to be yourself,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.860
and you alluded to this a little bit

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.250
just now, kind of with
style, and it's true.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.440
You have a style and you
can't become someone else.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.380
And I think respecting your style.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.880
I can't tell you how many mentors

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.853
or folks have told me to add
a little gravitas to my style.

00:17:59.906 --> 00:18:00.739
- [Rachel] Meaning?

00:18:00.739 --> 00:18:02.003
- You know, just more,

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.370
May-Li's gonna do an enactment for us,

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.284
I believe, at the end of this.

00:18:08.284 --> 00:18:09.767
- Stay tuned, stay tuned.
- We'll punt.

00:18:09.767 --> 00:18:10.660
- We'll punt on that for now.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.240
She's gonna give us a
physical representation.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:14.430
- I was told in my last job,

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:17.900
like you need to be meaner, like, yeah.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.530
- What?
- That was advice given to me.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:21.234
Like you need, yeah.

00:18:21.234 --> 00:18:22.090
- Yeah, maybe not meaner,

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.425
but just maybe more serious and--

00:18:25.425 --> 00:18:27.260
- I was told point blank, right.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.150
- Yeah, just kinda.
- We're not gonna.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.250
- Yeah, so you have to be yourself

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.780
because otherwise if you're
not your authentic self,

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:34.790
I mean, you're not happy.

00:18:34.790 --> 00:18:36.400
And the bottom line is
if you're not happy,

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.923
like you're not doing anybody any good.

00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:41.878
- [Rachel] Exactly, exactly, yeah.

00:18:41.878 --> 00:18:43.430
- So.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.710
- Yeah, I think there's this thing

00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:49.020
that I've been telling a lot of people

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.340
that when I get this question lately,

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.150
and it's about confidence because

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:54.803
I think a lot of people tell me,

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.523
I can't do this because I
don't have the confidence.

00:18:57.523 --> 00:18:59.670
There's a lot of people really struggling

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:01.110
with confidence and really struggling

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.960
with what's called imposter syndrome.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.180
So I have like mixed responses

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.200
and the imposter syndrome thing for me

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:13.800
really centers you as the
person having the issue.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.940
Like you are the one
with imposter syndrome,

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.770
but it may be that you're
walking through this world

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:20.680
constantly being given
cues from the outside world

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.450
that you're not good enough somehow,

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.920
and yet, somehow we
like center that on you,

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.120
so that's like the reservation
I have about the term.

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.750
- [Rachel] Oh, sure.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:32.000
- Because I think that
it's not just about you,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.750
it's also about what surrounds you.

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:36.460
So there's a dance there.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:38.910
The confidence thing, the
advice I give people is

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.030
if you are a person who loves learning

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:43.180
and loves doing new things,

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.880
you're always gonna be pushing yourself

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.510
to be at that learning edge,

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.830
which means that it's pretty likely

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:48.920
you're gonna be doing something new

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.320
that you've not done before.

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.330
So it's natural to not necessarily have

00:19:53.330 --> 00:19:54.470
all the confidence in the world

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:57.420
because that might actually
be false confidence

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.320
because you are doing
something for the first time,

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:00.580
and that's great.

00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:03.190
And so I tell people don't
worry about the confidence

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:05.230
as a prerequisite, it's
not a prerequisite.

00:20:05.230 --> 00:20:06.730
You just need to be able to focus

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:08.170
on problem solving so hard

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.223
that you're not distracted
by your lack of confidence.

00:20:11.223 --> 00:20:12.056
- [Rachel] Right, exactly.

00:20:12.056 --> 00:20:12.889
- It can just stay there.

00:20:12.889 --> 00:20:13.840
You know, take it to tea,

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:15.780
have a little conversation with it.

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.120
But just be like you sit right there,

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.780
we're gonna get to work
solving this problem,

00:20:19.780 --> 00:20:21.160
and you're not gonna stop me, that's it.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.360
- That's really good advice.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.710
That's awesome.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:25.280
Kind of follow-up question to that is,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.210
when do you both feel powerful,

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:30.854
or how is it that you do feel powerful

00:20:30.854 --> 00:20:31.687
and kind of in those moments

00:20:31.687 --> 00:20:32.680
that you might be insecure,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.290
or you may not be sure how to do things?

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:36.793
How do you guys feel powerful?

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.010
- Well, I believe that we take our power

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.770
in just being ourselves, right?

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.370
And recognizing thoughts of doubt

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.390
as just thoughts.

00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:53.660
So I believe in

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.170
many Buddhist concepts in that area

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:00.240
and just sort of being present

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.190
in the moment of what's actually happening

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:04.180
and realizing that a lot of the framing,

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.380
which is where the doubts
or the confidence comes in,

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.680
they're just all thoughts.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.030
They're just neural transmissions.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:11.460
They're just thoughts and they can be

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.480
different thoughts at any moment,

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.940
and there's only what's really there

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.383
and what's happening in the moment.

00:21:18.383 --> 00:21:19.560
And I think it's kind of the same thing

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.150
May-Li was saying, but it's true, right?

00:21:21.150 --> 00:21:24.090
I'm here, I'm focused, I'm
doing something, I'm learning,

00:21:24.090 --> 00:21:26.870
and yeah, the rest of it is a framing.

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:28.810
And I could change that
framing at any moment.

00:21:28.810 --> 00:21:31.970
I can say, I'm really great
at this, I'm killing it,

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.947
or I can doubt myself and say,

00:21:33.947 --> 00:21:35.640
oh, I'm really screwing this up.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.390
- [Rachel] Right, the first one's better.

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.310
May-Li?

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:40.330
- I feel like it's a bit of a pattern.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.710
There's a book I really
like called Art &amp; Fear,

00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:45.043
and what it talks about
is that as an artist

00:21:45.043 --> 00:21:48.310
or anybody that's pushing
yourself on your edge,

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:50.470
your bar or your standard for yourself

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:52.290
has continued to rise
because you learn more,

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:53.700
and so you never meet your own standard

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.160
because your standard moves
up as your skill moves up.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.050
And so all I've done is basically like,

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.880
I have these, I talk
myself out of anything

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.740
that might be paralyzing.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.050
I'll be like, okay, well,
have you done something

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:05.820
you don't know how to do before, yes.

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.310
Did it come out okay,
yes, it came out okay.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:08.540
Just like take a deep breath,

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.090
count to three, do it anyway. (laughs)

00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:13.300
- That's also pretty solid advice, yeah.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.133
I love that.

00:22:14.133 --> 00:22:16.920
So we have some really great philosophies,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:19.010
some Buddhist teachings.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.440
My power move is listening
to our Cardi B tracks.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.890
So you know, different
strokes for different folks.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:24.740
Whatever works for you.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.240
I love it.
- Musical as hell.

00:22:28.414 --> 00:22:30.770
- And I guess kind of
looking back at your career

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:32.870
and sort of where you've come from,

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.030
do you think things have changed?

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:39.100
And if so, how might they have changed?

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.760
Or if not, how have they not changed?

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.000
- Yeah, I feel like
things have changed a lot.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.580
A lot of the conversations
that are happening now openly

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:53.240
were happening behind
closed doors for years.

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.690
And I remember, it's
definitely only in this decade

00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:58.060
that it feels like they've come out.

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.010
Before that, it was see
if there's anybody around

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:02.310
you can talk to, first of all,

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:03.550
which was often not the case.

00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:06.400
And if there was, hopping into an office,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.760
closing the door, and being like,

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.690
did you see that, is it just me?

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:12.150
And now it doesn't feel like that anymore.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:14.100
Now it feels like it's
part of the conversation

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.703
in the greater world, not
just behind closed doors.

00:23:17.629 --> 00:23:20.329
- Yeah, I mean, I agree, for
sure things have changed.

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:23.650
I guess I have a little bit
more sobering perspective.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.530
I don't think they've changed as much

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.240
as we'd like for them to have changed,

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:28.950
or we'd like to think they have.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:32.390
And I think there are pockets of places

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.800
where it's wonderful,
like we're here together,

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.350
and we think, we hope we're helping

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.030
to create an environment
that's a good one,

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:44.020
and a strong one for that kind
of discourse all the time.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.380
I don't know if things have moved, I mean,

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.400
there's definitely more conversation,

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:52.413
but I think the powers
that be dig in as well.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:55.400
So we have a lot more to do.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.673
- [Rachel] Right, that's true.

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.310
Perhaps maybe when you
started your career,

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.720
how would you think that it
would have changed perhaps?

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.840
You know, what were
you thinking, like, oh,

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.720
in 10 years, this won't be a problem

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.553
because blah, blah, blah.

00:24:07.553 --> 00:24:09.020
What kind of was that that you kind of

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:10.830
are maybe a little bit surprised still

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:13.180
that you have to kind of
hit your head against?

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:17.223
- Do you wanna take--

00:24:17.223 --> 00:24:19.950
- Yeah, I feel like I would have,

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:21.586
you know, when I look
at just the statistics

00:24:21.586 --> 00:24:24.830
of where we've wound
up with representation

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:26.930
across the industry and in academia,

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.700
I feel like I would have expected

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.150
those needles to have
moved further by now.

00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:33.450
But, I mean, I think
we've seen the statistics

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:36.450
of women in computer
science was like at 35%

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:37.283
or something in the '80s,

00:24:37.283 --> 00:24:38.750
and it slipped to 12% sometime

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.260
in the last couple of years.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:41.970
So that's just one example.

00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:44.520
There's many other examples
of where representation

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:48.540
in Silicon Valley and in our disciplines

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:52.203
is just not representative
of our population.

00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:55.810
- [Rachel] Very true, good point, yeah.

00:24:55.810 --> 00:24:59.070
- Yeah, similarly I think

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:01.000
I would have thought 20 years ago

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.850
that we would have larger representation,

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:08.019
more equal representation
in all kinds of ways,

00:25:08.019 --> 00:25:11.960
in an engineering
organization, for example.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.320
So I think the pace has been slower

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.270
than maybe we thought, say, 20 years ago

00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:19.343
when we saw things changing a little bit.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.150
So yeah, I come back to there's still

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.000
a lot of work to do,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.380
so none of us should be
complacent about that.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.213
- [Rachel] That's true.

00:25:26.213 --> 00:25:27.046
- You got to always celebrate.

00:25:27.046 --> 00:25:27.879
- Still more work to do,

00:25:27.879 --> 00:25:29.820
but I think we're all kind of hopeful

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.590
of where things are going, I think.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.770
So definitely, the industry's having

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.210
a lot of good conversations,

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.530
and I think more people trying
to hold them accountable

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:37.880
to sort of be more representative

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.660
of the society in which it serves.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.630
So I think that's great.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:44.120
And Marta, you spoke about earlier

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.230
about when you became a manager

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.391
and sort of how hard that was

00:25:48.391 --> 00:25:51.150
for people who are maybe
a little bit reluctant.

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.890
And I can imagine for both of you

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:55.830
that you didn't really have many

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.310
female managers or leaders

00:25:58.310 --> 00:26:00.930
as you were coming up in this industry.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.930
How is it that you developed
your own leadership style

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:05.830
or management style when perhaps

00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:08.563
you didn't have those kind
of role models to go to?

00:26:10.170 --> 00:26:13.410
- Yeah, that's a great question
and definitely emphasis

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:14.890
on the word how did you develop it

00:26:14.890 --> 00:26:16.690
because it's still a work in progress.

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.157
- It's still a work in a progress.

00:26:18.157 --> 00:26:18.997
- Still a work in progress

00:26:18.997 --> 00:26:21.513
and we're developing all the time, I hope.

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:24.260
But you're right, I mean, it's not like

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.780
you could see a cookie
cutter cardboard cutout

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.000
and say, yeah, I wanna be like so-and-so

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.763
because so-and-so didn't
resemble me in any way.

00:26:35.090 --> 00:26:40.090
So yeah, becoming a leader is hard,

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.990
stepping into roles of leading
people is incredibly hard.

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.710
It looks so much easier than it is.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:47.900
I mean, that's one of those things

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:50.640
that I think everybody who's
become a first-time manager

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.850
or first-time leader thinks like,

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:55.300
oh, I'm gonna have that people part down

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:57.720
'cause I'm a people
person and I love people.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.570
You know, it's everything
else that'll be a struggle,

00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:02.550
and I think we all find out, oh boy,

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:04.550
no, is that not the case.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:08.090
Actually helping my folks grow,

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:12.040
and yet leading and leading from the front

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.680
and eventually you learn that's like

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.560
you're at the front
for all the hard stuff,

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:19.500
and you're at the back
for all the easy stuff,

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.550
and yeah, but it's a work
in progress, for sure.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:27.100
And seeking out other women from all kinds

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:30.457
of functions, for me, in the working world

00:27:30.457 --> 00:27:32.980
has been super helpful when there

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.273
weren't role models in
engineering, for example.

00:27:37.495 --> 00:27:39.120
I think that's a good strategy.

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:40.500
- Do you have like a managing tip

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.333
that you would give someone,

00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:42.330
or like something that you learn,

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:43.420
and you're like, oh, this is it.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:46.473
This is a key to unlocking
management style.

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.161
- Are you looking for one
of my mantras, Rachel?

00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:50.994
(everyone laughing)

00:27:50.994 --> 00:27:51.960
- [Rachel] I am always looking for

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:55.840
one of your Marta mantras, Marta mantras.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.887
We're just gonna do--

00:27:56.887 --> 00:27:58.190
- Marta's mantras--

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:00.483
- One of my mantras is no surprises.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:03.080
That's what I try to teach everyone

00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.340
is we can deal with anything,
we can fix anything,

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.350
we can adjust to anything
and we'll succeed,

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:11.900
just please tell me as soon
as you know about that.

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.870
- [Rachel] No surprises,
all right, excellent.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.443
- I think one of the things for me,

00:28:19.426 --> 00:28:20.620
and this is something I noticed

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.330
when I had a former director

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:25.390
who was surprised when she realized

00:28:28.461 --> 00:28:30.580
that she needed to adjust things

00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:33.770
so that people didn't have
to fight as hard as she did.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.850
And I think that's one of the things

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:38.260
that it takes an extra step to realize,

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:41.030
like just because I'm here doesn't mean

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.530
that everybody else should go through

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.340
what I had to go through to get here.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.470
So what is it that I need to change?

00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:49.010
And just like putting that
extra layer of thought

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.310
on top of things all the time

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.640
and double checking everything to say,

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.050
okay, am I expecting this
because this is status quo?

00:28:55.050 --> 00:28:57.693
Or is this something
that really should shift?

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.023
So that's just like an extra
layer on top of everything.

00:29:03.490 --> 00:29:06.313
Yeah, it takes like two
layers of thought, yeah.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.013
- [Rachel] Do you have a--

00:29:08.013 --> 00:29:10.290
- Constant self-check, yeah.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.060
- And in that self-check,

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.260
are you thinking more of like,

00:29:13.260 --> 00:29:16.990
I want to sort of make my decision making

00:29:16.990 --> 00:29:19.710
and leadership more inclusive?

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:22.300
Or are you thinking I'm,

00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.540
or are you intentionally trying
to shake up the status quo?

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:29.810
Are you kind of in your
own management role,

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.380
are you thinking, I'm
not gonna do it that way

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:34.280
because it shouldn't be done that way?

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.350
- Yeah, I think I'm really focused

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:41.480
on trying to build systems so that people

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:44.088
aren't systematically shut out.

00:29:44.088 --> 00:29:48.270
So a really simple
example, airtime, right?

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.860
Fighting for airtime in a meeting,

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:51.830
that's a thing that oftentimes happens.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:53.900
And so what we do on the design team

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:57.290
is we will switch to non-synchronous

00:29:57.290 --> 00:29:59.090
verbal communication 'cause we use,

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.500
we have a lot of remote
people at Khan Academy,

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.970
so we use a lot of docs,

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.420
design team's using Figma now,

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:05.530
and we use Google Docs,

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:06.920
so sometimes we'll say, you know what?

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:08.230
Let's do a quick brainstorm.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:09.740
Two minutes, set a timer,

00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.910
everybody's in the doc dropping ideas.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:14.010
And what's amazing is
you can see sometimes

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:18.320
like an idea that was typed or added

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:19.520
by somebody who would normally be

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.900
a quietest voice, is getting like

00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:24.210
a pile of emoji reactions from
everyone else in the team,

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.440
but they didn't have to fight

00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.253
to get that word in edgewise.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.690
Another thing that I
did, especially early on

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.130
when I was managing a smaller team

00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:35.660
was when there were
really tough trade-offs,

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:37.240
instead of people going in circles

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.160
on the conversation, I'd say,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.500
let's just make a pros/cons table,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:41.520
we're all gonna fill this
table in together quietly

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.550
and then we'll look at the
pros and cons together.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:45.330
So that it doesn't turn to this like,

00:30:45.330 --> 00:30:47.170
who's more skilled at debate,

00:30:47.170 --> 00:30:50.140
and we're just looking at the
reasons on the page together.

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.525
Yeah, stuff like that.

00:30:51.525 --> 00:30:53.510
But I would say it's pretty
constant and deliberate,

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:56.760
and so it just takes more brain vitamins.

00:30:56.760 --> 00:30:59.250
- Yeah, just to kind of, you know, yeah.

00:30:59.250 --> 00:31:01.880
So when May-Li is tired
at the end of the day,

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.950
it's because she's been
thinking doubly hard

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:05.460
about leadership.
- Yeah, everything takes

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.303
two layers of thought.
- That's right.

00:31:06.303 --> 00:31:07.810
- It's like, okay, here's the thing,

00:31:07.810 --> 00:31:09.200
now let me do the double check on it.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.270
- Yeah, that sounds great.

00:31:11.270 --> 00:31:12.103
I think kind of one of things

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:13.200
that you just said, May-Li,

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.283
was about making sure people's
voices are represented.

00:31:17.855 --> 00:31:19.790
And, I guess, because you two

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.770
are kind of in senior leadership roles,

00:31:21.770 --> 00:31:23.890
you often are in meetings or in rooms

00:31:23.890 --> 00:31:26.500
where many other employees may not be.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.850
How is it that you are kind of thinking

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.340
of those who aren't in the room

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:32.970
when you are in these big meetings?

00:31:32.970 --> 00:31:34.370
Like how do you make sure you're bringing

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:36.513
along voices who may not usually be heard?

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:39.440
- Yeah, I mean, that's a great question.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.520
Well, what all need to be aware of,

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:44.360
what I remind myself to
be aware of all the time

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.948
is we have constituents,
so to speak, right?

00:31:46.948 --> 00:31:50.160
So if I'm in a meeting, I'm
not representing myself,

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:52.540
like 99.9% of the time, right?

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.653
And so I'm representing others.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.280
Yeah, I think that that's an important

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:01.040
sort of general consciousness
to take into things,

00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:03.270
so that when we discuss things

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.220
about our company, for example,

00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.120
in our senior leadership team meeting,

00:32:08.587 --> 00:32:10.790
the lens for us always
is we're representing

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:14.910
our function here, so what
do my folks feel about this?

00:32:14.910 --> 00:32:17.423
What would work best for my folks?

00:32:18.547 --> 00:32:19.703
What have I heard?

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.500
It's a lot about listening.

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.590
It's a lot about listening,

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.200
which kinda gets back to
the voices not being heard.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.470
There's so much you can pick up

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:31.610
in just watching body
language and watching people,

00:32:31.610 --> 00:32:34.200
and you can tell when
somebody has something to say.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.420
I mean, a classic thing that we can do

00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:38.460
to help with that is to say,

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.840
oh, it looks like maybe
you have something to say.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.610
I mean, and you have to
find out ahead of time

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:44.400
who's comfortable with that and who isn't,

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.460
but there are plenty of people

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:46.490
who are comfortable with that,

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.600
they just need that extra little push

00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.540
to be asked to join the conversation.

00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:54.220
- Yeah, that last thing
is really important,

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.823
I think, because it starts so early.

00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:01.420
I've watched this in classrooms too,

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.210
who feels like they can speak up

00:33:04.210 --> 00:33:06.680
and who doesn't feel
like they can speak up.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:09.100
And so it isn't enough to just say like,

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:12.760
the door's open, like you
also have to invite people in.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.660
And being mindful of all of that,

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.070
being super mindful of my own reactions,

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:18.640
not necessarily expecting somebody

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:22.008
to have a perfectly
formulated thought, coming in.

00:33:22.008 --> 00:33:22.841
- [Rachel] Right.

00:33:22.841 --> 00:33:23.900
- I've definitely told people like, look,

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:27.060
I just need the data, it's like what

00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:27.893
we were talking about earlier,

00:33:27.893 --> 00:33:30.200
I just wanna learn so that I can

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.690
fix anything that needs fixing,

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:34.840
and I can't do that if
I don't have the data.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.170
And the way that I don't get data

00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:38.380
is if I make myself unapproachable,

00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:40.580
or if there aren't other,
or whether it's me,

00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:41.800
or if there aren't other routes

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.780
for that information to get to me.

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:45.893
So sometimes I tell people like, look,

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:49.810
it's okay if you don't have
this thoughtfully formulated,

00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:51.240
just tell me what you can,

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:53.520
and I'm gonna help you tease it apart.

00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:54.850
- [Rachel] Yeah, that
sounds really great too.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:56.447
- Yeah.

00:33:56.447 --> 00:33:57.463
- And then, I guess,

00:33:58.690 --> 00:33:59.980
I'm trying to figure out the best way

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.630
to formulate this question, when,

00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:05.450
I always feel like when women are in lead

00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:06.750
or there are women around,

00:34:07.623 --> 00:34:09.960
it is a bit of more inclusive,

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.960
it is a more thoughtful
work environment, right?

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:17.903
What is the opposite of that, right?

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.470
What are the things you notice

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:22.723
when there are not women in the room?

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:28.881
- Well, we don't talk
about our cute skirt.

00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:30.285
(Rachel laughs)

00:34:30.285 --> 00:34:31.800
Sometimes.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:32.633
- I was all like--

00:34:32.633 --> 00:34:33.850
- [Rachel] It's a very fashionable skirt.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:34.958
- I was all like what brand is she using?

00:34:34.958 --> 00:34:36.300
(everyone laughing)

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:37.393
- Or the lipstick.

00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.858
No, I'm kidding.

00:34:40.858 --> 00:34:41.720
Do you wanna go first?

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.553
Do you have a thought

00:34:42.553 --> 00:34:44.480
of what that looks like?
- Yeah.

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.590
Kind of, there are two stories.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:49.120
Like one of them I remember
after being the only woman

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.800
in a room for so long in
one of my work environments,

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.530
another woman joined and she
just messaged me quietly,

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:57.930
she said, do you have a safety pin?

00:34:57.930 --> 00:35:00.030
And I just remember feeling overjoyed

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:03.020
that we could talk about
a safety pin, right?

00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.610
All of a sudden there was
just this relief like,

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:06.390
oh, you use those too?

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:07.580
- [Rachel] Yeah, yeah.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.810
I love how with the men in the room

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:10.630
are like, safety pin?

00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:12.220
But you literally have no idea

00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.997
how like gold those things are.

00:35:13.997 --> 00:35:15.650
Those are money.
- They're amazing.

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.720
- [Rachel] To find a safety
pin when you need one

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:19.410
'cause like your blouse just won't button

00:35:19.410 --> 00:35:20.694
for some reason, and you're like--

00:35:20.694 --> 00:35:21.527
- Or you're--

00:35:21.527 --> 00:35:22.360
- Where the hell is that safety pin?

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.580
Yeah, exactly, anything, like yeah.

00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.630
- I think the other
thing I've noticed a lot

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.710
is that there's a lack of

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.930
physical gesturings of dominance,

00:35:35.930 --> 00:35:38.240
and that is something that,

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.963
especially if you're new
to like office workforce,

00:35:42.951 --> 00:35:43.907
I'll just give you some examples, so say--

00:35:43.907 --> 00:35:44.907
- [Rachel] M-L time.

00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:48.180
- Say, Marta and I were in a disagreement,

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.930
I might like tip my chin up higher

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:51.380
and kind of look down my nose at her.

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.530
That's like one way of
exerting physical dominance.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.780
Or I might get a pointy object

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.040
and do this type of thing.

00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:58.320
Now everybody in the meeting is like

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.280
paying more attention to me

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:01.370
because I'm waving this object.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:04.150
Or I might get up and just
kind of like make myself

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:06.550
as big as possible, put
my hands on my hips,

00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:08.100
rock back and forth, or like,

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.410
you know, like awkwardly
stand behind her like this

00:36:11.410 --> 00:36:12.740
while she's talking just to--

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.170
- And why are you
standing behind me, dude?

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:16.880
- Yeah, but this kind of stuff,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.140
like sometimes I will like leave

00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.980
the confines and like see people

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:23.160
doing that in some other place,

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.023
and I'm like, what are you doing?

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.150
Like getting up or sitting on the table

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.350
to make sure their head is higher.

00:36:29.350 --> 00:36:32.570
Like contrast our, I still remember

00:36:32.570 --> 00:36:34.880
like when our manager Jenny started,

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:35.830
we were in a meeting with her,

00:36:35.830 --> 00:36:37.650
and she sat on the floor,

00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:39.360
she was the only person
sitting on the floor,

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.740
she sat on the floor and made herself

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.830
as small as possible in
this meeting of managers,

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:46.198
and I was like, wow, what a contrast.

00:36:46.198 --> 00:36:47.031
- [Rachel] Right.

00:36:47.031 --> 00:36:49.460
- 'Cause I was used to
a lot of the punctuating

00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.820
every point I have to say with a,

00:36:51.820 --> 00:36:53.740
you know, like this kind of stuff.

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:56.150
And it was funny 'cause
it worked on people.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.360
So every once in a while,
I felt like I had to do it,

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:00.060
but I don't feel like that here.

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.700
- [Rachel] Right, yeah.

00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.550
- Yeah, for sure.

00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:04.798
- [Rachel] Yeah, we don't do that here,

00:37:04.798 --> 00:37:05.631
which is really great.

00:37:05.631 --> 00:37:06.721
- We definitely don't do that here.

00:37:06.721 --> 00:37:08.684
- [Rachel] Shout out to the
good men in Khan Academy,

00:37:08.684 --> 00:37:09.517
we don't do that here.

00:37:09.517 --> 00:37:11.180
- We don't do that here, it's true.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.333
Not by anyone, but yeah,

00:37:12.333 --> 00:37:14.240
I mean, on a more subtle fashion,

00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.563
there are things, I think,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.510
with women in the room there tends to be

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.910
more of the asking others
for their thoughts.

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:23.930
I think just, I do feel naturally

00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:27.845
there's often a little more
inclusion just in the room.

00:37:27.845 --> 00:37:29.860
- [Rachel] Right.

00:37:29.860 --> 00:37:32.887
- And so I think that that's
kind of a characteristic

00:37:32.887 --> 00:37:35.820
that is true in a room that's got

00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:39.800
a large kind of fraction of women in it.

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.850
- That's right, large fractions of women.

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:43.963
Let's see.

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:49.080
Actually, speaking sort of towards the men

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.290
of Khan Academy, and
they like all tense up,

00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:52.580
I just saw it, I just felt it.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.050
I just felt you all like, what?

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:54.910
What is she gonna say?
(audience laughs)

00:37:54.910 --> 00:37:55.910
No, all good things.

00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.090
Do you feel sort of, I feel like so much

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:00.930
of change is kind of driven

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:03.670
in workplaces by women, right,
and kind of led by women.

00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:06.150
Do you feel like it's on
women's shoulders alone

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.170
to kind of change work environments?

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:10.200
How is it that we work

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.790
with the men in our life

00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:14.360
to kind of make things more equitable?

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.740
- Yeah, that's a great question,

00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:17.990
and of course, it's all
of our responsibility

00:38:19.939 --> 00:38:22.760
to make an environment that
is inclusive of everyone.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.230
And there are so many
things that men can do

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:27.080
being in that position that they are.

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.610
I admire Andy Murray in the
tennis world, for example,

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:34.160
because he's done so
much for women in tennis.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.770
He broke away the first, kind of,

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:38.620
of the male to say like,
well, why are the women

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:40.600
making so much less
money than the men are?

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.170
They're working just as hard, right?

00:38:42.170 --> 00:38:45.120
They're playing out here
in the same tournaments.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:47.870
He hired a woman coach,

00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:51.660
first male kind of major winner.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:55.070
So those kinds of things
make a big difference.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:58.193
You know, sometimes I
think folks don't realize.

00:38:58.193 --> 00:39:00.400
Maybe the message that
I would send to all men

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.150
is do it if you can
because you believe in it,

00:39:04.150 --> 00:39:07.160
show it because it makes a difference.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.920
- I said that the other side is also true.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.920
There's a real benefit, both to everybody

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.120
across the gender spectrum

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.980
when we're operating in this
way that's more inclusive.

00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:21.660
I mean, I've seen a sigh of relief from,

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.430
men on my team join and realize

00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:26.180
that we're not doing this dominance game,

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.460
and just telling me like,

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.430
oh, this is just such
a breath of fresh air

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:32.870
because I've been in
all these environments

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:34.750
where you spend all this
time doing that stuff

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.540
instead of just talking about the content.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.230
And so everybody benefits.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:40.480
I think that's kind of the
curb cut principle of design,

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:45.480
it's like making it better for
groups that are less served,

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.440
makes it better ultimately for everybody.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.490
- [Rachel] Yeah, I think
that's very true, right?

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.090
I think everyone just kind of wants

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.510
to be seen and reflected in their work

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:57.340
and feel that they can
contribute in meaningful ways.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.300
And I think that the fewer barriers

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:01.810
that we can do to do that,
I think, everyone benefits.

00:40:01.810 --> 00:40:04.290
The work is better, the people are happy,

00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.440
you're able to retain your employees

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.940
because everyone just really feels

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.410
kind of all part of a bigger thing,

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.380
which I think is great.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:17.380
So now, I'm going to
open it up for questions.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.600
If anyone in the audience,

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.169
or let me just scroll down
to this thing right here.

00:40:24.169 --> 00:40:26.752
(all laughing)

00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:29.380
Let me double check.

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:38.620
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:42.260
We have a question here, which is,

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:45.680
I gave a priority to my family in my 20s,

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.450
marriage, kids, international relocations,

00:40:48.450 --> 00:40:50.910
and my career development
took a back seat.

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:54.230
I worked throughout, but
didn't really progress upward.

00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:57.540
It was more outward in
different fields and roles.

00:40:57.540 --> 00:41:01.260
I love what I do now and I'm
finally enjoying my work,

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.040
even though the path was wayward.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:05.620
However, I want to progress upward now.

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:06.930
Any advice?

00:41:06.930 --> 00:41:08.780
And this is a question from Facebook.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.040
- It's interesting 'cause we both

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.940
talked about how, in meandering.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:19.077
- Not focusing on upward so much,

00:41:19.077 --> 00:41:21.873
just sort of meandering
through the outward.

00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.303
- Yeah, I think to that question,

00:41:24.303 --> 00:41:27.960
I think people feel a lot of pressure

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:30.290
to sort of do A plus B equals C,

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.816
and that's how I feel successful,

00:41:32.816 --> 00:41:36.610
and that's how I build a good life.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:39.040
And I think part of it is

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.213
letting people know that it's okay

00:41:40.213 --> 00:41:43.270
that it doesn't look like A plus B plus C.

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:45.550
That it can look like all kinds of things.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:48.283
- 'Cause the way that I see it is,

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:51.250
the way I see it and I've always seen it

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:55.430
is that you have to decide for yourself

00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.210
what you revere, like what you look up to.

00:41:58.210 --> 00:42:02.950
And that doesn't have to be what

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:05.010
is dictated by a status quo either.

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:06.710
And some of the people
that you most admire

00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:08.570
might be somebody who aren't in

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:11.440
some sort of position of leadership.

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.260
They might be somebody
who's doing something else

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.190
that you find amazing,

00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:17.420
and that's totally cool and awesome.

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:20.700
So I just feel like if this person

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.900
is interested in getting into management,

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.040
then to treat that as a skill

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.810
because it's a different skill.

00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:31.160
And obviously, managing a
particular area is great,

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:34.030
it's better if you have
craft in that area,

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:35.710
but it is a different
thing to learn altogether.

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:37.373
It's a totally different skillset.

00:42:37.373 --> 00:42:38.206
- [Rachel] Right.

00:42:38.206 --> 00:42:39.039
- And so treating it that way

00:42:39.039 --> 00:42:40.970
and being interested in
that I think helps a lot,

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:44.330
recognizing that it's a totally
different thing to learn.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.450
- Yeah--

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.640
- And I don't think of it as up,

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:48.400
I think of it as just, it's another thing.

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:51.373
There's like many paths,
and that's one path.

00:42:51.373 --> 00:42:53.370
- Yeah, but to get back to it,

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:56.130
I don't want to sort of poo-poo the fact

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.190
that someone wants to grow upward--

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.640
- No, that's true.
- So just kind of,

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.030
because I know we both kind of think of it

00:43:02.030 --> 00:43:03.970
in a similar way that's
a little bit different,

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:06.230
but I think, sure, you have a goal,

00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:09.110
and you want to grow kind of upward

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:12.220
in more senior roles, titles, let's say,

00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:16.170
I think some ideas are
you find mentors, right?

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.630
Sign somebody up who's going to say,

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:20.210
I'll be working with you all the time,

00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:21.920
and if that's your goal,
I'm gonna help you.

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.730
And they will then take it apart for you,

00:43:23.730 --> 00:43:24.780
help you take it apart.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.640
Here are skills, right, that I've observed

00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.473
when you're telling me,

00:43:27.473 --> 00:43:28.980
these are the things we could work on.

00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.110
So there is a way to get there.

00:43:31.110 --> 00:43:32.870
I don't wanna make light of ambition

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:36.259
for anybody because that's yours

00:43:36.259 --> 00:43:39.470
and going forward.

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:42.180
So I would say getting help from others

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.700
is probably a great tool.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:45.350
- I think the other
thing that comes to mind

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:49.500
is also like putting
yourself in the shoes,

00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:53.900
the empathetic shoes of the
person who would hire you

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.670
or the person who would
ask you to do this work

00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:59.720
and get an idea of like what
problems are you solving,

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:02.310
like what is it that they're looking for.

00:44:02.310 --> 00:44:03.730
So if you have an idea that you're like,

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:06.590
okay, well, I'm at this organization,

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:07.870
there's this spot open,

00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:10.640
here's the big problems
that I see right now,

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.820
and I would imagine they need me

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:13.450
to jump in and do X, Y, and Z.

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.640
Just try and get that vantage point

00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.750
because then you can start building up

00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:19.380
the skill in a really empathic way

00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:22.440
that plugs into like your
mentors or whoever it is,

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.230
and you can say like, look,
I know that you're probably

00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:26.970
facing these challenges, is that correct?

00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:27.803
- [Rachel] Right, exactly.

00:44:27.803 --> 00:44:29.510
- Okay, cool, so here are the things

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.130
that I feel like are additive,

00:44:31.130 --> 00:44:33.780
instead of it being sort
of from you outward.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.640
It's kind of like a design problem.

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:36.693
- [Rachel] Yeah, exactly.

00:44:36.693 --> 00:44:38.283
- You're like, okay, what
does this person need?

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:21.760
Explicit about saying things like,

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.720
okay, look, if this is the total trade-off

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:24.860
and there isn't a right answer,

00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:25.910
I'm gonna just say that.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:27.967
I'm not gonna just pretend that there's

00:45:27.967 --> 00:45:29.730
always a direction that I see

00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:33.363
because I magically see all
directions of everything.

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:35.980
And then I would just speak to that meta

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:38.840
and say like, I know that's
a style, that's not my style.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:41.480
And so I think from all sides,

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:45.020
there's kind of an image of
what leadership looks like,

00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.670
whether you're the person who's accepting

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:47.950
somebody as your leader,

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:49.870
or if you're somebody
who's promoting somebody

00:45:49.870 --> 00:45:51.573
into a position of leadership.

00:45:53.625 --> 00:45:55.140
And I think it can be hard sometimes

00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.740
for people to look past that

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.010
and see different kinds of cues

00:45:58.010 --> 00:45:59.680
for different styles of leaders.

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.893
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.300
- Yeah, like I said, I would love to ask

00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:06.470
the person asking the question
kind of whether they meant

00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:08.560
external forces, like what do we think

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.480
is going on right in the world today

00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:13.600
if a barrier, those kinds of barriers,

00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.710
or whether we're talking about barriers

00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:17.940
that we're in control
of, let's say, ourselves.

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.840
So I mean, externally there are barriers

00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.530
because there are, like, if we say,

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:27.120
tech, for example, at tech
there are just still less women.

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.280
- [Rachel] Right.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:31.313
- So that's a barrier right there.

00:46:34.010 --> 00:46:37.240
I'd say that there is
still an overall perception

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:42.240
in the industry that leaders
naturally are not women.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:46.583
So we have that work to
do, as I mentioned earlier.

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:50.120
So yeah, I would say that there's still

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.320
some challenges out there.

00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:54.110
I don't know if I could pick one out

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.510
and say that's a barrier I recognize.

00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:58.020
- And I think it's also like

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.860
there's an importance to being systematic

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.070
about what criteria actually is,

00:47:03.070 --> 00:47:04.663
instead of just going
off of like a feeling.

00:47:04.663 --> 00:47:07.790
Like, I don't really feel
like this person is, you know,

00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:09.550
it's like, okay, what are the things

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:10.560
that need to be accomplished

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.730
and are they happening or not?

00:47:11.730 --> 00:47:13.770
I think that would help go a long way

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:15.550
'cause I do hear stories
of people saying like,

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:17.330
oh, we were hiring or we
were considering somebody

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:19.080
for a promotion and not having

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.560
those things be clearly spelled out.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:21.393
- Right, exactly.

00:47:21.393 --> 00:47:24.000
Have clear, clear criteria
that can apply to anyone.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.150
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:27.550
Another online question.

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.900
Among women who join the tech industry,

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:33.500
60% leave by mid-career,
which is nearly double

00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.390
the attrition rate for men, hence,

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:38.910
a smaller percentage of women
advance to leadership roles.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:40.990
What do you think are possible causes

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:42.903
and fixes for this situation?

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:46.120
- Yeah, well, that's a great question.

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:48.200
And it's a very sad statistic,

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:51.770
and I think there is still hostility

00:47:51.770 --> 00:47:53.300
in the workplace towards women.

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:55.740
I mean, that's sort of true.

00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:57.240
So I think that that is probably

00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.840
the biggest contributing factor.

00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:02.130
I think finding an environment,

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:04.523
like the one that we feel we have here,

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.790
super important, right?

00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:10.253
Because find a place you can thrive in.

00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:13.390
And again, if you're passionate
about doing the work,

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.220
then just look for
changing the environment

00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.080
so it's one that you can thrive in.

00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.950
And that's sort of the key there,

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:22.030
but yeah, I think that's a sad statistic,

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:24.320
and I think that there's a lot more

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.910
that we can do to make sure that we're all

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:29.130
always aware of inclusion,

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:30.670
not just for women, for everybody,

00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:34.230
but just all the time kind of listening

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:35.520
and reading those signals

00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:39.270
and making sure that
folks aren't dropping out

00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:41.550
of this industry because
it needs everybody.

00:48:41.550 --> 00:48:42.700
- [Rachel] Right, yeah.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.420
- Yeah, I was thinking about that.

00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:47.993
I feel like there's also,

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:54.560
there's still a disproportionate
amount of expectation

00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.590
of being like a super
woman in your own life.

00:48:57.590 --> 00:48:58.690
- [Rachel] Right, yeah.

00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:02.740
- Yeah, that feels like
that's still a thing too.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.190
There's like layers of the
onion skin on this one.

00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:08.020
It feels like there's internal, external,

00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:10.090
like meta, society level.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:10.923
- [Rachel] Right, yeah, yeah.

00:49:10.923 --> 00:49:11.756
- Yeah.

00:49:11.756 --> 00:49:12.990
- Yeah, women are amazing,

00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:14.900
but we're still only human sometimes,

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:18.163
and it's okay sometimes
to be mediocre, so.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:21.830
Okay, those are great questions.

00:49:21.830 --> 00:49:24.370
I don't think we have any other.

00:49:24.370 --> 00:49:25.203
Oh, we do.

00:49:25.203 --> 00:49:26.745
We have a question in the audience.

00:49:26.745 --> 00:49:29.190
- [Audience Member] Do
you have a microphone?

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:30.023
Do you want me to just yell it to you?

00:49:30.023 --> 00:49:31.320
- Yeah, go ahead, and I'll repeat it.

00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.780
- [Audience Member] Okay,
so I want to follow up

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:35.580
to the advice about finding a mentor

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:37.100
because it can be very difficult

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.647
to find women that are
above you in our industry.

00:49:39.647 --> 00:49:42.040
Do you have advice on how to find people

00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:44.190
who could be mentors, and then also,

00:49:44.190 --> 00:49:47.720
how do you actually approach
them around being a mentor?

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.120
- So just to repeat the question

00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.730
for the live stream, there was like how,

00:49:51.730 --> 00:49:54.100
what advice do you have
for kind of finding

00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.070
a mentor and what steps would you do

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:58.827
in trying to target the
right person for that?

00:49:58.827 --> 00:50:00.860
Did I capture, yeah, cool.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:02.030
- Yeah, that's a great question.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:03.560
I almost followed up when we were talking

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.670
about it earlier, that I
didn't want to sound glib

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.050
about when I said find a mentor

00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:10.050
because the hard part is doing it, right?

00:50:10.050 --> 00:50:11.543
The advice is easy to give.

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:14.730
So the one thing that I wanted to say then

00:50:14.730 --> 00:50:16.400
that I thought about that is

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:21.270
ask women that you come across, anywhere.

00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:23.030
If you feel like they have things

00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:26.610
that they can teach you,
ask them to be your mentor.

00:50:26.610 --> 00:50:28.450
I can say that in my career,

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:30.040
I have never said no to somebody

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.360
who's asked me to mentor them.

00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:33.450
I may have had limited bandwidth at times

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:35.380
and said like, well, this year maybe

00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:37.210
I can spend a little time with you,

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:38.710
next year, there will be more.

00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:39.690
But I've never said no.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:41.130
I don't think I'm an anomaly.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:44.640
I think that it's recognizing,

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:46.980
I think the hard part
may be finding a good fit

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.690
because you need to find someone

00:50:48.690 --> 00:50:50.520
who you're going to resonate with,

00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.820
you know, what they're telling you,

00:50:51.820 --> 00:50:54.520
not just somebody who's gonna
give you their guide book,

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:57.630
like we said, everybody's
style is different and so on.

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:00.450
But I think you're out and about,

00:51:00.450 --> 00:51:01.790
going to talks, going to meet-ups,

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.970
when you hear someone who is saying things

00:51:04.970 --> 00:51:06.610
that you think resonate with you,

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.980
do not hesitate to go up and ask them

00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:11.770
if they'll consider a
mentorship opportunity

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:14.350
because usually they'll say yes.

00:51:14.350 --> 00:51:15.630
And if when, what's the worst

00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:18.363
that can happen if they
don't and they say no?

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.102
- I think the other thing is like

00:51:21.102 --> 00:51:22.710
where you said the limited bandwidth,

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.010
the other thing that really helps

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:26.077
is if you figure out like

00:51:27.968 --> 00:51:30.276
how to make it the best use of their time

00:51:30.276 --> 00:51:32.020
in a small amount of time.

00:51:32.020 --> 00:51:33.600
So if you've done a little
bit of work up front,

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.970
and you know what they're about,

00:51:35.970 --> 00:51:37.240
what kinds of things interest them,

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:39.000
then you can already sort of resonate

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.160
and chat about those things.

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:45.010
And then it kind of goes
back to the empathetic thing,

00:51:45.010 --> 00:51:47.930
also kind of get an idea of like what are,

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:51.580
how is this a mutually
beneficial relationship?

00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.123
That definitely helps too.

00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:56.460
I think a lot of what we
stand to learn from mentees

00:51:56.460 --> 00:51:58.120
are what kinds of things
are you struggling with

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.370
as you're starting out new,

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.470
or coming up through different levels.

00:52:02.470 --> 00:52:04.530
And like we don't wanna lose touch

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.630
with what those experiences are like

00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:08.880
because then we can't
effectively create systems

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.290
to help support people.

00:52:10.290 --> 00:52:11.123
- [Rachel] Right.

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:13.970
- But we need to be able
to have those conversations

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.590
in a way that don't feel like, cool,

00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.040
so what do you wanna
talk about now, right?

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.450
'Cause then like, how do
we make this easy to--

00:52:20.450 --> 00:52:21.283
- [Rachel] To facilitate?

00:52:21.283 --> 00:52:23.130
- To facilitate and plug in, yeah.

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:24.800
- I'm curious to know, both of you

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.223
in your senior roles, do you
still have mentors today?

00:52:29.831 --> 00:52:31.280
You have people who you talk to as kind

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:33.300
of your either like advice board

00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.973
or whatever, advisors?

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:40.240
- I don't have a mentor,
I would say, one mentor.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.220
I learn a lot from all
of the women leaders

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.810
who are here at Khan Academy,
so I wanna say all the time.

00:52:46.810 --> 00:52:50.150
Our senior leadership team has
a lot of women leaders on it,

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:53.040
and I learn a lot from them all the time.

00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:56.890
Our COO, Ginny, a woman leader

00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:59.460
from whom I've learned a lot.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.100
So I'd say more a transition,

00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:03.970
just having a network of
women that you depend on.

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:07.500
So it's not like one
network, but one mentor,

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.490
but I think eventually,
hopefully you'll develop,

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.520
you'll keep the relationships
with your mentors

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:12.910
and you'll develop a whole network.

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:15.500
And now I have more like wise women,

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:19.260
a network of wise women
to whom I can reach out to

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.560
about any particular question
that happens to be one

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.389
that they may be particularly
experienced with.

00:53:25.389 --> 00:53:26.300
- [Rachel] That's good, yeah.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:27.820
- I feel like I definitely have, yeah,

00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:30.510
I definitely feel like I have mentors.

00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:33.030
Whether official relationship or not,

00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:36.370
both men and women that I'll reach out to

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:39.193
just via text message
or calls every so often.

00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.120
I mean, I think per your earlier question,

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:43.410
that's a good thing to call out too

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:47.360
is that some of my male mentors

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.180
and allies and friends have been

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.290
some of the strongest
support that I've had,

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:53.110
and so it's also good to not forget that

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.670
that support can come from anybody,

00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:58.300
sometimes in the most unlikely forms.

00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.360
- Yeah, that's a great call-out too.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:03.360
I'd say more of my mentors have been men

00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:05.430
and probably for obvious reasons,

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.360
given the field I'm in,

00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:10.340
but yeah, so a mentor can be anyone.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.350
- Can be anyone, all right.

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:16.320
All right, I think that
is the end of our chat.

00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:17.900
I wanna thank everyone here

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.630
in the Khan Academy office for watching.

00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:22.040
Thank you so much, let's give a round

00:54:22.040 --> 00:54:23.736
of applause for Martha and May-Li.

00:54:23.736 --> 00:54:24.569
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:54:24.569 --> 00:54:26.667
(audience applauds)

00:54:26.667 --> 00:54:28.450
- [Rachel] Thank you for everyone

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:31.600
watching on Facebook and online.

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:34.233
That's the show, goodnight, bye.
