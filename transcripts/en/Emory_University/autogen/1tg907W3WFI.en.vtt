no I'm very well I'm violence if I'm
agreeing with your point that it is very

01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760
agreeing with your point that it is very
 

01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:22.180
agreeing with your point that it is very
hard on the people and it's especially

01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:22.190
hard on the people and it's especially
 

01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:25.570
hard on the people and it's especially
hard if I may say so on women who are at

so I it's been one of my main concerns
 

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.000
so I it's been one of my main concerns
that I've never been able to really
