Well, this first line, it looks like
every point has a Y value equal to 1,

00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:06.150
2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.425
So y = 5.

00:00:08.425 --> 00:00:11.842
The second line is y = 1.

00:00:11.842 --> 00:00:17.685
And the third line, we go down 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, so it's y = -5.

00:00:17.685 --> 00:00:22.469
