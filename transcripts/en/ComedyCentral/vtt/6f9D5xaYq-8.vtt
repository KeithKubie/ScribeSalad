00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:03.636
- Hello. [snorts softly]
I'm Rachel Bloom,

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.639
and today we're gonna talk
about the capture...

00:00:06.672 --> 00:00:09.409
of Adolf Eichmann.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.612
 So Israel's established
 in 1948,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:17.216
 and Israel's like,
 okay, we need our own CIA.

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.320
 And so they form the Mossad,
 and David Ben-Gurion,

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:22.555
 who's the prime minister,
 is like,

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:24.624
 I'm going to appoint you,

00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.693
 Isser Harel,
 to be head of Mossad.

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:29.562
 And Isser Harel is like,
 awesome.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:32.665
 We're gonna hunt down
 Nazi war criminals,

00:00:32.698 --> 00:00:34.167
 'cause there are
 a lot of Nazis

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.868
 still, like, chilling.

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.370
 And the guy at the top
 of their list

00:00:37.403 --> 00:00:39.305
 is Adolf Eichmann,

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:42.108
 who literally planned
 the Holocaust.

00:00:42.141 --> 00:00:43.776
 So Isser Harel is like,

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.978
 let's nail this [bleep]
 mother[bleep]

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:47.413
 to the wall like a
 [bleep] moose

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:49.382
 who's been hunted.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.585
 Meanwhile, Adolf Eichmann
 is living in Argentina,

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.520
 making, like, a new alias.
 And he's like...

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:55.855
 [in German accent]
 Hmm, what's

00:00:55.888 --> 00:00:57.123
 an Argentinean-sounding name?

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:59.559
 Oh, I know: Ricardo Clement.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:02.295
 Good job, Adolf--
 I mean, Ricardo.

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:04.363
 Wink.
 However, his kids,

00:01:04.396 --> 00:01:06.132
 who were there with him,
 they're like,

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.000
 well, I'm really attached
 to Eichmann.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.036
 It's, like, in all
 my yearbooks.

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:11.938
 Like, I'm just gonna--
 I'm gonna--I'm gonna keep it.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.273
 So, the Eichmann kids
 are [bleep] stupid.

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:15.274
- [chuckling]

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:17.009
- [laughing]

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:19.011
Okay, so...

00:01:19.044 --> 00:01:22.849
 in the 1950s, Eichmann's son,
 Klaus, starts dating

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.650
 this very nice girl, Sylvia.

00:01:24.683 --> 00:01:26.486
 And when she's like,
 Daddy, I'm dating, like,

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.355
 the best guy.
 His name is Klaus Eichmann.

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:32.391
 And he's like, that's weird.

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:34.160
 My dog loves licking
 her [bleep].

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:36.896
- [laughs]
- My dog licks her vagina

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.731
 more than any dog.
 - That's cool.

00:01:38.764 --> 00:01:41.067
 - Anyway, so Sylvia's father,
 Lothar Hermann,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.402
 is like,
 huh, Eichmann, Eichmann...

00:01:43.435 --> 00:01:46.072
 [in German accent]
 Where have I heard that name?

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:48.107
 [dramatic percussive music]

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.843
 And so, Lothar tips off
 the Mossad.

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:52.712
 And he's like,
 my daughter's dating

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.847
 a guy named Klaus Eichmann.
 Like, this might

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.182
 be Adolf Eichmann--
 and this might be

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:57.717
 the son of Adolf Eichmann.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.051
 And the Mossad is like,

00:01:59.084 --> 00:02:00.887
 we need to check this guy out.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.389
 And so, they send operatives
 to Argentina,

00:02:03.422 --> 00:02:05.525
 all of whom
 are Holocaust survivors.

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.727
 And they're like, you need to
 take pictures of Eichmann

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.495
 to make sure this is Eichmann,
 so that we're not just, like,

00:02:09.528 --> 00:02:11.197
 capturing some poor
 Argentinean dude.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.198
 - Smart.

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.666
- Okay, so...

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.468
- [chuckles]
- No!

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:16.836
- What are you looking for?

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.004
- My water went
under the couch.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:19.972
- I got you.

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.274
You got it?
- Thanks, friend.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:22.675
- Mm-hmm.

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:25.211
- So, they send a guy,

00:02:25.244 --> 00:02:27.013
 who just kind of
 walks up to him

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.814
 while he's gardening,
 and they're like,

00:02:28.847 --> 00:02:30.516
 tell us how you garden.
 And he's like,

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.851
 well...
 and he, like, starts

00:02:31.884 --> 00:02:33.186
 to explain gardening to them.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:35.087
 And the whole time, they have

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.989
 a suitcase that has,
 like, a spy camera in it,

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:38.624
 so they're like...
 [imitates camera clicking]

00:02:38.657 --> 00:02:39.759
 And he's like,
 what's that sound?

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:41.027
 They're like, nothing.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.662
 So they send the pictures

00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:44.430
 back to Israel,
 and the Mossad is like,

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:47.833
 dudes, this is Eichmann.
 Let's get him there.

00:02:47.866 --> 00:02:49.535
 But Harel's like, whoa.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:52.505
 Argentina is really bad...
 - Mm-hmm.

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:54.340
 - About extraditing Nazis.

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:56.876
 They, like, don't give a shit
 for some reason.

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:59.912
 I don't know why.
 I don't know why!

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:01.914
 But they're just bad about it.

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:03.683
 And he tells Zvi Aharoni,

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:05.685
 if we're gonna capture
 Adolf Eichmann,

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:06.953
 we're gonna have to--
 we're gonna have to,

00:03:06.986 --> 00:03:08.955
 like, full-on kidnap him.

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:10.856
 Like-like a kid
 on a milk carton.

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.825
 We're gonna have
 to milk-carton Adolf Eichmann.

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:14.393
 - Mm.
 - So...

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:19.932
the four operatives, um...

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.602
they go to Argentina--
it's weird to tell a story

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.270
about Nazis and be so cozy.

00:03:24.303 --> 00:03:25.371
- [chuckles]
- Anyway,

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:27.406
 they park a deserted car

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.708
 to lure Eichmann.

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:30.309
 And they're like, okay guys,

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:33.079
 so...to distract ourselves

00:03:33.112 --> 00:03:34.847
 we need to come up
 with a group name.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.551
 How about...
 "The Kidnapping Friends"?

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:41.187
 And one of them's like,
 no, I don't--I--

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.222
 okay, if we're gonna come up
 with names,

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:45.691
 now's not the time to do it--
 but if we're going to,

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:48.828
 I think it should be called
 "The Abduction Posse."

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:51.897
 And another one's like,
 no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.332
 Listen, how about,
 I don't know,

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:54.967
 "The Snatch Squad?"

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.069
 And they're like,
 Snatch Squad!

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.505
 And just then, that's when
 Eichmann walks down the road.

00:03:59.538 --> 00:04:02.174
 And they're like,
 uh, our car is broken down.

00:04:02.207 --> 00:04:04.477
 [suspenseful music]

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.711
 Psych! It's not!

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:07.179
 And they tackle Eichmann.

00:04:07.212 --> 00:04:08.648
 They just, like, full-on,

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.949
 like, bum-rush Eichmann.

00:04:09.982 --> 00:04:11.651
 And they get him in the car,

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.919
and my dog continues
to lick her own [bleep].

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:15.021
- I'll be dogged.

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:15.955
I wanna do

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:16.956
the rest of the story
lying down.

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:18.724
- You do it.
You do what you--

00:04:18.757 --> 00:04:20.860
you do it the way you want.
- So, they bring him

00:04:20.893 --> 00:04:23.362
 to a safe house,
 and then they try

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:25.898
 to question him to make sure
 it's Adolf Eichmann

00:04:25.931 --> 00:04:27.833
 living in Germany--
 Ar-Argentina.

00:04:27.866 --> 00:04:31.270
 And Eichmann's like, hola.
 [laughs]

00:04:31.303 --> 00:04:33.639
 Me llamo Ricardo Clement.

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:36.275
 [laughing] Like, he's
 pretending to be Argentinean.

00:04:36.308 --> 00:04:37.943
 They're just like,
 clearly not.

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:40.813
 You are a pasty white
 German dude.

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:43.616
 And finally,
 he drops all the shit,

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.152
 and he's like, all right,
 I'm Adolf Eichmann.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:48.721
 Can I get a glass of wine?

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:51.457
 And they're like, okay,
 there is a plane leaving

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.659
 from Buenos Aires to Israel.

00:04:53.692 --> 00:04:56.162
 How do we sneak Eichmann
 onto this plane?

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:59.932
 So May 20, 1960,
 they sedate Adolf Eichmann,

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.501
 they dress him up
 as an El Al flight attendant--

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:04.403
 which is the Israeli airline--

00:05:04.436 --> 00:05:06.205
 and they literally, like,
 drag him to the airport.

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:08.274
 Like, full-on
 "Weekend At Bernie's"-ing

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:10.710
 the orchestrator of, like,
 the worst thing

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:12.378
 that's ever happened
 in their lives,

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:14.046
 and just being like,
 hey, I'm tired.

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:16.482
 Hello, I'm an
 El Al flight attendant.

00:05:16.515 --> 00:05:17.750
 And they're
 literally carrying him

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:19.752
 like, onto the plane.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:22.722
I mean, like,
the story's [bleep] insane.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.323
 So they get him to Israel,

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:26.859
 and they put
 Eichmann on trial.

00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:30.563
 And he's convicted,
 and...he's hung

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:32.365
 outside of Tel Aviv.
 - Wow.

00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:33.566
 - And the guys
 who captured him

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.001
 are like, look, f...

00:05:36.034 --> 00:05:38.971
 far be it for we
 to celebrate death,

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:41.340
 but also, um, [bleep] yeah.

00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:43.943
 - [bleep] the Nazis.
 - [bleep] the Nazis, man.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:47.980
I'm alive.
I'm 97.4 Ashkenazi.
