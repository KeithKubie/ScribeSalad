00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.980
It can feel very weird, and a bit threatening,
to talk about taking the pressure off a relationship.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.630
Our collective, inherited Romantic culture
likes to imagine functioning couples doing

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.279
more or less everything together and being
the centre of each other’s lives. The good

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.480
couple is, we are told, one in which two people
mean more or less everything to one another.In

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.059
a sound relationship, we are supposed to meet
each other’s needs in every area of existence

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:40.520
– from sex to intellectual stimulation,
cooking styles to bedroom habits. We’re

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.690
supposed to lead our social life in tandem,
be the primary sounding board for one another’s

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.300
problems and complete each other in spirit
and in matter. If they’re involved in a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.760
sport, we should at once join in or at least
come and support them every weekend; if we

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.410
want to visit a particular country, they are
supposed to trot along enthusiastically with

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.070
us; our friends are meant to be their friends…
It sounds sweet but it is – over the long

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.009
term – a recipe for disaster. No two people
can ever match each other across all areas

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.869
of existence; and the attempt to do so inevitably
ushers in bitterness and rage. We have, at

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:29.609
the collective level, given ourselves a hugely
unhelpful picture of how love should go. Any

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.920
independent move is read like a sign that
we can’t actually love one another: it is

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.490
taken to be a sign of imminent danger if we
visit other countries on our own or sleep

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.709
apart. So we end up badgering each other to
do things that we don’t really like (we

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.100
force each other to endure tedious hobbies
or see each other’s peculiar old friends),

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.520
not even because we inherently want to do
so but because any other arrangement has come

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.380
to seem like evidence of betrayal. A more
realistic and in the proper sense Romantic

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.829
view of couples would suggest that there have
to be a few strong areas where we can meet

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.400
each others needs, but that there should also
be plenty of others where we are clearly better

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.020
off pursuing our goals on our own. Consider
the following list of independent activities

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.970
and give them stars (from one to five) if
they strike you as relevant: I’d like to

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.440
… – Travel without my partner – Have
dinner one to one with a friend – Be able

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.430
to go to a party without my partner, and not
have them feel left out – Visit my parents

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.800
alone – Have my own financial adviser – Go
for long walks on my own – Have a separate

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.570
bathroom – Go shopping with a friend rather
than with my partner Look at each other’s

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:55.820
stars and list. Is there anything that you
feel you could accommodate? We should recognise

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.240
that a degree of independence isn’t an attack
on a partner: it’s a guarantee of the solidity

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.100
of the underlying commitment one has made.
Truly stable couples aren’t those that do

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.630
everything together, it’s those that have
managed to interpret their differences in

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.840
non-dramatic, non-disloyal terms. Ultimately,
a reduction of dependence doesn’t mean a

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.200
relationship is unraveling: it means that
we have learnt to focus more clearly and intently

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.500
on what the other person can actually bring
us and have stopped blaming them for not being

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.950
someone they never were. We no longer need
to be upset that their ideal holiday destination

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.850
strikes us as unappealing, or that their friends
seem boring. We have learnt, instead, to value

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:51.210
them for the areas where we truly see eye
to eye. To enjoy a harmonious union with someone,

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.430
we should ensure that we have plenty of sources
of excitement, reassurance and stimulation

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.010
outside of them. When we hit problems, we
should be able to lean on other supports.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.760
The demand that another person compensate
us for all that’s alarming, wearing or deficient

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.240
in our lives is a mechanism for systematically
destroying any relationship. Our conflicts

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.970
and disappointments will at once feel more
manageable when we stop asking our partner

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:27.650
to function as our long lost other half. The
more we can survive without a relationship,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:35.000
the greater will be its chances of survival
and fulfillment. We will truly give love a

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:46.470
chance when we stop believing it can single-handedly
save us.
