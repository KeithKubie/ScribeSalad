ring and talked to my daughter what a
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.479
ring and talked to my daughter what a
lovely way for the news to come it's a

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489
lovely way for the news to come it's a
 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.639
lovely way for the news to come it's a
striking coincidence that the news of

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649
striking coincidence that the news of
 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.440
striking coincidence that the news of
your prize comes on the same day that

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
your prize comes on the same day that
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.020
your prize comes on the same day that
we're hearing about the IPCC special

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030
we're hearing about the IPCC special
 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.760
we're hearing about the IPCC special
report highlighting the enormous

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770
report highlighting the enormous
 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.170
report highlighting the enormous
transformations that are going to be

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180
transformations that are going to be
 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.330
transformations that are going to be
needed if we're going to keep within

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340
needed if we're going to keep within
 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.660
needed if we're going to keep within
reasonable temperature rises you called

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670
reasonable temperature rises you called
 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.290
reasonable temperature rises you called
on almost any day there will be a story

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300
on almost any day there will be a story
 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.520
on almost any day there will be a story
somewhere in the newspaper and the

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
somewhere in the newspaper and the
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040
somewhere in the newspaper and the
science journals in economic journals

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050
science journals in economic journals
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.369
science journals in economic journals
about climate change and its causes and

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379
about climate change and its causes and
 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.399
about climate change and its causes and
its impacts and that's the sign of the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409
its impacts and that's the sign of the
 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.910
its impacts and that's the sign of the
duplicitous nature so I know this is a

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
duplicitous nature so I know this is a
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.480
duplicitous nature so I know this is a
report it's a useful report and it's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
report it's a useful report and it's
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.170
report it's a useful report and it's
it's collecting together what we've been

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
it's collecting together what we've been
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.550
it's collecting together what we've been
studying and learning over the last

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
studying and learning over the last
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.539
studying and learning over the last
actually 30 or 40 years and it's an

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549
actually 30 or 40 years and it's an
 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.609
actually 30 or 40 years and it's an
important reminder of the dangers we

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619
important reminder of the dangers we
 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.170
important reminder of the dangers we
face and the things that need to be done

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180
face and the things that need to be done
 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.200
face and the things that need to be done
and does your work make you hopeful that

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
and does your work make you hopeful that
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270
and does your work make you hopeful that
we can do what needs to be done

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280
we can do what needs to be done
 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.179
we can do what needs to be done
I'd say my most recent work has made me

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189
I'd say my most recent work has made me
 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.039
I'd say my most recent work has made me
somewhat concerned about the fact that

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
somewhat concerned about the fact that
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.620
somewhat concerned about the fact that
we're doing so little the the most

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
we're doing so little the the most
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.350
we're doing so little the the most
recent work I've done is studying actual

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
recent work I've done is studying actual
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.380
recent work I've done is studying actual
trends in abatement and in policies

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390
trends in abatement and in policies
 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.300
trends in abatement and in policies
suggest we're doing much less than needs

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
suggest we're doing much less than needs
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.020
suggest we're doing much less than needs
to be to reach any of their targets

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030
to be to reach any of their targets
 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.760
to be to reach any of their targets
whether it's a 1 and a half to B or two

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770
whether it's a 1 and a half to B or two
 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.749
whether it's a 1 and a half to B or two
degree or even that's basically target I

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759
degree or even that's basically target I
 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:08.690
degree or even that's basically target I
think the policies are lagging very very

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700
think the policies are lagging very very
 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.790
think the policies are lagging very very
miles miles miles behind the science and

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
miles miles miles behind the science and
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800
miles miles miles behind the science and
the need to what need to be the one

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
the need to what need to be the one
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.800
the need to what need to be the one
needs to be done hmm so it's hard to be

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
needs to be done hmm so it's hard to be
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.770
needs to be done hmm so it's hard to be
optimistic and also where we've fallen

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780
optimistic and also where we've fallen
 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.110
optimistic and also where we've fallen
behind because of the policies we're

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120
behind because of the policies we're
 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.610
behind because of the policies we're
actually going backwards in the United

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620
actually going backwards in the United
 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.990
actually going backwards in the United
States with the disastrous policies of

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000
States with the disastrous policies of
 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.960
States with the disastrous policies of
the Trump administration hmm I'd say it

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
the Trump administration hmm I'd say it
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.479
the Trump administration hmm I'd say it
and enemies that were personally and I

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489
and enemies that were personally and I
 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.540
and enemies that were personally and I
always use the word realism that dark

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
always use the word realism that dark
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.680
always use the word realism that dark
realism today yeah and it's not just the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690
realism today yeah and it's not just the
 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.110
realism today yeah and it's not just the
United States that may be pulling out of

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120
United States that may be pulling out of
 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.690
United States that may be pulling out of
these Accords other than on the horizon

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700
these Accords other than on the horizon
 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.220
these Accords other than on the horizon
yeah they're having different places are

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230
yeah they're having different places are
 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.530
yeah they're having different places are
doing different things but it's not too

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540
doing different things but it's not too
 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.660
doing different things but it's not too
late but the steps we have to take more

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670
late but the steps we have to take more
 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.009
late but the steps we have to take more
difficult now than if we'd started

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019
difficult now than if we'd started
 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.440
difficult now than if we'd started
earlier hmm would you highlight one

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450
earlier hmm would you highlight one
 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.090
earlier hmm would you highlight one
thing as being the single most important

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100
thing as being the single most important
 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.920
thing as being the single most important
thing for people to do well the first

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930
thing for people to do well the first
 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.140
thing for people to do well the first
thing is that people have to come to

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150
thing is that people have to come to
 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.060
thing is that people have to come to
grips with difficulties we face

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070
grips with difficulties we face
 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.400
grips with difficulties we face
I think the scientists haven't and many

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410
I think the scientists haven't and many
 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.780
I think the scientists haven't and many
of the people have but the government's

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
of the people have but the government's
 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.090
of the people have but the government's
have to and then the second thing was

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100
have to and then the second thing was
 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.580
have to and then the second thing was
most important so we take some kind of

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590
most important so we take some kind of
 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.610
most important so we take some kind of
economic steps I have advocated for many

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620
economic steps I have advocated for many
 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.440
economic steps I have advocated for many
years for carbon tax as a way of

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
years for carbon tax as a way of
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.770
years for carbon tax as a way of
implementing policies and then the third

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780
implementing policies and then the third
 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.960
implementing policies and then the third
thing is we'll have to have a

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970
thing is we'll have to have a
 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.330
thing is we'll have to have a
significant technological transformation

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340
significant technological transformation
 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.390
significant technological transformation
of course those first two would help the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400
of course those first two would help the
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.550
of course those first two would help the
third but those three has to go together

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560
third but those three has to go together
 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.280
third but those three has to go together
you can't do without public support but

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290
you can't do without public support but
 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.750
you can't do without public support but
you can't do it without some kind of

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760
you can't do it without some kind of
 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.789
you can't do it without some kind of
economic signals in the form of a carbon

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799
economic signals in the form of a carbon
 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.920
economic signals in the form of a carbon
tax and then all of those will help

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930
tax and then all of those will help
 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.840
tax and then all of those will help
induce the technological changes that

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850
induce the technological changes that
 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.120
induce the technological changes that
are necessary to make a transition to a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130
are necessary to make a transition to a
 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.690
are necessary to make a transition to a
low-carbon world and all that is

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700
low-carbon world and all that is
 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:51.920
low-carbon world and all that is
difficult enough to achieve if you

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930
difficult enough to achieve if you
 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.660
difficult enough to achieve if you
believe that this is what needs to be

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670
believe that this is what needs to be
 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:54.949
believe that this is what needs to be
done but if you don't believe goodness

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959
done but if you don't believe goodness
 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.180
done but if you don't believe goodness
where do you start well the first thing

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190
where do you start well the first thing
 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.759
where do you start well the first thing
you can't do it without looking without

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769
you can't do it without looking without
 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.819
you can't do it without looking without
the public awareness I think I think I

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829
the public awareness I think I think I
 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.720
the public awareness I think I think I
should we have a fair amount of progress
