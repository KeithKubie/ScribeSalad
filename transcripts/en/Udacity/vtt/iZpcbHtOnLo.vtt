00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.840
So I started off this process by
assigning some variables I already knew.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.000
So the height being eight is
just kind of a default value for

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.790
the height of a basement.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:08.100
It could've been seven,
it could've been nine.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.450
Anything that's tall enough
that we can fit in it is fine.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.150
For the total width and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.080
the total length we were actually given
those over here in the requirements.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.190
The length is 44 and the width is 30.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.270
Those are set by the other
floors of the house, and

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.740
the basement just kind of
mimics their footprint.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.660
So, what I did next, was that I just
went ahead and took the requirements for

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.900
the utility closet and the stairwell and
went ahead and applied them.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.260
I just said that the utility closet and

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.850
the stairwell must each
be 100 square feet.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.780
Let's just keep these simple and
go ahead and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.120
assign those 10 by 10 for each.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.460
Similarly for the bathroom, the bathroom
must be at least 200 square feet.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.810
And no length or
width can be under 10 feet.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.200
Let's just make it 10 by 20,
that's pretty easy.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.650
After assigning those three rooms,
we had 920 square feet left, so

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.510
I decided to keep things
simple here as well,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.180
split it in two,
two rooms that are each 460 square feet.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.350
And one way to do that would
be to make them each 20 by 23.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.270
So some of you might notice that
these rooms don't actually map to

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.250
the 44 by 30 basement, because while the
areas of these rooms add up to the same

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.430
number of square feet, they aren't
configurable into the right arrangement.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.320
For the purposes of this
example we'll be using numbers.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.810
But, a real configuration exercise for

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.370
this would also involve
arranging the rooms.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.960
So, not only do they add to
the same number of square feet, but

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.070
they can also fit inside
the same rectangle.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.590
&gt;&gt; Thank you, David.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.620
There are several things to
note from David's analysis.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.780
One is that in configuration
final we want an arrangement

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.480
of all the components of all the parts.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.970
So in this case, finally we want
an arrangement of all the rooms and

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.130
these stairwells and
these utility closets and so on.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.680
Not just the size of each one of them,
but the actual spatial layout.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.760
Second, they would begin by assigning
values to some variables here

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.750
because he thought that this
variables were more restricted.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.030
One can use a number of different
heuristics for ordering the variables.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.390
Perhaps we can choose those variables
which are most restricted first.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.050
Or we can choose those variables
that restrict others the most first.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.160
We can choose the most
important variables first.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.919
The point is there can be
a large number of variables and

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:10.449
we can impose an ordering on them.
