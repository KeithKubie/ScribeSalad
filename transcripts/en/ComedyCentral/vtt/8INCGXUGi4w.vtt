As we go to our next game,
AskReddit: Sex Ed Edition.

00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:10.611
Redditor Mollymonkey101 posted
this fascinating query

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:13.213
in-in AskReddit:
"Sex Ed teachers of reddit,

00:00:13.247 --> 00:00:15.215
what is the stupidest question
you've ever gotten?"

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:18.819
Among the avalanche of gems
was this one: "It's fun, right?"

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:21.688
Um... yes,
but not with an alcoholic clown

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:24.024
at a Super Bowl party,
I think would be the answer.

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.493
So, comedians, I want you to ask
even dumber sex ed questions

00:00:26.527 --> 00:00:29.096
in 60 seconds. And begin.
Uh, Jim.

00:00:29.129 --> 00:00:31.765
I have two girls,
but I don't have a cup.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.101
-Will a mug work?
-Points.

00:00:34.134 --> 00:00:35.102
Nikki.

00:00:35.135 --> 00:00:36.436
How old are balls?

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.971
Points.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:39.239
Kevin.

00:00:39.273 --> 00:00:41.375
Does it count as cheating
if it's just oral

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:42.376
and you're related?

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.610
Poi...

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.017
Points.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.218
Jim Jefferies.

00:00:51.251 --> 00:00:53.620
My friend says
that woman can have orgasms.

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:55.355
Is he gay or just stupid?

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:57.357
Points. Kevin.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.893
Where in the Bible does it say
that Jesus is cool

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:01.094
with the butt stuff?

00:01:01.128 --> 00:01:03.096
Points. Nikki Glaser.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.898
Who wins?

00:01:04.932 --> 00:01:06.767
Points.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.101
Kevin.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:09.903
How much blood should be
in the ejaculate?

00:01:09.937 --> 00:01:11.438
A gallon?

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:13.907
Is it... is it...

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:16.176
No, seriously.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.846
If it's... Is it more
than a gallon, is that bad?

00:01:18.879 --> 00:01:20.781
More than a gallon. I think
less than a gallon's okay.

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:20.881
-More than a gallon's bad.
Points. -All right, okay, good.
