00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:03.069
- In the previous video,
we talked about interphase

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:07.248
which is the bulk of a
cell's life cycle as it grows

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:12.046
and its DNA replicates,
and it grows some more.

00:00:12.046 --> 00:00:14.759
And now, we're gonna talk
about the actual cell division.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.710
We're gonna talk about mitosis.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.053
And if you wanna be precise,
mitosis is the process

00:00:20.053 --> 00:00:24.279
by which this one nucleus
will turn into two nuclei

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.959
that each have the original
genetic information.

00:00:27.959 --> 00:00:31.790
Now, as we exit mitosis,
we get into cytokineses

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.231
which will then split each of the nuclei

00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:39.772
into a separate cell when
we split the cytoplasm

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:40.608
right over here.

00:00:40.608 --> 00:00:44.280
We split or the cell as
it turns into to cells.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.552
Well, let's see how all of this happens.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.194
So the first phase, and I'll
leave the end of interphase

00:00:51.194 --> 00:00:52.158
right over here.

00:00:52.158 --> 00:00:56.198
We have this big cell, our
DNA has been replicated.

00:00:56.198 --> 00:00:59.240
We have two centrosomes right over here.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.240
The first phase of
mitosis involves the cell

00:01:04.394 --> 00:01:06.052
and I might draw a little
bit smaller just so I have

00:01:06.052 --> 00:01:07.712
enough space here.

00:01:07.712 --> 00:01:09.256
So, involve.

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:11.856
So, this is the cell right over here.

00:01:11.856 --> 00:01:13.981
So we're gonna go to this
phase right over here.

00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:16.813
And a few things start happening.

00:01:16.813 --> 00:01:20.993
One, the DNA, the chromosomes
go from being in their

00:01:20.993 --> 00:01:23.319
chromatin form where
they're all spread out

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.722
to kind of a more condensed
form that you can actually see

00:01:25.722 --> 00:01:27.382
from a light microscope.

00:01:27.382 --> 00:01:30.505
So for example, that magenta
chromosome which is now made up

00:01:30.505 --> 00:01:33.384
of two sister chromatids
after replication,

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.043
we talked about that
in the interphase video.

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:39.280
It might look something like this in a ...

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.184
It might look something like this

00:01:42.184 --> 00:01:45.183
if you were to look in a microscope.

00:01:45.183 --> 00:01:48.560
It's unlikely to be magenta but
it's gonna have kind of that

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.802
classic chromosome shape
that you're used to seeing

00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:52.102
in textbooks.

00:01:52.102 --> 00:01:54.482
And it has the centromere that connects

00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:56.363
these two sister chromatids.

00:01:56.363 --> 00:01:59.764
Right now, both of these two
sister chromatids combined

00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:01.981
are considered to be one chromosome.

00:02:01.981 --> 00:02:04.489
Even though before replication
it was still considered,

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:08.529
the magenta stuff was still
considered to be one chromosome.

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.501
And we can draw the blue chromosome.

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:13.045
Once again, it's now
in the condensed form.

00:02:13.045 --> 00:02:15.541
That's one sister
chromatid right over there.

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:18.745
That's another sister chromatid.

00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:21.564
They are connected at the centromere.

00:02:23.752 --> 00:02:27.263
So they're condensing now
as we enter into mitosis.

00:02:27.263 --> 00:02:30.741
And the nuclear membrane

00:02:30.741 --> 00:02:34.514
starts to go away.

00:02:34.514 --> 00:02:37.822
So the nuclear membrane
is starting to go away.

00:02:37.822 --> 00:02:40.857
And these two centrosomes
are starting to migrate

00:02:40.857 --> 00:02:44.491
to opposite sides of the cell.

00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:47.230
So one of them is going
over here and one of them

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.854
is maybe going to go over here.

00:02:49.854 --> 00:02:53.534
So they're migrating to
opposite sides of the cell.

00:02:53.534 --> 00:02:55.788
And it's pretty incredible.

00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:57.926
It's easy to say, "Oh, this
happens and then that happens."

00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:00.816
Remember, this cell doesn't have a brain.

00:03:00.816 --> 00:03:03.696
This is all happening through
chemical and thermodynamic

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:07.445
reactions and the way, just
based on certain triggers

00:03:07.445 --> 00:03:09.255
of where the cell is and its life cycle.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:10.939
It's amazing that this is happening.

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:12.436
It's amazing that the structures,

00:03:12.436 --> 00:03:14.431
and what sometimes we
consider to be a simple thing

00:03:14.431 --> 00:03:16.776
but it's actually
incredibly complex thing.

00:03:17.956 --> 00:03:20.678
It kind of knows what to do even though

00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:22.594
it has no intelligence here.

00:03:22.594 --> 00:03:23.801
And a lot of what I'm talking about,

00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.576
the general overview of the
process is well understood

00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:29.455
but scientists are still
understanding exactly

00:03:29.455 --> 00:03:32.438
how do the different things
happen when they should happen

00:03:32.438 --> 00:03:34.817
and by what mechanism and
what's actually happening.

00:03:34.817 --> 00:03:38.417
Sometimes, molecular or atomic basis.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:41.296
But anyway, this first phase of mitosis,

00:03:41.296 --> 00:03:43.560
the nuclear envelope, the nuclear membrane

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.150
starts to disappear.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.354
The centrosomes migrate to
the opposite ends of the cell.

00:03:48.354 --> 00:03:51.953
And our DNA condenses into
kind of the condensed form

00:03:51.953 --> 00:03:53.752
of the chromosomes.

00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:55.690
And we call this prophase.

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.769
Prophase.

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.628
Prophase of mitosis.

00:04:01.628 --> 00:04:03.590
Now, in the next phase.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.734
In the next phase, let
me draw my cell again.

00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:09.498
Drawing that same green color.

00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:14.089
In the next phase,

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:19.089
your nuclear membrane is now gone.

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:22.579
And the chromosomes start lining up

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:24.565
in the middle of the cells.

00:04:24.565 --> 00:04:27.790
So you have the blue one right over here,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.842
the blue one that's one sister chromatid.

00:04:29.842 --> 00:04:32.222
Here's another sister chromatid

00:04:32.222 --> 00:04:36.273
and they're connected at the centromere,

00:04:36.273 --> 00:04:39.257
not to be confused with a centrosome.

00:04:39.257 --> 00:04:43.251
And then, here's the magenta, one of the

00:04:43.251 --> 00:04:45.932
magenta sister chromatids and another one.

00:04:47.005 --> 00:04:48.902
And once again, it's not
magenta in real life,

00:04:48.902 --> 00:04:52.106
I'm just making it a magenta
because it looks nice.

00:04:52.106 --> 00:04:54.486
That's the centromere right over there.

00:04:54.486 --> 00:04:58.526
Our centrosomes are at opposite ends

00:04:58.526 --> 00:05:00.685
of the cell at this point.

00:05:00.685 --> 00:05:02.078
At opposite ends of the cell.

00:05:02.078 --> 00:05:03.556
And you might have heard of the word,

00:05:03.556 --> 00:05:04.646
let me label this again.

00:05:04.646 --> 00:05:05.661
I labeled it in a previous video.

00:05:05.661 --> 00:05:08.018
That's centrosomes.

00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:13.018
Centrosomes where the two
sister chromatids are connected.

00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:16.129
That's a centromere.

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:17.673
Centromere.

00:05:17.673 --> 00:05:20.715
Now, you might heard
of the word centrioles.

00:05:20.715 --> 00:05:22.607
Centrioles are actually, they help,

00:05:22.607 --> 00:05:25.451
they are exist inside the centrosomes.

00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:28.415
They're these two kind of
cylindrical looking structures.

00:05:28.415 --> 00:05:31.934
Each of the centrosomes
have two centrioles.

00:05:31.934 --> 00:05:33.280
But for the sake of
this video, you can say,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:36.403
"Well, the centrioles are
just part of the centrosomes."

00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:38.980
But I'm just listing you all the words

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.232
that involves centri something.

00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:44.553
Centrioles right over there
and you have two of them

00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:46.062
per centrosome.

00:05:46.062 --> 00:05:48.256
So hopefully, that helps
clarify some confusion.

00:05:48.256 --> 00:05:49.695
But these things line up.

00:05:49.695 --> 00:05:51.576
And a lot of what you're about
to see, this orchestration,

00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:54.316
these things moving around
in the cell, things lining up

00:05:54.316 --> 00:05:57.276
and soon things pulling apart,
these are all coordinated

00:05:57.276 --> 00:06:00.479
with actually a fairly
sophisticated mechanism of kind of a

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.833
scaffold of this kind of
ropes, these microtubules.

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:07.434
And the centrosomes' role, until now

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:08.618
I've just been kind of drawing.

00:06:08.618 --> 00:06:09.535
I mean, what do they do?

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:12.821
Well, the centrosomes'
role is these microtubules

00:06:12.821 --> 00:06:17.138
extend from them to each
other and to the centromeres

00:06:18.618 --> 00:06:23.499
of these chromosomes
and to a large degree,

00:06:23.499 --> 00:06:25.437
they're not the only actors here.

00:06:25.437 --> 00:06:28.258
They help pull and push
things in the right way.

00:06:28.258 --> 00:06:32.077
So these help keep make sure
that the two centrosomes

00:06:32.077 --> 00:06:33.494
push away from each other.

00:06:33.494 --> 00:06:35.468
And then as we'll see in the next phase,

00:06:35.468 --> 00:06:37.754
that they're able to
pull one of each of the

00:06:37.754 --> 00:06:41.249
sister chromatids from
each of the pairs towards

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:43.563
each of them.

00:06:43.563 --> 00:06:45.722
So this right over here where you see

00:06:45.722 --> 00:06:50.622
where the nuclear envelope
is now gone, the chromosomes

00:06:50.622 --> 00:06:53.861
have been lined up just like
this and your centrosomes

00:06:53.861 --> 00:06:57.281
are on opposite side of your cell.

00:06:57.281 --> 00:06:58.918
We call this the metaphase.

00:06:59.713 --> 00:07:04.713
We call this the metaphase of mitosis.

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.786
And then you can imagine
what's going to happen next.

00:07:07.786 --> 00:07:09.666
What's going to happen next?

00:07:09.666 --> 00:07:11.991
What's going to happen next is ...

00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:14.584
Let me, I don't wanna draw it
too big 'cause I wanna be able

00:07:14.584 --> 00:07:16.465
to fit it all in one page.

00:07:16.465 --> 00:07:20.947
What's going to happen next is that

00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:23.849
those microtubules are
going to start pulling

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:25.474
on each of the sister chromatids.

00:07:25.474 --> 00:07:26.891
Let me draw that.

00:07:26.891 --> 00:07:31.891
So you have this
centrosome right over here.

00:07:32.115 --> 00:07:35.990
You have all these
microtubules in your cell.

00:07:36.866 --> 00:07:38.561
You have the centrosome right over here,

00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:40.244
all those microtubules.

00:07:40.244 --> 00:07:43.019
And this one is going to be pulling,

00:07:43.019 --> 00:07:46.060
is going to be getting
one of the blue chromatids

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.301
to pull towards it or to move towards it.

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.578
So let me draw that.

00:07:49.578 --> 00:07:52.248
So this is one blue
chromatid right over here.

00:07:52.248 --> 00:07:54.746
aAd this one is going to
be pulling the other blue

00:07:54.746 --> 00:07:56.826
chromatid towards it.

00:07:58.004 --> 00:07:59.966
And same thing for the magenta.

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:03.285
And same thing for the magenta.

00:08:03.285 --> 00:08:05.724
So that one's being pulled to that way.

00:08:05.724 --> 00:08:09.543
And this one is being pulled that way.

00:08:09.543 --> 00:08:12.746
And just in case you're
concerned about the,

00:08:12.746 --> 00:08:15.448
some of more of the words
of vocabulary involved,

00:08:15.448 --> 00:08:18.548
the point it was this
microtubules connect to

00:08:18.548 --> 00:08:19.952
what used to be sister chromatids,

00:08:19.952 --> 00:08:23.114
but now that they're apart,
we now call them chromosomes.

00:08:23.114 --> 00:08:25.585
When they emerge, this is
one chromosome and they have

00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:26.618
two sister chromatids.

00:08:26.618 --> 00:08:28.882
But now they're apart, we would
actually now consider this

00:08:28.882 --> 00:08:30.588
each an independent chromosome.

00:08:30.588 --> 00:08:33.781
So now, you actually have
four chromosomes over here.

00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:37.318
This point right over here,
we call it kinetochore.

00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:39.524
And even exactly how that interphase works

00:08:39.524 --> 00:08:42.682
and exactly how things move
is not fully understood.

00:08:42.682 --> 00:08:44.539
Some of this stuff is
understood but some of this

00:08:44.539 --> 00:08:46.699
is still an area of research.

00:08:46.699 --> 00:08:49.415
So something even as
basic as cell division,

00:08:49.415 --> 00:08:51.316
not so basic after all.

00:08:51.316 --> 00:08:53.939
So this right over here where
you can start to see the DNA

00:08:53.939 --> 00:08:56.598
kind of migrating to their
respective sides of the cell.

00:08:56.598 --> 00:08:58.919
We call this the anaphase.

00:08:58.919 --> 00:09:01.472
We call this the anaphase.

00:09:02.503 --> 00:09:06.584
And that takes us to the
last formal phase of mitosis

00:09:06.584 --> 00:09:08.522
and that is called telophase.

00:09:09.677 --> 00:09:12.173
Telophase.

00:09:12.173 --> 00:09:16.735
And in telophase, I'm gonna
do my best shot to draw it.

00:09:16.735 --> 00:09:19.580
And you could already see
I have started to draw that

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:23.155
the cellular membrane is
starting to pinch in kind of in

00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:26.345
preparation for cytokineses,
in preparation for the cell

00:09:26.345 --> 00:09:27.645
splitting into two cells.

00:09:27.645 --> 00:09:29.838
So I'll do it a little bit more.

00:09:29.838 --> 00:09:33.078
Cytokineses is usually described
as kinda being a separate

00:09:33.078 --> 00:09:36.758
process in mitosis although
it's obviously they are,

00:09:36.758 --> 00:09:39.347
they kind of together
help the cell fully turn

00:09:39.347 --> 00:09:40.926
into two cells.

00:09:40.926 --> 00:09:44.316
So now in telophase, so you have this,

00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:45.840
what used to be a sister chromatid,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.991
now we can call it a
chromosome on its own.

00:09:47.991 --> 00:09:50.582
And we have this chromosome.

00:09:51.586 --> 00:09:55.628
And we have this chromosome

00:09:57.177 --> 00:09:58.060
right over there.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.296
We have to do it on both sides.

00:10:00.296 --> 00:10:04.133
So you're there and you have

00:10:05.446 --> 00:10:07.292
this right over here.

00:10:07.292 --> 00:10:10.125
And actually, let me draw
it a little bit different.

00:10:10.125 --> 00:10:12.783
Because at this phase, you're
really starting to unwind

00:10:12.783 --> 00:10:14.884
what happened at prophase.

00:10:14.884 --> 00:10:17.113
So prophase, you have the disappearance

00:10:17.113 --> 00:10:19.331
of the nuclear membrane and
you have the condensation

00:10:19.331 --> 00:10:21.103
of the chromosomes into this form here.

00:10:21.103 --> 00:10:24.144
Telophase, that's unwinding a little bit.

00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:26.683
So actually, let me draw
the two centrosomes.

00:10:26.683 --> 00:10:28.738
So you have one centrosome
with that same color that

00:10:28.738 --> 00:10:29.991
I had before.

00:10:29.991 --> 00:10:31.964
So you have one centrosome right here.

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.449
You have another centrosome
right over there.

00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:37.734
And now, the DNA, this blue DNA,

00:10:37.734 --> 00:10:39.320
this chromosome is now here
but it's starting to get

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:40.977
a little under wind a little bit,

00:10:40.977 --> 00:10:43.693
same thing on this side right over here.

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:45.818
Magenta chromosome is
on here but once again,

00:10:45.818 --> 00:10:47.676
it's starting to get a little bit unwound.

00:10:47.676 --> 00:10:49.198
Same thing over here.

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:54.198
And you start to have
nuclear membranes forming

00:10:54.645 --> 00:10:56.154
around the DNA.

00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:58.767
So once again, it's kind of redoing what

00:10:58.767 --> 00:11:01.553
was undone in prophase.

00:11:01.553 --> 00:11:04.153
Undone in prophase.

00:11:04.153 --> 00:11:05.897
And so, when you're done, essentially,

00:11:05.897 --> 00:11:07.816
you're gonna have these nuclear membranes.

00:11:07.816 --> 00:11:11.752
The DNA is gonna go back
to its chromatin form.

00:11:11.752 --> 00:11:14.028
And then you have cytokineses.

00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:16.535
And cytokineses is the process
by which this gets fully

00:11:16.535 --> 00:11:20.064
pinched together and you
have two separate cells.

00:11:20.064 --> 00:11:23.535
And some folks will say, "Oh,
it kind of begins in anaphase

00:11:23.535 --> 00:11:25.984
"and finishes after telophase."

00:11:25.984 --> 00:11:28.574
But it's kind of happening
near the end of mitosis

00:11:28.574 --> 00:11:29.653
in parallel with it.

00:11:29.653 --> 00:11:31.752
So this is cytokineses.

00:11:32.721 --> 00:11:34.267
Cytokineses.

00:11:35.124 --> 00:11:37.424
Cytokineses right over here.

00:11:37.424 --> 00:11:41.045
This essentially is how this larger cell

00:11:41.045 --> 00:11:45.086
that had two nuclei, how
this divides, fully divides

00:11:45.086 --> 00:11:47.685
into two cells.

00:11:47.685 --> 00:11:52.166
And at that point,
you're back to this phase

00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:53.386
of the cell cycle.

00:11:53.386 --> 00:11:56.021
Now, each of these two cells

00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:58.883
are going to go through interphase, G1,

00:11:58.883 --> 00:12:02.582
S-phase replicate their DNA,
and G2 phase goes some more

00:12:02.582 --> 00:12:05.055
and then it go through mitosis again.

00:12:05.055 --> 00:12:07.597
And then these two will
turn into four cells.

00:12:07.597 --> 00:12:09.786
Anyway, hopefully, you enjoyed that.
