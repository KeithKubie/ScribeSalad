00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
select * from art order by created descending.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So remember our table is called Art.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I hope I didn't confuse you by adding the s here.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I think we will accept both, but our class name is Art,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so that's the name of our table.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So select * from art, and remember all GQL queries

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
have to say select *, so you have no choice there.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Then order by--that's how you sort something--created.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is our property that represents when

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
this particular piece of art was submitted.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And since we want most recent first,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we add DESC, for descending, at the end of this query.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Okay, let's go ahead and add the store program.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So I've written the SQL select * from art order by created descending.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I used multiple lines here.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That makes it a little bit easier to read.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
That's going to store the results from this query,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which is actually going to be a cursor.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The cursor is just a pointer to the results in this variable called Arts.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Let's go ahead and pass in arts to our template.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Let's go to our template and make use of it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So below our form--this is going to get a little fancy--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we're going to display all the artwork we've received submitted.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So I'm going to start with an HR, which just draws a line across the page,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and then I can use a loop in this template.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This is going to be actually--it's going to be Python code embedded in our html.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You don't have to understand it, but that's what I'm doing.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
For art in arts,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
this little curly percent syntax is used by Jinja,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the template language, to separate html from Python.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We're going to create a div. We're going to call it art.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Remember this class doesn't do anything until we add the styles,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and we haven't added any styles yet.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So it basically just creates a new line.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Div class equals art title--

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
again, another div doesn't do anything yet.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We're just going to put the art title in here.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This is how we include a variable.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Remember the double curlies.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So for art in arts,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I'm going to take that art here

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and access its title.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And this object art here

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
is actually an instance of this class art here,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and it has a title.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So it can access the title using the period syntax.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Then we close those curlies, we close our div,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and then we're going to add the art body.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm going to use the pre tag.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
The pre tag is a handy little tag

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that basically preserves the white space that is inside it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So remember how we talked about html,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
how it converts all spaces to a single space

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and all new lines to a single new line?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That's why we can indent our html,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because there's actually all these spaces between all these tags

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and things to print as you'd expect them to.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The pretag basically says

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
any white space between this pretag is preformatted

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and it's going to stay that way.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So we're going to include our art.art.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now remember, this art here--

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
this is a little confusing, I realize--

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
this art here refers to this instance of our art class,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and our art class actually has a property called art,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
which is actually the text of the art itself.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So that's what we're going to include there,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and then we're going to close our div,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and we're going to end our loop.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And that's the end of our html file.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Let's review what we just added.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
For every art in arts, render this html.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Remember arts comes from

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
this query that we run here--this GQL query--

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
to select all of the art.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We're going to store that in a variable called Arts,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and we're going to pass it into our template.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So let's go to our browser.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Here we've got our page.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And now, when I reload this page, I should see all of our artwork.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Aha! And here is the camel we submitted.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
There's the title, and there is the camel.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Let's submit a new piece of art.
