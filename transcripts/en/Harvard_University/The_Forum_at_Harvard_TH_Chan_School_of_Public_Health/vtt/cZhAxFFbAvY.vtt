MICHELLE WILLIAMS:
Welcome to the forum,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.180
live streamed worldwide
from the Leadership Studio

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.210
at the Harvard T.H. Chan
School of Public Health.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.500
I'm Dean Michelle Williams.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.820
The forum is a collaboration
between the Harvard Chan School

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.040
and independent news media.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.010
Each program features
a panel of experts

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.880
addressing some of today's most
pressing public health issues.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.400
The forum is one way
the school advances

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.190
the frontiers of
public health and makes

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.110
scientific insights accessible
to policymakers and the public.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.690
I hope you find this program
engaging and informative.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.930
Thank you for joining us.

and WGBH, and is part of the
Dr. Lawrence H. and Roberta Cohn

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.613
forum series.

00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:12.280
And she is here.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.720
Roberta, excuse me.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.200
We are pleased to welcome the
Cohen family and friends here

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.700
today.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.980
So welcome to you.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.120
We are streaming
live on websites 4

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.680
of the forum and the world.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.800
So please join us there.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.290
We're also streaming live
on Facebook and YouTube,

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.393
and the program will
include a brief Q&amp;A.

00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:30.310
And we really want to
be sure to get those in,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.570
those questions and answers.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.230
You can email those to us at
the forum at hsph.harvard.edu.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.760
You can also participate in
a live chat that's happening

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.350
on the forum site right now.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.800
So let's start off by saying
that millions of babies

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.540
are safely delivered in the
United States each year.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.070
Many women will experience
safe and healthy pregnancies

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.360
and deliveries and
postpartum periods.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.780
However, we are seeing
a startling trend

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.190
in the United States.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.040
At a time when maternal
mortality is dropping

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.050
in many places in
the world, death

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.930
related pregnancy and
childbirth in the United States

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:05.980
have increased.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.320
And the risk is
triple or quadruple

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.582
for black women in America.

00:03:10.582 --> 00:03:12.040
Today we're going
to look at what's

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.013
driving that national trend
as well as the racial gap,

00:03:15.013 --> 00:03:16.930
and then we'll talk about
what we can actually

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.420
do about it because it's very
important to actually try

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.860
to do something about it.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.800
To set the stage, let's take a
look at a video from ProPublica

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.620
which published an
amazing series with NPR

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.750
about maternal
mortality in the US.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.220
And it's called Lost Mothers.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.968
Let's take a look.

00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:35.461
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.100
TINA MARTIN: Wow.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.600
That clip use statistics from
2016 and here we are in 2019.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.970
Those stats are
still distressing

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.310
and that clip itself
was disturbing.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.140
Wanda, give us an idea
of the big picture

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.120
what's happening here.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.620
WANDA BARFIELD: Well, thank you
for your introduction, Tina,

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.460
and thank you for your remarks
about this important issue.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.670
As been mentioned by Tina
and also by the clip,

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.620
that we see about 700 women
dying each year in our country

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.950
due to pregnancy or
delivery complications.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.260
With better data and
collection techniques

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.840
we're getting better
and better in terms

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.960
of identifying the causes
of these deaths that

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.290
are truly related to
pregnancy as well as delivery.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:05.620
But while pregnancy
related mortality ratios

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.110
have been relatively stable
in the last few years,

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.500
we know that overall
pregnancy related

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.180
mortality has not decreased.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.610
And this really is
a cause for concern.

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.270
And another major
cause for concern

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.330
are these evident racial
disparities that we're seeing.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:27.010
So for more than 30 years we've
seen a disproportionate burden

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.620
of death among
African-American women.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:32.830
Today, black women are
almost four times as

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.220
likely to die of a pregnancy
related complication

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.500
compared to white women.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.560
And this is really an
unconscionable issue.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.655
Importantly, emerging data from
state based maternal mortality

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:47.200
review committees--
and these are

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.410
groups that come together
to try to understand

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.570
the causes of death
--they're showing

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.560
that 60% of maternal
deaths may be preventable.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.530
And so we have no
reason to believe

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.650
that this prevent abilities
that would vary by race.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.010
So we have a lot of
room for opportunities

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.350
for intervention in this area.

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.070
Better data can also help
us to better understand

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:15.070
the gaps and the drivers
of maternal deaths

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:18.350
and think about ways
that we can prevent them.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.460
So some of what we're seeing
from these review committees

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.060
are that there are underlying
chronic conditions that

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.420
are disparate particularly
for African-American women.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.020
We're seeing that there are
the effects of unconscious bias

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.780
as well as structural racism
that may be contributing

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.190
to these deaths.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.590
And then the third issue
is an issue of quality.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:41.290
We're seeing variation
in hospital quality.

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:43.030
So with a better
data we're going

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.250
to get better
understanding of what

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.490
we need to do in terms of
quality care initiatives

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:50.840
that may have better impact.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.500
We can also think about
standardized care that

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:57.220
will allow women to get the
right care at the right time

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.570
and the right place.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:02.170
And high quality care is
really an important factor

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:06.130
in trying to improve the care of
women not only in the hospital,

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.520
but thinking about care into
the year after delivery.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.650
So we have a real opportunity to
really improve maternal health.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.520
At CDC we're really trying to
see how we can improve data

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.050
across the country.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:23.180
And we have an opportunity
now with the support

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.720
through Congress to look at
maternal mortality review

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.340
committees.

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.380
And so states and
jurisdictions will

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:34.140
have an opportunity to
improve their care for women.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:37.059
And at this point
I'd like to stop

00:08:37.059 --> 00:08:39.610
and I'll give a
chance for Dr. Langer

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.152
to further the discussion.

00:08:41.152 --> 00:08:41.860
TINA MARTIN: Yes.

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.680
Because you study health
trends around the world.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.485
Help us to put this into global
context what's happening here

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:48.360
in the United States.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.090
ANA LANGER: Sure.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.960
Thank you so much
for that question.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.820
Those of us working on
global maternal health

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.490
always considered maternal
mortality and severe morbidity

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.430
as a problem of low
resource settings.

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:05.380
In fact, after all,
99% of maternal deaths

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:07.820
happen in low and
middle income countries,

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:12.030
but that remaining 1% happens
among vulnerable women

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:13.630
in developed countries.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.560
And in fact the US is a country
where most of those deaths

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.310
happen, and probably
the only one, in fact

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.800
the only developed country
where the maternal mortality

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:27.340
ratio is going up.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.930
Overall, if you list
the countries from one

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:34.150
with the lowest maternal
mortality ratio, which

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:36.730
is Finland, to the
one with the highest,

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.710
the US occupies at
place number 46.

00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.320
In fact, it's interesting
to see that the US is

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:48.040
below Qatar, Libya,
and of course

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.070
all Western European
countries, but Qatar and Libya

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:53.050
are countries with a
much smaller economy

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.430
and expenditures in health.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.750
But as Wanda
correctly pointed out,

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:01.130
these deaths don't
happen randomly.

00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:03.640
So if you look at
maternal mortality

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:06.220
among non-Hispanic black
women and compare it

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.530
with what's happening
in other countries,

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:12.100
you will see that
maternal mortality

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.500
among non-Hispanic
black women here

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.110
is higher than maternal
mortality in Mexico,

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.300
and is the same
one as in Malaysia,

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:23.680
countries you wouldn't think
are doing better than America.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.960
On the other hand, if you
look at maternal mortality

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:28.390
among non-Hispanic
white women, you

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:31.930
will see that the ratio is
above the national ratio

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.720
in New Zealand and the UK.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.770
But vary slightly so,
almost at the same level.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:41.860
At the first report we'll
draw our recent attention

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:46.120
at least to this topic came
mostly from human rights

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.990
organizations.

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.450
There was this very
important report

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:53.710
from Amnesty International,
and in 2011 it

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:55.900
called deadly delivery,
the maternal health

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.270
crisis in the US,
and from journalists,

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:02.920
and you showed that clip from
Nina Martin and ProPublica

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:04.120
and NPR.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.700
But now more
academics, obviously

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:09.520
professional associations,
the CDC and so many

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.260
others are doing more studies
and publishing more papers,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.070
academic papers on this issue
trying to understand what's

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.230
behind the numbers
and trying to come up

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:25.950
with solutions for the crisis
that we are now facing.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:30.150
So the drivers, as Wanda
already pointed out,

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:33.100
include lack of
access, poor quality,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:38.140
and in fact a basic societal
undervaluing of women of color

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.780
that we are also trying
to understand better

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.860
the reasons for everything
that comes with it.

00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.340
So the US I think can
learn from other countries.

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:52.240
We've been quite successful in
making maternal mortality come

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.170
down in many other places.

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.850
So I look forward to maybe
giving some examples later

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:57.350
about that.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:58.840
TINA MARTIN: Excellent.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.730
Haywood, during your
time as president

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:03.940
of ACOG you advocated
for policy change that

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.860
can improve the state
of maternity care

00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.270
in the United States.

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.570
Tell us a little bit
more about that work.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.160
And listening to you
earlier, we talked

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:15.470
about social determinants
of health and hearing Ana

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:20.470
saying undervaluing women of
color or patients of color.

00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:23.860
So what is your
perspective on that?

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.690
HAYWOOD BROWN:
Well, at ACOG we've

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.450
been focused on
maternal mortality

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:32.920
and near misses for
many years recognizing

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.730
the causes for maternal death,
but also recognizing the risk

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.990
factors for maternal
morbidity, maternal death.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.220
And let me say from the outset,
for every maternal death there

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:45.220
are about 60 near misses.

00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:48.640
And those near misses include
things like hemorrhage

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.040
that didn't lead to
death, heart failure

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.135
didn't need to death,
a blood clot that

00:12:53.135 --> 00:12:54.760
didn't lead to death,
an infection that

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.060
didn't lead to death.

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:58.120
And so by understanding
these type of things

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.350
it's been very,
very helpful for us.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:03.000
And we've looked at this
over the course of years.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.980
So one of the things
that I focused on

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.220
over the past couple of
years is to really push

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:13.720
for maternal mortality reviews,
and we spent a lot of time

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.410
on Capitol Hill, and as
Dr. Barfield has indicated

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.160
we did get legislation passed
this year called the Preventing

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.340
Maternal Death Act and
Maternal Health Accountability

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:26.390
Act that was signed into law.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.870
And the idea was
that every state

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.510
would have a maternal mortality
review so we could better

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:36.220
understand the causes of
pregnancy related death.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.160
There was going to be
some financial support

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.610
for the infrastructure
for states who did not

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.610
have a mature review
program, and also

00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:47.500
for those states
who had one to try

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.060
to strengthen those program.

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.168
The other things that
we did were focus on

00:13:52.168 --> 00:13:54.460
levels of care, which Susan
will talk a little bit more

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:57.610
about, recognizing
the fact that there

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.170
are things that we could do.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:01.385
There were interventions
that we should have.

00:14:01.385 --> 00:14:03.010
And I will talk a
little bit about this

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:06.310
later if I have time,
but access to care

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:10.020
is still a major issue
in the United States.

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.250
Many of us live in
rural communities

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.410
and we'll talk a little
bit about the fact

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:21.010
that access is a serious factor
for women to have to travel

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.260
to distances and so forth.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:26.440
And the other factor, of course,
is that fragmentation of care

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.320
where the provider and
the delivery facility

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.560
are very different.

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.440
And so those also impact issues.

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.818
And with that these
are the type of things

00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:38.110
that we've talked about this
year and we've emphasized.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:41.300
We've emphasized the
challenges of access.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.360
We've emphasized the importance
of doing the reviews.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.695
We've emphasized
levels of care where

00:14:47.695 --> 00:14:51.610
a person would communicate
from a rural community

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.880
to a more tertiary care center,
certain types of patients

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:58.630
who may be much more
appropriate to be transferred.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:02.050
An example would be a lady
with a placental abnormality

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:06.077
with a placenta previa which
is at high risk for hemorrhage.

00:15:06.077 --> 00:15:07.660
And even though they
may be able to do

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.700
a cesarean at that
facility, they

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.090
may not have the blood to
handle the volume of blood loss.

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:15.910
And so those are the kind
of challenges and things

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:20.290
that we focused on to
improve the quality of care

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.800
and improved outcomes
for all women.

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:28.730
Dr. Barfield also mentioned
the fact that as we do reviews,

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.060
we've clearly noticed
this increasing

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.110
trend over the last 20 years.

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:35.560
Part of that has been due
to better ascertainment,

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.510
but part of it is
also due to the fact

00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:42.310
that women are indeed dying more
often over the last 20 years,

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.050
particularly women of color.

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:45.610
TINA MARTIN: Thank you.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:47.670
We will definitely
delve more into that.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.460
Susan, let's talk
to you for a second.

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.400
You're an OBGYN and
you have delivered

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.930
more than 4,000 babies.

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:53.515
Is that true?

00:15:53.515 --> 00:15:54.640
SUSAN MANN: Probably 5,000.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.590
TINA MARTIN: More
than 5,000 babies?

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:57.950
Oh my goodness.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:58.450
All right.

00:15:58.450 --> 00:15:59.140
And counting.

00:15:59.140 --> 00:15:59.772
OK.

00:15:59.772 --> 00:16:02.230
So you know firsthand what
these mothers are going through.

00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:04.900
And you recently
published a study

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.610
co-authored by
Haywood and others

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:10.300
about how to make changes
quickly in hospital settings

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.340
to prevent maternal mortality.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.240
Talk about that.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.948
SUSAN MANN: Sure.

00:16:13.948 --> 00:16:17.690
Thank you very much and thank
you forum for inviting me.

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.050
I have been practicing
very comfortably here

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:23.500
at Beth Israel in Boston
for the past 30 years.

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:29.120
And I've had the honor of seeing
a lot of changes over time.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.980
Around the early 2000s
the Department of Defense

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.930
came to Beth Israel
and said we want

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:37.750
to work with you to
start studying teamwork

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:40.210
and communication
among disciplines

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.780
and see if we can impart some
of the knowledge we've gained

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.010
from the military to medicine.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.120
And so that really became
a strong interest of mine,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.500
and we started foundational work
that really changed how people

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.830
practice and communicate in
hospitals across the United

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:59.530
States and outside
the United States.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:04.180
And when the increase
in maternal mortalities

00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:06.250
continued to go up
during this period,

00:17:06.250 --> 00:17:09.430
I was a little bit baffled
and obviously quite concerned.

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.490
I was asked by a hospital
system in South Dakota

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:18.369
that I was doing work
for to come out and see

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:21.130
if I could help them improve
their communication with some

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.460
of their rural hospitals and
critical access hospitals.

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:27.280
And as I mentioned, it's
a real different world

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.600
out in rural health compared to
what I'd been living in Boston.

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.210
I joke that if I sneeze
there about four people

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:35.963
to hand me a Kleenex.

00:17:35.963 --> 00:17:38.380
If you're in a rural hospital
you're waiting for the truck

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.420
to come to deliver the Kleenex.

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:42.580
So it's quite a
different experience.

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:44.380
And so when I
said, well, tell me

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.980
about some of these hospitals
with a system of 17 hospitals.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:51.220
They said, well, some of
them are really quite small.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.765
And I said, how small are they?

00:17:52.765 --> 00:17:56.290
They said, well, some of
them do 50 deliveries a year.

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:57.190
And I said, wow.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.020
That's a delivery a week.

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:03.070
How can you be good at
doing a delivery a week?

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:06.730
And I said, well, obviously you
should close those hospitals.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.830
And they said, well,
Susan, we would,

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.430
but then a woman might need to
drive six hours to have a baby.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:16.625
I said you need to leave
those hospitals open

00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:18.270
and you need to
make them better.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:20.290
And she said, that's
why we called you.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:24.340
So being a good researcher
I called my friend Wanda

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.270
and I said, Wanda,
where are people dying?

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.540
Are they dying in these
small rural hospitals?

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.647
Are we able to get them to
academic medical centers?

00:18:31.647 --> 00:18:32.230
This was what?

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.740
Six, seven, eight years ago.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.180
And she said we just don't
have great data, because

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:41.050
at that point in time how we
were collecting data oftentimes

00:18:41.050 --> 00:18:43.750
would be a checkbox on
a death certificate.

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.520
We weren't always
linking it to births.

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:51.370
And then the address
also, you couldn't quite

00:18:51.370 --> 00:18:53.140
tell where they were dying.

00:18:53.140 --> 00:18:56.060
And she said, actually, Susan,
I really hate to tell you this,

00:18:56.060 --> 00:19:00.040
but I think quite a few occur
outside of the hospital.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:05.830
And so you look at opioid abuse
and domestic violence, suicide,

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:06.880
and all those issues.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.570
And I said, wow.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:08.930
Those are really big issues.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.350
I'm just a practicing
obstetrician gynecologist.

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:13.210
I don't know that
I can tackle that,

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:15.400
but I certainly can
look into what is it

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.480
that we do in our hospitals?

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.560
How can we be better
prepared and how do we

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.000
get all hospitals to do this?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.630
And so in a recent
article that I

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:29.320
wrote with Haywood and the
current president Lisa Allea

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.400
and Kim McKay who's my
colleague out in South Dakota,

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.730
we were really looking at how
do you introduce these concepts

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.320
to all hospitals?

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.300
And what we wanted
to focus on were

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.980
the top three preventable causes
of pregnancy related deaths.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:48.220
And that includes severe
hypertension and management

00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.400
even after they go home;
Postpartum hemorrhage

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.790
as we saw so many of those
women in that clip died from;

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.460
and then also
preventing blood clots.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:00.730
I'm sure you heard about Serena
Williams and the troubles

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:01.360
that she had.

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.980
So we really wanted to
focus on what can be done,

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:08.710
how to improve teamwork
and communication.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.370
And also these levels of care,
that Haywood was talking about.

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:15.520
If you identify somebody
that's at three C sections,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.710
and needs to have a
fourth, should she really

00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:21.090
be done in a hospital that
does one delivery a week?

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:23.720
She needs to be identified
and [? risked ?]

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.000
out to a higher level of care.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.160
Whether she'll go there
is a different topic,

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:30.620
because women make their
own choices in life.

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.920
But it should be up to us
still at least educator her,

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:36.290
and say, we have connections.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:37.790
We send our babies
out, when they're

00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.190
28 weeks, to these hospitals.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:42.440
We should have these kind
of connections for our moms,

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:43.578
as well.

00:20:43.578 --> 00:20:45.620
TINA MARTIN: We're going
to get into all of that.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.410
I just want to make sure that
we're connecting with Karen.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.245
Dr. Scott are you there?

00:20:50.245 --> 00:20:51.120
KAREN SCOTT: Yes, hi.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:51.570
TINA MARTIN: You can hear us.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.020
KAREN SCOTT: Good morning, Tina.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:52.510
TINA MARTIN: Excellent.

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.390
KAREN SCOTT: Good
morning, panel.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:54.473
TINA MARTIN: Good morning.

00:20:54.473 --> 00:20:55.640
Good morning.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.060
In your role at the California
Birth Equity Collaborative

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.200
and the California Maternal
Quality Care Collaborative,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.460
you've really taken direct
aim at some of the disparities

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.580
that we've talked about.

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.545
So tell us a little
bit about your work.

00:21:10.545 --> 00:21:11.420
KAREN SCOTT: Yes, hi.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:12.360
Thank you so much.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.350
So the California Maternal
Quality Care Collaborative,

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:20.090
CMQCC, is a multi-stakeholder
organization

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:22.280
working closely with state
and national partners

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:25.470
to reduce preventable causes
of maternal mortality,

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.260
maternal morbidity, and racial
disparities in California.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:33.350
CMQCC uses research, QI
toolkits, statewide outreach

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.140
collaboratives, and its
innovative maternal data center

00:21:36.140 --> 00:21:39.090
to improve health outcomes
for mothers and infants.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:43.220
CMQCC was found in 2006 at
Stanford University School

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:45.920
of Medicine, together with
the state of California,

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.670
in response to rising maternal
mortality and morbidity rates.

00:21:49.670 --> 00:21:52.070
Since CMQCC's
inception, California

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:56.900
has seen a 55% decline in
our maternal mortality,

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:01.280
between 2006 and
2013, at this time,

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.020
where the national
maternal mortality

00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:04.850
rate continued to rise.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:07.490
Examples of our impact
include prevention

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:12.650
of 120,000 early births
from 2009 to 2014,

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:17.210
with an increase of 8% of
births making its full term.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:21.530
A reduction of maternal
morbidity by about 21%

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:26.150
between 2014 and '16,
among the 126 hospitals

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:29.420
participating in our projects
to reduce maternal hemorrhage

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.870
and preeclampsia, yet
there is more to our story.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:37.760
Since 1999, the data reporting
around maternal mortality

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.820
in California show a
persistent three to four-fold

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.310
gap between black
mothers and mothers

00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:45.110
from all other racial groups.

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:47.030
Maternal mortality
rates nearly doubled

00:22:47.030 --> 00:22:52.910
for all racial ethnic groups
between, again, 1999 and 2006.

00:22:52.910 --> 00:22:58.710
In response, the CMQCC's founded
[INAUDIBLE] 2010 [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:01.280
declined, showing a
decline in reduction

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.150
of maternal mortality.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.690
But the expectation was
that widespread adoption

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:08.270
of clinical safety
bundles would reduce

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:10.100
this gap in the number
of maternal deaths

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.640
among black women.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.150
However, the difference in
outcomes for black mothers,

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:17.420
compared with all other
racial groups, has persisted.

00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:20.600
Further analysis revealed
that clinical safety bundles

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.820
and social support
interventions,

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.120
done in isolation, without
an integrated approach,

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.580
did not produce the
desired outcomes.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.470
So CMQCC has now started
initiative with the California

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:35.480
Birth Equity Collaborative.

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.920
It really presents
an opportunity

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.660
to develop these QI toolkits
within a hospital setting,

00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:46.430
again, to properly evaluate and
transform birth culture, care,

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:49.640
experiences, and outcomes
through the integration

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:52.790
of clinical and
sociocultural intervention

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.070
and community-hospital
partnership.

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.280
So our data show that, even in
the absence of risk factors,

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.880
such as age over 35 years,
lack of health insurance,

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:05.120
inadequate or no [INAUDIBLE],,
and less than a high school

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.540
education, our US
health system continues

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.120
to not be able to protect our
black mothers and [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.240
people from experiencing
higher numbers of deaths

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.430
and life-threatening
complications during pregnancy

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:17.660
and childbirth.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.670
Again, increasing
evidence is pointing

00:24:19.670 --> 00:24:24.920
to racism within and across
multiple levels, and not race,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.680
as a key cause of these
birth disparities.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.800
Again, data also show
variations in the quality

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.970
of care and outcomes between
and within [? racial groups ?]

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:38.040
across hospitals in California,
highlighting [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.350
opportunities for advancing
equity, as well as [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.110
racism and quality improvement.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.590
So with our California Birth
Equity Collaborative pilot,

00:24:48.590 --> 00:24:51.410
CMQCC aims to
transform birth culture

00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:56.440
and care for, by, and with black
mothers and [INAUDIBLE] people

00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.470
in partnership with [INAUDIBLE]
community-based organizations,

00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.630
with our participating
hospitals,

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.140
with local advisor groups being
formed back into the hospitals.

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.700
As well as state and
national black women

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:11.750
scholars serving as
pilot mentors, who

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.720
represent various disciplines,
specifically public health

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.575
and social sciences.

00:25:16.575 --> 00:25:17.950
TINA MARTIN: Thank
you very much.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:20.033
Dr. Scott, I'm just going
to throw it back to you.

00:25:20.033 --> 00:25:22.320
When you said racism
across all levels,

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.390
how does that translate?

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:27.480
How does that play out for
a mother who has given birth

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:29.670
or is giving birth, and
is looking for care?

00:25:29.670 --> 00:25:31.620
How does that play out?

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.240
KAREN SCOTT: So
what we are seeing

00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.120
is that what is it
about the system?

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.350
We're looking at
systems accountability.

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:41.490
What is it about the system
that allows variation

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:45.150
in the responsiveness
to a black mother who's

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:48.980
reporting symptoms, that are
being dismissed, discounted,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.080
neglected?

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:51.250
There's a delay.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.940
And why are we seeing
variation in the response, when

00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:58.470
we have science technology that
shows we're able to prevent

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.420
60% of these causes?

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.720
So we're wondering, what
is it about that response

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.776
to black mothers, to
[INAUDIBLE] people

00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:09.540
that's causing these
variations with their systems?

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.970
Where black people are
coming to the hospitals.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.970
They're educated, they have
health insurance in California.

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.330
All of these factors that,
normally, are shown to protect

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.260
are not doing that.

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:23.590
So how [? we ?] look at the
ways in which interactions,

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:27.000
communication, the counseling,
and the decision-making

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.150
as being inclusive
of black mothers,

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:33.480
and their birthing support
systems, and people,

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:36.420
in how health care
is being delivered.

00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:38.670
TINA MARTIN: And Susan, I
hear you listening intently.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.660
What is your response to
what Dr. Scott's saying?

00:26:40.660 --> 00:26:41.368
SUSAN MANN: Sure.

00:26:41.368 --> 00:26:47.670
So about 2012, the
National Partnership

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:52.440
for Maternal Safety and
ACOG, and 30 organizations

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.230
came together to try
and address this issue.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.890
And they have cranked out
about 10 bundles of care.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.600
Recommendations for
how do you treat

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:05.190
hemorrhage, how do you treat
postpartum hypertension.

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:10.680
And about a year ago-- or
maybe this past summer--

00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.600
there was an article
in the USA Today

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.370
that said hospitals know what
to do, why aren't they doing it?

00:27:17.370 --> 00:27:22.680
And that really shook both
Dr. Haywood and I to the core.

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.290
And we said, OK, we're
putting out this material.

00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:26.940
We're educating people.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.760
What is the problem with
basic culture change?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.280
And that is really
something that, I think,

00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:33.460
needs to be looked at.

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:36.000
And all hospitals need
to be held accountable

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.770
for the following four things.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.410
And it needs to be
from the C-suite

00:27:40.410 --> 00:27:42.420
all the way down to
frontline caregivers.

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:45.810
If the C-suite isn't
providing training and support

00:27:45.810 --> 00:27:47.820
for the individuals
at the bedside,

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.840
this just isn't going to happen.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.530
And the four things
that we really looked at

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.710
were the [INAUDIBLE]
bundles, making sure

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.900
that you take what
was put out there

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.600
for maybe an academic
medical center,

00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.700
but you able to apply it to
a smaller rural hospital.

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.850
So if a patient
begins to bleed, what

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.420
are the medications that are
available in a moment's notice?

00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.600
And not you need some pharmacies
to release medication,

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.550
and they're not even
in the hospital.

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.340
How do you manage, if there
isn't a laboratory person

00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:19.290
to tell you what
the blood count is?

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:21.740
You need to quantify
that blood loss.

00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:24.750
And we have tools to
do it, it's just people

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.880
need to be trained on this.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:32.760
Finally, a secondary is the team
training and the communication.

00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:37.140
The obstetricians, nurse
midwives, family medicine docs,

00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.280
whoever is the provider
in the community,

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.250
providing care to
these women, need

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:44.130
to come together with
nursing and anesthesia,

00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:46.320
and all the hospitals
to understand

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.160
what are the demands on
the resources for that day.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.520
And you can't go and start an
elective c-section, if somebody

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:55.180
else is having a hemorrhage.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.600
The time of practicing
in individual silos

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.770
is really over.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:00.960
And our care
absolutely needs to be

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.340
coordinated across the board.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.910
And then third, we need to
take a page from the pilots.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.040
We need to simulate
these emergencies.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.220
You never know where things
are in your department,

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:12.220
until you need it.

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:14.415
And sometimes, oh, we
took that medicine out

00:29:14.415 --> 00:29:15.660
of the [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.710
What do you mean I can't get
magnesium right at this moment,

00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.850
and it's going to be
another 15 or 20 minutes?

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.900
You only find out things
like that if you try it

00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:27.240
and practice it,
and people know what

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.810
their roles are on the team,
when these emergencies arise.

00:29:30.810 --> 00:29:34.230
So we also recommend that
people have briefings.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.380
We come together, as a team,
before you start a c-section,

00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:40.740
so you understand what are
the risks for that patient.

00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:43.530
And you give the patient a
voice in the process, as well,

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.690
to talk about what
are her concerns.

00:29:45.690 --> 00:29:48.480
And maybe she shares
with you, my mother

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:51.900
had a pulmonary embolism
after she had my brother.

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.790
I forgot to mention
that to someone.

00:29:53.790 --> 00:29:54.940
Is that important?

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.430
You're like, yes, that's
actually quite important.

00:29:57.430 --> 00:29:58.230
Thank you.

00:29:58.230 --> 00:30:01.470
So making sure that the patient
has a voice in this process

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:03.700
is very important, as well.

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.460
And then finally, what we talked
about, the levels of care,

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:11.250
and making sure the
patients are at least

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.140
offered to deliver
at a site that

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.850
makes the most sense for them.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.230
Nobody wants to travel,
if they don't have to.

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:21.540
But boy, every week I read about
some hospital that's closing.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:24.330
And I know Haywood's going
to talk about these health

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:24.860
deserts.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.530
And it's just such a concern.

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:30.437
TINA MARTIN: And so talk
about the health deserts.

00:30:30.437 --> 00:30:31.770
HAYWOOD BROWN: Thank you, Susan.

00:30:31.770 --> 00:30:32.280
SUSAN MANN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.820
TINA MARTIN: Thank you, Susan.

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.630
She should be paid extra,
for doing my job for me.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:39.630
HAYWOOD BROWN: We've
already alluded to the fact

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:44.070
that maternity care is very
fragmented in this country.

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:46.355
You think about whether
you're in a city like Boston,

00:30:46.355 --> 00:30:47.730
there are actually
health deserts

00:30:47.730 --> 00:30:50.220
here for obstetric
care, just like they

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:53.730
are in rural North Carolina, or
rural Florida, where I'm from.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:57.540
Susan alluded to the fact
that 50% of all deliveries

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:03.020
occur in hospitals with three
or less deliveries a day.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.370
50% of all counties
in the United States

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:09.180
do not have a practicing
OBGYN and a midwife.

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.710
So when you think
about that, you

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:15.180
think about the whole access
issue and availability issue.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.960
That's a real challenge.

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.510
And so you have to
make sure that you

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.050
have ways of delivering the
same quality to individuals,

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:26.790
whether they're in rural
Montana or rural South Dakota,

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:29.460
as they are in urban Boston.

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:33.090
And those are
really keys to this.

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:37.050
And access to care and
affordability of care--

00:31:37.050 --> 00:31:42.210
I'll talk a little bit about
funding and support for women

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.650
and having those dollars
available to go to the doctor.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:50.790
Many women who, for instance,
don't have insurance,

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:55.260
may delay their prenatal care
until they can get on Medicaid,

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.820
or until they find the
insurance to do that.

00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:00.630
So the financial barriers
are still there in a country

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.440
as rich as ours.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:05.498
And so we really have to
focus in on this every day.

00:32:05.498 --> 00:32:07.290
And I'll talk a little
bit more about that,

00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:08.590
when we talk about--

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.700
but those are what we refer
to as maternity deserts.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.330
Deserts by the aspect
of where you live,

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:18.070
deserts by the aspect
of not having providers,

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:19.670
and so forth, and so on.

00:32:19.670 --> 00:32:21.420
And I want to just
give an example of what

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.710
Susan may be referring to.

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.910
So imagine that you are a woman
and you delivered, and you

00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:27.990
had a near miss.

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:30.840
You lost a lot of blood.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.010
You lost so much blood
that you are now weak.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.060
And you go home with your
baby, and everything's--

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.370
imagine, though, living in an
area where you really can't get

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:43.560
back for your postpartum visit.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.700
Then imagine not having
contraception available to you

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:49.640
for pregnancy spacing.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.020
And so you come into
your next pregnancy.

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.030
There you are,
with a blood count

00:32:54.030 --> 00:32:56.438
that's already half
of what it should be.

00:32:56.438 --> 00:32:58.980
You already have another risk
factor for having a hemorrhage,

00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:01.090
because you've had a hemorrhage.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:03.690
And so when we
talk about reviews,

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:07.920
understanding the system issues,
where that woman could have

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:11.370
actually had an opportunity
to build a blood count up,

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.950
or recognizing the fact that,
if she has another hemorrhage,

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:15.810
she could lose all
her blood volume,

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.520
and be at risk for mortality.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.940
So those are the type of things,
that Wanda will share with you,

00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:23.130
that we learned from reviews.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:26.130
And that's really key to
understanding what those risk

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:28.620
factors might be
for that woman who

00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:30.540
is in a vulnerable situation.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.700
TINA MARTIN: So Wanda,
let's talk about that.

00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:35.160
This data collection,
how important is it?

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.560
WANDA BARFIELD: So maternal
mortality review committees

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:41.010
are really our opportunity
to truly understand

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:43.540
what is going on around the
circumstance of a woman's

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.040
death.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.280
I sort of think of,
in infectious disease,

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.800
we talk about how we're
going to investigate

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.070
sources of infection.

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:55.990
But for maternal mortality, I
think of it more like a CSI.

00:33:55.990 --> 00:33:58.830
There's a case that
needs to be reviewed,

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:02.340
and we really need to understand
the underlying causes related

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.480
to that death.

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:06.240
And it requires a
multidisciplinary team

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:09.540
that's not just clinical,
but also the issues related

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.659
to social factors, as well,
that are very important.

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:15.659
Like why wasn't it a
woman able to come back?

00:34:15.659 --> 00:34:18.060
There are social
circumstances, whether it's

00:34:18.060 --> 00:34:21.449
issues of transportation
or family circumstances

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:23.100
that may not allow that.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.050
We need to better
understand other factors,

00:34:25.050 --> 00:34:27.300
such as mental health,
and how that might also

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:29.409
contribute to a woman's death.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:30.929
So these review
committees really

00:34:30.929 --> 00:34:34.900
have an opportunity to really
not only uncover those causes--

00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:38.750
these are things that we cannot
get out of a death certificate.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:41.850
Yet there is also an opportunity
for the review committees

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:45.400
to then think about ways
to prevent future deaths.

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:47.340
And this is a really
important aspect.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.639
And in combination with the
recommendations that they

00:34:50.639 --> 00:34:53.460
can make to facilities,
whether it's safety bundles,

00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.350
or in larger areas
like California--

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:57.960
which has really led
the way, in terms

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:00.860
of thinking about perinatal
quality collaboratives--

00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:04.230
there are so many states now
that are working together

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.570
to try to think about
these systematic issues,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.270
and ways that they
can improve health.

00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:12.660
So I think this is a
really important issue.

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.330
And back to what Karen
was saying about some

00:35:15.330 --> 00:35:18.170
of the challenges, with
regard to disparities,

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:21.770
I think we need to understand
that there are systems

00:35:21.770 --> 00:35:24.470
in place, or not in
place, that really affect

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:26.390
the aspects of women's health.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.870
We know that there
are facilities

00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:32.060
that African-American
women may go to,

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.510
that have a lower quality
of care, systematically.

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.250
And we really have
an opportunity

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:41.100
to try to think about how we
can improve that access to care,

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.410
as well as the quality of care.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:46.910
And it's not just having those
particular interventions,

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:48.920
but what are those
process measures that

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.970
make those interventions
happen in a rapid manner,

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.912
and an appropriate
manner every time?

00:35:54.912 --> 00:35:56.870
TINA MARTIN: And Ana,
you were saying something

00:35:56.870 --> 00:36:00.800
before we came in here about,
from your global perspective,

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.012
the experience of care.

00:36:02.012 --> 00:36:02.720
ANA LANGER: Yeah.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.100
TINA MARTIN: Talk a
little bit about that.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:05.017
ANA LANGER: Thank you.

00:36:05.017 --> 00:36:06.510
Thank you for that question.

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:13.610
In fact, you asked the question
about how racism plays out.

00:36:13.610 --> 00:36:15.920
And one of the ways
I think it plays out

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.640
is through disrespectful
and abusive treatment

00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.840
during maybe pregnancy, but most
importantly, during childbirth.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:26.150
And this is an area
that we, globally,

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.860
have been studying
quite extensively.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.070
In fact, we've documented
that everywhere--

00:36:33.070 --> 00:36:35.900
it could happen to any
woman, but it mostly

00:36:35.900 --> 00:36:39.330
happens to women who are
vulnerable because of race,

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:42.860
ethnicity, age,
socioeconomic status--

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:45.500
women are very poorly treated.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:49.430
In fact, they are subjected
to completely unacceptable

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:50.940
behaviors.

00:36:50.940 --> 00:36:55.220
Sometimes they are slapped, they
are spoken to in a very rude

00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:58.400
way, they are retained
in facilities--

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.880
sometimes because
they cannot pay.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.800
Well, obviously, their informed
consent is not asked for.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.020
So there are so many ways
women are poorly treated.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.930
And that's the
experience of care.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:14.870
So we've been talking mostly
about clinical care, which

00:37:14.870 --> 00:37:16.650
is obviously essential.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:21.350
But the way women experience
their childbirth is also

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:22.370
critical.

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.410
If their symptoms
are dismissed--

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.990
as some of my colleagues
here were saying-- obviously,

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.060
there are immediate
consequences.

00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:32.690
But even when that's
not the situation, when

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.030
women are poorly
treated, they will

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:38.050
mistrust the medical
system, the health system.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:40.880
And they may not come back,
when they have another pregnancy

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.650
and when they have
a complication.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.740
And probably they will spread
the word in their communities

00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:49.340
that that's a facility or
a place where you are not

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:52.160
treated as you deserve.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.190
So globally, we've
measured the prevalence

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:58.490
of disrespect and abuse,
and it's very common.

00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:01.130
We've also identified
some of the reasons

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:04.220
behind it, particularly
among the health workforce.

00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.440
Obviously, most people
in the health workforce

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.170
are well-intentioned.

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:12.290
They studied, and they
practice their careers,

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.130
because they want
to help others.

00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:17.750
But sometimes, they are
disrespected themselves.

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:20.660
They work in very
poor conditions

00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:25.550
that don't allow them to provide
the care a woman deserve.

00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:27.170
Of course, disrespect
and abuse is

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:30.680
unacceptable under any
circumstance, but still.

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.690
And we've also tested
some interventions

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.390
that I think would be
helpful here in the US,

00:38:35.390 --> 00:38:37.070
to address some of those issues.

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.500
TINA MARTIN: Like--

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:42.890
ANA LANGER: For instance, a
way to increase accountability.

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:48.590
Facilities need to be
prepared to answer questions

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.310
from their users about why
some things that are happening.

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.100
Women need to be informed
about what's going to happen,

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.640
when they go to the
facility for delivery.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:01.010
Very often, women come
from other places, never

00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:03.830
have been in that place,
and they have no idea

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:05.330
what's going to happen to them.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:08.180
And that's very, very stressful.

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.420
Sometimes women with a lower
level of education, and maybe

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.850
with some language
barriers, will not

00:39:13.850 --> 00:39:16.700
understand what's
going on in the labrum.

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.430
So having someone with
them, a companion--

00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:23.090
either a companion like a
doula or maybe a relative--

00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:25.010
will make the
experience stressful,

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:27.950
and will it provide a
link between the woman

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:29.760
and the health care providers.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.490
So all those
interventions have been

00:39:31.490 --> 00:39:33.680
tested, in terms of
their effectiveness,

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.750
their feasibility,
and acceptability.

00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:37.820
They will probably
have to be adopted,

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.490
those that are new here.

00:39:40.490 --> 00:39:46.130
But I think they are all good
ideas, that we already know

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.673
work, at least to some extent.

00:39:48.673 --> 00:39:50.840
TINA MARTIN: And Karen, I
see you nodding your head,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:54.630
when you were listening
to what Ana was saying.

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.150
What do you think
about the ideas

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.830
that she just mentioned,
in terms of care?

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:01.350
KAREN SCOTT: So I agree.

00:40:01.350 --> 00:40:03.950
I think there's a lot that is
happening in the International

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:06.350
space, around respectful
and dignified care,

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:11.240
that our nation is struggling
with that language.

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.400
So in order to
transform culture,

00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:15.450
it must happen with language.

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:19.670
So how do we acknowledge
what nations around

00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:22.970
the [INAUDIBLE] world around
really holding to the fact

00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:25.640
that we're experiencing
obstetric mistreatment

00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:26.840
or [? obstetric ?] violence.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:30.480
And those are words that
our systems, I would say,

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:33.710
are afraid to call
out and to really

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:37.160
speak very truthfully, in a very
transparent and meaningful way,

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.470
to our communities
who are experiencing

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:42.110
forms of structural violence.

00:40:42.110 --> 00:40:47.780
And the ways in which their
bodies are [INAUDIBLE] value

00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.880
really--

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.910
approaching black [? birthing ?]
people in a deficit model,

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:55.550
in a mother [? framed ?] or
[? individual framed ?] way.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:59.300
So how do we
acknowledge and amplify

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.120
a community-informed
knowledge base

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:04.190
of respectful and
dignified care?

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.980
And how, with [? a ?]
shared language and meaning,

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.900
then really create the
spaces for black mothers

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:13.490
[? and birthing ?] people
to help us define what

00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:17.780
a patient-reported metric of
respect and dignity would look

00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:21.200
like in the hospital setting,
so that we could build trusting

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.010
relationships?

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:27.050
So that could really have active
and reflective and responsive

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:29.840
listening, so that we
could also have really

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:33.500
patient-centered
connections and counseling,

00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:36.920
that's not just based
on risk stratification.

00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.740
What if we were to do
asset amplification?

00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:43.280
We continue to
pathologize birth, yet

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:45.720
it can be difficult
and dangerous,

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.410
but if that's the narrative
that we are perpetuating,

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:52.250
how can people feel
dignified while giving birth?

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.880
And when birth can be a
ritualistic or traditional rite

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.100
of passage for some
of our communities.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.440
What we're doing,
as I'm speaking of,

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:07.100
is having this patient-reported
experience-- not outcome,

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.690
but experience metric.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:12.890
It can allow us to build
systems, accountability

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.920
structures of processes
and mechanisms that really

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.040
stellar black women,
black working people,

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.130
and, again, how care
can be delivered

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:23.630
to them that honors them.

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.240
What it looked like if
the outcome-- not just

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:29.600
is decreasing death,
or complications--

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:32.650
but what if the outcome
is the experience?

00:42:32.650 --> 00:42:34.520
And so we're able
to really transform

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.638
the culture within
a hospital setting.

00:42:36.638 --> 00:42:38.055
Lest we think about
the experience

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:40.100
that someone is having,
that despite having

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.130
a difficult birth or
an unexpected outcome,

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:46.070
that the experience is
still being dignified.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:49.790
Having some sense of autonomy
in their birthing options.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:53.250
That can really shift
the ways in which people

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:55.550
in our country experience
birth, particularly

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.257
people sitting at
the margins, I'm

00:42:57.257 --> 00:42:59.090
like black mothers and
black working people,

00:42:59.090 --> 00:43:02.205
and their support
partners and families.

00:43:02.205 --> 00:43:03.330
TINA MARTIN: you very much.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:04.830
We're going to go
to one more theme,

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.663
and then we're going
to take some questions,

00:43:06.663 --> 00:43:08.840
because we have many people
who have many questions.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.340
All right.

00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:11.790
This theme, managing the
risks of chronic disease,

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:13.820
including heart
disease, pregnancy

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:15.320
in the postpartum period.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:17.280
Susan, I'll shoot
that out to you first.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:17.988
SUSAN MANN: Sure.

00:43:17.988 --> 00:43:20.440
So we talked a little
bit about risks.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.010
Identification is
very important.

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:25.460
One of the other things, that
Haywood and I have published

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:28.310
on, is a potential
use of telehealth

00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:32.240
for patients that have some
chronic diseases, for diabetes.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.880
So that these women don't
have to travel hours

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:37.430
to more academic
medical centers.

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:39.470
Can't that data be transmitted?

00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:43.190
Can't patients have
face-to-face telehealth visits?

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:48.470
So looking at what is it that we
can do to identify these health

00:43:48.470 --> 00:43:51.920
risks, and then to make it
more patient-friendly and

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:54.670
user-friendly, and
this difficult time.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:55.917
TINA MARTIN: Haywood?

00:43:55.917 --> 00:43:56.750
HAYWOOD BROWN: Yeah.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:44:00.110
I think we also have to remind
ourselves that about 60%

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.530
of all maternal deaths
occur postpartum.

00:44:02.530 --> 00:44:05.020
And about a decade
ago, I really changed

00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:06.770
the whole structural
postpartum follow-up.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:10.040
And it was my theme during my
presidency where we actually

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.280
started seeing women a lot
earlier in their postpartum

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.270
care.

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:17.810
For instance, patients who
really had major complications

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:19.640
being seen in two weeks.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.310
The idea is to screen them
for postpartum depression.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:25.495
If the patient has had
a major complications,

00:44:25.495 --> 00:44:27.620
really counsel them, again,
about recurrence risks,

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:29.100
and things like that.

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:32.030
But we also know that, by doing
earlier postpartum visits,

00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:34.920
you decrease the rate of
readmissions and death,

00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:37.160
particularly for things
like blood clots, which

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.470
are more likely to occur
in the postpartum period.

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.690
Heart failure, which is
most likely to present.

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:44.450
And keep in mind that now,
cardiovascular disease

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.240
is one of the leading causes
for maternal mortality.

00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:49.310
And many of these
women were present late

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:51.570
in the pregnancy,
or early postpartum.

00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:53.780
And so change in those
paradigms and getting people

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.660
to think about that has been
extremely, extremely important.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:01.340
We know if you deliver from a
rural community, your chance

00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.210
of readmission or
complications and mortality

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:06.920
are a lot higher
than if you delivered

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:08.970
in an urban community.

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:10.640
So those are the type of things.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:18.740
And we're focus more on policies
that would actually cover

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:20.308
at least 12 weeks postpartum.

00:45:20.308 --> 00:45:22.850
And that's the work that we're
doing with Medicaid right now,

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.040
to focus in on that.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:26.930
But earlier follow-up,
follow and guidelines--

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:29.920
particularly for hypertension--
looking for heart failure,

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.598
and all those type of things
are very, very important.

00:45:32.598 --> 00:45:34.640
TINA MARTIN: And And,
before we get to questions,

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.660
community partnerships.

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:37.370
Did you want to talk
about that a little bit?

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:38.910
ANA LANGER: Yes,
I would love to.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.880
In fact, in public health,
and in medicine too,

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:44.400
we work too much in silos.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.900
And we need to break
those artificial silos,

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.430
and in the case
of women's health,

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:51.810
we need to take a
life course approach.

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:54.950
In fact, what happens to a woman
during pregnancy, delivery,

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:58.940
and the six weeks postpartum--
or even 12 weeks postpartum--

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:03.230
is a result of what has
happened to those women earlier.

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:05.090
Maybe starting in
adolescence, or maybe

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:07.130
even when they were children.

00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:09.890
And the consequences
of what happens

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.020
during the maternal
health period

00:46:12.020 --> 00:46:17.000
will happen, or will be evident
and visible later in life,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:17.540
as well.

00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.390
We know how much the
risk of type 2 diabetes

00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:24.110
increases among women who
had gestational diabetes,

00:46:24.110 --> 00:46:28.310
or a hypertension among
women who had pre-eclampsia.

00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:31.610
So we need to take
that approach.

00:46:31.610 --> 00:46:35.180
And in fact, I wanted
to quickly mention

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.970
that we are now
starting a project here,

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:42.230
in our own backyard, in Boston,
in collaboration with Ariadne

00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:45.080
Labs, and with the generous
support of the Boston

00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:49.010
Foundation, to look at racial
and ethnic disparities--

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:52.460
but also immigration status
disparities-- among women

00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:55.790
during maternal health
care and one year later.

00:46:55.790 --> 00:47:00.410
Because we want to look at that
interface between what happens

00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:03.740
during the traditional
maternal health period,

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:10.132
and a what happens after
women have delivered.

00:47:10.132 --> 00:47:11.090
TINA MARTIN: Excellent.

00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:12.140
All right.

00:47:12.140 --> 00:47:14.360
Rafael Baez has a question.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.320
I'm going to allow anyone--

00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.040
including you, Karen-- to
answer these questions,

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.870
if you feel so inclined.

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:21.500
All right.

00:47:21.500 --> 00:47:22.980
Rafael has a two-part question.

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.670
The first part is how can local
government and state government

00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:29.180
help reduce maternal mortality?

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:31.730
WANDA BARFIELD: So I
think one major step

00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:33.785
is through maternal
mortality review committees.

00:47:33.785 --> 00:47:34.520
HAYWOOD BROWN: Absolutely.

00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.562
WANDA BARFIELD: And I
think that the time is now,

00:47:36.562 --> 00:47:38.200
in terms of that opportunity.

00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.310
So working with both clinical
care and public health,

00:47:43.310 --> 00:47:47.930
state health officials, leaders
of Schools of Public Health,

00:47:47.930 --> 00:47:50.690
leaders in state-based ACOG.

00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:53.360
We have a real opportunity
to really work together,

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.283
in terms of trying to reduce
the risk of maternal death.

00:47:57.283 --> 00:47:58.700
HAYWOOD BROWN: I
could add to that

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.850
by saying that
every state, almost,

00:48:01.850 --> 00:48:04.790
has a perinatal collaborative
that are working with our State

00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:06.110
Department of Health.

00:48:06.110 --> 00:48:08.727
And one of the ways that
you get reviews going

00:48:08.727 --> 00:48:11.310
is through your legislature, and
to your Department of Health.

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:13.160
And it really is a partnership.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.560
Getting that partnership
going, you really

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.800
want not government
interference,

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:21.080
but government help,
in order to make sure

00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:24.530
that they support these
initiatives that you're doing.

00:48:24.530 --> 00:48:25.972
And I think that's the key.

00:48:25.972 --> 00:48:26.930
TINA MARTIN: Excellent.

00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:27.220
All right.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.030
Curtis [? Older-- ?]
oh, I'm sorry, Karen.

00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:30.640
Did you want to say something?

00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.640
KAREN SCOTT: I do, I do.

00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:33.712
I want to add to
that, because I'm

00:48:33.712 --> 00:48:35.420
thinking about local
or state government.

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.390
I would say infrastructure.

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:41.300
Like funding the unsung
heroes, the unusual

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:43.310
suspects in black
maternal health

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:46.970
equity, which are out lactation
consultants and our doulas.

00:48:46.970 --> 00:48:50.420
And so they are cultural
brokers between hospitals

00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:55.315
and communities that usually
go unnoticed, and not valued.

00:48:55.315 --> 00:48:56.690
And so that is
what we are doing,

00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.880
is really strengthening
those cultural brokers

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.770
of bridges, who already have
the trust and the respect

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:05.000
of our communities.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.850
But they also sit in those
spaces within the hospital,

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:12.860
navigating these hierarchical
power differentials,

00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:16.140
and doing that as an advocate
on behalf of our communities.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.560
So I really think
we need to reinvest

00:49:18.560 --> 00:49:22.280
in lactation consultants and
doulas who are really sitting

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:25.100
in those spaces, that
can bridge hospitals

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:27.800
and communities to move towards
black maternal and health

00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:28.760
equity.

00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:29.180
TINA MARTIN: Excellent.

00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:29.720
Thank you.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.050
OK.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:31.700
Curtis [? Older. ?] I'm trying
to get as many questions

00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:32.660
as I can in here.

00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:34.370
Has anyone done a
study on the death rate

00:49:34.370 --> 00:49:37.160
for pregnancy and
childbirth for married women

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.450
versus unmarried women?

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:42.050
And if so, what do
those stats indicate?

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:45.290
HAYWOOD BROWN: I think those are
the things we find in reviews.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:49.820
And it's no question
that unmarried women,

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:54.350
unplanned pregnancies
have higher risk

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:57.720
for not only morbidity,
but potentially mortality.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.960
And I think those are the
things that we've learned.

00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:02.810
The other thing that
we have appreciated now

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:06.630
is that we have pregnancies
in women who are older.

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:09.380
And we recognize,
just from the data,

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:12.260
that pregnancies in women
who are in their late 40s

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:15.290
have a higher risk for
morbidity and mortality,

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:18.190
even though the woman may
appear to be quite healthy.

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:21.370
In one study, it was shown
that maybe as many as 20%

00:50:21.370 --> 00:50:23.920
of women who have
pregnancies over age 45,

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:27.830
particularly if they have twins,
have a cardiovascular event.

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:31.180
And so when we think about the
rise in cardiovascular disease

00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.330
as a cause of maternal
death, it really

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:36.070
plays into the role
of how important

00:50:36.070 --> 00:50:40.090
preconception counsel, if you
have an underlying condition,

00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:42.020
or if you have certain
types of things.

00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.587
So yes, that data is there.

00:50:43.587 --> 00:50:44.545
TINA MARTIN: Excellent.

00:50:44.545 --> 00:50:45.955
Anybody else want to comment?

00:50:45.955 --> 00:50:47.980
WANDA BARFIELD: Marital
status and education

00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:50.870
may be a proxy for
wealth and income.

00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:53.230
And we know still that
African-American women who

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.350
are well-educated still
have a higher risk of death

00:50:56.350 --> 00:50:58.977
than low-educated white women.

00:50:58.977 --> 00:51:00.810
HAYWOOD BROWN: And the
thing Wanda's saying,

00:51:00.810 --> 00:51:04.120
I've mentioned the
whole story of anemia.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.540
Poor women and women of color
are more likely to be anemic.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.600
And so anemia is a risk factor
for postpartum hemorrhage.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.960
But also, if you lose blood, you
are more likely a risk factor

00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:16.160
for higher morbidity
and mortality.

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:18.400
So irrespective
of socioeconomic,

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:22.090
sometimes, anemia can be a
factor that's easily corrected

00:51:22.090 --> 00:51:24.072
with just some iron pills.

00:51:24.072 --> 00:51:25.030
TINA MARTIN: Thank you.

00:51:25.030 --> 00:51:27.250
Karen, I hear your
microphone on.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:28.160
KAREN SCOTT: Yes.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.160
I just want to continue
to add, because I always

00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:34.300
want to critically challenge
these tropes and narratives

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.640
around the contributors
[? and ?] drivers

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.440
of severe maternal morbidity.

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.510
Because even with the
data that we found,

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:45.340
that even after controlling for
age, BMI, or obesity, as well

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.090
as comorbidities, those are
not the largest contributors

00:51:49.090 --> 00:51:50.560
to severe maternal morbidity.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:54.040
So again, it's pointing
back to not the individual

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.860
or the black body,
but what is happening

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.470
when that black body shows
up within the hospital

00:51:59.470 --> 00:52:02.680
setting that's impacting
their responsiveness.

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.270
We have these tools,
we have these policies,

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:06.680
we have these protocols.

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.180
But why are we not responding
to a particular group

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:13.810
in an effective, appropriate,
timely manner, as we

00:52:13.810 --> 00:52:16.242
do with other populations?

00:52:16.242 --> 00:52:17.200
TINA MARTIN: Thank you.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.860
And time is leaving us here.

00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:22.030
We're done at 1 o'clock.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:23.710
I just want to give
each of the speakers

00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.810
an opportunity to give us maybe
one or two takeaways from this.

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.170
Wanda, we'll start with you.

00:52:28.170 --> 00:52:31.090
WANDA BARFIELD: So I think that
there is a lot that we can do,

00:52:31.090 --> 00:52:33.610
but one area that's
really critical for states

00:52:33.610 --> 00:52:37.240
is to think about insuring
risk-appropriate care.

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.090
We need to standardize
and improve care

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:42.400
to ensure that all
women are delivering

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.370
at the right place,
and the right time,

00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:48.631
and the right hospital.

00:52:48.631 --> 00:52:50.940
TINA MARTIN: Ana.

00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:51.610
ANA LANGER: Yes.

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:56.170
I would like to emphasize that
the US is part of the globe.

00:52:56.170 --> 00:53:01.960
And that we should break
that silo, too, and think

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:05.020
about maternal health
for all women everywhere,

00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:09.640
women's health, if we
want to be more inclusive.

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:14.680
And so that's one key message
that I would like to a to share

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:15.700
with you.

00:53:15.700 --> 00:53:19.600
And another one, that comes
from low and middle income

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:21.790
countries, is that
many of those countries

00:53:21.790 --> 00:53:25.120
have made maternal health
care free and available

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.500
for all women.

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.650
And those countries are
much poorer than the US.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:32.470
So I think it's quite
appalling to think

00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:35.530
that so many women still face
financial barriers to have

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:38.570
access to quality care
in a timely fashion.

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:40.000
So what can I say?

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.140
I would encourage us all to
push so all women in the US

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:46.510
have free access to
maternal health care.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:47.730
TINA MARTIN: Thank you.

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:48.880
Haywood.

00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.560
HAYWOOD BROWN: We
have to re-educate

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.930
on the importance of
the postpartum visit,

00:53:52.930 --> 00:53:54.910
and postpartum follow-up,
and early postpartum

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:57.910
follow-up for all
women, irrespective

00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:59.080
of where they live.

00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.330
We know that women
who are poor are

00:54:01.330 --> 00:54:03.910
less likely to show up for
their postpartum visit,

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:05.890
mainly because of barriers.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:08.260
And we need to make sure
that that's emphasized,

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:10.570
at the time of discharge
from the hospital,

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:12.790
that the patient
understands the [INAUDIBLE],,

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:14.910
providers understand
the importance of it,

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:18.160
and systems understand the
importance of that visit.

00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.900
And we need to be
able to have coverage

00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.150
for women for an extended
postpartum period.

00:54:23.150 --> 00:54:25.210
It's not a one episode visit.

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:28.708
It really is seeing the patient,
when she needs to be seen.

00:54:28.708 --> 00:54:29.500
TINA MARTIN: Susan.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.000
SUSAN MANN: It's
always hard to go last.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.410
Everyone's been some fabulous
[? points ahead of you. ?]

00:54:32.410 --> 00:54:34.600
TINA MARTIN: No,
you're not last.

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:35.500
Karen's last.

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:36.610
SUSAN MANN: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:36.880
Sorry.

00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:37.963
I forgot about you, Karen.

00:54:37.963 --> 00:54:38.980
I apologize.

00:54:38.980 --> 00:54:42.160
You'll have a hard
time, I promise.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:47.200
However, I think really this
maternal mortality thing

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.000
is so multifactorial.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.190
And hospitals really
need to be held

00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:54.610
accountable for their
state of preparedness,

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:59.380
and their ability to respond
to emergencies, as they arise.

00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:06.360
Regardless of who the patient
is, what color she is,

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:08.020
where she gives birth.

00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.820
It needs to be,
across the board,

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:13.270
a level of accountability,
like I said, from the C-suite

00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:16.630
all the way down to the
front line caregivers.

00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:19.152
TINA MARTIN: Karen,
final thoughts?

00:55:19.152 --> 00:55:19.860
KAREN SCOTT: Two.

00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:24.210
So I really want to advocate and
hold, again, as we're saying,

00:55:24.210 --> 00:55:26.250
systems accountable for--

00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:29.550
I'm going to say-- the
cultural rigor, and humility

00:55:29.550 --> 00:55:33.030
and responsiveness, and
the scientific integrity

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:34.740
and validity of our work.

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:37.950
And also to dismantle the silos.

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:41.820
To invest in public
health and social sciences

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.880
as transdisciplinary
approaches that really censor
