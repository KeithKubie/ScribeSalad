hello
no matter the science guy I am a guy I'm

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900
no matter the science guy I am a guy I'm

a youtuber named Wesley and I I wanted

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660
a youtuber named Wesley and I I wanted
 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.980
a youtuber named Wesley and I I wanted
to ask you if since uh Carl Sagan was

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990
to ask you if since uh Carl Sagan was
 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.609
to ask you if since uh Carl Sagan was
your mentor if I'm not mistaken what is

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619
your mentor if I'm not mistaken what is
 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.320
