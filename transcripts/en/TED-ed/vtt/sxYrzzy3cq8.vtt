00:00:06.636 --> 00:00:09.077
Statistics are persuasive.

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:12.541
So much so that people, organizations,
and whole countries

00:00:12.541 --> 00:00:17.747
base some of their most important 
decisions on organized data.

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:19.484
But there's a problem with that.

00:00:19.484 --> 00:00:23.301
Any set of statistics might have something
lurking inside it,

00:00:23.301 --> 00:00:27.251
something that can turn the results
completely upside down.

00:00:27.251 --> 00:00:30.920
For example, imagine you need to choose
between two hospitals

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.737
for an elderly relative's surgery.

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:36.434
Out of each hospital's 
last 1000 patient's,

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:39.612
900 survived at Hospital A,

00:00:39.612 --> 00:00:43.021
while only 800 survived at Hospital B.

00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:46.170
So it looks like Hospital A 
is the better choice.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.843
But before you make your decision,

00:00:47.843 --> 00:00:51.411
remember that not all patients
arrive at the hospital

00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:53.811
with the same level of health.

00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:56.703
And if we divide each hospital's
last 1000 patients

00:00:56.703 --> 00:01:01.132
into those who arrived in good health
and those who arrived in poor health,

00:01:01.132 --> 00:01:03.772
the picture starts to look very different.

00:01:03.772 --> 00:01:07.849
Hospital A had only 100 patients
who arrived in poor health,

00:01:07.849 --> 00:01:10.325
of which 30 survived.

00:01:10.325 --> 00:01:14.852
But Hospital B had 400,
and they were able to save 210.

00:01:14.852 --> 00:01:17.169
So Hospital B is the better choice

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:20.741
for patients who arrive 
at hospital in poor health,

00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:24.526
with a survival rate of 52.5%.

00:01:24.526 --> 00:01:28.445
And what if your relative's health
is good when she arrives at the hospital?

00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:32.271
Strangely enough, Hospital B is still
the better choice,

00:01:32.271 --> 00:01:35.676
with a survival rate of over 98%.

00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:38.733
So how can Hospital A have a better
overall survival rate

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:44.830
if Hospital B has better survival rates
for patients in each of the two groups?

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.589
What we've stumbled upon is a case
of Simpson's paradox,

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:51.899
where the same set of data can appear
to show opposite trends

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.664
depending on how it's grouped.

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:58.744
This often occurs when aggregated data
hides a conditional variable,

00:01:58.744 --> 00:02:01.377
sometimes known as a lurking variable,

00:02:01.377 --> 00:02:06.584
which is a hidden additional factor
that significantly influences results.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:10.023
Here, the hidden factor is the relative
proportion of patients

00:02:10.023 --> 00:02:13.264
who arrive in good or poor health.

00:02:13.264 --> 00:02:16.544
Simpson's paradox isn't just
a hypothetical scenario.

00:02:16.544 --> 00:02:18.924
It pops up from time 
to time in the real world,

00:02:18.924 --> 00:02:22.132
sometimes in important contexts.

00:02:22.132 --> 00:02:24.130
One study in the UK appeared to show

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.600
that smokers had a higher survival rate
than nonsmokers

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.846
over a twenty-year time period.

00:02:29.846 --> 00:02:33.307
That is, until dividing the participants
by age group

00:02:33.307 --> 00:02:37.823
showed that the nonsmokers 
were significantly older on average,

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.930
and thus, more likely
to die during the trial period,

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.438
precisely because they were living longer
in general.

00:02:44.438 --> 00:02:47.286
Here, the age groups 
are the lurking variable,

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:50.176
and are vital to correctly 
interpret the data.

00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:51.559
In another example,

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.281
an analysis of Florida's 
death penalty cases

00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:58.265
seemed to reveal 
no racial disparity in sentencing

00:02:58.265 --> 00:03:01.581
between black and white defendants
convicted of murder.

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:06.396
But dividing the cases by the race
of the victim told a different story.

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:07.969
In either situation,

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:11.091
black defendants were more likely
to be sentenced to death.

00:03:11.091 --> 00:03:15.066
The slightly higher overall sentencing 
rate for white defendants

00:03:15.066 --> 00:03:18.692
was due to the fact 
that cases with white victims

00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:21.359
were more likely 
to elicit a death sentence

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:24.091
than cases where the victim was black,

00:03:24.091 --> 00:03:28.483
and most murders occurred between
people of the same race.

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:31.319
So how do we avoid 
falling for the paradox?

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.686
Unfortunately, 
there's no one-size-fits-all answer.

00:03:34.686 --> 00:03:38.504
Data can be grouped and divided
in any number of ways,

00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:42.106
and overall numbers may sometimes
give a more accurate picture

00:03:42.106 --> 00:03:46.638
than data divided into misleading
or arbitrary categories.

00:03:46.638 --> 00:03:52.089
All we can do is carefully study the
actual situations the statistics describe

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:55.977
and consider whether lurking variables
may be present.

00:03:55.977 --> 00:03:59.378
Otherwise, we leave ourselves
vulnerable to those who would use data

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:02.649
to manipulate others
and promote their own agendas.
