00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:02.981
- [Instructor] Suppose
that men have a mean height

00:00:02.981 --> 00:00:06.008
of 178 centimeters with
a standard deviation

00:00:06.008 --> 00:00:07.997
of eight centimeters.

00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:10.818
Women have a mean height
of 170 centimeters

00:00:10.818 --> 00:00:13.830
with a standard deviation
of six centimeters.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.857
The male and female heights
are each normally distributed.

00:00:17.857 --> 00:00:22.225
We independently, randomly
select a man and a woman.

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:24.564
What is the probability that the woman

00:00:24.564 --> 00:00:26.503
is taller than the man?

00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:29.109
So I encourage you to pause
this video and think through it,

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.284
and I'll give you a hint.

00:00:31.284 --> 00:00:34.583
What if we were to define
the random variable M

00:00:34.583 --> 00:00:39.058
as equal to the height of
a randomly selected man?

00:00:39.058 --> 00:00:40.808
Height of random man.

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:46.693
What if we define the random variable W

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:48.776
to be equal to the height

00:00:50.141 --> 00:00:51.641
of a random woman?

00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:54.596
Woman.

00:00:55.584 --> 00:00:58.157
And we defined a third random variable

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:00.323
in terms of these first two?

00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:03.892
So let me call this D, for difference.

00:01:03.892 --> 00:01:06.592
And it is equal to the
difference in height

00:01:06.592 --> 00:01:10.011
between a randomly selected man,

00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:12.511
and a randomly selected woman.

00:01:14.468 --> 00:01:16.713
So D, the random variable D is equal

00:01:16.713 --> 00:01:20.880
to the random variable M,
minus the random variable W.

00:01:22.027 --> 00:01:25.730
So the first two are clearly
normally distributed.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.278
They tell us that right over here.

00:01:27.278 --> 00:01:30.194
The male and female heights
are each normally distributed.

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:33.202
And we also know, or you're about to know,

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:35.633
that the difference of random variables

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:37.846
that are each normally distributed

00:01:37.846 --> 00:01:40.678
is also going to be normally distributed.

00:01:40.678 --> 00:01:42.559
So given this, can you think about

00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:44.156
how to tackle this question?

00:01:44.156 --> 00:01:48.846
The probability that the
woman is taller than the man.

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:50.406
Alright now let's work
through this together.

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:52.666
And to help us visualize,
I'll draw the normal

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:57.296
distribution curves for
these three random variables.

00:01:57.296 --> 00:02:01.268
So this first one is for the variable M,

00:02:01.268 --> 00:02:06.172
and so right here in the
middle, that is the mean of M.

00:02:06.172 --> 00:02:07.504
And we know that this is going to

00:02:07.504 --> 00:02:09.837
be equal to 178 centimeters.

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:13.459
We'll assume everything is in centimeters.

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.147
We also know that it
has a standard deviation

00:02:15.147 --> 00:02:16.168
of eight centimeters.

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:18.898
So for example, if this is
one standard deviation above,

00:02:18.898 --> 00:02:20.988
this is one standard deviation below,

00:02:20.988 --> 00:02:24.622
this point right over here
would be eight centimeters more

00:02:24.622 --> 00:02:27.594
than 178, so that would be 186,

00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:30.072
and this would be eight
centimeters below that,

00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:32.256
so this would be 170 centimeters.

00:02:32.256 --> 00:02:35.112
So this is for the random variable M.

00:02:35.112 --> 00:02:37.863
Now let's think about
the random variable W.

00:02:37.863 --> 00:02:40.359
The random variable W,

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.192
the mean of W they tell us is 170.

00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:50.122
And one standard deviation above the mean

00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:52.685
is going to be six
centimeters above the mean.

00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:56.024
The standard deviation
is six, six centimeters,

00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:57.888
so this would be minus six,

00:02:57.888 --> 00:03:00.701
is to go one standard
deviation below the mean.

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:03.877
Now let's think about the
difference between the two.

00:03:03.877 --> 00:03:05.822
The random variable D.

00:03:05.822 --> 00:03:07.900
So let me think about this one a bit.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.682
The random variable D.

00:03:09.682 --> 00:03:13.407
The mean of D is going to be equal to

00:03:13.407 --> 00:03:17.164
the differences in the means
of these random variables.

00:03:17.164 --> 00:03:20.334
So it's going to be
equal to the mean of M,

00:03:20.334 --> 00:03:23.251
the mean of M, minus the mean of W.

00:03:24.328 --> 00:03:25.995
Minus the mean of W.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.381
Well we know both of these,
this is gonna be 178 minus 170,

00:03:31.381 --> 00:03:32.779
so let me write that down.

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.446
This is equal to 178 centimeters

00:03:37.492 --> 00:03:39.325
minus 170 centimeters.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.310
Which is going to be equal to,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:44.894
I'll do it in this color,

00:03:44.894 --> 00:03:47.902
this is going to be equal
to eight centimeters.

00:03:47.902 --> 00:03:50.654
So this is eight right over here.

00:03:50.654 --> 00:03:53.800
Now what about the standard deviation?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.781
Assuming these two random
variables are independent,

00:03:57.781 --> 00:04:00.044
and they tell us that
we are independently,

00:04:00.044 --> 00:04:01.809
randomly selecting a man and a woman.

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:02.995
The height of the man shouldn't affect

00:04:02.995 --> 00:04:05.381
the height of the woman, or vice versa.

00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:08.200
Assuming that these two
are independent variables,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.797
if you take the sum or
the difference of these,

00:04:10.797 --> 00:04:13.577
then the spread will increase.

00:04:13.577 --> 00:04:16.236
But you won't just add
the standard deviations.

00:04:16.236 --> 00:04:19.231
What you would actually
do is say the variance

00:04:19.231 --> 00:04:21.883
of the difference is going to be the sum

00:04:21.883 --> 00:04:24.344
of these two variances.

00:04:24.344 --> 00:04:26.063
So let me write that down.

00:04:26.063 --> 00:04:27.875
So I could write variance with VAR,

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:30.853
or I could write it as the
standard deviation squared.

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:31.686
So let me write that.

00:04:31.686 --> 00:04:35.853
The standard deviation of D,
of our difference, squared,

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.362
which is the variance,
is going to be equal

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.195
to the variance of our variable M,

00:04:43.903 --> 00:04:46.903
plus the variance of our variable W.

00:04:48.993 --> 00:04:50.711
Now this might be a little
bit counterintuitive.

00:04:50.711 --> 00:04:51.844
This might've made sense to you

00:04:51.844 --> 00:04:53.626
if this was plus right over here.

00:04:53.626 --> 00:04:56.500
But it doesn't matter if we
are adding or subtracting,

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.617
and these are truly independent variables.

00:04:59.617 --> 00:05:02.601
Then regardless of whether
we're adding or subtracting,

00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:05.393
you would add the variances.

00:05:05.393 --> 00:05:07.227
And so we can figure this out.

00:05:07.227 --> 00:05:11.029
This is going to be equal
to the standard deviation

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:12.946
of variable M is eight.

00:05:13.872 --> 00:05:16.789
So eight squared is going to be 64.

00:05:17.932 --> 00:05:21.142
And then we have six squared.

00:05:21.142 --> 00:05:22.320
This right over here is six.

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.118
Six squared is going to be 36.

00:05:25.118 --> 00:05:26.778
You add these two together,

00:05:26.778 --> 00:05:29.928
this is going to be equal to 100.

00:05:29.928 --> 00:05:34.237
And so the variance of this
distribution right over here

00:05:34.237 --> 00:05:35.950
is going to be equal to 100.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.655
Well what's the standard
deviation of that distribution?

00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:39.488
Well it's going to be equal

00:05:39.488 --> 00:05:41.452
to the square root of the variance.

00:05:41.452 --> 00:05:45.360
So the square root of
100, which is equal to 10.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.331
So for example, one standard
deviation above the mean

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:49.831
is going to be 18.

00:05:51.692 --> 00:05:54.147
One standard deviation below the mean

00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:57.771
is going to be equal to negative two.

00:05:57.771 --> 00:05:59.644
And so now using this distribution

00:05:59.644 --> 00:06:01.399
we can actually answer this question.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.402
What is the probability that the woman

00:06:03.402 --> 00:06:05.225
is taller than the man?

00:06:05.225 --> 00:06:07.448
Well we can rewrite
that question as saying,

00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:11.941
what is the probability that
the random variable D is,

00:06:11.941 --> 00:06:12.945
what conditions would it be?

00:06:12.945 --> 00:06:15.604
Pause the video and think about it.

00:06:15.604 --> 00:06:18.779
Well the situation's where the
woman is taller than the man,

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:21.142
if the woman is taller than the man,

00:06:21.142 --> 00:06:22.953
then this is gonna be a negative value.

00:06:22.953 --> 00:06:25.426
Then D is gonna be less than zero.

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:27.034
So what we really want to do is figure out

00:06:27.034 --> 00:06:30.451
the probability that D is less than zero.

00:06:31.545 --> 00:06:35.712
And so what we want to do if
we say zero is right over...

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:43.366
If we say that zero is right
over here on our distribution,

00:06:44.302 --> 00:06:46.802
so that is D is equal to zero,

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:50.838
we want to figure out,
well what is the area

00:06:50.838 --> 00:06:53.486
under the curve less than that?

00:06:53.486 --> 00:06:55.902
So we want to figure out this entire area.

00:06:55.902 --> 00:06:58.257
There's a couple of
ways you could do this.

00:06:58.257 --> 00:07:02.460
You could figure out the Z
score for D equaling zero,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.302
and that's pretty straightforward.

00:07:04.302 --> 00:07:08.469
You could just say, this Z is
equal to zero minus our mean

00:07:10.386 --> 00:07:14.469
of eight divided by our
standard deviation of 10.

00:07:16.063 --> 00:07:18.553
So it's negative eight over 10,

00:07:18.553 --> 00:07:22.136
which is equal to negative 8/10.

00:07:23.128 --> 00:07:24.794
So you could look up a Z table and say,

00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:27.017
what is the total area under the curve

00:07:27.017 --> 00:07:29.767
below Z is equal to negative 0.8?

00:07:31.223 --> 00:07:32.770
Another way you could do this

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.898
is you could use a graphing calculator.

00:07:34.898 --> 00:07:37.003
I have a TI-84 here.

00:07:37.003 --> 00:07:41.170
Where you have a normal
cumulative distribution function.

00:07:42.754 --> 00:07:44.913
I'm gonna press second VARS,

00:07:44.913 --> 00:07:48.182
and that gets me to distribution.

00:07:48.182 --> 00:07:50.063
And so I have these various functions.

00:07:50.063 --> 00:07:53.633
I want normal cumulative
distribution function,

00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:56.243
so that is choice two.

00:07:56.243 --> 00:07:57.935
And then the lower bound.

00:07:57.935 --> 00:08:00.309
Well I want to go to negative infinity.

00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:03.037
Well calculators don't have
a negative infinity button,

00:08:03.037 --> 00:08:04.552
but you could put in a very,

00:08:04.552 --> 00:08:06.629
very, very, very negative number

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:09.910
that for our purposes, is
equivalent to negative infinity.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:14.077
So we could say negative one
times 10 to the 99th power.

00:08:15.585 --> 00:08:17.033
And the way we do that is second,

00:08:17.033 --> 00:08:19.627
these two capital E's
are saying essentially,

00:08:19.627 --> 00:08:23.590
times 10 to the, and I'll say 99th power.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.016
So this is a very, very,
very negative number.

00:08:27.016 --> 00:08:31.016
The upper bound here, we
want to go delete this.

00:08:32.942 --> 00:08:34.906
The upper bound is going to be zero.

00:08:34.906 --> 00:08:37.812
We're finding the area
from negative infinity

00:08:37.812 --> 00:08:39.479
all the way to zero.

00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:44.182
The mean here, well we've
already figured that out.

00:08:44.182 --> 00:08:45.682
The mean is eight.

00:08:46.795 --> 00:08:49.373
And then the standard deviation here,

00:08:49.373 --> 00:08:53.499
we figured this out too,
this is equal to 10.

00:08:53.499 --> 00:08:55.419
And so when we pick this,

00:08:55.419 --> 00:08:58.643
we're gonna go back to
the main screen, enter.

00:08:58.643 --> 00:09:00.361
So this is we could've just typed this in

00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:01.667
directly on the main screen.

00:09:01.667 --> 00:09:05.260
This says look, we are looking
at a normal distribution.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.105
We want to find the cumulative
area between two bounds.

00:09:08.105 --> 00:09:10.137
In this case, it's from
negative infinity to zero.

00:09:10.137 --> 00:09:12.747
From negative infinity to zero,

00:09:12.747 --> 00:09:16.914
where the mean is eight, and
the standard deviation is 10.

00:09:17.904 --> 00:09:21.821
We press enter, and we
get approximately 0.212.

00:09:26.847 --> 00:09:28.764
Is approximately 0.212.

00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:32.585
Or we could say what is the probability

00:09:32.585 --> 00:09:34.959
that the woman is taller than the man?

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:37.750
Well, 0.212, or approximately,

00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:41.475
there's a 21.2% chance of that happening.

00:09:41.475 --> 00:09:44.308
A little better than one in five.
