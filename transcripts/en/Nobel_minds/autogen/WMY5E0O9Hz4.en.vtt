00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.309
 
I kind of worked on statistical methods

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319
I kind of worked on statistical methods
 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.460
I kind of worked on statistical methods
and then I was very lucky at early out

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470
and then I was very lucky at early out
 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.480
and then I was very lucky at early out
of my career to have some great

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490
of my career to have some great
 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.519
of my career to have some great
collaborators and some some work that i

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529
collaborators and some some work that i
 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.730
collaborators and some some work that i
did with Ken singleton started getting a

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740
did with Ken singleton started getting a
 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.950
did with Ken singleton started getting a
lot of attention and and I guess at that

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960
lot of attention and and I guess at that
 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.330
lot of attention and and I guess at that
point in time was the first time I had

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340
point in time was the first time I had
 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.250
point in time was the first time I had
on some feeling that this is an

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260
on some feeling that this is an
 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.400
on some feeling that this is an
important research agenda and maybe it

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
important research agenda and maybe it
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.080
important research agenda and maybe it
was nineteen eighty-five when Kenneth

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
was nineteen eighty-five when Kenneth
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.120
was nineteen eighty-five when Kenneth
and I were given the first prize Ragnar

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
and I were given the first prize Ragnar
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.400
and I were given the first prize Ragnar
fish was the first Nobel laureate in

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
fish was the first Nobel laureate in
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.720
fish was the first Nobel laureate in
economics and so the kind of every

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730
economics and so the kind of every
 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.130
economics and so the kind of every
society has this prize called the first

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140
society has this prize called the first
 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.560
society has this prize called the first
prize and so at a fairly young age I was

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570
prize and so at a fairly young age I was
 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.179
prize and so at a fairly young age I was
I was able to share that I guess that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189
I was able to share that I guess that
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250
I was able to share that I guess that
was an indicator that the work was

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260
was an indicator that the work was
 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770
was an indicator that the work was
getting some attention I remember being

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780
getting some attention I remember being
 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.780
getting some attention I remember being
very much kind of enthusiastic and

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790
very much kind of enthusiastic and
 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.369
very much kind of enthusiastic and
excited by the research but it was very

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
excited by the research but it was very
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.610
excited by the research but it was very
hard to tell that how you know which

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
hard to tell that how you know which
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.930
hard to tell that how you know which
portions of the research we're going to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
portions of the research we're going to
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.459
portions of the research we're going to
command the biggest attention in fact it

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
command the biggest attention in fact it
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.779
command the biggest attention in fact it
even now when I work on research

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789
even now when I work on research
 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.770
even now when I work on research
projects yeah sometimes they get very

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780
projects yeah sometimes they get very
 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.180
projects yeah sometimes they get very
little attention sometimes they get a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190
little attention sometimes they get a
 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.160
little attention sometimes they get a
lot and I mean while I'm doing it it's

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170
lot and I mean while I'm doing it it's
 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.709
lot and I mean while I'm doing it it's
not always so easy to tell which are the

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719
not always so easy to tell which are the
 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.710
not always so easy to tell which are the
ones I'll have the bigger influence
