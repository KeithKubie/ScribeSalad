00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.765
- [Voiceover] So let's get
some practice and hopefully

00:00:01.765 --> 00:00:04.006
a little bit of intuition
for adding and subtracting

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:06.544
two dimensional vectors.

00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:10.225
So let's say that I have vector A, and

00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:14.646
let's say that its x component is

00:00:14.646 --> 00:00:19.126
I don't know, three, and it's
y component is negative one.

00:00:19.126 --> 00:00:23.105
And let's say we also have a vector B.

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:26.523
Vector B, and let's say
that its x component

00:00:26.523 --> 00:00:31.388
is two, and let's say
its y component is three.

00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:35.298
Now, let's first think about what would

00:00:35.298 --> 00:00:38.496
A plus B equal?

00:00:38.496 --> 00:00:41.176
So what resulting vector would this be?

00:00:41.176 --> 00:00:44.939
A plus B is equal to what?

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:46.678
And I encourage you to pause the video

00:00:46.678 --> 00:00:49.174
and think about what this would be.

00:00:49.174 --> 00:00:51.147
Well, the convention
is, is if we're taking

00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:53.060
the sum of two vectors, we can just add up

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.900
their x, their x components to get our new

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.733
x component and up their y components

00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.340
to get the new y component.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.739
So the x component of
vector A plus vector B

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.799
is going to be three plus two.

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.515
That's going to be the x
component, which we know is five.

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:12.894
And the y component is
going to be negative one.

00:01:12.894 --> 00:01:16.755
Negative one plus three.

00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:21.435
Negative one plus three,
and so the resulting vector

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:23.479
is going to have an x component

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.479
of five and a y component
of negative one plus three

00:01:28.537 --> 00:01:31.339
is equal to two.

00:01:31.339 --> 00:01:33.079
Alright, that was pretty straightforward.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:34.657
Now instead of adding
them, let's think about

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:36.700
what would happen if we subtract them.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.798
So let's think about what A, what vector A

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:43.618
minus vector B would be,
and I suspect that you might

00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:46.475
be able to guess or at least think about

00:01:46.475 --> 00:01:49.260
what would happen if you subtract vector B

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.475
instead of adding vector B.

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:56.116
Well, as you might have
guessed, instead of

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:59.415
adding the corresponding
components, we subtract it.

00:01:59.415 --> 00:02:01.202
So our x component is going to be the

00:02:01.202 --> 00:02:05.097
x component of A minus
the x component of B

00:02:05.097 --> 00:02:07.958
'cause it's vector A minus vector B.

00:02:07.958 --> 00:02:10.694
So our x component is going to be

00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:12.936
three minus two.

00:02:12.936 --> 00:02:17.116
Three minus two,

00:02:17.116 --> 00:02:19.975
and our y component is going to be

00:02:19.975 --> 00:02:23.685
the y component of A, negative one,

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.088
minus the y component of B.

00:02:26.088 --> 00:02:28.691
So minus three.

00:02:28.691 --> 00:02:32.591
Minus three, and so the resulting vector

00:02:32.591 --> 00:02:36.752
is going to be, is going to
be the vector three minus two.

00:02:36.752 --> 00:02:38.173
The x component's going to be one,

00:02:38.173 --> 00:02:40.247
and then the y component of negative one

00:02:40.247 --> 00:02:43.581
minus three is negative four.

00:02:43.581 --> 00:02:45.239
Now what I just showed
you, this is the convention

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.939
for adding and subtracting
two dimensional vectors

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:49.439
like vectors A and B.

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:51.002
Let's think a little bit about how we can

00:02:51.002 --> 00:02:54.136
visually depict what is going on.

00:02:54.136 --> 00:02:58.138
So let's first visually depict
adding vector A and vector B.

00:02:58.138 --> 00:03:02.422
So let me draw some axes, and so my,

00:03:02.422 --> 00:03:07.422
so this could be, there's my y-axis.

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:09.700
Y-axis, let's see.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.956
The highest y value I get to is,

00:03:11.956 --> 00:03:14.256
the highest y value I get to is three,

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:15.858
and the lowest is negative four.

00:03:15.858 --> 00:03:19.282
And then, so let me draw
the x-axis some place.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.196
Whoops, didn't mean to do that.

00:03:21.196 --> 00:03:22.882
I did the zoom by accident.

00:03:22.882 --> 00:03:24.118
Alright.

00:03:24.118 --> 00:03:27.436
So the x-axis, put it right over there.

00:03:29.096 --> 00:03:31.307
There's my x-axis, and let's see.

00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:34.107
The highest x value is five.

00:03:34.107 --> 00:03:35.271
The lowest is three.

00:03:35.271 --> 00:03:36.929
Actually, I could just focus on the,

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:40.886
I could just focus on
the, let me just focus

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:42.585
on the right hand side.

00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:45.541
So that's y, and then let me do

00:03:45.541 --> 00:03:50.240
x looking like that.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.964
X-axis.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:52.845
And now let's see.

00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:56.720
Vector A is 3, -1.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.720
So one, two, three, and negative one.

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:04.800
If we want to just visualize
it in standard form,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.945
we could put its initial
point at the origin

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:09.865
and its terminal point at the point 3, -1.

00:04:09.865 --> 00:04:12.500
And so we could draw it like that.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.043
We could also shift it
around, as long as it has

00:04:14.043 --> 00:04:16.524
the same, as long as it
has the same magnitude

00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:20.141
and direction, we could shift it around.

00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:23.265
So that right there is our vector A.

00:04:23.265 --> 00:04:26.879
Now Vector B, 2,3, we could
have its initial point

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:30.683
at the origin and just, we
could draw it like this.

00:04:30.683 --> 00:04:32.859
So the x-coordinate is two.

00:04:32.859 --> 00:04:36.242
Y-coordinate one, two, three.

00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:38.425
So its terminal point could be there.

00:04:38.425 --> 00:04:42.799
So we could just draw it
like this for vector B,

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.539
but if we're going to
add vector B to vector A

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.001
like we have right over
there, what we want to do is

00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:51.919
shift vector B over so that
its, I guess you could say,

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.101
tail starts at A's head,
or its initial point

00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:57.462
starts at A's terminal point.

00:04:57.462 --> 00:04:58.920
So let's do that.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.838
So if we start right over
here, we're going to go

00:05:01.838 --> 00:05:03.519
two in the x direction.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:06.223
So we're going to go two
more in the x direction,

00:05:06.223 --> 00:05:08.104
and we're going to go
three in the y direction.

00:05:08.104 --> 00:05:10.841
So one, two, three.

00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:13.025
So we're going to end up right over there.

00:05:13.025 --> 00:05:15.645
So notice, this is the
same vector, vector B.

00:05:15.645 --> 00:05:17.725
I've just shifted it over.

00:05:17.725 --> 00:05:19.778
Has the same magnitude and same direction

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.442
as what I had drawn before,

00:05:21.442 --> 00:05:23.197
as that vector right over there.

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.622
I have just shifted it
down into the right.

00:05:25.622 --> 00:05:27.997
And now we do this, so this is vector A,

00:05:27.997 --> 00:05:29.123
I'm adding Vector B.

00:05:29.123 --> 00:05:31.542
I put the, I put the
initial point of vector B

00:05:31.542 --> 00:05:33.400
at the terminal point of vector A.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.163
I've shifted it over right over there.

00:05:35.163 --> 00:05:37.420
So now I can figure out
the resulting vector,

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.190
A plus B, the resulting vector A plus B,

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.161
by going from the initial point of A

00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:45.719
to the terminal point of B.

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:48.798
So it's gonna start here,
and then go over there,

00:05:48.798 --> 00:05:52.282
and notice, this vector I'm
going five in the x direction,

00:05:52.282 --> 00:05:54.067
and two in the y direction.

00:05:54.067 --> 00:05:58.480
This is the vector 5,2 right over there.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.017
That is vector A plus vector B.

00:06:01.017 --> 00:06:03.742
But also think about what
happens when we do A minus B.

00:06:03.742 --> 00:06:06.323
Well, we could still have
vector A just like we drew it,

00:06:06.323 --> 00:06:10.441
but now instead of
putting vector B's tail or

00:06:10.441 --> 00:06:13.637
initial point at the
terminal point of vector A,

00:06:13.637 --> 00:06:15.160
we would wanna put negative B.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.067
So negative B would just
be, have the same magnitude

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:20.441
but it'll be in the opposite direction.

00:06:20.441 --> 00:06:23.337
So instead of going two
to the right and three up,

00:06:23.337 --> 00:06:27.922
we would go two to the
left and three down.

00:06:27.922 --> 00:06:32.922
So just two the left and
one, two, three down,

00:06:33.384 --> 00:06:36.739
and we would end up right about there.

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:39.438
And so, if you subtract A minus B,

00:06:39.438 --> 00:06:42.180
that's the same thing
as A plus negative B.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.800
So negative B is going to
look something like this.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.883
It's going to be the
exact opposite direction.

00:06:48.883 --> 00:06:52.478
It's gonna look like that, and so there

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:55.638
if you start at the
initial point of A and get

00:06:55.638 --> 00:06:59.538
to the terminal point of the
negative B now, this is all

00:06:59.538 --> 00:07:01.637
hand-drawn, so it could be
a little bit more precise,

00:07:01.637 --> 00:07:06.637
notice we get to the point 1, -4.

00:07:07.017 --> 00:07:07.920
1, -4.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.658
So this vector right
over here, let me do that

00:07:09.658 --> 00:07:12.999
in a different color, this brown, whoops,

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:14.038
that's not what I wanted to do.

00:07:14.038 --> 00:07:17.341
This brown vector right
over here, that is the

00:07:17.341 --> 00:07:20.877
vector A minus B, and then this white one,

00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:23.038
actually, let me do this
in another color as well,

00:07:23.038 --> 00:07:27.582
this magenta vector right
here, that is A plus B.

00:07:27.582 --> 00:07:28.562
So hopefully that makes sense,

00:07:28.562 --> 00:07:30.282
and if you, given the
components, you're just, if

00:07:30.282 --> 00:07:32.462
you're adding the vectors, add
the correspondent components.

00:07:32.462 --> 00:07:34.500
If you're subtracting the
vectors, well if you're

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.341
subtracting B from A,
subtract B's components,

00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:38.343
corresponding components from

00:07:38.343 --> 00:07:40.590
the corresponding components of A.
