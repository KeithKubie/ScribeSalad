00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.090
We're given a
bunch of lines here

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:05.540
that intersect in all different
ways and form triangles.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.490
And what I want to
do in this video,

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.550
we've been given the measures of
some of the angles, this angle,

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.200
that angle, and that angle.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.700
And what we want
to do in this video

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.110
is figure out what the
measure of this angle is.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.500
And we're going to
call that measure x.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.760
And so I encourage you to pause
the video right now and try

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.780
it yourself.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.990
And then I'm going to
give you the solution.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.556
So I'm assuming
you've unpaused it.

00:00:26.556 --> 00:00:28.180
And you've solved it
or you've given it

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.210
at least a good shot of it.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.980
So let's try to do it.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.290
And what's fun about
these is there's

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:32.610
multiple ways to solve these.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.030
And you kind of
just have to keep

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.880
figuring out what
you can figure out.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.520
So let's say you start on the
left-hand side right over here.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.150
If this is 121 degrees,
then you'd say, well look,

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.740
this angle right over here is
supplementary to this angle

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.000
right over there.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.880
So this is 121 degrees
plus this green angle, that

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.190
has to be equal to 180 degrees.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.630
So this is going to
be 180 minus 121.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.266
Let's see, that's the
same thing as 80 minus 21.

00:01:04.266 --> 00:01:05.900
80 minus 20 would be 60.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.770
So that's going
to be 59 degrees.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:08.970
So let me write that down.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.930
That's going to be 59 degrees.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.920
Now we see that we have
two angles of a triangle.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.642
If you have two
angles of a triangle,

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:19.100
you can figure out
the third angle,

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.150
because they need
to add up to 180.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.220
Or you could say that this
angle right over here--

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.890
so we'll call that
question mark--

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.320
we know that 59 plus
29 plus question mark

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.760
needs to be equal
to 180 degrees.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.360
And if we subtract the 15 out
of the 29 from both sides,

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:43.680
we get question mark is equal to
180 minus 59 minus 29 degrees.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.120
So that is going to be 180
minus 59 minus 29, let's see,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.600
180 minus 59, we
already know, is 121.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.050
And then 121 minus 29.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.920
So if you subtract
just 20, you get 101.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.720
You subtract another
9, you get 92.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.090
So that's going to be
equal to 92 degrees.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.789
This is equal to 92 degrees.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.150
Well, this right here
is equal to 92 degrees.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.740
This angle right here is
vertical with that angle.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.452
So it is also going to
be equal to 92 degrees.

00:02:17.452 --> 00:02:18.910
And now we're
getting pretty close.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.237
We can zoom in on this
triangle down here.

00:02:21.237 --> 00:02:22.570
And let me save some space here.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.550
So let me just say
that that over there

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.120
is also going to be 92 degrees.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.730
And at this triangle
down here, we

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.800
have two of the sides
of the triangle.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.660
We just have to
figure out the third.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.909
And actually, we don't even
have to do much math here,

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.960
because we have two of the
angles of this triangle.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.770
We have to figure
out the third angle.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.930
So over here, we have one angle
that's 92, one angle that's 29.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.369
The other one will be
180 minus 92 minus 29.

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:50.160
And we don't even have
to do any math here,

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.870
because essentially, this is the
exact same angles that we have

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.710
in this triangle
right over here.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.190
We have a 92 degree angle,
we have a 29 degree angle,

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.960
and the other one is 59 degrees.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.850
So in this case,
it has to be also

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.430
59 degrees, because over
here they added up to 180.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.020
So over here, they'll
also add up to 180.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.510
So that will also
get us to 59 degrees.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.180
We could just get that by
taking 180, subtracting 29,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.730
subtracting 92.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.130
And then if this is 59
degrees, then this angle

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.250
is also going to be 59
degrees, because they

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.570
are vertical angles.

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.694
So we're done. x is
equal to 59 degrees.

00:03:27.694 --> 00:03:29.110
Now there's multiple
ways that you

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.640
could have reasoned
through this problem.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.130
You could have immediately
said-- so let me start over,

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.780
actually.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.300
Maybe a faster way,
but you wouldn't

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.466
have been able to do kind
of this basic steps there,

00:03:40.466 --> 00:03:45.510
is you said, look, this is an
exterior angle right over here.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.690
It is equal to the sum of
the remote interior angles.

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.250
So 121 is going to be 29 plus
this thing right over here.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.130
And we ended up doing that when
I did it step-by-step before.

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.340
But here, we're just
using kind of a few things

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.590
that we know about
triangles ahead of time

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.840
to maybe skip a step or two.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.298
Although I like to do it the
other way just so we make sure

00:04:05.298 --> 00:04:07.550
we don't do anything weird.

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.600
So anyway, this
is going to be 129

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.340
minus 29, which
is going to be 92.

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:17.670
And if this is 92, then
this is also going to be 92.

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.670
And then, if this is x, then
this is also going to be x.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:27.560
And you could say x plus 92
plus 29 is equal to 180 degrees.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.540
And then you'd say
x plus 92 plus 29 is

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.960
going to be 121 degrees.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.570
We already knew that before.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.390
And so that is going
to equal 180 degrees.

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:47.640
And so x is equal to 59 degrees.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.360
So there's a ton
of ways that you

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.650
could have thought
about this problem.
