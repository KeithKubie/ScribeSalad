00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.600
Hello, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Film History.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.700
You probably know Thomas Alva Edison as the inventor of the light bulb or the phonograph,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.900
But that's not entirely true.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.600
Gasp!

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.500
He's an icon of American innovation, and personally came up with dozens of new devices,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.500
but he was also one of those guys with too many ideas to accomplish all by himself.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.200
Just like me.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.300
So he hired a batch of talented assistants and put them to work

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.600
in the world's first industrial research lab at Menlo Park, New Jersey.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.800
and with their help, Edison made some major contributions to lots of technologies,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.500
including the technology of film.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.600
Hey, that's what we're talking about!

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.180
One of those engineers was a young man named William, also known as W.K.L Dickson,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.100
or, Wkl Dickson, as I like to call him.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.600
His assignment was to create something that would animate photographs,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.800
something Edison hoped would do for the eye what the phonograph does for the ear.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.440
Within a few years, Dickson invented a couple of devices:

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.900
The world's first motion picture camera, and a peep-show style device that let people watch movies.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.900
I love movies.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.200
Just like that, film production was born, and audiences hungry for movies weren't far behind.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.780
{ Theme music }

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.380
Before Edison and his lab had even built the viewing machine,

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.580
He applied for two preliminary claims with the US Patent Office,

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.340
one for his plans for the device, and one for it's name.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.300
Thomas Edison, ever the patenter.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.060
The idea was to create a coin operated entertainment machine that produced

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.400
images to go along with music or speech that played from a phonograph.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.460
Edison wanted to call it the "Kinetoscope".

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.500
I would have called it the Coin-operated-entertainment-machine... o-graph. But, whatever.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.800
For William Dickson and his team working in Edison lab, the pressure was on,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.800
And there were a few technical challenges right away.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.000
First, they needed to invent the camera to capture the images that would play in the kinetoscope, duh!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.120
While Edison was on a trip to France, he ran into our old friend Etienne-Jules Marey,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.300
Remember him? that guy with the chronophotographic gun?

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.900
Awesome!

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.700
who shot motion studies of all those animals?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.300
Edison raced back to New Jersey and gave Dickson the scoop on the chronophotographic gun

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.800
Awesome!

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.500
And they decided to develop their own camera based on that design.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.300
But, there was another problem. Rolls of paper film just weren't durable enough

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.100
to capture a long series of images and be played back over and over again.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.000
After some experimentation, Dickson found that celluloid filmstrips that

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.740
were coated in light-sensitive emulsion did the trick.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.040
It's a technology that's still being used today.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.000
When in doubt, coat in light-sensitive emulsion, as the saying goes.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.600
So Edison hit up his old entrepreneur buddy George Eastman of Eastman Kodak. Remember him too?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
And Eastman began making lots of celluloid film in 50 ft rolls,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.600
which gave Dickson all the material he needed.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.700
The last technical hurdle was figuring out a way to stop the film very briefly and at regular intervals.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.800
Their devices needed to capture and project a series of distinct images,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.520
instead of an indecipherable blur, which is what you'd get if you ran a roll of film

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.300
straight through a camera or a kinetoscope.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.900
So both the camera and the viewing device had to be able to grab and hold a frame of film

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.100
long enough for it to be exposed to light, and then move it along a grab the next one.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.540
To do this, Dickson took one of those long rolls of celluloid film and cut holes along the edges.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.200
We eventually called these "sprocket holes".

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.400
Then he fashioned an intermittent stop-and-go device inspired by the inner workings of a pocket watch.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.200
This device was kind of like wheel with tiny teeth that grabbed the perforated film strip

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.800
by the holes and pulled it forward.

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.800
The teeth stopped for a split second, before grabbing the next set of holes and moving the film forward again.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.000
This way, the viewer would see a sequential series of still images, that created that

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.400
delicious illusion of motion, as long as the stop-and-go device was moving fast enough.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.700
In 1881, at the National Federation of Women's Clubs in New York city,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.000
Edison unveiled his prototype for the kinetoscope.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.200
It was basically a cabinet with a peep hole on top, so you can look inside and watch pictures move. Movies!

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.000
I love movies.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And it was the first device which allowed for film exhibition, which is how a film is shown to an audience.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.700
But, as innovative as Edison was, there were limits to his vision.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.700
Unlike me.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.100
He thought of motion pictures as an add-on to phonographs,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.940
Which people listened to in their homes or at commercial phonograph parlors.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.160
He didn't foresee the power of projecting film to a huge audience of people.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.280
And he was exactly right. That didn't happen, ever.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.500
In fact, some scholars think he discouraged Dickson from pursuing film projection,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.300
which eventually fractured their relationship.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.000
But for now, Edison and Dickson were chummy, and worked together to create

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.800
this pair of sister inventions, each with their own limitations.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.700
The kinetograph was the first motion picture camera, which worked because they figured out

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.940
how to synchronize the shudder of the camera to a single frame of film,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.360
using the sprocket holes and the intermittent stop-and-go device.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.500
But it could only record images inside the studio,

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.600
because it was too big to haul around and needed electrical power to work.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.800
No vlogs yet, but soon! Not that soon.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.200
The kinetoscope, on the other hand, was a peep-show device

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.340
used to view the film developed from the kinetograph.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.040
It could only show movies to one person at a time, and held 40-50 ft rolls,

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.040
so the movies themselves could only be about 16 seconds long.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.400
It's basically the Twitter of movies.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.000
And even though Edison and Dickson originally hoped to synchronize the sound from a phonograph

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.500
to the images in a kinetoscope, they never quite figured out how to do it.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.800
In fact, true synchronous sound, or matching up sounds to images, would elude technicians for decades.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.600
Now, some of the keys to Edison's success were his aggressive pursuit of patents,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.560
and his interest in mass production, which was transforming industry at the time.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.100
Even Henry Ford's large scale, relatively cost-effective assembly lines were made possible

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.400
thanks to Edison's innovations in electric power.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.400
After all, something had to keep those conveyor belts moving.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.700
In 1894, a Canadian entrepreneur named Andrew Holland opened the first

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.200
Kinetoscope parlor In New York City, charging 25 cents per person.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.600
Edison got dollar signs in his eyes, and before long kinetoscope parlors were

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.300
opening up all over the United States.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.000
People were lining up to get a brief glimpse at a moving picture,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.500
as music played from a phonograph and refreshments were served.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.800
Just like film exhibitors today, kinetoscope parlor operators made most of their money from concessions,

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.500
since they had to lease or buy the kinetoscopes and the films themselves.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.200
Meanwhile, Edison was intent on collecting every single penny he was owed. Of course he was.

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:17.000
As more kinetoscope parlors opened their doors, more and more people were hungry for movies.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.500
Crash Course does not condone or recommend eating movies.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.700
Edison put Dickson in charge of film production, or, everything involved in the making of a film,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.060
from writing and casting actors, to building sets and capturing the images,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.200
Dickson was pretty busy.

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.200
And together, they built the first film production studio in the world, in West Orange, New Jersey.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.880
They didn't really have to start from scratch, the space already existed,

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.100
because that's where they made the first films with the kinetograph.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.800
But they poured more time, and just over 600 dollars into it, to make it a full fledged studio.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.800
They covered the interior walls with tar paper strips to make the performers

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.720
stand out against the stark black background.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.600
That, combines with complaints that it was cramped, stuffy and hot earned the studio its name:

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.800
Employees called it The Black Maria, after a local expression for police vans or paddy-wagons,

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.600
which gives you some idea how they felt about working for a guy like Edison.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.300
And because the kinetograph needed a lot of light to record an image,

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.500
they built a retractable sun roof and a set on circular railroad tracks,

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.300
so that it could be spun around to follow the sun's light.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.800
Did they add a hot tub as well? Would be nice, to have like a sun roof and a hot tub, that'd be nice.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.000
William Dickson served as producer, director, and camera operator for

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.700
hundreds of kinetograph films from 1893-1895.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.760
Most of them featured Vaudeville performers and slapstick physical comedy,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.200
favoring movement over story.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.480
See, the Vaudeville Circuit was the mass entertainment of the 1800s to the 1930s

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.000
before radio was widespread, and before movies came along.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.900
Performers would travel together, set up shop at the local theater, and put on a variety show,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.100
everything from music, comedy and acrobatics,

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.600
to sketches, trained animal and excerpts from stage plays.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.700
People like Harry Houdini, The Marks Brothers, Bob Hope, and Buster Keaton

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.400
all spent time on the Vaudeville stage.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.300
The most famous Vaudeville performers would only play the most exclusive theaters in big cities,

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.000
making it impossible for the far flung masses to see them.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.800
So they'd have nothing to do. What would they do? They'd probably just sit around a punch eagles.

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.600
But with kinetoscope parlors, one star studded performance by, say, Sandow the Strongman

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.200
could be reproduced dozens of times as a seconds-long film.

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.300
That way, audiences all over the country could get a glimpse

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.800
of his bulging pecks and that sweet stache!

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:06.600
Can I do a... a performance? Can I do a Sandow the Strongman performance?

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.000
-No.
No? Okay, No.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.300
Using Vaudeville talent had lots of advantages for kinetograph filmmakers.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.800
Dickson had only 16 seconds to work with, and couldn't record synchronous sound,

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.400
so the performances had to be brief and interesting to watch.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.300
Name recognition helped, as did performers who's acts were reliable and well rehearsed.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.000
Just like mine. Right, Nick?

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.700
Plus, there were lots of them, and a steady supply of talent helped meet

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.500
the growing demand for content unleashed by the kinetoscope.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.700
At least... for a while.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.480
Because, as powerful an revolutionary as the kinetograph and the kinetoscope were,

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.000
their limitations threatened Edison's grip on motion picture production and exhibition.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.700
I mentioned some of these earlier, but they're about to become very important. So pay attention!

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:43.200
First, the kinetograph was static, the camera couldn't move,

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.300
it was too big, and required electricity to run, so you could only shoot movies from one perspective.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.000
Second, the kinetograph required lots of light, so it could only capture images well

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.360
when the sun was shining. In New Jersey.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.700
Third, the kinetoscope peep-hole viewing system meant that only one person at a time could watch a movie,

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.100
which is fine if you're like me and you don't like to be around other people,

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.400
but not for everyone.

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:04.300
That meant a lot of waiting your turn to watch, limiting the number of costumers

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.200
a kinetoscope parlor could admit each day.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.800
Finally, there wasn't any editing yet, so each kinetograph movie was just one single uninterrupted shot.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.500
this wasn't nessecarily a limitation, throughout the history of cinema

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.100
there have been extraordinary films made from single long takes,

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.500
but until filmmakers could edit different shots together, the kind of stories that could be told

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.800
had to begin and end inside one brief shot.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.600
Despite this laundry list of drawbacks, film had arrived,

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:27.000
thanks to Thomas Edison, and especially William Dickson.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.400
Whatever else filmmakers were gonna do, whatever else movies were going to become,

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.600
this was their start.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.900
Today we talked about two key inventions: the kinetograph and the kinetoscope,

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:37.800
that were used to capture and exhibit the very first moving pictures.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.900
We discussed how the principles of industrial mass production helped spread their inventions,

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.420
altering the landscape of mass entertainment forever.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:48.000
We introduced the first film studios and talked about how the first movies showcased

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.700
the action of swanky Vaudeville performers rather than stories.
