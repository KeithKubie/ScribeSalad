00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:08.054
Let's say that f of x is equal
to x times e to the negative

00:00:08.054 --> 00:00:14.470
two x squared, and we want to
find any critical numbers for f.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.031
I encourage you to pause
this video and think about,

00:00:17.031 --> 00:00:20.585
can you find any critical numbers of f.

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:23.085
I'm assuming you've given a go at it.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.797
Let's just remind ourselves
what a critical number is.

00:00:26.406 --> 00:00:30.454
We would say c is a critical

00:00:30.454 --> 00:00:38.637
number of f, if and only if.

00:00:39.924 --> 00:00:44.203
I'll write if with two f's,
short for if and only if,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:53.610
f prime of c is equal to zero
or f prime of c is undefined.

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:58.918
If we look for the critical
numbers for f we want to figure

00:00:59.119 --> 00:01:01.510
out all the places where
the derivative of this with

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.023
respect to x is either equal
to zero or it is undefined.

00:01:06.515 --> 00:01:09.405
Let's think about how we can
find the derivative of this.

00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:15.924
f prime of x is going
to be, well let's see.

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:17.424
We're going to have to
apply some combination

00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:19.285
of the product rule and the chain rule.

00:01:19.285 --> 00:01:26.710
It's going to be the derivative
with respect to x of x,

00:01:28.436 --> 00:01:29.560
so it's going to be that,

00:01:29.813 --> 00:01:38.593
times e to the negative two
x squared plus the derivative

00:01:38.593 --> 00:01:44.515
with respect to x of e to
the negative two x squared

00:01:50.162 --> 00:01:57.078
times x. This is just the
product rule right over here.

00:01:57.078 --> 00:02:00.390
Derivative of the x times e to the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.487
negative of two x squared plus
the derivative of e to the

00:02:02.487 --> 00:02:05.499
negative two x squared
times x, right over here.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.064
What is this going to be?

00:02:07.454 --> 00:02:09.843
Well all of this stuff in magenta,

00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:12.172
the derivative of x with respect to x,

00:02:12.172 --> 00:02:14.063
that's just going to be equal to one.

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:16.328
This first part is going to be equal

00:02:16.328 --> 00:02:20.489
to e to the negative two x squared.

00:02:20.827 --> 00:02:23.020
Now the derivative of e to the

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.937
negative two x squared over here.

00:02:25.315 --> 00:02:26.484
I'll do this in this pink color.

00:02:26.484 --> 00:02:30.827
This part right over here,
that is going to be equal to-

00:02:30.827 --> 00:02:32.329
We'll just apply the chain rule.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.813
Derivative of e to the
negative two x squared with

00:02:34.813 --> 00:02:37.671
respect to negative two
x squared, well that's

00:02:37.671 --> 00:02:41.125
just going to be e to the
negative two x squared.

00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:42.789
We're going to multiply that times the

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:46.662
derivative of negative two
x squared with respect to x.

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.097
That's going to be what, negative four x.

00:02:52.687 --> 00:02:56.568
Times negative four x, and of

00:02:56.568 --> 00:02:58.379
course we have this x over here.

00:02:58.748 --> 00:03:02.020
We have that x over there and let's see,

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.031
can we simplify it at all?

00:03:06.673 --> 00:03:08.544
Well obviously both of these terms have

00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:10.154
an e to the negative two x squared.

00:03:10.154 --> 00:03:11.435
I'm going to try to
figure out where this is

00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:16.176
either undefined or where
this is equal to zero.

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.017
Let's think about this a little bit.

00:03:20.745 --> 00:03:23.166
If we factor out e to the
negative two x squared,

00:03:23.455 --> 00:03:24.426
I'll do that in green.

00:03:24.846 --> 00:03:26.136
We're going to have,

00:03:26.346 --> 00:03:30.457
this is equal to e to the
negative two x squared times,

00:03:31.097 --> 00:03:38.377
we have here, one minus four x squared.

00:03:38.674 --> 00:03:44.831
One minus four x squared.

00:03:45.643 --> 00:03:47.346
This is the derivative of f.

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:53.458
Where would this be
undefined or equal to zero?

00:03:55.423 --> 00:03:57.716
e to the negative two x squared,

00:03:57.964 --> 00:04:02.402
this is going to be
defined for any value of x,

00:04:02.747 --> 00:04:04.308
this part is going to be defined,

00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:07.796
and this part is also going to
be defined for any value of x.

00:04:08.625 --> 00:04:10.326
There's no point where this is undefined.

00:04:10.326 --> 00:04:12.518
Let's think about when this
is going to be equal to zero.

00:04:13.045 --> 00:04:15.904
The product of these two
expressions equalling zero,

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:17.969
e to the negative two x squared,

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.019
that will never be equal to zero.

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.624
If you get this exponent to be a really,

00:04:21.624 --> 00:04:23.780
I guess you could say
very negative number,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.046
you will approach zero but you
will never get it to be zero.

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:30.829
This part here can't be zero.

00:04:31.049 --> 00:04:33.499
If the product of two
things are zero at least

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.780
one of them has to be
zero, so the only way

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.378
we can get f prime of x
to be equal to zero is

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:44.047
when one minus four x
squared is equal to zero.

00:04:44.597 --> 00:04:46.892
One minus four x squared is equal

00:04:46.892 --> 00:04:48.473
to zero, let me rewrite that.

00:04:48.473 --> 00:04:50.874
One minus four x squared is equal

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.484
to zero, when does that happen?

00:04:53.765 --> 00:04:55.265
This one we can just solve.

00:04:55.705 --> 00:04:57.205
Add four x squared to both sides,

00:04:57.205 --> 00:04:59.656
you get one is equal to four x squared.

00:04:59.656 --> 00:05:01.016
Divide both sides by four, you get

00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:03.987
one fourth is equal to x squared.

00:05:03.987 --> 00:05:06.318
Then what x values is this true at?

00:05:06.318 --> 00:05:09.709
We just take the plus or minus
square root of both sides

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:15.030
and you get x is equal to
plus or minus one half.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.751
Negative one half squared is one fourth,

00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:19.612
positive one half squared is one fourth.

00:05:20.098 --> 00:05:23.989
If x equals plus or
minus one half f prime,

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.003
or the derivative, is equal to zero.

00:05:26.003 --> 00:05:27.145
Let me write it this way.

00:05:27.473 --> 00:05:31.441
f prime of one half is equal to zero,

00:05:31.722 --> 00:05:33.254
and you can verify that right over here.

00:05:33.537 --> 00:05:37.351
And f prime of negative
one half is equal to zero.

00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:40.383
If someone asks what are
the critical numbers here,

00:05:45.507 --> 00:05:49.348
they are one half and negative one half.
