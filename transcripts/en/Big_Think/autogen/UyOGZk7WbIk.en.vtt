00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.120
you go for a second opinion and people
say no my doctor recommended it how

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130

I say can you please refer me for a
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.170
I say can you please refer me for a
second opinion then we asked another

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
second opinion then we asked another
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.969
second opinion then we asked another
group we said here's the situation if

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979
group we said here's the situation if
 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770

from an outside perspective you look at

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110
from an outside perspective you look at
 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.699

the situation
 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.880
the situation
and then you say to yourself if this was

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890
and then you say to yourself if this was
 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.399
and then you say to yourself if this was
about somebody else somebody I love and

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:19.409
about somebody else somebody I love and
 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:21.380
about somebody else somebody I love and
care about and then when this situation

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
care about and then when this situation
 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.990

what would why what would I advise them
 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.970
what would why what would I advise them
and you would realize that often your

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980
and you would realize that often your
 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.490
and you would realize that often your
advice will be different and often a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
advice will be different and often a
 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.910
advice will be different and often a
more rational useful perspective

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920
