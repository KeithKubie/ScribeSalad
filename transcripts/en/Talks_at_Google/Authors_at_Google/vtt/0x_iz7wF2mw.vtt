JULIE WISKIRCHEN: Good
afternoon everybody.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.560
I'm Julie Wiskirchen from the

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.780
Authors@Google team in Los Angeles.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.660
And today, we are welcoming
William Knoedelseder, who's

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.360
going to be discussing his new
book, "Bitter Brew-- the Rise

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.600
and Fall of Anheuser-Busch and
Americas King of Beers."

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.330
I grew up in St. Louis.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.810
It's the home of
Anheuser-Busch.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.700
And I think I was in high school
when I finally realized

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.320
there was other beer besides
Budweiser in the world.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.930
So the Busch family are
almost like the

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.260
Kennedys in St. Louis.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.140
It's quite a dynasty.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.940
So I'm very interested to hear
some of the backstory behind

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.250
it all today.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.420
And just a little background on
Bill-- he spent 12 years as

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.310
a reporter at the "LA Times"
where his groundbreaking

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.080
coverage of the recording
industry for the newspaper's

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.660
financial section
resulted in the

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.370
critically-acclaimed book "Stiffed--

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.410
A True Story of MCA, the Music
Business, and the Mafia."

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.430
He's also been a television
executive creating, managing,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.010
and producing news programs for
Knight Ridder, Fox, and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.650
the USA Network.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.440
At USA, he was vice
president of news.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.209
His last book, "I'm
Dying Up Here--

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:07.030
Heartbreak and High Times in
Stand-Up Comedy's Golden Era,"

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.670
has been optioned for
film by Jim Carrey.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.930
And today, he's going to talk
about "Bitter Brew." So please

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.860
join me in welcoming William
Knoedelseder.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.656
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.656 --> 00:01:18.520
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
Hi everyone.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.450
For anybody who's wondering,
my name in German is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.510
pronounced "Kenerdelzader."
It means noodle cooker or

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.660
dumpling maker.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.180
So those are my roots.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.220
I'm also Irish on my
mother's side.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.610
So I'm a combination or
Irish and German--

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.295
I think maybe an expert on beer
on the day of my birth.

00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:47.690
It's actually very charming
that they're serving

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.430
beer for you today.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.790
Not a lot of companies give you
free beer in the middle of

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.340
the day while you're working,
and on a Monday.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.460
As it turns out though,
it's actually kind of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.270
an old-school thing.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.140
Because Anheuser-Busch used to
do that back in the day.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.110
In the 1890s, when the brewery
employees worked from 4:00 AM

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:16.750
to 7:00 PM seven days a week,
just like you guys, they

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.920
served them beer.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.230
They eventually bargained to get
three hours off on Sunday

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.830
so that they could
go to church.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.950
And they were paid between
$50 and $75 a

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.900
month and 20 free beers--

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.480
not a month, a day.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.190
They got 20 free beers
a day every day.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.990
I've done the math.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.710
That's 140 beers a
week, 602 beers a

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.380
month, and 7,300 a year--

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.560
while you're working
in a plant.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.470
That's what a good union
can do for you I guess.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.350
"Bitter Brew" is the story of
America's most successful beer

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.980
company, and the colorful and
often outrageous family that

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.730
founded it and operated it
for about 150 years--

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.440
from three days after Lincoln
was first inaugurated to the

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.020
week that Obama was
first elected.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.400
And that takes in a
lot of history.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.890
That's the Industrial
Revolution, the Civil War,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.940
World War I, Prohibition, World
War II, not to mention

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.030
the Budweiser frogs campaign
and what's up.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.040
So it's also the story of beer
in America and how you came to

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.820
be drinking the style
and brand of beer

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:42.090
you're drinking now.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.670
And again, in addition
to that, it's

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.720
a story of my hometown.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.310
Because I grew up
in St. Louis.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.860
And like Julie, I was steeped
in the lore of Budweiser and

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.540
the Clydesdales and Cardinals
baseball and the Busch family,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.810
who were the royalty
of the city.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.620
And she mentioned
the Kennedy's.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.770
They're very much like that,
especially the Busch males.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.840
They exhibited all the
recklessness and sexual

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.070
rapacity of the Kennedy's
without the appetite for

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.160
public service.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.770
They were very wealthy and
privileged, but they weren't

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.900
pretentious.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.870
They were boisterous, hard
drinking, fast driving, gun

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.340
loving, skirt chasing
bad boys.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.470
And they seemed to get away with
everything, which I think

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.300
is why my high school buddies
and college buddies and I

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.320
thought they were so cool.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.410
Because it's all this, and they
own a beer company, too,

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.850
back in the time.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:59.760
In fact, in my high school
yearbook my senior year, the

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.230
graduating seniors were all
asked to state what their

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.030
ambition was.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.560
And I'm kind of embarrassed to
report that under my picture

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.980
in my senior yearbook, it says,
president of Budweiser.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.810
It's weird now.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.860
And I went on to the University
of Missouri where I

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.340
majored in Budweiser, which
was a special decelerated

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.880
seven-year undergraduate
program.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.730
And in the '80s, when I came out
here to be a writer in Los

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:37.170
Angeles, early on
I had this idea.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:41.850
And I wrote up a proposal for a
television series based on a

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.860
fictional family that owned
a baseball team and a

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.540
brewery in St. Louis.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.750
And I took it around.

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.890
And at the time, "Dallas" was
the number one show on

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.030
television.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.840
And there was another show
called "Falcon Crest," which

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.140
was about a rich family that
owned a winery in Napa.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.765
So I thought, this
is a sure thing.

00:06:01.765 --> 00:06:06.000
But nobody was interested
in my thing.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.460
And I remember one big time
agent with this very

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.590
intimidating name-- he was like
the number one literary

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:14.320
agent around.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.875
And he had this name.

00:06:14.875 --> 00:06:17.732
His name was Sterling Lord.

00:06:17.732 --> 00:06:23.180
And Sterling Lord told me
bluntly that not only was beer

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.650
and baseball in St. Louis not
nearly as sexy as oil tycoons

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.280
in Dallas, but my proposal
wasn't very well written.

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:36.320
So I either improved in my
writing, or Hollywood

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.310
standards have gone down.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.850
Because right now, "Bitter Brew"
is being developed as a

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.140
TV series by Lionsgate
Television.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.520
And alas, Mr. Lord will not
be around to see it,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.770
God rest his soul.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.250
But I'll never forget
him for that.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.810
The Anheuser-Busch story, the
brewery story and the family,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:02.210
starts in 1857 when Adolphus
Busch, an 18-year-old

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.140
immigrant from Mainz, Germany,
stepped off a

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.200
steamboat in St. Louis.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:10.110
And he basically inhaled the
aroma of the 40 or so

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:14.075
breweries that were operating
there at the time.

00:07:14.075 --> 00:07:18.720
He was part of a mass influx
of Europeans--

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.130
7 and 1/2 million of them--

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:26.420
that arrived between
1820 and 1870.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.910
They basically doubled the
population of the country.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.610
And 2/3 of them, as it turns
out, were from Germany and

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.656
Ireland, which were
beer-drinking countries.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:42.920
The Irish, of course, were
fleeing poverty and famine in

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.230
their country.

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:47.300
So they pretty much arrived
starving and penniless.

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.820
And they had to fight their way,
literally block by block,

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:50.540
into New York.

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:54.960
The Germans tended to be middle
class merchants who

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.110
were looking for a more
democratic form of government

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:59.930
after they'd had a
liberal political

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.530
revolution fail in Germany.

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:05.600
So they arrived with some
money in their pockets.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.980
And instead of going into New
York, they traveled to the

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:08.830
interior of the country.

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.540
And they came down the
major waterways.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:14.850
And a huge number of them
settled in an area that became

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:17.410
known as the German Triangle.

00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.240
And the points of the triangle
were Cincinnati, Milwaukee,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:21.490
and St. Louis.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.320
St. Louis was a particularly
good place for a brewery, to

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.940
build breweries, because number
one, it was situated on

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.480
the Mississippi River.

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.580
So there was this great
free supply of water.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.030
And it was also built on
a series of very large

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:40.919
underground caves.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:43.299
So they could store the
beer and keep it cool.

00:08:43.299 --> 00:08:46.170
There was no refrigeration
back then.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:49.430
One other important thing--

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:53.250
the Germans and the
Irish preferred a

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:54.810
different kind of beer.

00:08:54.810 --> 00:08:58.190
Like the English who colonized
the country, the Irish

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:02.330
preferred strong tasting ales
that were made with a yeast

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:05.410
that floated to the top
during fermentation.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:09.740
And the Germans, they liked a
different kind of beer, a

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.910
crisper, lighter tasting beer
that was made with a yeast

00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:14.670
that sunk to the bottom.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:20.720
And it's called lager, because
that's the word for aging.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:23.400
And this kind of beer takes at
least a month of aging-- at

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.620
least that's what they thought
back then-- to achieve its

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:27.650
full taste potential.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:29.340
So there was two different
competing

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:30.890
styles of beer there.

00:09:30.890 --> 00:09:33.230
And of course, the Germans
would eventually win out,

00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:35.580
because they tend to
take over things.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.260
And every place they settled,
of course, they built

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.460
breweries, the Germans.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.060
Because there was just these
tons and tons of Germans

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:53.760
pouring in, and they
had to be serviced.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.900
They had a big thirst
for beer.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:56.620
That was their drink.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.500
It was not the American drink.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.760
We were not a beer
drinking country.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.840
The Germans sort
of made it so.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:09.800
And when Adolphus Busch arrived
in St. Louis, all of

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.230
the beer that was made
in St. Louis was

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.170
consumed in St. Louis.

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:16.130
And it was like 18 million
$0.05 glasses a year.

00:10:16.130 --> 00:10:19.400
Every brewery was a local-- it
was a hyper-local business.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.480
You sold in the neighborhood.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:21.730
Every brewery was
a microbrewery.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.930
Their names were invariably the
name of the street they

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.920
were on, the neighborhood they
were located in, or the

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:31.970
founding family.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.190
And the names of the founding
families are funny if you read

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.080
them today.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.160
The list is like, Brinkworth,
Breizedick, Feurerbacher,

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.510
Hyderbreeder, Klausman,
Schlostein, Schlops, Schners,

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.240
Stump, Stifle, Urich,
Vinkelmeyer.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:50.920
There were like 200 breweries
in Missouri at

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.490
one point early on.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.170
Because every city had the
same thing going on.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.320
And the only name that you'd
look at today, the list-- and

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.615
I've seen the list-- the only
one you would recognize is

00:11:00.615 --> 00:11:00.930
Anheuser-Busch.

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.620
The rest of them have
all gone away.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:08.800
And every now and then, you
would see one Irish brewery--

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.940
Mullally or Mullanthy or
something like that.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.460
But it was pretty much a German
thing by the turn of

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.080
the century.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.310
And Adolphus was a really
smart, young guy.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:20.710
After a couple of years of
operating his own beer supply

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:25.780
business, he married the
daughter of one of his

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:30.740
customers who was a very wealthy
soap manufacture named

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:35.040
Eberhard Anheuser, who had come
into reluctant ownership

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.900
of a failing brewery because
of a bad debt.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.630
He didn't want to own it.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:42.800
He took it over because they
didn't pay the bill.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.980
And it was called a Bavarian
brewery, and it made beer so

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.520
bad that the bartenders were
used to people spitting it

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.370
back across the bar at
them all the time.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.560
And of course, they weren't
doing well.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.710
And Adolphus convinced his
father-in-law to let him run

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.520
the business--

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:03.340
manage it anyway.

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:07.290
And one of the first smart
things he did was, he acquired

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:12.080
a recipe for a light tasting
lager beer that had been made

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:17.990
for years by some monks in the
bohemian village of Budweis.

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:20.990
And it was known in the
region as Budweiser--

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.040
"Budveiser," I'm sorry.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.500
And ever since that happened,
there's been lawsuits between

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.710
Anheuser-Busch and the
people over there.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.020
And it's gone on
for 100 years.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.670
And I'm always asked at these
things, well, why didn't you

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:35.660
include that in the book?

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:36.670
And why didn't you
go into that?

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:40.550
And the reason is simple--
because it's so boring.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:44.680
The controversy is that he
clearly paid the monks for the

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.620
recipe, he brought it back here,
changed it, and no one

00:12:47.620 --> 00:12:50.490
ever expected Anheuser-Busch to
get that big and sell beer

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:51.700
all over the world.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.390
And they've gone back and
forth with the lawsuits.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:56.330
One side wins, the other
side wins, they appeal,

00:12:56.330 --> 00:12:56.996
it goes on and on.

00:12:56.996 --> 00:12:58.050
It's just stupendously boring.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.150
And it hasn't resulted
in anything yet.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.390
It's still the same.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:05.720
Budweiser never tasted the
same as "Budveiser."

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.210
Because they changed it to
make it more palatable to

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.160
American tastes.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:12.607
I've had both, and they
really don't resemble

00:13:12.607 --> 00:13:13.385
one another at all.

00:13:13.385 --> 00:13:16.860
But the Budvar people, they
still resent this.

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:17.830
And they may have a case.

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.280
It's just not a very interesting
story to tell, so

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.810
I didn't go into it.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:26.030
The second really smart thing
that Adolphus did was, he

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.000
became the first brewery in the
United States, and maybe

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.790
the world, to pasteurize and
bottle his beer so it could be

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.140
shipped outside the city limits,
even outside the

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.550
state, without spoiling.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.510
And that changed everything.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.983
He was really more of an
industrialist than a brewery.

00:13:40.983 --> 00:13:42.060
He didn't much like beer.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.110
He preferred wine.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.060
And he was a proponent of
vertical integration before

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:50.980
there was a name for it.

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.835
To fire his brewery, he bought
a couple coal mines on the

00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:58.480
other side of the river and then
built a railway to bring

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.850
the coal into the plant.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:02.210
He bought into the bottling
company that

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.340
his beer went into.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.970
And he bought into the rail car
company that made the cars

00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:08.220
that took the beer to market.

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:12.800
And in the end, he controlled
it all the way to the end,

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:16.070
because he bought into the
saloons that would sell it.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.020
What he would do
is, he would--

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:20.470
he sort of pioneered this.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:24.320
He would pay for a proprietor's
alcohol license,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:27.410
all his licenses, his glassware,
his signage, pay

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:31.260
his rent for a few months, and
he'd set them up in business

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.370
with a signed agreement that
they would only sell

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:38.020
Anheuser-Busch beer,
his products.

00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.540
So he was just killing
the competition.

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:42.490
They all had to sort of
do the same thing.

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:45.250
They had to then go out and
get their own saloons, and

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.580
have them sell their
beer exclusively.

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.960
And this eventually came
back to bite them all.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.285
Because the proprietors--

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.440
their partners would
run brothels out

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.480
of their back room.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.300
And they would pay off the
politicians and the cops to

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.380
look the other way.

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.720
And this would have
repercussions for them, and

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.270
I'll explain to you
in a minute.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:10.070
Adolphus was right.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:12.880
He believed that beer
was going to become

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:13.620
the national drink.

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:16.410
And it did turn out that way,
and not just beer, but

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.310
specifically lager beer.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:26.170
And by the time he died in 1913,
I think the per capita

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.520
consumption of beer
had quadrupled.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:33.340
And America surpassed Germany
as the number one beer

00:15:33.340 --> 00:15:34.920
producing country
in the world.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.780
It was our 17th largest
industry.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.500
And then, something totally
crazy happened.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:46.330
Under pressure from a strident
Christian minority--

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.750
imagine that--

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:51.770
Congress and the state
legislatures all across the

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:54.940
country passed and ratified
the Eighteenth Amendment,

00:15:54.940 --> 00:16:00.090
which outlawed the sale of
alcoholic beverages.

00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:04.910
And they literally outlawed
their 17th largest industry.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.460
And the repercussions were
just huge in business.

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.270
There were 1,300 breweries
operating

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:10.520
in the United States.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:12.040
All of those people pretty much

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.950
lost their jobs overnight.

00:16:13.950 --> 00:16:17.090
And anybody who supplied the
beer business with anything,

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:18.780
they lost their jobs--

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.000
the bottlers, the people who
made the wooden kegs, the

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.960
coopers, the railroads
lost money--

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.460
anybody that had anything
to do with that.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:30.580
I read somewhere in
my research--

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.000
on the internet, so therefore
it must be true--

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.900
that New York and Boston at the
time relied on the federal

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:43.280
excise tax on alcohol for
85% of their income.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.210
So it was a pretty radical thing
to do to all of a sudden

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.540
not be able to do that.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:54.150
And in St. Louis, it caused the
loss of 40,000 jobs in a

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.860
relatively small city--

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:56.750
brewery-related jobs.

00:16:56.750 --> 00:16:58.370
And the number nationwide--

00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.720
brewery-related--

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.700
was something like
1.2 million.

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.800
And that doesn't include the
number of people in the

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.700
distilled spirits business,
which is just as labor

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.270
intensive as brewing.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:20.890
The irony is that it was the
distillers that were first

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:25.000
targeted by the temperance
movement.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.250
They weren't after beer.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:29.300
They were after the
whiskey makers.

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:35.630
And for years leading up to
Prohibition, the brewers tried

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.600
really hard to distinguish
themselves between themselves

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.440
and the distillers who were
their competitor for the

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.830
consumer's advertising dollar.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:48.770
And they would push themselves
as an invigorating,

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:51.810
non-intoxicating,
wholesome drink.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.870
And Anheuser-Busch had a
magazine ad or a newspaper ad

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.560
that said something stupid
like, Budweiser--

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:05.660
spells temperance.

00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.300
OK, right.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.950
But the funny thing was, the
Germans kind of believed that.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:17.860
They historically felt that
their product was sort of

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:18.720
healthy and wholesome.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:22.020
And the way they drank was
different than the way, say,

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:22.765
the Irish did.

00:18:22.765 --> 00:18:24.250
In St. Louis, the Irish bars--

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:25.590
there were no women
in those bars.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:29.630
It was guys getting smashed
before or after work, or

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.920
during the day, or
whatever else.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:32.070
And they went in there
to get loaded.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:35.290
The Germans, when they came,
they brought with them the

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.340
whole idea of beer halls
and beer gardens.

00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:40.340
And they would drink with
the whole family.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.110
The kids would be there.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.320
It was sort of a family thing,
and everybody got together and

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.480
sang crazy German songs.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.590
And it was kind of wholesome
compared to your basic Irish

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.080
or English pub.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:57.390
Anyway, so the anti-alcohol
forces sort of bought the

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:00.680
whole wholesome thing
for a while.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.810
They weren't really going after
the brewers until they

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:06.190
figured out that, wait a minute,
most of these saloons

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:08.890
that are serving this devil
whiskey that's killing

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:13.500
America's soul are owned
by brewers--

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.840
not just brewers, but
Germans, foreigners.

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:18.880
And the biggest, baddest foreign
brewer of all was

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.400
Adolphus Busch.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:27.130
So he became the poster boy for
the anti-alcohol movement.

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:32.370
He didn't live to see
prohibition pass, but shortly

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:36.510
before he died, he made the
pronouncement that if it did

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:41.900
pass, it would, quote, "ruin
the whole world,"

00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:43.550
which it didn't do.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:50.980
But anyway, his son, who was
named August Anheuser Busch,

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:55.230
managed to keep the company
operating during Prohibition

00:19:55.230 --> 00:19:59.870
by pivoting and manufacturing
related products that were the

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.390
result of Adolphus' vertical
integration.

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.490
He manufactured railcars.

00:20:06.490 --> 00:20:10.630
He manufactured refrigeration
stuff.

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:12.390
He manufactured ice cream.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:16.640
He made a malt-based soft
drink called Bevo.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.840
And they had a nonalcoholic
version of Budweiser.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:24.380
And the most important thing,
the most profitably thing they

00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:30.490
did, was they established a
baking division, which sold

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:33.770
barley malt syrup and yeast,
and became really

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.590
successful at that.

00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.880
And they called it the baking
division when in fact it was

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:43.170
coincidentally branded
Budweiser Products.

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.760
And those two ingredients were
the key ingredients in the

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.260
booming home brewery
trade in the

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.750
country, which was illegal.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.070
So they went from being the most
successful brewery to the

00:20:54.070 --> 00:21:00.130
most successful bootleg
warehouse, bootleg operation,

00:21:00.130 --> 00:21:00.590
in the country.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.910
And that's how they
kept the company

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:05.430
running through Probation.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:09.300
They kept 2,000 people employed
when St. Louis had

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.790
unemployment 30%.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:16.860
And that's when the city just
always remembered August

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.810
Anheuser Busch for that, because
he did keep it open.

00:21:19.810 --> 00:21:26.130
And what happened then--

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.480
so Probation lasts 13 years.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.470
And when Franklin Roosevelt ran
for president, he ran on

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:36.030
an anti-Prohibition thing.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:41.400
And in February, 1933, shortly
after he was inaugurated, he

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.730
was eager to get
people working.

00:21:42.730 --> 00:21:47.620
So he urged Congress to
immediately put beer--

00:21:47.620 --> 00:21:48.750
3.2% alcohol--

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:52.590
back on sale in the United
States, which was eight months

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.120
ahead of the repeal
of Prohibition.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.340
Because to appeal Prohibition,
they had to ratify a new

00:21:58.340 --> 00:21:59.590
amendment to the Constitution.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.510
And it was going to take eight
months while all the stays

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.880
went through.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.460
But they put beer back on
the market right away.

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.470
And in exchange for that favor
he did for them, he puts some

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:11.510
new regulations on the industry
where the brewers

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.110
could no longer own an
interest in retail

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.050
establishments.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:19.150
From then on, and to this day,
they had to sell their beer in

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.430
arm's length transactions with
middlemen, who were the

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.345
distributors, and then they
dealt with the retailers.

00:22:25.345 --> 00:22:29.980
And that was to keep the
corruption out of it.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:36.510
The night that beer went on
sale, at midnight on April 7,

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:43.390
1933, a crowd of 35,000 people
gathered outside the gates of

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:44.610
Anheuser-Busch's brewery.

00:22:44.610 --> 00:22:46.950
And they saying "Happy Days
are Here Again." And they

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:52.070
counted down the clock for
the gates to open up.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.210
And it did.

00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:55.170
It was quite an amazing scene.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:23:00.240
The gates opened up, and 1,200
trucks full of beer just

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.390
rolled out of the gates to make
deliveries all over town.

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:08.880
And by dawn, the citizens
of St. Louis had

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.100
consumed every drop.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:12.200
There was nothing left.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.870
And supposedly, that scene
happened in other big brewing

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:19.270
cities in the country.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.230
There was four or
five of them.

00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:27.910
And today, economists are sort
of in agreement that April

00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:31.390
1933 marked the end of
the Great Recession.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.280
That's when the economy started
expanding again.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.940
And it did really well for--

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:41.010
the night that Prohibition
[INAUDIBLE], they literally

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.900
had a brass band out in front.

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:45.310
And the whole city went crazy.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:50.090
But anyway, they pretty much
agree that April '33 was the

00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:51.100
end of the Depression.

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.730
And beer sales soared.

00:23:52.730 --> 00:23:56.780
And the economy was on
an uptick for the

00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.030
next couple of years.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:04.200
Unemployment dropped by half,
and everything was going fine.

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:08.420
Then all of a sudden, the
economy hit a tailspin.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:12.880
And unemployment shot back up.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.150
And the reason was, there was
a confluence of factors that

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:19.270
sound really familiar today.

00:24:19.270 --> 00:24:24.400
The Roosevelt administration
tried to cut the deficit by

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.130
slashing government spending,
Congress voted a tax hike on

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.870
the rich, and the Federal
Reserve sort of tightened

00:24:30.870 --> 00:24:31.990
their money policy.

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:35.450
And that produced what
is known as the Great

00:24:35.450 --> 00:24:38.210
Recession of 1937.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:46.175
And by this time, Adolphus is
gone, his son August Anheuser

00:24:46.175 --> 00:24:49.850
Busch is gone, and the guy in
charge of the brewer is the

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:50.610
third generation.

00:24:50.610 --> 00:24:55.550
He's Adolphus' grandson, August
Anheuser Busch II,

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.850
forever known as Gussie.

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:00.300
And Gussie was the guy
who really put the

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.060
company on the map.

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.890
But he was in charge in 1937.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:11.370
And his reaction to this
downturn in the economy viewed

00:25:11.370 --> 00:25:16.410
from this age of egregious
corporate greed is really

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:17.590
extraordinary, I think.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.370
And I was sort of surprised
when I found this.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:20.900
I'll read this to you.

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.010
"The company announced that it
was going to devote the entire

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.460
1938 advertising budget to
a series of newspaper and

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.580
magazine ads aimed at calming
the nation's economic fears

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.220
and restoring confidence in the
ability of the country's

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:36.490
institution to deal
with the problems.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.260
The idea was to, quote, 'sell
America to Americans,'

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.680
according to a statement
Anheuser-Busch sent to its

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.740
employees and the industry
at large.

00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:46.450
'Our challenge is more important
than selling beer,

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:49.720
more important than making
profits,' the statement said.

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:52.200
The ads contained no pictures
of the product, no statement

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.440
about its merits.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.700
Instead, they offered patriotic
pep talks that might

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.840
have made Ronald Reagan blush.

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.180
'Each sunrise in America ushers
in new opportunities to

00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.560
those who keep their chins up,
who never lose that lusty

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.610
courage and willingness that
made ours the most envied

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:09.260
nation on earth,' said one.

00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:12.670
'Confidence sailed our pioneer
forefathers across the

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:15.130
turbulent Atlantic," said
another. 'Confidence helped

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.310
our grandfathers extend the
stubborn frontier, and made

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.040
ours the strongest and most
abundant land on Earth.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.530
Confidence is now ready to take
America further still.'"

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:28.100
The only mention of Budweiser in
the ads for the whole year

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:28.650
came at the end.

00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.215
There was a tag line that said,
"Live life, every golden

00:26:31.215 --> 00:26:31.720
minute of it.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.690
Drink Budweiser, every gold
drop of it." And without

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:39.330
question, there was self
interest behind the ads.

00:26:39.330 --> 00:26:43.830
Gussie figured that confident
wage-earning men were likely

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.740
to drink more beer than fearful
unemployed men.

00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:50.090
But the campaign wasn't
a cynical ploy.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.610
Gussie believed in his gut that
serving the public good

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.850
also served the company, and
that goodwill was always the

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:56.480
best salesman.

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:05.280
It all went back to the
beginning, when he told his

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:10.525
step father, Eberhard Anheuser,
his new partner--

00:27:10.525 --> 00:27:14.530
he told him, our businesses
isn't making beer.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:16.050
Our business is making
friends.

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.710
And Gussie believed that
till the day he died.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:22.840
He said that almost every
day at some point.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:26.450
He came to the conclusion that
the company would never go

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:27.915
wrong by doubling down
on patriotism

00:27:27.915 --> 00:27:28.950
and the public good.

00:27:28.950 --> 00:27:32.330
And this was the quote that
struck me when I found it.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.490
He said, "If we do something in
the public interest, which

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.240
at the same time is profitable
to the company, then this is

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.700
indeed very good business." And
as it turned out, at the

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.960
end of this year that they had
where they didn't do any

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.750
advertising except these
patriotic things, the industry

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:54.240
increased by 26%.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.630
And Budweiser sales
went up 176%.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:02.850
And for the next 30,
I don't know, 37--

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:08.080
something like that-- years
with Gussie at the helm,

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:09.880
Anheuser-Busch sold more--

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.970
except for a couple
years in between--

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.010
they sold more than any
brewer on the planet.

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:21.730
And when I was doing this book,
Gussie was like a gift

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:22.310
from the gods.

00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:24.180
He's such an amazing character,
and such an

00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:28.320
indelible figure in
American commerce.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.960
He was the quintessential
robber baron.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.780
He was blunt and coarse and
impatient and vindictive and

00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.820
hot tempered and spoiled.

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:46.320
And he was irascible.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.460
And yet, he was also charming
and charismatic and

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.700
sentimental.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:29:00.360
And he was a guy with unbridled
appetites who ate

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:03.860
life in huge big bites.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:09.950
And he was the greatest beer
salesman who ever lived.

00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.160
He was made to do this.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:18.210
He was married four
times, cheated on

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:19.210
his first three wives.

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:23.560
We don't know about the fourth
because he was in his 80s.

00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:25.300
What's cheating when
you're 83?

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:27.230
I don't know.

00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.610
He had 11 children
during that time.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.710
And he raised them, in the words
of one of his daughters

00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:36.640
who's still living-- and she
told me, daddy raised us with

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:40.410
a great deal of love
and anger.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:43.850
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.470
And he was the guy who
introduced Clydesdales to

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:49.660
America, which is really kind
of an amazing thing if you

00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.150
think about it.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:53.010
Before he hitched Clydesdales
up to those bright red beer

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:56.620
wagons, they were just
mud-splattered farm animals.

00:29:56.620 --> 00:30:00.260
They were draft horses that were
used primarily to haul

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.850
coal and lumber.

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:04.800
But he had this abiding passion
for these animals.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:11.000
And he saw this as a way
to promote beer.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.390
But he didn't just use
them to promote beer.

00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:17.910
He took over the breeding of
Clydesdales in this country.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:19.340
He improved the breed.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.260
He coddled them.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.270
He took care of them.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:27.330
And he made them into
something more.

00:30:27.330 --> 00:30:28.580
He made them heroic.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:36.740
If you see the stables that they
were kept in his estate,

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.730
a stall for a Clydesdale--

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.780
I mean, Clydesdales,
they're huge.

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:42.460
I don't know if you've ever been
up close to one, but they

00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.780
are really big.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.170
And some of them weigh
2,000 pounds.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:48.505
So a stall for a Clydesdale is
about as big as that area of

00:30:48.505 --> 00:30:49.440
the room right there.

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:53.690
And there are apartments in
Manhattan that cost $3,000 a

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:57.560
month that are smaller and not
as nice as a Clydesdale stall.

00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:00.670
So he really did something
for them.

00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:03.870
And it's a big thing.

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:07.510
He made them the most beloved
breed in the world, possibly,

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:10.370
and certainly one of the
most recognizable.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:17.130
He's also the guy that married
beer and baseball, which paved

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.550
the way for Anheuser-Busch to
eventually become synonymous

00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:22.800
with American sport.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:26.250
And he sort of foresaw that,
although in the beginning,

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:30.770
when he bought the team, the
Cardinals, in 1953, he saw it

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:37.060
as an opportunity to own a
giant tavern where 30,000

00:31:37.060 --> 00:31:40.860
people would sit in the
sweltering St. Louis heat with

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:43.530
nothing to slake their thirst
except Budweiser.

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:45.650
This was just too good.

00:31:45.650 --> 00:31:47.080
So that's what he did.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:52.360
And then what happened was,
after he became a baseball

00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:55.220
team owner in addition to being
a brewer, he became a

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.700
national celebrity.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.400
Reporters all over the place
would come to talk to him,

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.870
because he was so colorful
and outrageous.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.300
And he would give them
terrific quotes.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.130
And they would come and listen
to him sound off on women and

00:32:10.130 --> 00:32:12.910
baseball and beer
and whatever.

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:16.290
And he always provided good
copy-- much of it was

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.580
unprintable.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:23.970
And long before Packers coach
Vince Lombardi uttered his

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:26.470
immortal quote--

00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:29.350
what is it? "Winning isn't
everything-- it's the only

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.960
thing."

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.600
Well Gussie had put it much
more succinctly and

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.060
eloquently, I think.

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:39.320
And what he said was, "Being
second isn't worth shit,"

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.700
which didn't get printed
for years.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.090
Because they couldn't print
that word in the papers.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:47.870
So it was handed down as, "Being
second isn't worth

00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:52.470
anything." Because they couldn't
even put in that he

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:53.360
said a bad word.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.070
You couldn't indicate that
in the papers back then.

00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:57.430
But that's how Gussie spoke.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:00.260
There was one thing I mentioned
in the book where he

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:04.830
would do things like, he was
speaking about one long-time

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.300
employee who was retiring.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:08.860
And he was going on and
on about the guy--

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.130
and people there, reporters
there--

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:12.760
and what a great employee
he was.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.990
And then he stopped and he
said, of course, this has

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.950
nothing to do with his wife, who
was the biggest bitch that

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:18.200
ever happened.

00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:23.280
That's Gussie.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:28.246
Anyway, throughout the 1950s and
the 1960s, Gussie was the

00:33:28.246 --> 00:33:28.570
king of beer.

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:29.430
It was undisputed.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:31.390
He was the king of beer
of the planet.

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:35.110
He was the quintessential
beer baron.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:39.060
He was friends with Harry Truman
and Lyndon Johnson.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.250
He raised a ton of money
for Kennedy.

00:33:42.250 --> 00:33:49.460
Hollywood celebrities would
come to his estate in St.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.940
Louis, which was this enormous
gated thing that was named

00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.810
Grant's Farm.

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.005
I don't know if anybody's
heard of it.

00:33:57.005 --> 00:33:58.600
It's not really well known
outside of St. Louis.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.680
But Grant's Farm was named that
because it used to belong

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.530
to Ulysses S Grant, who farmed
it unsuccessfully prior

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:07.040
to the Civil War.

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:09.780
Gussie's father bought it.

00:34:09.780 --> 00:34:13.250
And they developed it into
this amazing thing.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:20.850
And it features a 27 room French
Renaissance chateau on

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:26.269
300 wooded acres with a lake and
a stream and herds of deer

00:34:26.269 --> 00:34:29.600
and elk and antelope and
buffalo, and even

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.560
giraffes and elephants.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.290
And it's an amazing place.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:42.710
And that's where he lived with
his third wife, who was this

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:47.420
beautiful blonde Swiss woman
named Gertrude Trudy, with

00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:48.659
whom he had seven children.

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:51.960
All of them were born and
raised at Grant's Farm.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.790
His father built the house.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:56.719
And the house cost $350,000
in like 1900.

00:34:56.719 --> 00:35:02.030
So that's a very expensive,
very impressive house.

00:35:02.030 --> 00:35:05.630
There's a ballroom on
the third floor.

00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:08.710
And in the main staircase right
off the ballroom-- in

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.630
the ballroom, there's room
for a full orchestra.

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.810
And the main staircase that goes
from the second floor and

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:17.100
down, the ceiling was perforated
so that the sound

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.940
of the orchestra could drift
down through the entire house.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.140
Because you didn't have
speakers back then.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:24.220
Anyway, they spent $350,000
on a house.

00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:25.710
But they also--

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:28.970
his father spent almost
that much on a

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.440
barn for his animals.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.760
And there's a thing--

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.310
I'll digress here.

00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:36.774
There's this structure they
built at Grant's Farm that's

00:35:36.774 --> 00:35:38.130
not like anything
I've ever seen.

00:35:38.130 --> 00:35:39.660
And it may be unique
in America.

00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:41.180
And they called it
the Bauernhof.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.490
And it's basically
a barn that's the

00:35:43.490 --> 00:35:45.910
size of a city block.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:51.870
And it was made to look like the
structures in the medieval

00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:53.110
Bavarian town of Rottenburg.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:58.630
And it was modeled after what
was known as fortress farms.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.390
And fortress farms were back in
the day when I guess there

00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:03.940
was marauders and people
running around.

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.540
The farmers, they would build
a wall around everything.

00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:09.740
And inside the wall, they
kept everything.

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.700
That's where the family lived.

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.740
That's where the working force,
the hands, lived.

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.950
That's where all the
animals were kept.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:16.480
That's where all the equipment--
there was

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.240
a barn around it.

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.630
And this bauernhof
was spectacular.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:24.260
And if you see it today,
it's hard to even take

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:24.990
a picture of it.

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:28.300
And it's hard to
even describe.

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:29.710
And it's not faux.

00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:30.930
It's not like something
Disney does.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:32.045
There's nothing faux about it.

00:36:32.045 --> 00:36:33.080
It's the real deal.

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:35.290
It looks like Rottenburg.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:39.260
And there's living quarters
there for the family, people

00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:41.090
coming in from out of town
when Gussie was there.

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.710
Servants lived there.

00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:51.900
There was a giant place for the
Clydesdales, and a huge

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.630
collection of these
antique carriages

00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:57.450
that all of them collected.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.060
The carriage house has
a room that-- the

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.370
ceiling might be 50 feet.

00:37:00.370 --> 00:37:03.070
And there's animal heads all
over the place of animals that

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.720
have lived and died
on the estate.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:11.090
And the center courtyard of this
place was big enough that

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:15.290
you could comfortably seat 1,000
people for dinner, which

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:16.370
happened a number of times.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.890
They had a dinner for Harry
Truman once there.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:23.540
And then one time, sales of beer
sort of dropped off in

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.180
St. Louis, and Gussie decided
he was going to

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.315
take care of that.

00:37:26.315 --> 00:37:28.730
So he was going to throw a
party for anyone who had

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.500
anything to do with
selling his beer.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:35.720
So he entertained 1,000 people
a night in the courtyard of

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:40.360
the Bauernhof for 11
straight nights.

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.940
And that's how big it is.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:48.720
If you grow up in St. Louis, you
remember you probably took

00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:52.160
a school field trip
to Grant's Farm.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.810
Because at some point during
this thing when Gussie was

00:37:55.810 --> 00:38:00.830
there living with the family,
somebody who was there at one

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:02.870
of his parties said, you know,
you really should-- this is so

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:03.770
marvelous for children.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:05.670
You should open it
up to the public.

00:38:05.670 --> 00:38:06.890
So he decided to do that.

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.800
He decided he would open up part
of it so that you could

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.860
come and you could tour the
animal enclosures, you could

00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.120
see all the grounds
and all that.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.260
You never could see the house.

00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.450
The house is sort of off in
the distance, sort of

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:20.220
mysterious, so that they
kept their privacy.

00:38:20.220 --> 00:38:22.920
But Gussie was this
attention whore.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.240
He just loved to be the
center of attention.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.070
He would just walk over from the
house, and he'd wade into

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:27.670
the crowds.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:35.120
And he had a cockatoo named
Cocky, and pet monkeys and a

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:35.750
baby elephant.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:37.600
He would do tricks like
the ring master.

00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:39.380
And he just couldn't get enough
of the attention.

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.360
They would all gather around.

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:44.150
But it was this sort of magical
beer kingdom he

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:46.610
created that you remember
as a child.

00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.490
Because you rode
a little tram.

00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:51.740
And inner city kids could
literally reach

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:53.570
out and touch a buffalo.

00:38:53.570 --> 00:38:54.710
And this was part of
the legacy of the

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:56.150
family in St. Louis.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:59.440
And I remember it so
well going there.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:04.310
And one of the most fascinating
days I spent in

00:39:04.310 --> 00:39:07.910
the course of doing this
research on this book, I was

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:11.970
allowed to walk around Grant's
Farm and the house and the

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.580
Bauernhof by myself.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.300
And it was just amazing
to see.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.950
Because I had all these
childhood memories.

00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:18.200
And it's still there.

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:27.970
But from the '50s and '60s and
into the '70s, it was Camelot.

00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:31.110
It was Gussie and his wife Trudy
and the seven kids, and

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:32.550
the kids all worked
on the place.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:34.200
And it was just spectacular.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.590
And then, something happened
that sort of changed things

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.530
and led to a lot of stuff.

00:39:39.530 --> 00:39:43.900
And I'll read my final passage
here about this.

00:39:47.341 --> 00:39:49.490
"It was cold and raining
in St. Louis on

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.840
December 16, 1974.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:54.540
The big house at Grant's Farm
was bustling with preparations

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.630
for the annual party celebrating
the feast of St.

00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:59.990
Nicholas, the Old World patron
saint of children, and a

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.080
precursor to the modern
day Santa Claus.

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.700
Trudy always made a big deal out
of St. Nicholas Day, the

00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.220
highlight of which was a visit
from an elaborately costumed

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:09.880
St. Nick who would suddenly
emerge from the trees and

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:13.460
enter the house carrying a bag
full of fruits, nuts, and

00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:15.320
presents that he poured
out onto the floor and

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.750
distributed to kids.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:19.650
The last thing St. Nick pulled
from the bag was a sapling

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:23.230
whipping switch, which he held
ominously in one hand while

00:40:23.230 --> 00:40:25.920
relating all the naughty and
nice things each child had

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.930
done that year.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:30.000
St. Nick was usually Trudy's
brother Willy, and the older

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.010
kids were sworn not to
tell the young ones."

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:33.950
I forgot to say something.

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:35.580
I have to set this up.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.300
Bear with me a minute.

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:41.740
Right before this, the
Arab oil embargo hit.

00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:45.420
And what happened was, because
America's supporting Israel

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:51.360
during the Yom Kippur War, the
oil exporting nations in the

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.970
Middle East stopped
selling us oil.

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:56.680
They just cut it off, and the
price of oil went totally off

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:57.050
the charts.

00:40:57.050 --> 00:41:01.300
And it just wreaked havoc
on the economy.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:04.220
And in California at that time,
you could only get gas

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.290
on every other day depending on
whether your license plate

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:10.830
ended in an even or
an odd number.

00:41:10.830 --> 00:41:12.566
And the waits were like
an hour and a half.

00:41:12.566 --> 00:41:13.930
And it hit business
really hard.

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.990
And everybody was
losing money.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.070
And at Anheuser-Busch,
everything was

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:18.730
delivered on trucks.

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:21.020
So they were trying
to cut costs.

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.030
And so there was a meeting.

00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:27.850
And in this meeting, Gussie
suggested that the patriotic

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:29.470
thing to do, and the good thing
to do for business, were

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.020
that all the executives were
going to get rid of their

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.470
company car.

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.990
Because we can't afford
that, and that's a

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:39.690
place to cut cost.

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:43.180
The problem was, he didn't
include himself in that, OK?

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:47.070
He had five cars, including
one for the family.

00:41:47.070 --> 00:41:51.260
And they had a big heavy black
limousine that carried the

00:41:51.260 --> 00:41:53.400
children to and from school.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.480
So there was a big
fight about this.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.200
And one of the executives
resigned over it.

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:00.580
And they never did have
to turn in their cars.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.780
But they did trade out some of
the big cars, the company

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:08.830
cars, for smaller cars,
including the big sedan that

00:42:08.830 --> 00:42:11.890
carried the children, which
they swapped out for a

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:15.160
Volkswagen van to save money.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.190
That's where I forgot--

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.780
back to this.

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:22.140
"At 4:00 PM that afternoon on
Highway 244 just a few miles

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:25.110
from Grant's Farm, a tractor
trailer truck skidded off the

00:42:25.110 --> 00:42:28.120
pavement and hurdled across
the grass median into the

00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:32.070
opposite traffic lanes where it
struck a car, jackknifed,

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.850
and then collided head-on with
a Volkswagen van carrying the

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.570
two youngest Busch children--

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:39.480
11 year-old Andrew and
eight-year-old Christina--

00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.480
on their way home from school.

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:44.470
The 50 foot flatbed rig cut
through the thin metal skin of

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:47.310
the van like a can opener,
severing the legs of the Busch

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:51.300
family's long-time chauffeur,
Nathan Mays.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.145
Andrew Busch was thrown through
the front window of

00:42:53.145 --> 00:42:55.450
the van and suffered serious
head injuries.

00:42:55.450 --> 00:42:57.750
Christina, who was sitting
directly behind Mays, suffered

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.880
devastating head and
abdominal injuries.

00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:02.180
Witnesses said the little girl
made it to the hospital alive

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.640
only because a car carrying five
nurses happened by the

00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.820
accident, and they administered
to her and Andrew

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:08.730
until the ambulance arrived.

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:11.120
15-year-old Billy Busch was
waiting at his school for

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:12.090
Nathan to pick him up.

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:14.892
When the van didn't arrive by
5:00, he called home and was

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:17.240
told there'd been an accident
and someone else would come

00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.760
for him shortly.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:21.100
He was taken straight to St.
John's Mercy Hospital, where

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:24.170
much of the family had already
gathered in a waiting room.

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:26.600
'I remember thinking, this can't
be true,' Billy said of

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:27.380
the scene he'd encountered.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:30.170
'Christina was in the ICU, and
mom told me they had all these

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:31.990
wires running in and out
of her and she couldn't

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:33.180
breath on her own.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:35.470
They told me that Andrew was
going to be OK, but Nathan was

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.520
dead, which really upset
me, because I was

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.700
very close to him.

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:41.090
But I thought Cristina would get
better, because dad would

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:42.200
make it all right.

00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:45.010
He would get the best doctors
and they would fix her.' The

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.500
most shocking thing to Billy was
the effect of the tragedy

00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:50.400
on his father, who was collapsed
in a chair, sobbing

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.730
uncontrollably, unable to
take charge of anything.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:55.910
'I'd ever seen dad like that,'
he said. 'It was like

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:59.230
everything had been taken out of
him.' Gussie doted on Tina,

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.140
his 11th child, born
when he was 67.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:04.670
Blonde and blue-eyed like her
mother, she was the last of

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:06.370
the Mohicans, he liked to say.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.000
He called her his little
honeybee and allowed her to

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.110
climb up on his lap at the
dinner table and take out his

00:44:10.110 --> 00:44:12.120
false teeth and run
away with them.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.270
He always danced with her at
family parties, and the sight

00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:16.960
of the two of them, the oldest
and youngest of the Busch clan

00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.870
delighting in one another,
always caused

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:20.440
people to stop and watch.

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:22.465
Now, they were both broken
beyond fixing.

00:44:22.465 --> 00:44:25.300
'The doctors told us that
if they turned off the

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.770
ventilator, that Christina
probably would not survive.

00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:29.550
And if she did, she would
probably be a vegetable

00:44:29.550 --> 00:44:31.240
anyway,' recalled Adolphus IV.

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:34.210
'But mom and dad kept her on it
for 11 days to explore any

00:44:34.210 --> 00:44:35.540
possible scenario.

00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:37.600
They were looking for some
expert somewhere who might say

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:38.930
there was a chance.

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:40.070
There was no chance, however.

00:44:40.070 --> 00:44:43.000
On December 17, the ventilator
finally was turned off, and

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.560
the baby of the Busch family
died, along with a big part of

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:48.210
her father, who would
never fully recover.

00:44:48.210 --> 00:44:52.650
'I understand why dad felt so
bad,' said Billy. 'But I

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:54.090
thought he would come back.'

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:56.700
Instead, from what had been an
incredibly happy family where

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:58.810
everything went so wonderfully,
it all began to

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:00.430
fall apart."

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:04.330
Now, this struck me.

00:45:04.330 --> 00:45:08.430
Because this is a story
about a business.

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:10.180
But it's also about a family.

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.210
And that's the one thing
that I really--

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:18.850
getting inside the family, I
was given access to some

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:19.430
members of the family.

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:20.460
They had never talked before.

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:23.500
They were like these cardboard
cut out rich people in most

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.960
people in St. Louis' mind.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.920
And I got a chance to sort of
see what it was like inside

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.800
the family.

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.380
And they were a family.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:33.300
And the kids would show at
dinner, and they had to have

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.010
their pajamas on and
the whole bit.

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:38.460
And it was very much
Ozzie and Harriet--

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:40.140
very rich Ozzie and Harriet.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:42.710
But again, it was
still a family.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:47.040
And this particular personal
incident caused

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.160
all sorts of things.

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.970
Everything turned on
this historically.

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:54.460
This causes a whole chain
of events to happen--

00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:57.330
that I won't go into, because I
don't want to take away the

00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:59.350
enjoyment of reading
the book--

00:45:59.350 --> 00:46:04.520
that had to do with who
succeeded Gussie after this

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:05.065
was all over.

00:46:05.065 --> 00:46:07.710
And everything sort
of turned on this.

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.310
And I won't go into it.

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:14.770
But it sort of was the end of
the magical beer kingdom that

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:16.380
he created there.

00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:19.330
Now, he lived quite some time
after this, Gussie did.

00:46:19.330 --> 00:46:24.790
He died at Grant's Farm in the
same bedroom his father had

00:46:24.790 --> 00:46:31.110
died in 55 years before at the
ripe old age of 89 and married

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.360
to his fourth wife.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:39.820
He died a very rich guy.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:43.700
He was pretty much just as rich
as Adolphus when he died.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:48.790
He controlled 35 million shares
of Anheuser-Busch,

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:52.000
which all passed to
family members.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.230
And each of his 10 surviving
children got

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:59.680
big chunks of stock.

00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:02.390
He had three different
families of children.

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:05.940
Depending on what family
you were in, you

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.100
got x amount of stock.

00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:10.455
And the children who were born
and raised at Grant's

00:47:10.455 --> 00:47:11.320
Farm got the most.

00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:16.160
And they got 750,000
shares each.

00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:19.080
So they never, ever
had to work again.

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:21.130
And some of them never did.

00:47:21.130 --> 00:47:25.460
And the stock split a whole
bunch of time-- not a whole

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:28.070
bunch, but half a
dozen times--

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:29.530
after Gussie died.

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:33.190
And the only one of them
who never sold a

00:47:33.190 --> 00:47:35.560
share of his stock--

00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.560
he was determined.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.820
He wasn't going to sell it,
because his dad never sold a

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:39.940
share in his whole life.

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:40.970
He had never sold a share.

00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:42.450
The others all diversified.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:47.030
But it was Billy Busch who
held onto every share.

00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:52.330
And so when the company was
bought out in 2008 at $70 a

00:47:52.330 --> 00:47:57.920
share, Billy Busch reaped
this huge fortune.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:01.450
He made like $100 million.

00:48:01.450 --> 00:48:09.700
And he decided that he didn't
like the idea-- he'd never

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:10.370
worked for the brewery.

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:13.510
But he decided that he didn't
like the idea that after 150

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:15.020
years of being part
of the community--

00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:18.360
and Anheuser-Busch, you can't
walk four blocks in St. Louis

00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.760
without Anheuser-Busch's name
on something that they

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:22.090
donated money to.

00:48:22.090 --> 00:48:24.380
He didn't like the idea that
they weren't in the business,

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:25.690
and they weren't part of the
community anymore, and they

00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:26.760
were just rich people.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:32.900
So he took a chunk of his
inheritance, and he invested

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:36.240
in a beer company, which makes
the beer that you're drinking

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:38.860
right now, and that
Julie went to

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:39.930
considerable trouble to get.

00:48:39.930 --> 00:48:43.740
Because it's only sold, by the
way, in Missouri and Illinois.

00:48:43.740 --> 00:48:46.760
And it's the William K Busch
Brewing Company.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.720
And it's the only beer that I
know of that's made according

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.550
to these ancient Bavarian laws
that says that beer can only

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:54.820
have four ingredients--

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:58.300
water, hops, yeast,
and barley--

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.660
that's it, for what
it's worth.

00:49:00.660 --> 00:49:08.080
And so for me, it was like
a nice coda to the story.

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:10.290
The arc of the story from Gussie
in the magical beer

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:15.430
kingdom to the buyout, there's
a lot of tragedy in it, and a

00:49:15.430 --> 00:49:18.290
lot of ugly stuff
that took place.

00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:21.220
But this provided sort
of an upbeat ending.

00:49:21.220 --> 00:49:28.600
Because 157 years after Adolphus
lands in St. Louis

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:34.110
and starts this dynasty, his
great grandson, William K

00:49:34.110 --> 00:49:39.600
Billy Busch, is now the owner
of the smallest beer company

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.100
in St. Louis.

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:45.020
So it's sort of a full circle.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.620
That's all I have in
terms of narrative.

00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:48.440
But I'd be happy to answer
any questions you

00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:51.160
have about beer, whatever.

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:52.150
I'm not a beer expert.

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:56.650
But feel free--

00:49:56.650 --> 00:49:59.430
anyone out there, America.

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:00.980
AUDIENCE: What's your
favorite beer?

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:01.650
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER:
My favorite beer?

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:04.320
Well, you know, I grew up on
Budweiser, drank a lot of

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.410
Budweiser in my time.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.280
And then as I got older,
my love affair

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:09.350
with Budweiser waned.

00:50:09.350 --> 00:50:13.250
And I played around with
foreign beers in green

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:16.570
bottles, cheated on
my first love.

00:50:19.150 --> 00:50:20.970
And I tried everything.

00:50:20.970 --> 00:50:22.600
But I kind of settled on--

00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:30.110
I like Harp lager, which is a
lager made by Guinness, an

00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:34.210
Irish lager of all things.

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:38.340
Microbrews and craft beers
tend to be sweet to me.

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:41.200
I like beers that have
bite to them.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.390
Anheuser-Busch products
are kind of not

00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:46.220
too exciting anymore.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:50.570
They changed their formula
a lot over the years.

00:50:50.570 --> 00:50:52.840
So Harp lager would
be my favorite.

00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:54.000
I don't drink it anymore.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.433
As I told someone earlier, I
decided a few years back that

00:50:56.433 --> 00:50:58.180
it was time for me to get out
of the way and let the young

00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.900
people have some.

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.770
But I had my share.

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:03.570
I didn't turn many away.

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:04.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:10.910
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Well,
there's probably some guys

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:12.030
from Anheuser-Busch.

00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:14.980
Everybody cashed out
for a lot of money.

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:18.850
Nobody in the family is.

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:22.200
They've all moved on.

00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.510
And most of the executives
took buy-outs.

00:51:24.510 --> 00:51:26.170
The guys who bought it--

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:28.170
Anheuser-Busch is not the
same company anymore.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:31.600
InBev, which bought
Anheuser-Busch in 2008--

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.110
four years before, that
company did not exist.

00:51:34.110 --> 00:51:37.860
It's basically an investment
portfolio of beer brands owned

00:51:37.860 --> 00:51:41.025
by these three billionaires
from Brazil.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:46.480
They made their money in banking
and because they own

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:47.990
the Walmart of Brazil.

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:49.445
And they bought a bunch
of old breweries.

00:51:49.445 --> 00:51:52.650
And they sort of conglomerated
up.

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:58.650
So if you go there now, it's
inevitable what will happen.

00:51:58.650 --> 00:52:02.800
They sort of run Grant's Farm,
and it's not quite as clean as

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.690
it used to be.

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:06.530
There's stuff on the floor.

00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:08.410
You used to be able to eat off
the floors in the stable.

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:09.280
It's not like that anymore.

00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:10.530
They don't care that much.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:17.460
What happened with
Anheuser-Busch, at least in my

00:52:17.460 --> 00:52:23.200
opinion, is that they were done
in by globalization and,

00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:24.980
if you read it, drug
addiction.

00:52:24.980 --> 00:52:27.660
That's what took it down.

00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.050
And it's the same brand.

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:36.930
But they're now using malt
extracts, and they're using

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:40.250
all this stuff that the Busch
family would never have done.

00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:43.660
The Busch family, they're
viewed now--

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.250
Anheuser-Busch--

00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:46.720
by a lot of the craft beer world
as like, they were the

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.170
big behemoth of the enemy.

00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:51.560
But they started out as
a craft beer company.

00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:53.590
They were the littlest
beer company.

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:56.310
And they became Goliath.

00:52:56.310 --> 00:53:00.440
But they definitely would not
use-- they used only natural

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:00.990
ingredients.

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:04.410
They wouldn't change, even
though it cost more.

00:53:04.410 --> 00:53:07.540
All their competitors, like
Schlitz, which went down, and

00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:11.290
all the others, they did all
these things to hurry up the

00:53:11.290 --> 00:53:12.300
aging process.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.900
But Gussie wouldn't
hear of it.

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.290
His father wouldn't hear
of it, no, no.

00:53:16.290 --> 00:53:19.380
They aged that beer
30, 45 days.

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.840
And you had Schlitz, who was
their competitor, getting the

00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:24.080
beer out in 10.

00:53:24.080 --> 00:53:27.890
So they maintained quality.

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:29.330
And it's not going to be
like that anymore.

00:53:29.330 --> 00:53:33.600
You may not like the beer, but
they did stand for that.

00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:37.630
And whether or not you
liked the taste,

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:38.830
they maintained quality.

00:53:38.830 --> 00:53:40.600
And that sort of changed.

00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.150
And they're not as connected
to the--

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:47.950
if you think about it, since
I wrote the book--

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:49.910
and I may even have
that in there.

00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:51.260
Yeah, I do have it in there.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:51.770
It's this.

00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:53.780
I got it.

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.010
The guys who took over, the
Brazilian guys, when they

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.330
bought Anheuser-Busch, in order
to buy it, they when

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:00.430
into debt, OK?

00:54:00.430 --> 00:54:04.310
They borrowed all this money--
$50-some billion.

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:05.630
I don't know what it was.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:08.160
And then, they had to
pay that down, OK?

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:10.610
So they had to cut costs.

00:54:10.610 --> 00:54:14.240
And they negotiated contracts
that paid them bonuses based

00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:16.780
on how much cost cutting
they did, not how

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.140
much beer they sold.

00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:20.010
So they didn't sell
any more beer.

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:22.200
They didn't create any
more brand loyalty.

00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.600
They didn't do any of that.

00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:25.650
What they did was cut costs.

00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:27.730
So they sold off this and
they sold off that.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:32.030
And they got rid of 1,000 or
1,500 people in St. Louis.

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:35.190
And because they cut costs,
they qualified

00:54:35.190 --> 00:54:37.310
for these huge bonuses.

00:54:37.310 --> 00:54:39.670
And the one guy,
Carlos Brito--

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:42.350
when this came out, it
was sort of shocking.

00:54:42.350 --> 00:54:44.130
He'd been there a year and a
half or two years and he

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:49.480
already qualified for a
$200 million bonus.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.610
The group of executives who came
and took over totally got

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:54.265
bonuses worth $1.2 billion.

00:54:54.265 --> 00:54:59.920
Now, $200 million was what
Gussie Busch was worth when he

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.310
left the company
after 50 years.

00:55:02.310 --> 00:55:06.760
This guy came in and made $200
million because of cost

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:10.120
cutting in two years.

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.400
And so it's a different
sort of thing.

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:15.750
And it's sort of what's happened
in American business.

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:18.380
Back then, when the Busch
family ran it, they were

00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:20.230
imperious, and they were
all this other stuff.

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:22.280
And there's all sorts of things
you could criticize.

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:27.540
But the company wasn't just
about trying to return the

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:33.470
highest possible rate of
return to investors.

00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:36.020
It was about all kinds
of other stuff.

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:37.520
Yeah, they had to
do that, too.

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:42.000
But they were really
serious about jobs.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.330
They were very proud of the fact
that when you worked for

00:55:44.330 --> 00:55:46.590
Anheuser-Busch, you worked
for the gold

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:47.970
standard in St. Louis.

00:55:47.970 --> 00:55:50.640
Everybody knew that if you
worked at Anheuser-Busch, you

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:54.430
got the best benefits, you had
the best medical care, you had

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:55.320
all the perks.

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.860
And that was what
they stood for--

00:55:56.860 --> 00:55:58.910
we are a classy operation.

00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:59.790
And they spent money.

00:55:59.790 --> 00:56:02.980
Now, people who come in to buy
companies go, we don't need

00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:03.670
that, we don't need that.

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:05.460
What about the way we're
feeding these horses?

00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.560
Forget it, give them
some cheaper--

00:56:06.560 --> 00:56:07.570
that's how they do it.

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:09.630
They cut costs and get
bonuses on it.

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:16.860
So Anheuser-Busch InBev will
continue to be a company for

00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:18.230
the foreseeable future.

00:56:18.230 --> 00:56:19.500
But it won't be the
same company.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:25.370
It won't have that soul that
the Busch family gave it.

00:56:25.370 --> 00:56:27.366
And they kind of went
the way of all

00:56:27.366 --> 00:56:29.210
American business dynasties.

00:56:29.210 --> 00:56:30.390
There aren't many left.

00:56:30.390 --> 00:56:33.850
I think they may have been
the last great one.

00:56:33.850 --> 00:56:37.829
So that's a long answer to
a short third question.

00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:39.705
AUDIENCE: What about
the brew-pub thing?

00:56:39.705 --> 00:56:42.988
Because you said that you can't
produce beer and also

00:56:42.988 --> 00:56:44.395
own the establishment
that you sell.

00:56:44.395 --> 00:56:45.961
So how does it work when you
own a brew-pub where you

00:56:45.961 --> 00:56:47.473
actually have the brewing
equipment there, and then you

00:56:47.473 --> 00:56:48.335
own the bar and--

00:56:48.335 --> 00:56:50.200
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: You
know, I don't know.

00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.575
There must be some sort of--

00:56:51.575 --> 00:56:52.885
he's asking about the--

00:56:52.885 --> 00:56:54.188
out there.

00:56:54.188 --> 00:56:56.740
AUDIENCE: It's changed in
the past [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:57.210
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: What?

00:56:57.210 --> 00:56:58.450
AUDIENCE: It's changed
in the past 20 years.

00:56:58.450 --> 00:57:00.450
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: OK,
I don't know that.

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:02.440
He's asking about why you
can own a brew-pub and

00:57:02.440 --> 00:57:03.460
sell your own beer.

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.960
I think it's probably there's
some rule that if you bake it

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.120
right there, you can sell
it right there, but

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.153
you can't sell it--

00:57:08.153 --> 00:57:09.490
AUDIENCE: No, you need
a retail license.

00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:10.832
If you have a retail license,
then you can

00:57:10.832 --> 00:57:12.440
sell beer on the premises.

00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.270
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: But
Anheuser-Busch can't.

00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:15.530
AUDIENCE: Because they
are [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:15.530 --> 00:57:17.270
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Yeah, they
can't sell their beer on

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.810
their property.

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:19.690
They can give it away, but
they can't sell it.

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:20.800
They do give it away somewhat.

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.290
If you go through the
Anheuser-Busch plant in St.

00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:27.540
Louis, you get some free
beer at the end--

00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:30.970
another big attraction
in Missouri.

00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:32.680
If you ever got to Missouri--

00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:35.730
but you should go to Grant's
Farm and see the Bauernhof.

00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:36.645
It's amazing.

00:57:36.645 --> 00:57:38.890
Anybody else?

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:39.783
Yes.

00:57:39.783 --> 00:57:42.741
AUDIENCE: So I've heard that
there are sometimes

00:57:42.741 --> 00:57:44.220
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:44.220 --> 00:57:48.903
various variations on the
products so that you have more

00:57:48.903 --> 00:57:51.122
choices but they're all
in the same stores.

00:57:51.122 --> 00:57:55.276
And also they're trying to
cut into craft beer.

00:57:58.168 --> 00:58:02.506
Do you think they have
a future [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:02.506 --> 00:58:04.434
Are they going to cut into
craft beer [INAUDIBLE]?

00:58:07.130 --> 00:58:09.690
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: He's
asking about the future of

00:58:09.690 --> 00:58:13.020
Anheuser-Busch versus craft
beer and how they do them.

00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:16.110
Yeah, I think they have been
doing that for years.

00:58:16.110 --> 00:58:20.780
All the major beer
manufacturers, brewers, know

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.500
about craft beer and
how it's coming up.

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:26.370
And they're trying
to co-opt that.

00:58:26.370 --> 00:58:28.280
And what they'll do
is, they'll buy.

00:58:28.280 --> 00:58:32.310
If you're a craft brewer
and you're doing well,

00:58:32.310 --> 00:58:34.710
Anheuser-Busch is going to knock
on your door and say,

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:35.630
we'd like to buy your company.

00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:37.660
That's how big companies
always do it.

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:41.390
As far as all the products that
they have on the shelves

00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:43.540
that all lead to the same thing,
well, that's kind of

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:49.100
what every food products
company does.

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.450
And they try and get more
and more shelf space.

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:55.050
Proctor and Gamble does that
with its soap products.

00:58:55.050 --> 00:58:58.190
General Mills does that with
its cereal products.

00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:01.620
You walk through the store, and
if you can take up 10 feet

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.550
of shelf space and whatever
they reach for is yours,

00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:05.530
you're better off than
if you just have two.

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:06.310
So that's what they do.

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:08.280
But yeah, I think they
probably are

00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.900
threatened by that.

00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:13.630
Because your generation of
people has turned away from

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.250
traditional beers.

00:59:15.250 --> 00:59:18.240
And it's probably hurting
them quite badly.

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:24.390
And I think they'll survive by
buying up, and there'll be

00:59:24.390 --> 00:59:26.673
craft brewers that sell out
for a lot of money.

00:59:26.673 --> 00:59:29.984
AUDIENCE: Sort of the reverse
question, but these things are

00:59:29.984 --> 00:59:31.234
relevant [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:41.470
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Could
be, but that's not--

00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:43.640
what happened with
Anheuser-Busch, the problem

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.960
was that they didn't
globalize.

00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:51.090
Gussie Busch's son, August III,
who took over after him--

00:59:51.090 --> 00:59:54.060
and that's a whole
big story there--

00:59:56.740 --> 00:59:58.950
he pushed them to heights that
Gussie never imagined.

00:59:58.950 --> 01:00:02.500
He made them the global power.

01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:07.310
But they never responded to
companies like InBev, which

01:00:07.310 --> 01:00:09.370
started buying up breweries
all over the country,

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.030
all over the world.

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:10.900
He didn't want to do that.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:13.790
He wanted to keep getting
a bigger and bigger

01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:16.640
share of the US market.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.570
He thought they could
get 60%--

01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:20.560
they were at 52%--

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.840
because the US market was
the most profitable.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.210
And he didn't try--

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:27.300
he thought he would lose control
if he partnered up

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:29.050
with owning breweries
here and there.

01:00:29.050 --> 01:00:30.830
And he always found a
reason not to do it.

01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:33.060
And that was a short-sighted
thing.

01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:35.990
So that all of a sudden, they
went from being the biggest

01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:38.420
brewer to the second biggest
brewer to the third biggest.

01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:40.180
And they lost power.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.600
And that's sort of what led to--
all of a sudden, there

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.740
was somebody big enough to come
in and take them over.

01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.270
That was unthinkable for
the previous 60 years.

01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:51.290
There was nobody big enough
to come in and take over

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:51.570
Anheuser-Busch.

01:00:51.570 --> 01:00:52.740
They were it.

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:55.970
So the craft brew thing,
I don't know if

01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:57.170
that toppled them--

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:58.970
I don't think so.

01:00:58.970 --> 01:01:01.360
And I don't think it'll
topple them now.

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.580
I think that it'll get
bigger and bigger.

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:09.880
But if you took all the craft
brewers in the country and put

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:15.200
their output up against the
two big beer companies,

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:15.760
they're not--

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:18.190
AUDIENCE: I'm not saying
to topple [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:22.570 --> 01:01:23.580
WILLIAM KNOEDELSEDER: Yeah,
well it could be.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:27.540
Yeah, I think that there's a big
future in craft brewing.

01:01:27.540 --> 01:01:30.590
Because beer is now a thing
where you pair certain beers

01:01:30.590 --> 01:01:32.040
with certain foods.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:34.480
Nobody thought about that back
when they were coming up with

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.040
Bud Light, let me tell you.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.740
Bud Light-- goes with anything,
because it doesn't

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.360
taste like anything.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.610
Anyone else--

01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:47.070
out there in America, anybody?

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:49.060
That's it?

01:01:49.060 --> 01:01:50.470
Thanks for coming everybody.

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:51.070
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:51.070 --> 01:01:55.378
[APPLAUSE]
