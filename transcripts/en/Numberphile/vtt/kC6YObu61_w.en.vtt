MALE SPEAKER: What are
you about to show us?

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.215
RIA SYMONDS: Why 7 is
a happy number.

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:05.750
So let's start with
the number 7.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.040
So let's square 7, because all
numbers like to be squared.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.530
I'm sure that's the root
of all happiness.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.692
So 7 squared gives us 49.

00:00:20.692 --> 00:00:24.655
So I'm going to take each of
those digits and square those.

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:26.210
So 4 squared.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.050
I'm going to add
them together.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:35.980
So I get 16 plus 81 equals 97.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.460
So let's square each of those.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.920
81 plus 49.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.132
That gives me 130.

00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:47.450
Let's try again.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.800
1 squared plus 3 squared plus
0 squared gives me 10.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.000
One more iteration, and I
think we'll be there.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.690
1 squared plus 0 squared
equals 1.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.170
This makes my number
7 a happy number.

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.690
It's happy because it ends up
with 1, which 1 is your first

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.660
natural number.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.200
It's the number all numbers
are based upon.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.120
If it's different,
you won't get 1.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.600
That means this number
will be a sad number.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.880
It's not particularly
important.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.130
It's just fun.
