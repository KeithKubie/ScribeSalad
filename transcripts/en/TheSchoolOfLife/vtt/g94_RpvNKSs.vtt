00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.919
One of the great burdens which our Romantic
culture has imposed upon long-term relationships

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:12.620
is the idea that love and sexual fulfillment
must always, if things are working as they

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.720
should, fit neatly together. This beautiful
and hugely convenient idea raises a passionate

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:25.590
hope that over many years two people will
not only like and help one another, manage

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:33.180
their domestic finances reasonably well, perhaps
raise a family, have enjoyable holidays, understand

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.460
one another’s problems, schedule cleaning
rotas, put up with each other’s failings,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.780
see each others’ parents and friends and
pursue their careers in harmony, but they

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:53.210
will also be devoted and exciting sexual partners,
endlessly entwining and recombining, sometimes

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.970
being gentle and slow, at others, brutal and
urgent, travelling together on a shared, life-long

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.460
erotic adventure. It’s this sublime idea
that begins to torment us when – as is the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.860
case in almost every relationship – sex
starts with time to get at once less intense

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.159
and less frequent, more cautious and more
frustrating, more at odds with daily life

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.220
and eventually definitively more daunting
as a prospect than reading a book, watching

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.510
the news together or simply going to sleep.
This can appear nothing short of a catastrophe,

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:40.140
a sign of monstrous failing and very often
a prelude to a break-up. And yet the problem

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.700
is not ours alone. It is simply that almost
everything that can make love go well seems

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.979
primed not to make sex go well – and vice
versa. We are afflicted by a fundamental misalignment

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.659
in the qualities of character and spirit required
by good sex on the one hand and successful

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.920
love on the other. A relationship cannot survive
in the long term without tenderness, soberness,

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.390
practical intelligence and selective resignation.
We have carefully to fathom another’s motives,

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:23.761
explain our moods, overcome hurts and sulks
and assume a mantle of predictability. Sex

00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:30.500
on the other hand, in its most dramatic, thrilling
versions, demands that we be heedless, decadent,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.569
perhaps cruel or untenably submissive. It
can involve the crudest language and moments

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.180
of sublime degradation. In having to suffer
from feelings of inadequacy around what happens

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.989
in long-term love, we are the victims of major
cultural failure: the failure of our surrounding

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.520
culture to continually stress a realistic
picture of an unavoidable tension between

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.790
two crucial yet incompatible themes of existence.
In a wiser world, we would collectively admit

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:12.140
that the very rare cases where love and sex
did run together were astonishing exceptions

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.790
with no relevance whatsoever to most of our
lives. We would instead learn to pay admiring

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.510
attention to those who had accepted with a
reasonable show of dignity and grace that

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:31.230
the natural price of long-term togetherness
is a decline in the quality and frequency

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:38.530
of sexual contact – and that this is, in
a great many cases, a price very much worth

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.600
paying.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.240
Our Sex book explores how sex truely operates.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:53.640
and that far from thinking about sex too much, we haven't begun to think about it nearly enough.
