00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.710
We covered a lot of
ground in this lesson.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.140
You've learned about user research,

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.610
which allows you to figure
out what users' needs are,

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.270
what they say they want, and
how they use existing products.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.570
&gt;&gt; We also learned about validating your
idea through market demands, trends, and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.440
competitive analysis.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.760
Sometimes, as you validate your
original idea might change or

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.120
be scrapped, and that's okay.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.420
Like any good entrepreneur, you have
to continue validating your hunches.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.360
&gt;&gt; Once you have a valided idea and

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.820
something users want, you'll need to
deliver a product to the end user.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.850
We'll cover how to think
about your users and

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.320
how to design great experiences for
them in the next lesson.
