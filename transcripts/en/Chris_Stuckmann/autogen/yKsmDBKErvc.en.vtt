each other one of them's on the phone
the others in person this is just such a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
the others in person this is just such a
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.179

the film hasn't been made up until now
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990
the film hasn't been made up until now
because not only is it a very relevant

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
because not only is it a very relevant
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.810

has taken a considerably more mainstream
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.170
has taken a considerably more mainstream
approach and I think that was a very

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180
approach and I think that was a very
 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.899
approach and I think that was a very
wise decision because this film needs to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
wise decision because this film needs to
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.580
wise decision because this film needs to
be seen by as many people as possible

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
be seen by as many people as possible
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.249
be seen by as many people as possible
and to do so you kind of have to adopt

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259
and to do so you kind of have to adopt
 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.319
and to do so you kind of have to adopt
more of a crowd-pleasing element to your

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
more of a crowd-pleasing element to your
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.539
more of a crowd-pleasing element to your

film even though the story is very dark
 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.030
film even though the story is very dark
and in so doing I feel like a lot more

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
and in so doing I feel like a lot more
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.620
and in so doing I feel like a lot more
people are going to see this movie and a

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630
people are going to see this movie and a
 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.300

there are some historical inaccuracies

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
there are some historical inaccuracies
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.999
there are some historical inaccuracies
throughout the film and some things have

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
throughout the film and some things have
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.069
throughout the film and some things have
been more embellished to create more of

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079
been more embellished to create more of
 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.649
been more embellished to create more of
a theatrical experience and I'm assuming

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659
a theatrical experience and I'm assuming
 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.330
a theatrical experience and I'm assuming
that more than likely some people will

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340
that more than likely some people will
 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.370
that more than likely some people will
find fault with that and thus say this

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
find fault with that and thus say this
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.249
find fault with that and thus say this
is a bad film or be angry about that but

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
is a bad film or be angry about that but
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.319
is a bad film or be angry about that but
