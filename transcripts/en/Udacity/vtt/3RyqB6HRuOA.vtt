00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.685
Let's think first how to get e to the x by itself. Before we do anything else,

00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:10.530
we need to subtract 23 from both sides. That leaves us with 3e to the x equals

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.375
323. To get e to the x alone, all we need to do now is to divide both sides by

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:19.717
3. Now, I could come up with a decimal for the right-hand side here, but I

00:00:19.717 --> 00:00:23.820
don't think it's going to be very pretty. So, I'm just going to leave this as

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.325
an improper fraction for now. So we have e to the x equals 323 over 3. Now, I

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:34.616
want to get x by itself, and what do I need to do? Well, I need to take the log

00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:38.154
of both sides and the base of that log needs to be the same as the base we have

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:46.107
here, which is e. So I have ln of e to the x equals ln of 323 over 3. We know

00:00:46.107 --> 00:00:52.056
that the left-hand side will reduce just to x. That's why we picked a log of

00:00:52.056 --> 00:00:55.880
this base after all. To figure out what the right-hand side evaluates to, we

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:04.720
have to use our calculator. Okay, so natural log of 323 divided by 3. Double

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.968
check that we've add the correct thing here and that looks right to me. That

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:14.161
equals 4.679 and so on. We said we wanted our answer to just two decimal

00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:18.639
places, so that should be 4.68.
