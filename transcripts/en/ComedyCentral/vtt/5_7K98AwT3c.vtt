00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:01.868
I'm born
and raised in Brooklyn,

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:03.336
so I could tell you're not
from here but you fit in well.

00:00:03.369 --> 00:00:04.771
Thank you so much.
I'm telling you, dude,

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.372
like when you order a coffee,
you just order the coffee.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.141
You don't talk about
the integrity of the bean.

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.476
No. I'm like, "Give me
that latte, straight up."

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.178
Yeah.
You're from Ridgewood, right?

00:00:12.211 --> 00:00:13.946
Ridgewood-Bushwick
borderline, yeah.

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:15.448
Why are you so shady?
It's not about shady.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.517
It's when Mayor Bloomberg
was the mayor,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.952
he changed the borderlines.
I was born in Brooklyn,

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:21.687
made it Queens,
so now I have a identity crisis.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.657
So you know what it feels like
when the border crosses you.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:25.358
See?

00:00:28.127 --> 00:00:29.195
What's up, everybody.

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:30.997
Welcome to Stupid Questions
with Chris Distefano.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.900 line:83%
I'm here with my boy,
Arturo Castro,

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.335
who's got a new show
coming out on Comedy Central,

00:00:36.368 --> 00:00:37.970
called Alternatino.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.240
Just rolls off the tongue,
really. I like it.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.976 line:76%
What would you rather go
without, sex or alcohol?

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.545
Alcohol.
Alcohol, you're good?

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.346
Yeah, yeah, I-
You could drink no booze?

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.616
I'm just a social drinker, man.
Right.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.718
And just, like, social,
every day, before noon.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.087
You need to have sex.
Not even,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.555
I just need to procreate
at some point, you know.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:56.856
Absolutely.
Dude, I got a daughter.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.724
Yeah? You know what?
My daughter is a Latina.

00:00:58.757 --> 00:01:01.761
Awesome. What about that?
Watch Alternatino. There you go.

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:03.596
Yeah. Your daughter
is my main demographic.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.831
She's Puerto Rican.

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.833
I'm Guatemalan, so we-
So is that ...

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:08.367
What's the difference?
I'm kidding.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.869
It happens,
and everybody at a party

00:01:09.902 --> 00:01:11.604
that's ever been to Peru
once in their life,

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.806
they're like,
"Bruh, I've been to Peru."

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:16.743
I'm like, "How was it?
I've never been."

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:19.912
All right,
next stupid question.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.582 line:76%
If you were ever to get
arrested, God forbid-

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:23.816 line:71%
God forbid.

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:26.385 line:76%
... what would your
family assume your crime was?

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:29.456
Probably got in a fight
with a clown.

00:01:30.089 --> 00:01:31.958
Yeah? Yeah.
Are you scared of clowns, dude?

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.893
Yeah, they freak me out, bro.
Dude, they freak me out.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:36.129
I admire all people
in the clown industry,

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.497
I'm just saying I had a clown,

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.999
when I was seven years old,
he smelled like booze.

00:01:40.032 --> 00:01:43.303
Crispino payaso,
Okay. What? Is that a dish?

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:44.904
Payaso means clown.

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:47.773
Crispino payaso, to me,
just sounds delicious.

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:50.576
Christina Palatzzio.
It sounds like a girl

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:52.278
I would go on a date with
and then her father be like,

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:54.280
"If you touch my daughter ... "
Christina Palatzzio

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.648
over there.
Her father's the kind of guy,

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:57.450
he just walk on the treadmill
with sunglasses on.

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:01.120 line:83%
Here's an idea,
would you rather be a guy

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:04.090 line:78%
who's known to drink his own pee

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:06.125 line:83%
or go on romantic dates
with his relatives?

00:02:06.158 --> 00:02:07.426 line:78%
What would you rather be?

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:09.362
I am drinking my own pee now.
Well, actually, no.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:10.596
Truth be told,
you're drinking my pee.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.766
Thanks. At what cousin
do you think it's okay,

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:15.568
I'll marry them and just deal
with the consequences?

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:16.969
What brings down the risk?
I think it ...

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:18.971
once you get to the second
cousin, you're good to go.

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.973
What if your first cousin's
a smoke show?

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:22.575
No, I rather would
drink my own pee.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:23.976
Yeah? Yeah.
You know what I like about you,

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.344
I've been talking to you
for a little while,

00:02:25.377 --> 00:02:26.646
you walk past me on the street,
I'd be like,

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.914
"I hate that guy
because of his hat,"

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.148
but now I like you a lot.
You got-

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:30.483
The amount of times
that people have called me

00:02:30.516 --> 00:02:32.084
shitty Bruno Mars
on the street ...

00:02:32.117 --> 00:02:35.121
Shitty Bruno Mars.

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:38.558
All right, here's a question.
All right. Okay?

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:42.562 line:83%
Would you rather fart
every time you laughed

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:45.364 line:83%
or would you rather
go heh-heh every time

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:46.933 line:83%
somebody said
something depressing?

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:48.935
I don't mind farting
or whatever.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.903
Probably fart every time
I laugh now.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:52.405
As I get older,
I can't keep anything in.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.673
I come from a family
of perfumers

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:54.874
so it smells real nice.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:56.509
Yeah, but farting
in your house was dangerous

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.044
if your Mom had all
those chemicals growing up,

00:02:58.077 --> 00:02:59.478
because the whole thing
would go up in flames.

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:00.813
Yeah, because
that's how it works.

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:03.549
Yo, cuz-
There's no spark involved.

00:03:03.582 --> 00:03:04.784
Listen, I don't know
how to do ...

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:06.719
I'm not good with gas.
I do electric.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:09.322
All right, did you have
a good time on Stupid Questions?

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.590
Awesome time, bro.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.091
Dude, I wanted
to get you a gift.

00:03:12.124 --> 00:03:13.526
Okay, so the first thing
I got you,

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:14.760
because you're Latino-
Yeah, I am.

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:17.863
... so I got you a soccer ball,
but it says England on it-

00:03:17.896 --> 00:03:19.999
Wow. ... because ...
Because that's stupid.

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:21.601
But I just thought, you know,
England's a ...

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:23.202
it's a nice country.
Thank you so much.

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:26.172
And then also, because you're
on Narcos and you're from ...

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:28.107
you know,
I just got you a kilo of ...

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:30.543
that's actually
pure cocaine, so-

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:32.178
Look, I'm Maradona.

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:35.681
I'm Chris Distefano,
this has been Arturo Castro,

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:37.416
and we've had a good time,
and you're going to watch,

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.786
when it comes out
pretty soon, Alternatino.

00:03:40.352 --> 00:03:42.455
Yes!

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:45.224
Alternatino! Yo soy
Christopher. Thank you.

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:47.493
Yo soy Arturo Castro.
