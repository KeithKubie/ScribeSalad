00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.689
If science drops in a field but no other researchers
are around to hear it, does it further the

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.960
academic area of study?

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.719
Howdy researchers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.020
Science is a process, it’s a way of thinking
about the world around us.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.450
Most of these scientific processes are thought
through and then published in a journal, but

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.570
to read them you have to pay!

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.650
Shouldn’t all this scientific knowledge
be FREE!?

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.770
Firstly, science is mostly paid for by grants
from governments, non-profits, foundations,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.640
universities, corporations or others with
deep pockets.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.710
We did a video about it.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.310
But, even though the science was paid for,
that’s just the first half of the equation...

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.800
the other half is the scientific journal.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.180
The first journals were published over 350
years ago as a way to organize new scientific

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.370
knowledge, and that continues today.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.680
According to the International Association
of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers,

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.760
2.5 million new scientific papers are published
each year in over 28,000 different journals.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.370
A new paper is published every 20 seconds.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.539
(and you thought we’d run out of stuff for
DNews 😉).

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:09.229
Researchers need others to read their paper
so it can affect their field.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.680
So, they freely send their treasured manuscripts
to journals for peer review and publication.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.290
When a manuscript comes in, specialists select
and send the best manuscripts to volunteer

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.340
experts in the field who are “carefully
selected based on… expertise, research area,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.889
and lack of bias” for peer review.

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:31.229
After that, the papers are copy-edited, compiled
into an issue of the journal, physically printed

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.090
and then shipped and/or published online!

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.529
They’re, like, the nerdiest magazines in
the world.

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.679
All this costs money…

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.490
According to a study in PLOS One this whole
process can cost 20 to 40 dollars per page,

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.859
depending on how many papers the journal receives
and how many they have to reject.

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.020
Someone has to pay for that, and there are
three ways this can happen: authors can submit

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.850
for free and readers/subscribers pay (called
the traditional model), or authors pay and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.090
readers get it for free (called open-access),
or both authors and readers pay!English-language

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.289
journals alone were worth $10 billion dollars
in 2013!

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.040
I know what you’re thinking, just put them
on the internet!

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.510
Save on shipping, like newspapers and magazines!

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.090
Well, even though publishers don’t have
to print and ship big books of papers anymore,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.329
they often still do.

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:25.440
And, even if the journals were only online,
servers and bandwidth need to be paid for,

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.220
and that ain’t cheap.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.550
Publishing requires dollah bills, y’all
and someone has to pay, and everyone gets

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.610
their money differently…

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.120
For example: the American Association for
the Advancement of Science (AAAS) publishes

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.410
the Science journals, and the Public Library
of Science publishes PLoS One among others;

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.489
both are nonprofits.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.730
But, while PLOS uses an open-access (free
to you) model, Triple-A-S publishes six journals:

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.610
five with a traditional model (you pay) and
one open-access.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.810
Plus, there are for-profit journals like Macmillan
Publishers, who own the journal Nature (and

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.300
a mix of traditional and open access options).

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.750
And the giant Reed Elsevier (now called RELX)
publishes over 2000 journals some of which

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.840
are open-access and some are traditional!

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.670
So, though some are non-profits, they don’t
always give it to YOU for free, and those

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.519
that do still can charge researchers up to
2900 dollars to publish!

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.879
While others make money off scientific research
which makes some people feel icky.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.349
The whole thing is confusing.

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:36.489
Asking “what is worse: for-profits charging
universities or readers for access, or open-access

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.829
charging authors?”

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:38.829
Shrug.

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:40.859
The debate rages.

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.819
Many scientists argue as the peer review is
provided for free by the scientific community,

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.879
and the papers are provided for free by the
scientific community; access to the papers

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:49.879
should.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:50.879
be.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:51.879
free.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.730
The EU agrees, ordering any publically-funded
papers to be made free by 2020; pushing toward

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.319
open access to science!

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.049
In the US, where many of the papers originate,
some scientists are calling for boycotts on

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.120
for-profit publishing.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.549
In the end, there was a time when practitioners
needed a physical reference to the latest

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.989
scientific achievements.

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.560
In the days before the internet, getting a
journal in the mail must have been both exciting

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.170
and illuminating, but now, thanks to digital
publishing… this whole pay-for-science model

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.920
is wont to change…

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.480
People WANT the knowledge to be free, but
no one knows how to do it.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.890
As y’all know, more research is always needed,
but should that research be behind a paywall?

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.630
