we don't actually know the extent to

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250
we don't actually know the extent to
 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.980
we don't actually know the extent to
which gender is socially constructed

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:08.990
which gender is socially constructed
 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.560
which gender is socially constructed
because you can't do an experiment where

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:11.570
because you can't do an experiment where
 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.280
because you can't do an experiment where
you remove culture and see what happens

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290
you remove culture and see what happens
 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.030
you remove culture and see what happens
so we don't know to what extent what we

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040
so we don't know to what extent what we
 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.030
so we don't know to what extent what we
see as gendered patterns are the result

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:22.040
see as gendered patterns are the result
 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.180
see as gendered patterns are the result
of sex biological sex males and females

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:25.190
of sex biological sex males and females
 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.780
of sex biological sex males and females
we know that gender differs according to

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790
we know that gender differs according to
 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.880
we know that gender differs according to
culture but we also know that there are

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890
culture but we also know that there are
 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:32.979
culture but we also know that there are
patterns that appear to be fairly

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989
patterns that appear to be fairly
 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:34.960
patterns that appear to be fairly
universal in terms of gender norms and

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970
universal in terms of gender norms and
 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.490
universal in terms of gender norms and
the ones that are more universal are

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500
the ones that are more universal are
 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.370
the ones that are more universal are
more likely to probably have a sex basis

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380
more likely to probably have a sex basis
 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.200
more likely to probably have a sex basis
to in an evolved sex basis that is to

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210
to in an evolved sex basis that is to
 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.540
to in an evolved sex basis that is to
say a biological basis for males and

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550
say a biological basis for males and
 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.020
say a biological basis for males and
females

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030
females
 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.740
females
so for example who which gender serves a

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750
so for example who which gender serves a
 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.380
so for example who which gender serves a
very important meal may be different by

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390
very important meal may be different by
 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:51.819
very important meal may be different by
different cultures so in some cultures a

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829
different cultures so in some cultures a
 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.440
different cultures so in some cultures a
man will serve a very important male

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:53.450
man will serve a very important male
 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.880
man will serve a very important male
versus a woman so for example think

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890
versus a woman so for example think
 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.050
versus a woman so for example think
about in the United States that

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060
about in the United States that
 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.150
about in the United States that
historically speaking the Father carves

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160
historically speaking the Father carves
 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.850
historically speaking the Father carves
the turkey on Thanksgiving but in

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860
the turkey on Thanksgiving but in
 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.430
the turkey on Thanksgiving but in
general women prepare food historically

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440
general women prepare food historically
 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.550
general women prepare food historically
speaking so what we know is that these

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560
speaking so what we know is that these
 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.230
speaking so what we know is that these
kinds of things can differ by culture

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240
kinds of things can differ by culture
 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.849
kinds of things can differ by culture
but that there are some universals and

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:09.859
but that there are some universals and
 

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.559
but that there are some universals and
one of the universals we find for

00:01:11.559 --> 00:01:11.569
one of the universals we find for
 

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:13.840
one of the universals we find for
example is in childhood play that we

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850
example is in childhood play that we
 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.039
example is in childhood play that we
find that children who are girls tend to

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049
find that children who are girls tend to
 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.230
find that children who are girls tend to
do more social play they tend to do more

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240
do more social play they tend to do more
 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.690
do more social play they tend to do more
social role play children who are boys

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700
social role play children who are boys
 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.629
social role play children who are boys
tend to do more competitive play they

00:01:25.629 --> 00:01:25.639
tend to do more competitive play they
 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:28.919
tend to do more competitive play they
tend to do more play that mimics

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929
tend to do more play that mimics
 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.870
tend to do more play that mimics
aggression or that mimics sport and

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880
aggression or that mimics sport and
 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.359
aggression or that mimics sport and
mimics sometimes building and so there

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369
mimics sometimes building and so there
 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.679
mimics sometimes building and so there
are these kinds of patterns but that

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689
are these kinds of patterns but that
 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.019
are these kinds of patterns but that
doesn't mean everybody fits them and

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:41.029
doesn't mean everybody fits them and
 

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:43.359
doesn't mean everybody fits them and
it's really interesting actually too if

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369
it's really interesting actually too if
 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.550
it's really interesting actually too if
you look across culturally scientists

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560
you look across culturally scientists
 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.690
you look across culturally scientists
find evidence that this may have it's

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
find evidence that this may have it's
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.309
find evidence that this may have it's
not just gender that there's a sexuality

00:01:51.309 --> 00:01:51.319
not just gender that there's a sexuality
 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:53.980
not just gender that there's a sexuality
component to it too so boys who are

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990
component to it too so boys who are
 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.739
component to it too so boys who are
going to grow up and be gay and we know

00:01:56.739 --> 00:01:56.749
going to grow up and be gay and we know
 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.480
going to grow up and be gay and we know
who they are because of retrospectively

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490
who they are because of retrospectively
 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.639
who they are because of retrospectively
they grow up to be gay they're what's

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649
they grow up to be gay they're what's
 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.409
they grow up to be gay they're what's
called Andra philic that is to say

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:02.419
called Andra philic that is to say
 

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:04.300
called Andra philic that is to say
they're attracted to males and the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310
they're attracted to males and the
 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.919
they're attracted to males and the
majority of females are also attracted

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929
majority of females are also attracted
 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.599
majority of females are also attracted
to males so most females are under

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609
to males so most females are under
 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:08.980
to males so most females are under
philic and a small percentage of boys

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990
philic and a small percentage of boys
 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.600
philic and a small percentage of boys
are Andrew will grow up to be under

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610
are Andrew will grow up to be under
 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.580
are Andrew will grow up to be under
philic we know that historically

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590
philic we know that historically
 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.280
philic we know that historically
speaking cross-culturally they

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290
speaking cross-culturally they
 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.289
speaking cross-culturally they
to be more feminine in terms of their

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299
to be more feminine in terms of their
 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.270
to be more feminine in terms of their
interests they're more interested in

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280
interests they're more interested in
 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.670
interests they're more interested in
social roleplay for example they're more

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680
social roleplay for example they're more
 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.929
social roleplay for example they're more
interested in helping their mothers

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939
interested in helping their mothers
 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.339
interested in helping their mothers
they're more interested in associating

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349
they're more interested in associating
 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.740
they're more interested in associating
with girls as young children and more

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750
with girls as young children and more
 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.170
with girls as young children and more
inches in dressing as girls for example

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180
inches in dressing as girls for example
 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.160
inches in dressing as girls for example
that doesn't mean that they're girls but

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170
that doesn't mean that they're girls but
 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.470
that doesn't mean that they're girls but
it does suggest to us that sexuality and

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480
it does suggest to us that sexuality and
 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.539
it does suggest to us that sexuality and
gender have inter played components in

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549
gender have inter played components in
 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.240
gender have inter played components in
them that gender isn't just about social

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250
them that gender isn't just about social
 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.740
them that gender isn't just about social
role that it has something to do with

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
role that it has something to do with
 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.720
role that it has something to do with
sexuality and that there's a reason

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730
sexuality and that there's a reason
 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.300
sexuality and that there's a reason
females end up with these kinds of

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310
females end up with these kinds of
 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.500
females end up with these kinds of
patterns and males end up with these

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510
patterns and males end up with these
 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.699
patterns and males end up with these
kinds of patterns and when you have a

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709
kinds of patterns and when you have a
 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.920
kinds of patterns and when you have a
male who's attracted to males he ends up

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930
male who's attracted to males he ends up
 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.119
male who's attracted to males he ends up
with a little bit more of the female

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129
with a little bit more of the female
 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.860
with a little bit more of the female
pattern and in some circumstances if you

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870
pattern and in some circumstances if you
 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.990
pattern and in some circumstances if you
have a girl and she's attracted to girls

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000
have a girl and she's attracted to girls
 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.670
have a girl and she's attracted to girls
she'll end up with a little bit more of

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680
she'll end up with a little bit more of
 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.430
she'll end up with a little bit more of
the male pattern in childhood so gender

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440
the male pattern in childhood so gender
 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.530
the male pattern in childhood so gender
and sexual orientations seem to have

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540
and sexual orientations seem to have
 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.990
and sexual orientations seem to have
sort of some connection to each other

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000
sort of some connection to each other
 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.059
sort of some connection to each other
but it's not a perfect connection in

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069
but it's not a perfect connection in
 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.039
but it's not a perfect connection in
terms of absolute correlation and so we

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049
terms of absolute correlation and so we
 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.229
terms of absolute correlation and so we
can't say that we can easily predict

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239
can't say that we can easily predict
 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.449
can't say that we can easily predict
what would be somebody's gender role or

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459
what would be somebody's gender role or
 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.640
what would be somebody's gender role or
sexual orientation simply by looking at

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650
sexual orientation simply by looking at
 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.710
sexual orientation simply by looking at
some of the components evolution would

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720
some of the components evolution would
 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.960
some of the components evolution would
naturally favour heterosexuality because

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970
naturally favour heterosexuality because
 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.490
naturally favour heterosexuality because
that's how you get babies and so if

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500
that's how you get babies and so if
 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.809
that's how you get babies and so if
we're thinking about genes trying to

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819
we're thinking about genes trying to
 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.400
we're thinking about genes trying to
produce genes it would make no sense to

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410
produce genes it would make no sense to
 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.369
produce genes it would make no sense to
have genes that would lead to people who

00:03:27.369 --> 00:03:27.379
have genes that would lead to people who
 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.050
have genes that would lead to people who
don't reproduce because those genes

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060
don't reproduce because those genes
 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.699

know cross culturally gay people exist
 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.050
know cross culturally gay people exist
so we know that that's a natural

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060
so we know that that's a natural
 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.030
so we know that that's a natural
variation in the population and so then

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040
variation in the population and so then

scientists asked the really interesting

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239
scientists asked the really interesting
 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.750
scientists asked the really interesting
question why is that there why does that

in theory that should lead to lower
reproductive fitness which means it

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970
reproductive fitness which means it
 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.699
reproductive fitness which means it
should lead to fewer babies and so it

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709
should lead to fewer babies and so it
 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.129
should lead to fewer babies and so it
should it should fade out evolutionarily

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139
should it should fade out evolutionarily
 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.129

throwing up variation and some of it

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.049
throwing up variation and some of it
 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:10.390
throwing up variation and some of it
will work in some environments and some

that means you have more adults

the later born males will be gay so this

the later born males will be gay so this

the later born males will be gay so this
has been studied in many populations in

has been studied in many populations in
 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.280
has been studied in many populations in
the world large numbers and it's

rigorous we know that this is true so

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480
rigorous we know that this is true so
 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.210

immune system appears to be reacting to
male hormones and maybe dampening them

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.470
male hormones and maybe dampening them
 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:12.530
male hormones and maybe dampening them
down a little bit and this results in

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540
down a little bit and this results in
 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.060
down a little bit and this results in

males are more likely to be gay it's a

males are more likely to be gay it's a
surprising finding because it suggests

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:20.040
surprising finding because it suggests
 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.100
surprising finding because it suggests
to us that some men are absolutely born

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:22.110
to us that some men are absolutely born
 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.690
to us that some men are absolutely born
gay but not because of genetics they're

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:23.700
gay but not because of genetics they're
 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.970
gay but not because of genetics they're
born gay because of the birth order in

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:25.980
born gay because of the birth order in
 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:29.510
born gay because of the birth order in
terms of some sort of effect having on a

woman woman's system which is reacting

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:32.790
woman woman's system which is reacting
 

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:35.180
woman woman's system which is reacting
to her children's system and it only

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:35.190
to her children's system and it only
 

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:37.280
to her children's system and it only
occurs in males doesn't occur in females

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:37.290
occurs in males doesn't occur in females
 

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.960
occurs in males doesn't occur in females
and that's part of the reason why the

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:38.970
and that's part of the reason why the
 

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:40.150
and that's part of the reason why the
theory is it's an immune response

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160
theory is it's an immune response
 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.290
theory is it's an immune response
because it doesn't occur with females it

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.300
because it doesn't occur with females it
 

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.270
because it doesn't occur with females it
only occurs with males born out of the

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280
only occurs with males born out of the
 

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.500
only occurs with males born out of the
same womb so that's something I've

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:45.510
same womb so that's something I've
 

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.659
same womb so that's something I've
colloquially called wound gay but it's

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:47.669
colloquially called wound gay but it's
 

00:07:47.669 --> 00:07:48.920
colloquially called wound gay but it's
called the paternal birth order effect

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:48.930
called the paternal birth order effect
 

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.930
called the paternal birth order effect
and I think the evidence is very strong

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940
and I think the evidence is very strong
 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:52.820
and I think the evidence is very strong
that a certain percentage of gay people

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:52.830
that a certain percentage of gay people
 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.909
that a certain percentage of gay people
are born that way we do not have good

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919
are born that way we do not have good
 

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:57.140
are born that way we do not have good
evidence that straight people are born

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.150
evidence that straight people are born
 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.610
evidence that straight people are born
that way we don't bother to look for

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:58.620
that way we don't bother to look for
 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.460
that way we don't bother to look for
that evidence straight straight people

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:01.470
that evidence straight straight people
 

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:03.950
that evidence straight straight people
have been less interesting to scientists

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:03.960
have been less interesting to scientists
 

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.560
have been less interesting to scientists
than gay people in terms of where they

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:06.570
than gay people in terms of where they
 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.690
than gay people in terms of where they
come from and that's because there's a

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:08.700
come from and that's because there's a
 

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.610
come from and that's because there's a
heterosexist assumption that straight

lead to more babies so logically you

lead to more babies so logically you
would want to explain gay people but

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280
would want to explain gay people but
 

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.740
would want to explain gay people but
it's also a political issue that

basically straight people have required

basically straight people have required

basically straight people have required
no explanation and gay people have

00:08:34.370 --> 00:08:34.380
no explanation and gay people have
 

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:36.320
no explanation and gay people have
required explanation and some of the

clingy mothers make gay boys what we

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:49.830
clingy mothers make gay boys what we
 

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.770
clingy mothers make gay boys what we
know from cross-cultural studies is that

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:51.780
know from cross-cultural studies is that
 

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.870

gay boys are more interested in being

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880
gay boys are more interested in being
 

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.890
gay boys are more interested in being
with their mothers and straight boys and

with their mothers and straight boys and
 

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:57.360
with their mothers and straight boys and
it's not that the mothers are more

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.370
it's not that the mothers are more
 

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.130
it's not that the mothers are more
clingy it's that the boys are more

so we've studied much more about gay

00:09:02.519 --> 00:09:02.529
so we've studied much more about gay
 

00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:03.600
so we've studied much more about gay
people than we have studied about
