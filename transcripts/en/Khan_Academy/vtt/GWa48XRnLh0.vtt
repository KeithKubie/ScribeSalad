00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
- [Instructor] The terms mastery learning

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:05.459
are used a lot these days
but I wanna do a video

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:08.232
on 'em because they can
mean different things

00:00:08.232 --> 00:00:09.961
to different people and
I wanna just talk about

00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:12.542
what it means at least in
a Khan Academy context.

00:00:12.542 --> 00:00:14.838
So to give us some perspective,
let's actually just start

00:00:14.838 --> 00:00:18.603
with traditional learning and
think about where it works

00:00:18.603 --> 00:00:20.425
and maybe where it doesn't work

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:22.730
and then we could think
about why mastery learning

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.651
might address some of those issues.

00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:27.707
So let's say we are in a
middle school math class

00:00:27.707 --> 00:00:31.874
and right now, the classroom
is focused on negative numbers.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.550
We're gonna work on that
for a couple of weeks.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.133
So this is negative
numbers right over here

00:00:40.099 --> 00:00:42.368
and after a couple of weeks
of lecture and homework,

00:00:42.368 --> 00:00:44.713
we give a task and lets
say a certain student

00:00:44.713 --> 00:00:48.225
that we're following
gets an 80% on that test.

00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:51.558
So he or she knows a lot of the material

00:00:52.648 --> 00:00:55.755
but doesn't know some of the material here

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:58.520
maybe doesn't know some
of the material here

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.412
maybe doesn't know some
of the material over here.

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:04.006
So these are gaps.

00:01:04.006 --> 00:01:07.135
These are gaps in their understanding.

00:01:07.135 --> 00:01:11.198
So these, we label these
correctly, these are gaps.

00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:13.242
And even though we've taken the trouble

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:15.720
of giving an assessment, a quiz a test,

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.153
and we identified these gaps,

00:01:17.153 --> 00:01:19.298
the whole class including that student

00:01:19.298 --> 00:01:21.502
will then move on to the next concept.

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:24.460
So let's say the next
concept that we now work on

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.877
maybe we do it for a few more weeks

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:30.633
according to the lesson
plan, is now basic exponents.

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:32.800
So this is basic exponents

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:36.861
and the same thing happens.

00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:39.197
We have some lecture and
homework for a few weeks

00:01:39.197 --> 00:01:41.097
and then at the end of that we have a test

00:01:41.097 --> 00:01:42.539
and let's say on the that test,

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.363
the student gets a 70%.

00:01:45.363 --> 00:01:48.788
So he or she knows a
good bit of the material

00:01:48.788 --> 00:01:52.149
but there's still some
pretty significant gaps.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.705
Let me color in these gaps.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:55.429
So the white is what they were actually

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:56.780
able to perform on these tests

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.181
and even these tests are imperfect,

00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:59.989
they're just sampling
the students' knowledge

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:01.687
and so what happen to be on the test

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:04.267
they still didn't know
some of the material.

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:05.669
Some of it might've been careless mistakes

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:07.894
but some of it might've
been pretty important.

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:10.211
For example, this gap right over here

00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:14.803
might be what happens if I raise
something to the zero power

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:18.906
or maybe it's building on top
of a gap with negative numbers

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:21.393
maybe this gap was happening,

00:02:21.393 --> 00:02:23.589
not just 'cause basic
exponents are difficult

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.571
but because there's a
gap in negative numbers

00:02:25.571 --> 00:02:27.429
so the student doesn't
know what does it mean

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:31.310
if I take a negative number
to a positive exponent.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.698
So maybe that's a gap there.

00:02:33.698 --> 00:02:35.251
But even though we've taken the trouble

00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:37.907
of identifying those gaps,
the class will then move on

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.402
to the next concept.

00:02:39.402 --> 00:02:41.759
The amount of time is what's fixed

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.451
and what's variable is how well

00:02:43.451 --> 00:02:46.664
the students understand
it, A, B, C, D, or F.

00:02:46.664 --> 00:02:49.825
And then the next concept, let's say

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:51.317
we'll do this in another color,

00:02:51.317 --> 00:02:54.701
so the next concept here,
we are building on top of

00:02:54.701 --> 00:02:56.274
everything that we've learned so far,

00:02:56.274 --> 00:02:59.191
let's say it is negative exponents.

00:03:01.365 --> 00:03:03.205
So I think you can see
where this is going.

00:03:03.205 --> 00:03:06.607
This is trouble now for the student.

00:03:06.607 --> 00:03:08.975
There's lecture and homework,
the student is trying

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:12.215
the best they can but things
are just not really gelling.

00:03:12.215 --> 00:03:14.751
And so all of a sudden,
when you take the quiz,

00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:17.495
the student just hits a wall
after two or three weeks

00:03:17.495 --> 00:03:20.963
and let's say they get a 30%

00:03:20.963 --> 00:03:23.531
and so they're only able to get 30%

00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.620
of the material right that
happened to be on the test,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.907
the rest they got wrong.

00:03:28.907 --> 00:03:30.947
Now, in a traditional system, we say

00:03:30.947 --> 00:03:34.087
"alright, the student just
failed this exam quite badly.

00:03:34.087 --> 00:03:36.241
"Maybe the student needs to work harder.

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:39.309
"Maybe they need to be put
into a different track.

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:44.043
"Maybe the subject is just too
difficult for this student."

00:03:44.043 --> 00:03:45.750
but when you look at what's going on,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.274
it's pretty clear that
it had nothing to do

00:03:47.274 --> 00:03:49.189
with the ability level of the student

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:51.561
and it didn't have anything
to do with the difficulty

00:03:51.561 --> 00:03:52.931
necessarily of the subject matter

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.942
but it's more that they
just kept accumulating

00:03:54.942 --> 00:03:57.391
these gaps all along the way

00:03:57.391 --> 00:04:00.216
so at some point, those
gaps become so debilitating

00:04:00.216 --> 00:04:02.033
that the student hits a wall

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.089
and starts failing the class

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:05.863
and if they're not able to
remediate these gaps go back,

00:04:05.863 --> 00:04:08.056
well they're never going to really be able

00:04:08.056 --> 00:04:09.623
to understand negative exponents

00:04:09.623 --> 00:04:11.228
and then they're never going
to be able to understand

00:04:11.228 --> 00:04:13.543
logarithms properly and
more advanced algebra

00:04:13.543 --> 00:04:16.125
and so on and so forth
and we've all seen this

00:04:16.125 --> 00:04:18.107
either for ourselves
or some of our friends

00:04:18.107 --> 00:04:18.972
and family members.

00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:20.015
They hit walls.

00:04:20.015 --> 00:04:22.311
And the argument that we
believe at Khan Academy

00:04:22.311 --> 00:04:25.941
it is not because they're not bright,

00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:28.570
it's not because the
subject matter is difficult,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.566
it's because we're forcing
them through at a fixed pace.

00:04:31.566 --> 00:04:34.100
And to realize how absurd
this is on some level,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.863
imagine if we did other
things in our life that way,

00:04:36.863 --> 00:04:38.874
say home building.

00:04:38.874 --> 00:04:41.443
So you tell the contractor
we have two weeks

00:04:41.443 --> 00:04:44.326
to build this foundation, do what you can.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.863
And so they build a foundation

00:04:45.863 --> 00:04:47.924
but then two weeks later,
the inspector comes

00:04:47.924 --> 00:04:51.155
and says "Okay, the concrete's
still wet right over here.

00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:53.126
"This part isn't quite up to code.

00:04:53.126 --> 00:04:56.417
"I will give this an 80%"

00:04:56.417 --> 00:04:57.526
and you say, "Great, that's a C.

00:04:57.526 --> 00:04:59.008
"Let's build the first floor."

00:04:59.008 --> 00:05:01.244
and so again, you try to
build the first floor,

00:05:01.244 --> 00:05:03.519
maybe it rains, some of
the supplies don't show up,

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:05.743
and so the inspector comes
after a couple of weeks

00:05:05.743 --> 00:05:08.761
and says, "Alright, I'll give that 70%"

00:05:08.761 --> 00:05:09.745
and you say "Great, that's a D

00:05:09.745 --> 00:05:11.342
"Now let's build the second floor"

00:05:11.342 --> 00:05:12.862
so on and so forth then all of a sudden

00:05:12.862 --> 00:05:14.093
while you're building that second floor,

00:05:14.093 --> 00:05:17.315
the whole structure comes collapsing down.

00:05:17.315 --> 00:05:19.405
And if our reaction to
that is the reaction

00:05:19.405 --> 00:05:20.542
we typically have in education,

00:05:20.542 --> 00:05:22.358
we say "Oh, we needed more inspection"

00:05:22.358 --> 00:05:25.108
or "we needed better contractors"

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.536
but the problem was the process.

00:05:28.536 --> 00:05:30.231
We are artificially constraining

00:05:30.231 --> 00:05:32.173
how long you have to do something

00:05:32.173 --> 00:05:34.672
which pretty much ensures
a variable outcome.

00:05:34.672 --> 00:05:37.679
You take the trouble of
identifying those gaps

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:39.902
but then you build right on top of it.

00:05:39.902 --> 00:05:41.934
So this is traditional learning

00:05:41.934 --> 00:05:44.230
and one could argue that if
you're just pushing people

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:45.988
ahead at some pace like this,

00:05:45.988 --> 00:05:48.366
gaps will accumulate for everyone

00:05:48.366 --> 00:05:50.316
and they will all hit a wall at some point

00:05:50.316 --> 00:05:51.941
and we've all felt that.

00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:54.333
And so mastery learning says,
"Look, instead of making

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:57.521
"everyone go at the same
pace, let us personalize."

00:05:57.521 --> 00:06:00.284
and personalization in this context means

00:06:00.284 --> 00:06:02.447
let people go at their own pace.

00:06:02.447 --> 00:06:05.780
So traditional learning, it's fixed pace

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:10.417
and variable understanding,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.643
while mastery learning
has personalization.

00:06:19.838 --> 00:06:22.505
So it's more of a variable pace,

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:27.173
and then we assume students get

00:06:27.173 --> 00:06:29.825
to a high level of proficiency or mastery.

00:06:29.825 --> 00:06:31.492
So high expectations

00:06:37.675 --> 00:06:40.536
around proficiency or mastery

00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:42.719
and those words can mean different things

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:47.065
in different context,
proficiency or mastery.

00:06:47.065 --> 00:06:51.128
So in a mastery learning
system, you first would

00:06:51.128 --> 00:06:54.480
maybe the student would be
ready for the negative numbers

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.474
and maybe after a few weeks,

00:06:56.474 --> 00:06:58.293
they take some type of assessment,

00:06:58.293 --> 00:07:00.405
to get much as much practice
and feedback as possible

00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:03.433
and they perform similarly
to that first example,

00:07:03.433 --> 00:07:04.825
the student in the first example,

00:07:04.825 --> 00:07:07.284
maybe they get that 80% there.

00:07:07.284 --> 00:07:09.174
In a mastery learning system,

00:07:09.174 --> 00:07:10.372
we wouldn't just tell that student,

00:07:10.372 --> 00:07:13.664
"Alright, let's move
on to basic exponents"

00:07:13.664 --> 00:07:16.694
what we would do is, hey,
why don't you keep working

00:07:16.694 --> 00:07:19.027
on the negative numbers here

00:07:20.037 --> 00:07:22.482
and so that you can address those gaps.

00:07:22.482 --> 00:07:24.595
And so it takes the student
maybe a little bit more time

00:07:24.595 --> 00:07:28.597
but eventually, they're
able to fill in those gaps.

00:07:28.597 --> 00:07:30.823
There might be still a few small gaps

00:07:30.823 --> 00:07:34.285
but the whole point is that
they can always go back

00:07:34.285 --> 00:07:36.999
and revisit and ensure that
they fill in those gaps

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:39.124
so that they don't become debilitating.

00:07:39.124 --> 00:07:41.196
Ideally, they'll fill in all the gaps.

00:07:41.196 --> 00:07:43.470
And now, they're ready for basic exponents

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.020
and I'd argue that now that
you're tackling basic exponents,

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:48.185
one, the student actually
might be able to even learn it

00:07:48.185 --> 00:07:50.104
faster 'cause they're
gonna get less confused

00:07:50.104 --> 00:07:52.948
by the negative exponents
but if they still end up

00:07:52.948 --> 00:07:55.955
having a gap when they take
some type of an assessment

00:07:55.955 --> 00:07:57.064
or while they're doing practice,

00:07:57.064 --> 00:07:58.861
they have as much time as they need

00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:01.929
to go back and fill in those gaps

00:08:01.929 --> 00:08:03.972
and so the whole principle here is

00:08:03.972 --> 00:08:06.041
in mastery learning,
the student is building

00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:08.003
a really, really solid foundation

00:08:08.003 --> 00:08:09.771
so that they never hit that wall

00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:11.122
when they get to negative exponents.

00:08:11.122 --> 00:08:12.798
They understand their
negative numbers well,

00:08:12.798 --> 00:08:14.131
they understand their exponents well

00:08:14.131 --> 00:08:16.833
and so then they can just keep on going

00:08:16.833 --> 00:08:19.055
and going and going and at Khan Academy

00:08:19.055 --> 00:08:21.494
we believe that if you learn this way,

00:08:21.494 --> 00:08:22.806
yes, certain subjects might take you

00:08:22.806 --> 00:08:25.535
a little bit longer, but
then if you invest there,

00:08:25.535 --> 00:08:27.384
the future subjects will take less time

00:08:27.384 --> 00:08:29.653
and you will understand more and overall

00:08:29.653 --> 00:08:31.369
and we've seen efficacy
studies to this effect,

00:08:31.369 --> 00:08:33.757
you'll actually learn better, faster

00:08:33.757 --> 00:08:37.279
and you won't eventually
hit some type of a barrier

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:41.191
like the first student did
with negative exponents.
