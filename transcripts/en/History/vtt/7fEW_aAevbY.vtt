00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:04.104
NARRATOR: Deep in the
Ozark Mountains, the pickup

00:00:04.104 --> 00:00:06.005
is rigged for a heavy haul.

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:07.307
Here goes nothing.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.343
NARRATOR: To move a repurposed
shed to its new home,

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:13.380
in a clearing 100 feet
away, if it holds.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.632
Looks good.

00:00:32.632 --> 00:00:34.567
Are you happy
with where it is?

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.102
I like it.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.237
JASON: Yeah?

00:00:37.237 --> 00:00:37.937
I'll be damned.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.873
All right, high five.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:41.541
It worked.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:45.612
Everything worked out
better than I'd hoped for.

00:00:45.612 --> 00:00:48.581
Now I've got to get on
building some laying box

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.683
for these chickens.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.952
NARRATOR: To keep the chickens
safe in their new coop,

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:54.554
they're installing a fence.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.456
JASON: And Mary's
gonna get on the fence,

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.825
so that they're safe
and secure at night.

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.462
NARRATOR: And nesting
cubbies for laying eggs.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:05.732
The boxes themselves, just a
bunch of scrap wood that I knew

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:09.669
would come in handy
for something.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.105
[clanging]

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:14.407
Mary's got her hands
full with the little one,

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:17.110
and working on the fence.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.078
With the fencepost
pounder, I'm

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:23.583
going to pound in a post
on each corner of the yard.

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:26.920
This is just get a
quick something up,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.087
so they won't escape tonight.

00:01:28.087 --> 00:01:30.223
[hammering]

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.192
All right.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.629
That's the bottom
through here.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.635
Mary's got the fence done.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.170
River's back from school.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.340
And only, really, one
thing left to do, bring

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.442
in these lovely chickens
and introduce them

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.578
to their new glorious home.

00:01:51.578 --> 00:01:52.712
All right, so, River?

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:53.847
Yeah?

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:55.782
JASON: I'm gonna trim
the feathers back a bit,

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.784
so that they don't fly.

00:01:57.784 --> 00:02:00.487
And you get to name them.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:01.955
Yay.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.290
NARRATOR: Trimming the primary
flight feathers on at least one

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.060
wing keeps the birds grounded.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.061
Yeah, that's good.

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:09.262
Let her go.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.563
There's number one.
Who's that?

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:15.502
Spots.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:16.636
Spots, OK.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.872
Hello, Spots.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:21.074
JASON: Chickens cannot
fly for a long distance,

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.575
but they can fly.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:25.078
So by trimming their wings,
they're not gonna fly off.

00:02:25.078 --> 00:02:27.780
Let's get that.
[chicken clucking]

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.716
Yup, there you go.

00:02:29.716 --> 00:02:31.150
Who's that?

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.652
- Sleepy.
- Sleepy.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:36.055
All right, watch your fingers.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:37.090
Go.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.925
Steve.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:40.093
Steve?

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:40.994
Steve the chicken.

00:02:40.994 --> 00:02:41.761
I like Steve.

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:43.663
Come on.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.031
JASON: Mary and I
have made a plan,

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.367
and together we pulled this off.

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:48.868
And now we've got chickens.

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:51.271
And they ought to
start laying soon.

00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.539
It's an added source of protein.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.841
And it's also an
added source of meat.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.443
So they're one more
thing to this homestead

00:02:57.443 --> 00:03:00.480
that makes it feel like home.
