00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.840
Let's verify that
the margin mechanics

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.190
in the marking to market
of the futures contract

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.340
actually gets both the seller
and the buyer what they

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.900
originally wanted, which
is that they don't have

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.830
to be susceptible to the
volatility in apple prices.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.660
They both wanted
to, effectively,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.270
sell the apples for $0.20
a pound or buy the apples

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.530
for $0.20 a pound.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.610
And they didn't want to,
in the farmer's case,

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.234
go out of business if they could
only sell the apples for $0.10

00:00:28.234 --> 00:00:30.230
a pound, or in the
pie company's case,

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.040
go out of business if they had
to buy the apples for $0.30

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.880
a pound.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.480
So let's verify
that this works out.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.130
So they originally
had a contract price

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.870
of $200 for 1,000 pounds.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.810
So this is essentially
$0.20 a pound.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.090
And as we said in
the previous video,

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.310
as the futures contract
delivery price changes day

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.380
by day, as we get closer and
closer to the actual delivery

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.710
date, what happens
is that we transfer

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.690
money between the buyer's margin
account and the seller's margin

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.420
account.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.460
As the delivery price
of the future contract

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.860
goes down, in order to mark
the delivery price down--

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.230
so in order to mark it down
from $200 to $190 to $185--

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.100
this guy keeps getting a better
deal on the actual delivery

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.790
price.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.040
So to make things fair, he has
to transfer the same amount

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.920
of money to the margin
account of the seller.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.790
So let's imagine two scenarios.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.470
Let's say that
eventually, as we approach

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.010
November 15-- remember,
this is the delivery date--

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.497
the futures contract
delivery price

00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:32.080
is going to approach
the market price.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.360
You can imagine right
when we're like a second

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.950
before the delivery date, the
futures contract and the market

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.616
price aren't going
to be that different.

00:01:38.616 --> 00:01:44.000
And let's say that this goes
all the way down to $100.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.480
So in that whole process,
this futures contract

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.630
keeps getting
marked down to $100.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.400
So on that day, it is
true that the seller

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.990
will sell 1,000 pounds of apples
to the buyer for only $100.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.160
You might say, hey, wait.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.660
What did the seller
get out of this?

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.280
He's only getting $0.10
per pound for his apples.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.309
This was what he feared.

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:06.350
He is susceptible to the
volatility of the market

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.080
prices.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.080
But remember, because of this
marking to market, and because

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.750
of the margin transfers here,
as this delivery price went down

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.420
from $200 to $100,
there would have

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.300
been a transfer from
this guy's margin account

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.620
to this guy's margin
account of $100.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.530
So instead of just
getting the $100

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.910
for that 1,000 pounds of
apples, because this seller had

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.910
this futures contract,
he would have also gotten

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.650
another $100 transferred
into his margin account.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.300
So the true economic value he
gets is $200, no matter what,

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.490
for his 1,000 pounds of
apples, or $0.20 a pound.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.430
You can imagine
the other scenario.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.230
What if the delivery price
as we get closer and closer

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.330
to delivery date goes up?

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.004
If it goes to $300
per 1,000 pounds?

00:02:57.004 --> 00:02:59.170
Well, you might say, hey,
the seller is going to get

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.378
a bonanza, and this guy's
going to go out of business

00:03:01.378 --> 00:03:04.000
because he's going to be
essentially paying $0.30 per

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.830
pound.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.040
But you gotta remember,
if the price went up

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.500
and it becomes more and more
favorable to the seller,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.820
because of the margin
mechanics, the seller would

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.080
have to transfer $100 over--
as the price moves up--

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.260
to the buyer, to
his margin account.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.120
And so even though this guy
has to pay $300 per pound,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.590
because that's where the market
price eventually ended up,

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.910
he would get $100
from the seller.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.900
So effectively, he would
still only have to pay $200.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.460
And even though this guy
is selling it for $300,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.010
he actually had to
pay another $100.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.980
So net, he's really only
getting $200 for it.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.930
So no matter how you look at
it, both parties are transacting

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.470
at $200, or $0.20 a pound.
