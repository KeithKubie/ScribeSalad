PRESENTER: I am very pleased to
welcome to Google today Nelly

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:10.050
Ben Hayoun.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.650
Nellie is a fearless and
passionate provocateur

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.490
who was nominated
by "Icon" magazine

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.900
as one of the 50 international
designers shaping the future.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.630
She is the designer
of experiences

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.620
at SETI, the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.290
And in 2014 "WIRED"
magazine awarded

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.390
Nellie with a "WIRED" Innovation
Fellowship for her work

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.410
and its potential to
make a significant impact

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.490
on the world.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.260
Her latest film,
"Disaster Playground,"

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.760
has original music
from the prodigy,

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.170
and it unveils the
real-life chain of command

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.820
if an asteroid was
to hit the Earth.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.214
It's got its UK premiere on
June 30 at the BFI in London

00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:44.130
and will be available
on all digital platforms

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.701
after that, including
Google Play.

00:00:45.701 --> 00:00:47.700
So please join me in a
massive round of applause

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.841
and welcome to the
stage, Nelly Ben Hayoun.

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:51.314
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.314 --> 00:00:53.278
NELLY BEN HAYOUN:
Merci beaucoup.

00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:56.150
Thanks for the
lovely introduction.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.180
Bonjour.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.140
Bonjour, Googlers.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.670
So, yes, I guess I kind of put
this slide really big up there,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.280
so you're kind of
aware that I've got

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.020
a very strong French accent.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.590
And I'm really sorry about this.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.506
You know, I've been here
for about nine years.

00:01:10.506 --> 00:01:12.790
But it's still as
strong as it gets, huh?

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.610
And what is going to
happen, just now for you,

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.050
is going to be an
intense bombardment

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.010
of different [INAUDIBLE],
everything we do in the studio,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.510
basically.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.650
But I'm going to just keep
on getting more and more

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.250
passionate, as it
goes, and I'm going

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.090
to go more and more faster.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.910
So just be prepared
mentally for this.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.180
And if it doesn't
make any sense to you,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.389
can just raise your
hands in the air,

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:37.930
and I will try and
like slow it down.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.770
But I don't promise anything.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.235
Anyway, so let me introduce
you a bit more to my practice.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:46.220
So I'm going to start by giving
you a bit more for background

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.530
and then we will get into
the core of what we do

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.670
in the studio, which is pretty
extreme as we like to call it.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.550
So I created the
studio back in 2009.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.700
And the idea of the studio
was to try and figure out

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.010
how can we really get members
of the public engaged.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.070
And, you know, I come
from a design world, OK?

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.660
I'm a designer by training.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.364
And I always find
it pretty difficult

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:12.780
as a designer to actually get
members of the public really

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.100
fascinated by a table or
a chair or actually get

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.970
them really engaged with a cause
or with research that I think

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.650
is very important.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.060
So it kind of became sort of
a rotating thing in my head.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.530
And I was, like, how
on earth can we really

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.990
try and get members of the
public engaged with a cause?

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.280
How can we do that?

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.290
And then the other
kind of problem I had

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.846
was also this notion
of "hyperreal."

00:02:35.846 --> 00:02:38.220
"Hyperreal" is this word which
was coined by Baudrillard.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.780
So if you don't know him,
he's a French sociologist.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.870
Don't worry, I don't just
have French references,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.362
but this one is pretty good.

00:02:44.362 --> 00:02:46.570
So Baudrillard came up with
that word of "hyperreal."

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.680
And what it is is this
idea that, in a way,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.450
you know, if you look at this
example-- and I'm a space geek,

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.660
so you're only going
to see space stuff.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.320
But if you look at
this, everything

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.450
is NASA nowadays-- Super 8 NASA,
NASA Laundrymat, NASA Liquor.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.300
You even have the Apollo
Tire and Wheel Shop.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.250
And, really, this
idea of "hyperreal"

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.501
is this idea that in a way
nothing has any meaning today.

00:03:09.501 --> 00:03:11.625
So if you want to get
members of the public engaged

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:15.900
with a cause when they
have a multitude of offers

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.780
on the table, they
don't really tend

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.700
to actually engage really
physically with anything.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.250
So how can we do that?

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.860
And I started to
think, well, you

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.820
know, I come from also
different backgrounds.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.070
So I got training as a designer,
but I also trained as a painter

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.830
before that.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.630
And before that, I was also
making kimonos in Japan.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.130
So I've got this sort of
strange mix of things, right?

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.340
But we all do.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.200
But, for me, I've
always been fascinated

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.790
to actually look at a painting
and how a painter actually

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.265
brings in all their discipline
into their practice.

00:03:46.265 --> 00:03:47.890
So, for example, in
the case of Manet--

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.070
but you can take all the
Renaissance as well--

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:53.070
you get this famous painting
in which this woman is looking

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.080
at you, but on the back you can
see the scene that either she's

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.060
dreaming of or the
scene that is actually

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.995
the perspective of the mural.

00:03:59.995 --> 00:04:01.620
But what I'm seeing
there is like there

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.310
is sort of a scene in a scene.

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.200
There is an architecture
which is there.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.230
So it's like the 2D becomes 3D.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.020
And that is very
interesting, right?

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.490
This whole mix of different
disciplines into one.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.120
And then if you
look even further,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.000
there is actually one
of my favorite painter

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.024
called Luc Tuymans.

00:04:17.024 --> 00:04:18.940
He's talking about
painting as being something

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.346
which is very hard to remember.

00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:23.220
And what he's saying
about that, he's saying,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.340
well, look, when you
go into a museum,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.490
you don't tend to
remember a painting,

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.440
but you will try and
remember the tone of it.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.640
And actually the tone can really
remain in someone's memory.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.700
And that's what I think
is very interesting.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.940
So how can you sort of bring
in a tone or bring in a paste

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.580
to a design product
or to something

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.370
that will sort of talk to
all of us to some extent?

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.850
How can you do that?

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:49.400
Is this even possible?

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.950
And I started at that time also
taking some classes in theater.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.469
And one of those things
that always fascinated me is

00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:58.260
commedia dell'arte.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.801
Do you know about
commedia dell'arte?

00:04:59.801 --> 00:05:00.630
Are you awake?

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:01.460
Are you OK?

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.910
I know it is post-lunch.

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.690
But, you know, show
me a bit of the love.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.710
So commedia dell-arte is this
satirical form from basically

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.670
the 17th century.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.890
And the idea of commedia
dell'arte is you will have

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:15.890
extreme characters.

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.627
Usually, they have
a mask as well.

00:05:17.627 --> 00:05:18.960
And it's pretty much structured.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.540
They all have like some
sort of pattern that they

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.660
need to perform on stage.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.307
But what is very interesting
is like all the improvisation

00:05:27.307 --> 00:05:28.140
that are in between.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.410
So it really is a
craft of improvisation.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.180
That's what commedia
dell'arte is all about.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.680
And again, I was like, well,
when you look at design, again,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.820
how can we sort of bring in
that component of improvisation

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.460
or live event as well?

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.350
How can we bring this
into our practice?

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.399
And so you know, I
was spending my time

00:05:46.399 --> 00:05:47.440
getting it into the head.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.480
And that's what we
came up in the studio,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.740
is design of experiences.

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.420
So you probably
wonder, what the heck

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.732
is a design of experiences?

00:05:55.732 --> 00:05:57.810
Do you?

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.930
I hope you do.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.380
Let's put it this way.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.972
So the design of experiences is
really around these two axes.

00:06:05.972 --> 00:06:07.430
So sorry, it's a
bit of background,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.330
but then at least you will
know where I come from.

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.038
And hopefully, it will
make sense to you.

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:13.550
But it comes from
critical design.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.750
And I'm going to tell you
a few more words about it.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.490
But it's also combining it with
a component more of the range

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.910
of the live event, like
the theatre of cruelty.

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.710
Again, I'm going to tell you
a few more words about it.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.400
Are you excited about this?

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.190
All these things at Google are
so as, you know, in the search.

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.110
But if you don't know
about critical design,

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.760
it really started in 1999.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.050
And it was coined into a
book called "Hertzian Tales"

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.527
by Professor Anthony Dunne
and Fiona Raby, his partner.

00:06:44.527 --> 00:06:46.610
And they actually started
this course at the Royal

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.550
College of Art called Design
Interactions, which actually

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.520
some of you have done, I know.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.982
And I also come from there.

00:06:52.982 --> 00:06:54.440
And what I found
really interesting

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.800
about the whole practice
of critical design

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.440
is this idea that as
a designer, usually

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.160
you would do the A list.

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.350
So the A list is usually
problem-solving approach.

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.920
Here is a problem, and
here is a response to it.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.785
I mean, I'm kind of
oversimplifying it.

00:07:08.785 --> 00:07:10.910
I'm not saying that this
is just what designers do.

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.670
But that's one component.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.240
But as a critical designer,
what you would do is actually,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.060
you would take more of a
problem-finding approach.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.190
So you would try and think
about nanotechnology,

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.520
scientific biology,
all the new technology

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.100
that we have nowadays,
and you would

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.350
like to think about how that
might change our everyday

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.060
into the next 5, 10 years.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.350
And you would try to
think about actually

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.580
what problem might raise in it.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.650
And in a way, the
product becomes a debate

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.900
that you're going to be doing.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.690
That's the ultimate goal
of a critical designer,

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:41.730
is to design a
platform for debate

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.921
for members of the public.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.420
And in a way, it
makes sense, right?

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.020
A product can also be a debate.

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.704
And that's also means
that we work a lot

00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:49.870
within the field of fiction.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.870
We work a lot with futurists.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:53.630
We work in
pluridisciplinary teams.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:56.330
That's where this
component comes from.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.380
Now, Antonin Artaud is
coming way back forward.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.520
I like to have a mix
of different reference.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:08.230
But Antonin Artaud really,
20th century dramaturge,

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.390
came up with this title
of the Theatre of Cruelty.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.360
And the Theatre of Cruelty
is really this idea

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.590
that in a way, when
you come to see a show,

00:08:15.590 --> 00:08:18.360
you always expect--
just like right now,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.030
you just expect to
be quite passive.

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:21.970
You take in the information.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:22.920
And that is fine.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.560
Nothing is going
to happen to you.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.630
Now, Antonin Artaud
tried to reverse this.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.220
He's saying, well,
actually, you're

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.820
coming to see me on stage,
but I'm going to vomit on you.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.990
I'm going to vomit on you.

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.659
I'm going to throw you
blood on the face, water.

00:08:35.659 --> 00:08:38.309
I'm going to try and
shake you out your body.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:43.239
I'm going to actually get this
sort of violence out of you

00:08:43.239 --> 00:08:46.360
so we can actually really have
this conversation from what

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.460
is happening on stage
and what is happening

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.010
within the public sphere.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.840
So what I'm saying to you is not
that in Nelly Ben Hayoun studio

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.250
we are vomiting on our
clients, not at all.

00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:59.760
But what I'm saying is we like
to take this kind of quite

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.530
dramatic, let's say, approach,
quite visceral way to things,

00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:05.530
where maybe you
might want to expand

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.580
something we are designing, but
we don't leave you the choice.

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.090
It is just happening.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:12.134
So this is how we would
define it, really.

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:13.800
The design of experiences
is this notion

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.780
of engineering a situation.

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:21.040
And if some of you want to
look a bit more into this,

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.290
there is also
situationists as well

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:27.091
that's created this all
engineering of situation

00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:27.590
before.

00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:29.740
So it's not new, some new ideas.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.320
The engineering of
a situation that

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.910
can generate disorder
and critical thinking,

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.340
both in an institution
and amongst members

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.420
of the general public.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:39.630
So that's the idea.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:43.560
Now, what is actually
what we are doing?

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.220
So really, when you think
about the creative process,

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.980
you would think about
chaos at the initial part.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.156
Like it's usually a
bombardment of ideas.

00:09:52.156 --> 00:09:53.530
You would take
some bits from-- I

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:55.670
don't know-- the film
industry, some bits from there,

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.630
and you would mix them up.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.660
You would start to look
at different references,

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.540
and you would come
up with an idea.

00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.890
Now, for us, chaos
comes at the beginning

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.450
of the creative
process, and it also

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:07.610
comes at the end of the creative
process, in the delivery.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:10.732
So in a way, chaos is also
made up of public engagement.

00:10:10.732 --> 00:10:12.190
And I hope that
makes sense to you.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:14.780
And we will get
there in a second.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.660
But total bombardment is another
component of the way we work.

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:22.410
So what does that mean,
total bombardment?

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.701
I'm going to get to it as well.

00:10:23.701 --> 00:10:27.690
But that means that in a
way, we do not tell a product

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.560
or we do not tell a story
just through one channel.

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.250
We look at feature film.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.090
We look at book.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:34.180
We look at app.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.720
We look at exhibition.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.450
And we will sort of spread out
the work and the narratives

00:10:40.450 --> 00:10:43.360
through all of these different
channels to actually really,

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.250
like I said, total bombard you.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:46.840
So there is no way out.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:50.430
It's like it's a total
holistical experience.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.600
And really, what we do is we
like to aim for the impossible.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.961
We love really large-scale
production where everybody's

00:10:56.961 --> 00:10:59.210
telling you-- and mainly all
the funders and clients--

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.480
it's impossible.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.750
And just because this is
impossible, we will do it.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.060
So the crew is also
reflecting this.

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.336
It's a pluridisciplinary crew.

00:11:07.336 --> 00:11:09.960
We've got people coming from the
engineering background, people

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.069
from the art background,
people from the research

00:11:12.069 --> 00:11:13.360
background, science background.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.374
And it's all basically
mixed up together,

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:17.540
which obviously means that
we can argue quite a lot,

00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:20.030
but that's part of the process.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.510
Now, just to come back to
this idea of total bombardment

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.810
and sort of spreading out
narratives in different fields,

00:11:26.810 --> 00:11:28.650
if you want to do
that, you also need

00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:31.750
to have the credits to
be-- like if you want

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.200
to talk to a
scientific audience,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.658
you need to have
the credits within

00:11:34.658 --> 00:11:35.840
that scientific audience.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.060
If you want to get to a
film audience involved,

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.890
you need to have the credit
for that specific world to.

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:43.130
So a lot of what we
do, also, is to try

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:45.300
and actually collaborate
with an institution

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:49.300
that we know will have really
interesting-- will bring

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:51.610
a really interesting
component to the project

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:53.440
or an interesting content to it.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.330
So to this end, back since
like now three years,

00:11:57.330 --> 00:11:59.050
I'm working with
the SETI Institute

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.920
as a designer of experiences.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.080
If you don't know about
the SETI Institute,

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.760
it's the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:10.990
It was created in 1986.

00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:12.630
And the idea of
the SETI Institute

00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:14.954
was to say, well, look,
we might not be alone.

00:12:14.954 --> 00:12:15.870
We might not be alone.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.453
There might be other
things out there.

00:12:17.453 --> 00:12:19.500
And we should better
find out, actually,

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.950
and we should better spend
some time researching this.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:25.690
So the SETI Institute is really
divided in two components--

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:27.820
the SETI Search,
which is about looking

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.794
for signals coming from other
potential civilizations.

00:12:32.794 --> 00:12:35.210
And then you've got the other
part, which is astrobiology,

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:37.376
which is really about finding
life on other planets.

00:12:37.376 --> 00:12:40.280
So that can be bacteria.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:42.230
That can be anything
that we can consider

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.416
as life nowadays-- extremophiles
or things like that.

00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:47.290
And that, to me, has
always been fascinating,

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:50.720
because in there, you get to
all the most pioneer scientists.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:55.390
People really try and break
down the scale of what science

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.940
can actually provide us with.

00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:59.440
And what that bring us-- well,
it's like all new perspective

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.500
to the work we are doing.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.956
We are not just
doing it for here,

00:13:01.956 --> 00:13:04.080
but we're also looking at
the scale of the universe

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:05.519
and what is happening out there.

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:08.060
Now, we're also involved with
the International Astronautical

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.860
Federation.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:11.110
I'm a member of the Space
Education and Outreach

00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.970
Committee.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:13.500
It's a very
interesting place to be

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.375
if you want to play a
role, also politically,

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:18.440
with the decisions which are
being taken in the space field

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.120
and with space agencies.

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.500
It's where I can actually
share these ideas

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.294
and we can actually
discuss about maybe

00:13:24.294 --> 00:13:26.710
there is another way to get
members of the public involved

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.790
with space exploration
than getting them to draw

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.117
a cosmonaut or things that.

00:13:31.117 --> 00:13:32.950
There might be something
else that we can do

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:35.970
which is a bit more in depth.

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:37.400
Let's put it this way.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:43.370
So now, we also collaborate
with WeTransfer since now--

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.280
when did it start?

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.790
In 2011, and their
head of experiences.

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:51.960
And so if you don't
know about WeTransfer,

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.530
that is a free file
transfer service

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:56.680
that allows you to share files.

00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.950
And as you do so, you've
got this background that

00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:00.460
keeps on flipping through it.

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.699
Now, it's been very interesting
for me to collaborate

00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:04.240
with WeTransfer in
the sense that you

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.520
can bring in content as well
through this background.

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.090
You can bring a new
article by "The Guardian."

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:12.681
You can bring the research of
this man here, for example.

00:14:12.681 --> 00:14:13.180
You click.

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.610
You get to his website.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.940
And WeTransfer has 66 million
active users, all digital,

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.740
which obviously is a very
interesting conversation

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.890
that you can get with them.

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:24.650
And then "WIRED," more
recently, in which

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:28.560
we started to actually get
to speak to another audience

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.740
as well.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:31.050
So now what do you?

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:31.960
What do we do?

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.350
What do you do, we know.

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:34.249
But what do we do?

00:14:34.249 --> 00:14:35.540
You probably want to know that.

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.870
Or do you want?

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.050
Yes?

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.290
OK, good.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.420
So we go in the
field a lot, right?

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:46.840
I mean, in that case,
for example, with CERN,

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.040
we went to visit the Large
Hadron Collider, which

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.810
is this place where you bombard
protons at the speed of light.

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:52.820
Think about it.

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:54.610
Bombard protons at
the speed of light

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:58.080
to recreate the first
second of the Big Bang.

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.720
Isn't it fascinating?

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.810
It's so amazing, right?

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.090
But what about us?

00:15:03.090 --> 00:15:04.290
What about all of us?

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.680
How does it feel to be
one of the scientists

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.590
when you're switching
on a machine like this?

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.506
And so that's how the
approach really started there,

00:15:11.506 --> 00:15:12.630
is that I went to see them.

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:14.430
I said, look, this is
amazing, what you do.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.300
But then how can we get
a bit of that magic back

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.990
into our kitchen
sink, for example?

00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:21.670
So we worked
together for a year.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.870
We looked at different type
of physics experiments,

00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:28.534
many-- the Casimir experiment,
if you're looking into physics.

00:15:28.534 --> 00:15:30.700
But I'm not going to go
into details of the physics.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:32.190
But that's what we did there.

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:35.200
And we tried and reproduce it
with the meaning of nowadays.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.750
So, for example, this lady
is using a microwave gun,

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.000
which is pretty dangerous.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.600
Obviously, we reworked some
component of the experiment.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.670
But that's the idea, right?

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:49.320
As a member of the
public, you can now

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.520
generate a picometer,
which is close to nothing,

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.350
but of dark energy, which is
74% of the universal, so total

00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:56.080
unknown.

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.650
So in a way, you can
generate a bit of unknown

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:01.790
while you're eating your
pancake in your kitchen.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.600
Isn't it amazing?

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.540
That's what we want to do if
we were given the opportunity.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.400
Now, here is another
experiment where

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.900
fantastical things happen.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.806
It's in Japan.

00:16:11.806 --> 00:16:13.180
It's called the
Super Kamiokande.

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.090
It's a neutrino observatory.

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:17.200
Now, what is happening
there is eventually,

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.840
you've got a particle
meeting another one.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.780
It creates a huge
explosion, which

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.490
is called a sonic boom when a
particle is traveling faster

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:26.900
than the speed of
light in a vacuum.

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:30.300
And all of this is amazing,
but what about us, again?

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:32.831
So we worked with them and
with the physicists who

00:16:32.831 --> 00:16:34.080
are working on the experiment.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.520
And we told them,
look, how can we

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:38.690
give this as an experience
for a member of the public?

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:41.750
But obviously, we come at it
from a theatrical perspective

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:43.560
and a design perspective, too.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.950
So that means that we will
work the soundtrack with them.

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.860
We will work the light
effect with them.

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:50.730
We will try and reproduce very
accurately what you actually

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:51.640
inside the tank.

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.014
But then there is
component of it

00:16:53.014 --> 00:16:54.960
which are left to
improvisation, of course,

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:58.752
because you do not want to
bombard a member of the public

00:16:58.752 --> 00:16:59.460
with the science.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.794
You also want them
to be in the maze

00:17:01.794 --> 00:17:04.210
of going through this journey
in which they can experience

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:06.460
something which is close to
an out of body experience.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.390
It's very violent,
that project, actually.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.980
You get very low frequency.

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:11.819
You've got your
entire body shaking up

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:12.819
when you go through it.

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:14.150
It's not very enjoyable.

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:16.310
But then obviously,
what we try and look

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.702
for is actually this moment of a
maze where the member of public

00:17:20.702 --> 00:17:21.910
would tell you, is this real?

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:24.500
Is this fake?

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.579
What is this?

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:28.640
And then this is where
the engagement starts.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.880
Now, we work a lot as
well with astronauts.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.990
And one of them is
Jean Pierre Haignere,

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:35.800
who is a French
astronaut that lift off

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.590
three time from the Soyuz
rocket, three times or two

00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:39.090
times.

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:40.120
I need to check that.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.470
But basically, the idea
that I used to tell him,

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:45.605
well, look, if you're just
too small, you're too big,

00:17:45.605 --> 00:17:47.730
you don't have the right
PhD, what are your chances

00:17:47.730 --> 00:17:49.020
to make it in space, really?

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.820
Let's face it.

00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:51.450
Not much.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:53.810
So we went to see him.

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:56.580
And we said, look, can
we try and generate

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.070
a sort of a monster that you
can have in your living room,

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:01.420
like a [INAUDIBLE]
pretty much, that

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:04.990
would give you the entire
holistic experience of a Soyuz

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.325
rocket-- stage one, stage
two, stage three, and then

00:18:08.325 --> 00:18:08.950
weightlessness.

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:10.783
Obviously, weightlessness
is a bit difficult

00:18:10.783 --> 00:18:14.130
to put together in your
living room, but we tried.

00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:15.795
So we did the
soundtrack with him.

00:18:15.795 --> 00:18:17.920
We did everything tailored
to him, because remember

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.494
that if you're
designing experience,

00:18:19.494 --> 00:18:21.660
you're not there to-- you
know, it's not interesting

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:26.040
if it's my own vision of what
a rocket liftoff is about.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.500
It doesn't mean anything.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.079
But if you get the
real expert involved,

00:18:30.079 --> 00:18:32.120
and he's actually helping
you through the process

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.570
to actually make sure that
what you do is tangible,

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:37.440
then this is where it
becomes interesting.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:39.510
At least that's what we think.

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.200
So here is the
stage, experiencing

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:44.770
one of the stage of
the rocket liftoff.

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:47.060
And I'm going to show you
a few extracts of people

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.980
going through their experience.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:54.520
So, for example, as you can
see, it's a pretty loud object.

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:58.380
We killed every single
microphone with it.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.270
But basically, here, these
people will go-- of course,

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.520
there is the whole part which
is about the performance

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.650
and making believe
that actually, you're

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.150
really going to
experience something

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:10.520
which is close to a
scientific experiment.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.360
And then by the
moment you go in this,

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.184
you're actually really seeing
that you are experiencing

00:19:16.184 --> 00:19:17.350
some form of weightlessness.

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:19.683
And you're actually really
believing something as simple

00:19:19.683 --> 00:19:24.930
as that, that I'm actually
lifting you up somewhere.

00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:27.580
And so, this lady, for
example, is saying,

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:29.540
I think it's very terrified.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.830
I thought it was exciting
to go to the moon,

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.860
but it's actually really scary.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.470
But when you get someone
who tells you this, you that

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:37.654
this is job done.

00:19:37.654 --> 00:19:39.070
Because actually,
there is nothing

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.450
more scary than going
into a rocket liftoff.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.980
You never know if you're
going to make it back or not.

00:19:44.980 --> 00:19:47.136
So in a way, getting
that type of feedback

00:19:47.136 --> 00:19:48.760
from a member of the
public is the best

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.343
you can get, really, for someone
who is designing experiences,

00:19:51.343 --> 00:19:54.010
because that's what you
want from them, in a way.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.390
So of course, it means that
there is a lot of trial,

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:57.850
and there is a lot
of improvisation

00:19:57.850 --> 00:19:58.641
that comes with it.

00:19:58.641 --> 00:20:00.960
But that's part of
our process, too.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.370
And we accept that.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.910
And so here is another
extreme project

00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:07.600
in which we were
questioning what

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.350
the future of entertainment
might be like.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:13.191
And doing all these projects,
I realized that actually,

00:20:13.191 --> 00:20:15.190
as a member of the public,
you want things which

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:17.480
are more and more extreme.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:20.800
Even Disney World now is
scary like hell when you think

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:23.040
about it, for a kid, really.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.060
And you need to push
and push and push to get

00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:27.100
that moment of thrill, really.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.250
And in a way, we were looking at
that for this specific project

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:32.860
in which we are working with
volcanologists at Mount St.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:36.350
Helens, which is a
volcano in the US.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:40.390
And we reproduced [INAUDIBLE]
eruption of this volcano.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:43.930
And it comes with
a power supply.

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.564
You push it into
your living room.

00:20:45.564 --> 00:20:46.730
Obviously, it's scaled down.

00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.688
The point is not to kill
you, but it will still

00:20:48.688 --> 00:20:51.402
burn down quite a big
part of your living room.

00:20:51.402 --> 00:20:53.110
And then what we did
is we put it online.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:55.930
We say, who wants to
have this volcano?

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.420
And we weren't interested
really in term of the feedback.

00:20:58.420 --> 00:20:59.860
We had more than
6,000 people who

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:02.884
wanted to have this thing
into their living room.

00:21:02.884 --> 00:21:04.800
And of course, it's
starting this whole debate

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.960
about of course, what do we want
when it comes to entertainment,

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:12.230
and how much extreme do we
want to, actually-- it to be,

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.230
and whether or not we
should domesticate science

00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:16.520
for this, and
specifically volcano,

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:18.180
or whether or not
we shouldn't do it.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:20.400
So it's bringing up all
these ethical and also

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.090
political questions
to the table.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.260
Now, here is our
latest project--

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.590
"Disaster Playground."

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.450
So "Disaster Playground"
is bringing up

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:33.560
all these different ideas
together into a feature film.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.740
But [INAUDIBLE] we
are looking at is

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.280
when you think
about asteroid, you

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.060
would think about Bruce
Willis with a big drill,

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.555
ready to save all of us.

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:47.180
That's what we all
automatically think.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.270
And if you think even further,
you would think, OK, well,

00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:51.450
it's pretty much in hands.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.910
NASA's got it in hands, or
[? ISSA's ?] got it in hands.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.170
But someone must
have this in hands,

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.200
because we do not want to
finish like the dinosaurs.

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:01.640
Now, the reality's
a bit different.

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.970
And I didn't use that when
I started the project,

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.790
but I was really
interested in this notion

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:08.590
of how can we
actually bring back

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:11.810
the political mind together
with the scientific mind?

00:22:11.810 --> 00:22:14.340
Because if you look
at, for example,

00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:17.220
the atomic bomb, a lot of things
that they've been reproached

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:18.800
to Oppenheimer is
the fact that he

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.460
was so sublime by the
technology that, in a way,

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.220
he never thought about the cause
or what political implication

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.860
his discovery would do.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.040
And there is this notion
since the Second World War

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:34.410
that in any case, scientists
do not have critical thinking.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:38.950
And I wanted to actually come
up with a project in which we

00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:40.850
will prove that they
have critical thinking.

00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:43.061
So we needed to come up
with something quite extreme

00:22:43.061 --> 00:22:45.060
in which they will be
forced to actually come up

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.780
with a political decision.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.770
And so that's where this
whole scenario came up.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.720
So we went all around the US to
meet with the chain of command,

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.410
the people who actually
have a real role

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:57.470
to play if an asteroid
was to strike.

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:59.480
And we went to meet them all.

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.330
We went all the way to the
White House, to the UN.

00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:03.694
And here is a few extracts.

00:23:03.694 --> 00:23:05.110
So we went to visit
the monitoring

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:09.041
device who are looking for
what is out there in the sky.

00:23:09.041 --> 00:23:09.820
Here they are.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.340
We looked at the
role of amateurs

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:13.780
into asteroid detection.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.691
We met with the
Minor Planet Center

00:23:15.691 --> 00:23:17.690
as well, the people who
are basically monitoring

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:21.720
the sky on daily basis.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.870
We looked at the
detection technique.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:24.930
Here is Mark Boslough.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:26.888
He's working at the Sandia
National Laboratory,

00:23:26.888 --> 00:23:29.790
which is a place where
originally the atomic bomb was

00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:30.530
created.

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:33.640
So do we or shall we send
anything to actually burst

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.620
this thing in space?

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:39.220
We worked with astronauts,
notably Rusty Schweickart, who

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.640
was an Apollo 9 astronaut,
who actually is really

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:45.410
engaged with that
specific topic,

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:47.550
and he's one of the mentors
of the World Asteroid

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.810
Day, which I'm going to
tell you a bit more about.

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:51.530
We went all the way
to NASA headquarters,

00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:55.035
met Lindley Johnson, and with
people who actually started

00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:56.770
the NEO programs,
the Near-Earth Object

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:59.690
program, which is-- near-earth
objects is asteroids,

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.310
basically.

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:02.640
But it extends to more objects.

00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:04.240
And then all the way to the UN.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.950
And of course, we talked
as well with the people

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.010
who will have a role
to play on the ground.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.270
And we trained with the
people from Disaster City.

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:13.228
So I don't now if you
know about Disaster City,

00:24:13.228 --> 00:24:18.430
but it's the place where
all the teams worldwide

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:21.090
get teamed for disaster
type of scenario.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.330
That's what it looks like.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.460
So the entire technique
was, of course,

00:24:24.460 --> 00:24:26.420
one of the Theatre of Cruelty.

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.550
I would turn up in office
with these props that

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:32.080
would put them under a
massive amount of pressure.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.730
And hopefully, we
wanted to get back

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.590
to the core of how they
would react for real if we're

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.835
in this real situation.

00:24:37.835 --> 00:24:38.960
So you can get that, right?

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.610
We are in a "what if"
situation that we've staged,

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:44.110
and we get them to actually
perform how they would really

00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:45.750
react to it.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:47.840
So here is a few of our props.

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.700
And then like I say, it's
not just a feature film.

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.092
It's also the booth,
the app, the exhibition.

00:24:53.092 --> 00:24:55.550
And all of these stories are
being told at different levels

00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.420
so a member of the
public can engage with it

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.674
at different components.

00:24:59.674 --> 00:25:00.590
And I will come to it.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.530
Now, I work a lot
with music, too.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:05.520
And in this case, we worked
with Ed Banger Records,

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:07.490
which, if you don't
know them, they

00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:09.780
produce Daft Punk, Justice,
and all these people.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:11.950
And they actually compose
the music for the film.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.760
And then we worked
with punk band Prodigy.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.780
Prodigy, yes?

00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:20.616
And then they actually
re-orchestrated

00:25:20.616 --> 00:25:22.990
one of their music for the
International Space Orchestra,

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.300
which is an orchestra we have.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.114
So anyway, I'm going to
show you the trailer, which

00:25:27.114 --> 00:25:28.030
I hope you will enjoy.

00:25:28.030 --> 00:25:30.437
And then we move
to the next step.

00:25:30.437 --> 00:25:32.872
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

notified of a building collapse

00:25:43.290 --> 00:25:45.366
to Building 239, cause unknown.

At 8:30 this
morning, an asteroid

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.980
impacted the county of Granger.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:59.960
-Our team on the ground
are currently investigating

-I can't believe this.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:19.560
There's news here that an
asteroid just hit in Texas,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.010
and it took out an entire town.

00:26:21.010 --> 00:26:23.560
-It doesn't make any sense to
me what you're talking about.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.090
-Asteroids.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:24.999
-An asteroid?

00:26:24.999 --> 00:26:25.540
-An asteroid!

-We have the means
to protect our planet

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.100
if we choose to do so.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:48.260
If we don't, we might go
the way of the dinosaurs.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:49.920
-Asteroids are
definitely coming.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.810
There is one that's
going to hit the Earth.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.260
It's already set
on that trajectory.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.840
We just don't know
which one it is.

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.430
So here's a
tremendous catastrophe

00:26:57.430 --> 00:27:01.670
that can be prevented by
humans working and preserving

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:04.799
and modeling and preparing.

about blowing up an asteroid
or pushing it or moving it,

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.820
what we need to do, before we
think about that is understand

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:25.789
what's the threat?

I don't know.

don't think anybody

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:43.430
knew who Oppenheimer would
be prior to Manhattan Project

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.300
either.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.480

so the dates are all in
there and [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:36.615 --> 00:29:38.990
Anyway, another thing I wanted
to tell you about as well,

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.060
because we are all about
music, too, in the studio,

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:44.930
we have an orchestra which is
based at NASA Ames Research

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.800
Center and the SETI Institute.

00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.710
And it pretty much
looks like this.

00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:52.470
It's about 60
members which are all

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:53.900
coming from
different departments

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.720
at NASA, SETI
Singularity University.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.350
Basically, it's a
space community which

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.140
is based in Silicon Valley.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.290
We want to extend
it others, but we

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:08.350
need to keep it within
something that we can actually

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.260
know where this is all going,

00:30:10.260 --> 00:30:13.791
Anyway, the first
performance we actually

00:30:13.791 --> 00:30:15.540
did with the International
Space Orchestra

00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:18.720
was also looking
at when things go

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.040
terribly wrong in
mission control,

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.090
how do people actually do react?

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.590
And who are those sort
of heroes that manage

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:28.060
to find how to deal with it?

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.300
And in a way, it's
part of the story when

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.380
it comes to the craft
of space exploration

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:33.850
that we don't know much about.

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:36.295
Because actually, if you look
at the communication that

00:30:36.295 --> 00:30:38.150
is being done by most
of the space agencies,

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:40.670
like we will share
all the successes,

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.000
but when there is problem,
we don't share that.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.200
And it makes sense,
you might think.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:48.930
But actually, if you go
back in time with the Greek,

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.600
for example, they used to
have this old dramatic session

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.960
where they would
get a chorus that

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.440
would sing the difficulties
to be in politics.

00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.130
It was called the
politeia, and it

00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:01.060
would be like the
pathos live on stage,

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.560
and they would sing
the difficulties

00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.070
of being a politician.

00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.690
Now, that created
a bit of sympathy,

00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.160
or empathy, I would say,
by a member of the public.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.350
If it is difficult,
then I can understand.

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.740
If it's only success,
success, success,

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:17.860
how can I feel for you in a way?

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.220
So we tried to put
this together in music.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.800
And then here we are actually
having Bobby Womack, Damon

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.915
Albarn to compose the music.

00:31:25.915 --> 00:31:28.040
Maywa Denki is a Japanese
composer; Bruce Sterling.

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.660
who is a science fiction
author that came with his wife

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.820
Jasmina Tesanovic to perform
as part of the orchestra

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:38.430
at Penguin Cafe with UK,
really beautiful jazz band.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:40.840
Evan Price was our
music director,

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.040
who is a genius, really.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.990
Because when you think
about it, all of them

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.540
didn't know each other at
the beginning of the project.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.420
And also, I'm not a musician,
so I just pick them up.

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.580
Oh, you play a triangle?

00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:52.700
Come in the orchestra.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:53.840
Oh, you play the dobro?

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.590
Come in it.

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:58.410
Oh, you play-- so it's like it's
an absolute mix of instruments.

00:31:58.410 --> 00:32:01.690
So pretty much to
actually sound harmonic,

00:32:01.690 --> 00:32:03.570
you need to have
quite a skill there.

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:05.810
And that was the one of Evan.

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:08.420
So here is one of our
members, Yvonne Gagle,

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:09.430
who is an astronaut.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.450
And then, of
course, like I said,

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:14.420
it doesn't make sense for me to
direct it without the expert.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.680
I do not know how
the voice tone needs

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.480
to be like when you perform
inside a mission control.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.844
I needed some help.

00:32:21.844 --> 00:32:23.260
Therefore, we
directed it together

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:28.550
with Rusty Hunt, who is a flight
director at NASA and Astronaut

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.022
Gagle to actually get
this as right as possible.

00:32:31.022 --> 00:32:33.480
And then they were positioned
like they were in the Mission

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:37.140
Control of the Apollo 11 mission
because we reenact the Apollo

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.600
11 mission.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.954
And it was part
scripted, part perform.

00:32:40.954 --> 00:32:42.370
And then here,
they are performing

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.203
in front of the world's
largest [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:44.203 --> 00:32:46.362
We eventually got to
record at Skywalker.

00:32:46.362 --> 00:32:47.820
I don't know if I
have time to show

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:51.113
you the extract from the feature
film, maybe a tiny bit of it.

00:32:51.113 --> 00:32:52.592
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:56.370
-I pretty much feel like if
I'm an astronaut right now.

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.290
The International Space
Orchestra, it's a world for us,

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:05.790
right?

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:08.022
It's never been done before.

00:33:08.022 --> 00:33:10.470
I mean, NASA Ames is
such a messy place--

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.710
2,500 researchers.

00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:15.370
So it's as well bringing
this whole event together.

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:18.580
So then we can all meet
and make something happen.

00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:20.230
Yes, it's going to
be very enjoyable.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:22.675
But then also, it's going
to be quite odd work.

00:33:22.675 --> 00:33:25.050
So I just hope that you're
all going to take part in this

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.566
and take it with
the right attitude.

00:33:27.566 --> 00:33:29.652
-You remind me of
a good con artist.

00:33:29.652 --> 00:33:30.564
-[LAUGHS].

00:33:30.564 --> 00:33:31.476
-A good what?

00:33:31.476 --> 00:33:32.850
-You know what a con artist is?

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:36.490
-Someone who can sell
anything to anybody.

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:39.320
-Test tubes, go. [INAUDIBLE] go.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.340
Ethanol spray, go.

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.360
Capcom, we are go
for power descend.

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:44.630
-We're here.

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:45.445
We're here.

00:33:45.445 --> 00:33:46.461
We're on the moon.

00:33:46.461 --> 00:33:46.960
This is it.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.990
That should almost be-- every
word is just like a crystal

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:51.450
coming though.

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:56.240
The eagle has landed.

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:58.290
-I'm kind of a perfectionist.

00:33:58.290 --> 00:34:00.470
And I'm a pretty
high energy person.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:02.240
-You know, science
is black and white.

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:03.770
Music probably isn't.

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:08.469
But it still takes a
creative mind to do it.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:12.350
-When we go wherever we're going
to go-- be it Mars or beyond--

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:15.500
you have to take the
human spirit with you,

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.531
or we won't survive or
thrive where we're going.

00:34:18.531 --> 00:34:22.361
-I mean, they're never going to
be the Philharmonic, all right?

00:34:22.361 --> 00:34:25.886
But that's not the point.

00:34:25.886 --> 00:34:26.469
[END PLAYBACK]

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:27.344
-We did this project.

00:34:27.344 --> 00:34:30.690
And then since every year,
new performance, new composer,

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:31.739
new scene.

00:34:31.739 --> 00:34:34.489
Lately, it was with Beck at
the Davies Symphony Hall.

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.090
And actually, they're
getting better and better.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:38.514
They just got a
standing ovation,

00:34:38.514 --> 00:34:41.570
so I was very happy for
them, because a lot of them

00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:44.139
had to make a choice
between going into music

00:34:44.139 --> 00:34:45.639
or actually going into science.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:49.081
So it was, for them,
a bit of a moment.

00:34:49.081 --> 00:34:51.330
And then we eventually got
this music that we recorded

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:54.420
at Skywalker-- which is a place
where they recorded "Star Wars"

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.370
initially, right?-- to be
sent in space, of course,

00:34:58.370 --> 00:35:01.150
where it's actually
since August,

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:04.980
orbiting the Earth on one
of these nanosatellites,

00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:08.760
which are run by Nanosatisfi,
Spire if you're interested

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.400
in nanosattelites.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.344
And then here they are orbiting
and singing from there.

00:35:13.344 --> 00:35:14.760
And then currently,
we are working

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.060
on a new extreme project where
we are looking for partners.

00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.350
So if you're interested
in joining us in this new

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.920
expedition, which is pretty cold
and very deep down in the sea,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.190
I cannot say much about it,
but it involves Viking ship,

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.810
underwater discoveries,
something, something,

00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:31.705
something.

00:35:31.705 --> 00:35:32.330
So here you go.

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.115
So that's where you will see
all our things in the next year

00:35:36.115 --> 00:35:37.260
or so.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:37.760
Voila!

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.180
-Thank you.
