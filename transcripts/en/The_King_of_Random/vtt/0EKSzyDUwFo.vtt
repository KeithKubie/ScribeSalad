00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.299
Gooey melted marshmallows dripping with chocolate,
and sandwiched between two graham crackers.

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.630
They taste so good, it makes you want s'more.
But if you've ever tried roasting marshmallows

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.040
on an open fire, they may have ended up a
bit more crispy than you ever intended. In

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.490
this project let's avoid the charred carbon
coating, by turning your empty drink cans,

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.090
into a simple and effective, s'mores roaster.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.580
We’re all familiar with the term “lifehacks”, but this summer, 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.760
the guys at mike’s hard
lemonade asked me to help put a refreshing

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680
twist on it with what they’re calling “mikehacks"
/ˈmīkˌhak/

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.330
noun: mikehack; plural noun: mikehacks; noun:
mike hack; plural noun: mike hacks

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.470
1. basically a lifehack that makes any social
occasion, more awesome.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.800
This little contraption will help melt your
marshmallows and chocolate, to s'mores perfection,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.070
making for a delicious ending to your summer socials. To start this project, we're gonna

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.620
need a 16 oz aluminum drink can, as well
as a pair of scissors, and a marker. Now,

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.470
if we turn the can upside down on a flat surface,
holding the marker a quarter of the way up

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.760
from the bottom, we can easily mark a line
around the can just by giving it one complete

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.680
turn. Let's go ahead and cut the top off the
can, making sure we stay about an inch above

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.250
the line, because this initial cut is gonna
come out pretty jagged. Now we can go ahead

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.000
and cut along the line, making sure we're
cutting counter clock-wise, so we end up with

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.330
a nice clean edge all around the top. Alright,
next we need to find something the same shape

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.240
and size as a box of toothpicks or matches.
And the size is important. You can see it's

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.920
gonna take a bit of manipulation, but the
end of the box should just barely fit inside

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.240
the can. Now if we set the can upright, and
push the box all the way to the bottom, we'll

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.080
be able to use it as a form to crease the
edges, and mold the can to the shape of the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.229
box. At this point, let's gently pull the
box back out of the can, and you can see our

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.920
little roaster oven is halfway done. Now this container shape is perfect for accommodating

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.409
a couple of graham crackers, but the problem
is that everything keeps falling over forward.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.630
Let's solve that challenge By adding some
feet. We'll need to snip each of the 4 corners,

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.049
about half an inch deep, then crease the sides
over flat against the can. If we bend them

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.850
back and forth a few times you can see they
make a clean break, and I like to trim the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.090
corners off the can just to clean them up
a bit. If you did the same, the tabs on your

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.260
can should look something like this. Now,
if you look closely, you can see where I poked

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.430
two holes in the upper tab as well, and when
this is folded inside the can, and the bottom

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.069
feet are bent down like this, our s'mores
roaster is completely finished. All we need

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.430
to do now is load our crackers with some chocolate
and marshmallows, then tuck them inside the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.050
can so we can get them roasting. Now if we
set this near the edge of a campfire with

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.080
the open end facing the flames, it should
only take a few minutes to get our marshmallows

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.630
toasting, to golden brown perfection. A quick
peek inside, and you can see everything is

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.040
soft and gooey, and looking delicious. Now
there are all kinds of other ways this can

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.830
be used as well. For a more adventurous approach,
I tried bending a coat hanger to form a make-shift

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.239
roasting stick, and slipped the forked end
inside the tab holes we made earlier. The

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.270
cool thing about this method is you can get
closer to the heat, and the flames don't actually

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.760
touch the marshmallows. So they shouldn't
catch on fire. Instead, everything gets melted

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.790
into a soft and gooey goodness that's completely
irresistible. Another idea you can try is

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.970
fitting the roaster between the gaps on your
cooking grill. The leftover heat from bbq'ing

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.209
should be just enough to make one of these
sweet and tasty treats. Well now you know

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.250
how to turn your empty aluminum drink cans,
into a flame resistant s'mores roaster, so

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.470
you'll never have to worry about carbon encrusted
marshmallows again. By the way, if you're

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.400
at home and don't feel like getting a fire
going, try setting a hairdryer to medium or

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.069
high heat, then aiming it inside the can.
In 2 minutes or less, you'll have the great

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.519
same results, without even having to strike
a match. Well that's it for now. If you liked

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.319
this project, perhaps you'll like some of
my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
