00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.350
thought it was going to be in fact I was
surprised at the level of depth that was

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
surprised at the level of depth that was
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.550
surprised at the level of depth that was
given to certain characters in this

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560
given to certain characters in this
 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.469

these characters and make them less
robotic so to speak and that was

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
robotic so to speak and that was
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:26.960
robotic so to speak and that was
something that really surprised me they

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970
something that really surprised me they
 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.999
something that really surprised me they
actually did take time with the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009
actually did take time with the
 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.100
actually did take time with the
characters which is good however I think

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110
characters which is good however I think
 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.749
characters which is good however I think
they took a little too much time because

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
they took a little too much time because
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.130
they took a little too much time because
there are elements of this movie that

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
there are elements of this movie that
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.050
there are elements of this movie that
dragged weird the first Robocop film he

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
dragged weird the first Robocop film he
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.850
dragged weird the first Robocop film he
was immediately like robotic and it was

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860
was immediately like robotic and it was
 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.770
was immediately like robotic and it was
about him learning to access his

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
about him learning to access his
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.990
about him learning to access his
humanity again when he becomes Robocop

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000
humanity again when he becomes Robocop
 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.090
humanity again when he becomes Robocop
in this movie he still has his human

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
in this movie he still has his human
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.530
in this movie he still has his human
side and it's about him learning to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540
side and it's about him learning to
 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.480
side and it's about him learning to
actually be more like a robot and then

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
actually be more like a robot and then
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.830
actually be more like a robot and then
the struggle with the human and the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
the struggle with the human and the
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.569
the struggle with the human and the
robotic side and I enjoyed that effort

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579
robotic side and I enjoyed that effort
 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.710
robotic side and I enjoyed that effort
but at the same time I think it kind of

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720
but at the same time I think it kind of
 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120
but at the same time I think it kind of
took away from the movie too because it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
took away from the movie too because it
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.340
took away from the movie too because it
really stretched out this elongated

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350
really stretched out this elongated
 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.740
really stretched out this elongated
training period just to have him back to

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
training period just to have him back to
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.469
training period just to have him back to
where he was as a robot all of a sudden

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479
where he was as a robot all of a sudden
 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.670
where he was as a robot all of a sudden
and then it just felt like we didn't

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
and then it just felt like we didn't
 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.289
and then it just felt like we didn't
really get anywhere we actually we

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
really get anywhere we actually we
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.030
really get anywhere we actually we
tracked it a little bit but my biggest

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040
tracked it a little bit but my biggest
 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.679
tracked it a little bit but my biggest
flaw with this movie is the villains

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
flaw with this movie is the villains
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.869
flaw with this movie is the villains
they're like they're horrible they're

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879
they're like they're horrible they're
 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.999
they're like they're horrible they're
just cookie cutter villains there's a

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009
just cookie cutter villains there's a
 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.260
just cookie cutter villains there's a
bad guy there

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270
bad guy there
 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.510
bad guy there
this organization and we don't like him

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520
this organization and we don't like him
 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.670
this organization and we don't like him
because he's bad and then the actual

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680
because he's bad and then the actual
 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.890
because he's bad and then the actual
villain eventually services but it was

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900
villain eventually services but it was
 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.050
villain eventually services but it was
such a weak betrayal of what this

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060
such a weak betrayal of what this
 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.850
such a weak betrayal of what this
villain could have been that's not

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860
villain could have been that's not
 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.740
villain could have been that's not
really a very interesting antagonist so

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
really a very interesting antagonist so
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.330
really a very interesting antagonist so
since these villains were kind of weak

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340
since these villains were kind of weak
 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.400
since these villains were kind of weak
in the movie the action didn't really

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
in the movie the action didn't really
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.680
in the movie the action didn't really
feel like it had that much urgency so I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690
feel like it had that much urgency so I
 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.500
feel like it had that much urgency so I
wasn't really all that worried whenever

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510
wasn't really all that worried whenever
 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.840
wasn't really all that worried whenever
this guy was in battle because he's so

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850
this guy was in battle because he's so
 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.120
this guy was in battle because he's so
precise he's so perfect at what he does

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130
precise he's so perfect at what he does
 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.040
precise he's so perfect at what he does
that it didn't really feel as if there

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050
that it didn't really feel as if there
 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.080
that it didn't really feel as if there
was any emotion there and I get it he's

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
was any emotion there and I get it he's
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.840
was any emotion there and I get it he's
a robot emotion is supposed to be absent

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850
a robot emotion is supposed to be absent
 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.630
a robot emotion is supposed to be absent
from the scenario but emotion in regards

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
from the scenario but emotion in regards
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.580
from the scenario but emotion in regards
to what the audience is feeling in these

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590
to what the audience is feeling in these
 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.200
to what the audience is feeling in these
action scenes would have been better

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210
action scenes would have been better
 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.750
action scenes would have been better
because I didn't really feel as if I was

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
because I didn't really feel as if I was
 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.240
because I didn't really feel as if I was
invested in some of the action in the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250
invested in some of the action in the
 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.250
invested in some of the action in the
movie or him as a character simply

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260
movie or him as a character simply
 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.190
