00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.120
I got asked a question the other day, I was working with a company.

2
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.680
I was actually, no, it was Nicole working with a company.

3
00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:10.681
I was doing a speech and I was doing some Q and a at the end and a guy asked me,

4
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.960
how do you define character and how do you build it?

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.760
And I'd actually never been asked this question before and quite frankly,

6
00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.910
I hadn't really thought about it very much. And,

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.880
and this guy had to thought about it and I talked to him afterwards and it was

8
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:29.260
something that he,

9
00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.040
it was why he really wanted to hear me talk because he wanted to get my

10
00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:34.120
perspective on this.

11
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.380
And I answered the question like this.

12
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.210
I said, you know, for me,

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.160
character is not a very complex thing.

14
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.930
For me.

15
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.250
Character is you do what's right,

16
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.410
you do what's right, you do the right thing. That's what you do.

17
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.910
And if you do the right thing, regardless of what the consequences are,

18
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:08.260
that that represents character. And so then how do you build character?

19
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.620
It's a beautiful thing because it's the same thing.

20
00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.710
If you want to build character, you do the right thing.

21
00:01:14.711 --> 00:01:17.470
You do the right thing for yourself. You do the right thing for your family,

22
00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:20.110
you do the right thing for the people that you know,

23
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.760
you do the right thing for your community.

24
00:01:21.761 --> 00:01:24.280
You do the right thing for your country. That's what you do.

25
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.470
And now on an individual level, those things are hard things often,

26
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.440
right? If those are hard things, you have to make the right decisions.

27
00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.490
You have to live a disciplined life. Those build character,

28
00:01:36.491 --> 00:01:40.810
those little things that you do on a daily basis to make yourself better,

29
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.150
to improve your health, to improve your,

30
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.580
your situation in life. You're doing those things. They're hard to do.

31
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.860
And when you do those things,

32
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.640
they build your character and ultimately they lead to your, your,

33
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.520
your character being a good character as opposed to a bad one.

34
00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.390
But I'd never been asked that question before and I thought that the simplicity

35
00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:05.260
of it is pretty clear when you think about it. You know,

36
00:02:05.261 --> 00:02:06.810
when you think about the people that you know, you don't.

37
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.820
When I think about the,

38
00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:11.950
the people that I worked for in the military or that work for me upward down the

39
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:16.000
chain of command. What is it that made them people that, cause you know,

40
00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:16.980
there's bad care. You know, we,

41
00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.720
we can't sit here and pretend like everybody that just because you're in the

42
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:22.270
military, you've got great characters. That's absolutely not true.

43
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.890
But what about those people? And I, you know, I've thought through this in,

44
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.110
in three seconds as this guy asked me this question, you know,

45
00:02:29.111 --> 00:02:29.681
I thought to myself, well,

46
00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:32.530
what about the guys that I know that have good character that I look to and say,

47
00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:36.160
yeah, this, this person I trust, you know, without question,

48
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.620
what kind of person is that? That's the person that you know,

49
00:02:38.621 --> 00:02:41.080
is going to do the right thing all the time, regardless of the consequence.

50
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.590
<v 1>And a couple of things about that. First of all, it isn't easy.</v>

51
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.910
In fact, usually the right thing is the toughest thing. You know, it's the,

52
00:02:50.911 --> 00:02:55.260
it's the hard decision. The second thing is it doesn't always turn out, um,

53
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.830
for the best when you do the right thing. Lots of times we stumble, you know,

54
00:02:58.831 --> 00:03:03.370
and, and your listeners may think that the three of us, you know, have always,

55
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.140
uh, you know, been on the top of the heap,

56
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.300
but all three of us have fallen short, you know, I mean, uh,

57
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:13.300
I'll tell you this, uh, languishing in prison camp. The first,

58
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.230
the first month in that prison camp I laid there in, in,

59
00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.920
in blood and sweat and tears and uh, and,

60
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.950
and my mental state was just in the tank because I'd given up fighter pilots and

61
00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:27.880
not supposed to give up.

62
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.980
Jim and I weren't trained to surrender and, and my, my mental,

63
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.890
the depression that I had just because of that.

64
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.010
And I think that largely in life, you know,

65
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.880
when you do do the right thing and it doesn't turn out right,

66
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.300
then you have to get up, dust yourself off,

67
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.160
get back in the back in this, in the fray. And that's tough to do.

68
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.780
You know, the last thing you want to do when, when,

69
00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.680
when you're getting beat up every from every side and you'd really want to quit,

70
00:03:59.681 --> 00:04:02.680
the last thing you want to do is to, is to stand up and,

71
00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.110
and be forceful again to, to, you know,

72
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.020
to take control of the situation.

73
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.790
And yet it's those kinds of challenges in life that build that character,

74
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.690
you know, that really make the difference between, you know,

75
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.850
that the positive life, uh,

76
00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.450
the life lived well in those guys and gals that, uh,

77
00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.950
that don't make those kinds of decisions.
