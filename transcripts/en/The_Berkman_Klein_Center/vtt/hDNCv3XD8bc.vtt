00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right. So we move from the sprinting to the lightning.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Our biggest -- Beta Sprint review team recommended six

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
slightly longer positions which we've just seen,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and then three lightning round presentations.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I would love to ask Bookworm, the DPLA Collection Achievements

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and Profiles System, and Wikicite all come up on stage,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I think we can more or less fit the whole crew,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
so we have more or less of the back-and-forth action.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And if you can't fit there, maybe just stand close by,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we're going to go Bookworm and then Collection Achievement

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and Profile System and then SJUR last.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
All right. So the first of the lightnings is called Bookworm.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Ben Schmidt, Martin Camacho, thank you so much for being here.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
All right. So I'm Ben Schmidt, I'm a graduate student in history at Princeton University,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and visiting graduate fellow at the Cultural Observatory.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm Martin Camacho, an undergraduate in math at Harvard.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And we're here to talk about our project,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which is Bookworm. We are a relatively smaller group,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so we focused on one thing, and that's search.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
We want to talk about how you find things in the digital library.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So this is an example of the current search site, the open libraries interface

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and it works like a lot of interfaces, you get about five-ten results,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and you get a bunch of metadata fields on the right side

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
of the screen so that you can limit the books that you're

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
interested in looking at. This is a good interface,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
it's so good that pretty much everyone is using it nowadays.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The New York public Library's redesigned -- even commercial sites like Amazon

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and Google are producing essentially the same sort of search results. These search results are good,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but only for a particular type of search engine,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
when you're trying to find a few books which match your particular search terms

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
or you know the author of for Unocal on metadata that you're interested in.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But it's not great for exploring a huge library.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Doesn't give you a sense of the volume of these libraries, and it discourages browsing anyway,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
in some ways we've re-created the closed stack library.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So we're wondering how you can create a new form of

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
search that will allow you to look at large groups of books at the same time,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and we started with something that the Cultural Observatory released last year,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
which was the Google books and grandeur,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which is something that lets you look at -- engram, using the vast Google books collection.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We learned two things.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
People are really good at finding patterns in these sorts of visual displays,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
if you look at a chart like this that shows the rise of a

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
university library, and that its decline or something,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and the rise of the digital library in the 1990s,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that this -- clear patterns that you want to investigate

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and you want to look into that motivate you to actually find these books.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
We actually also learned that people complain about books and have interesting insights

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
about books and this sort of thing doesn't address.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It doesn't let you find out what the individual books are here because meditation per --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
understrength licensing conditions can actually get at the catalog information.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So we wanted to take both of these things and put them together.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
The power of the insights you can get to fulltext made

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
visible through compelling visualization that people can

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
use to find patterns with library quality metadata in an

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
experience that places reading books at the center of

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
library search interface. And this we came up with Bookworm.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I think maybe you shouldn't go to that URL quite yet,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
because live demo is about to happen

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and we do not have a spectacular server here.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Is the -- [Laughter] but afterwards I urge you to  try to crash at.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Our hope with a Bookworm is it helps  you will have a new

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
engagement with Liber is. Martin will show how this works.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
-- With libraries.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
All right. This is the main interface of Bookworm,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and we've tried to make  the user interface where the

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
user build data visualizationn where they can define the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
axes and also defined a different series and the charts.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Here have searched for the word evolution

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and I'm graphing it over the corpus of all books so what

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I get is the graph that shows the percentage of books in

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the 19th century which use the word evolution.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Suppose I'm interested in the use of the word evolution

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and science. I go here, I had another group of books, go into the metadata selector,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and pick a subject science, which is in the standardization,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and every submit the query,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
now I can see of course evolution is used much more

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
probably in science than it was on average in all books.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I can keep doing this -- so I'll add social science here.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Which is H, for some reason.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
[Laughter]

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You are evidently not a librarian. Exactly.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
[Laughter]

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And now I can see that there's a short

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and steep increase in the usage of evolution

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and social sciences around 10 years after Charles R.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
published origin of species around 1870

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and keeps increasing until it gets to about as popular in

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
social sciences in about 1900.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Even if I didn't know anything about social Darwinism,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I could still kind of look at -- see something

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
interesting is going on here. So I want to find out more.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I can click on the graph in a certain year, say, 1880.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
What pops up as a list of all the books

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and social sciences published in 1880 which use the word evolution,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and this is ranked by frequency of usage of the word ask -- evolution.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I can read any of these using the open libraries awesome

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
online book reader getting read.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Let's read principles of sociology by Herbert Spencer.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
This will pop up the book in the open Library reader.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
That's the basic gist of Bookworm.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Please visit us at bookworm.culturomics.org.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Thanks so much for your time.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Great job, guys.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Wonderful job. We're going to go on without questions

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and then we'll come back to the whole group with

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000
questions and that's okay. So, Tito Sierra

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and Jason Renato, the DPLA collection  profile system.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Curious to see how the graphical prepositioned -- graphical revisitation turns out.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I'm going to talk about the Beta Sprint collection achievement and profile system

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and just to give you a little bit of context for this,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
we begin from certain assumptions.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
One assumption is that there's already a lot of cultural

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
heritage content online on the web.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Many different formats, from large organizations, small organizations,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and more of this content is coming online every day.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
The problem that we see is that a lot of this content is distributed, it's silos.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It's not easily discoverable by search engines or really well connected.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And therefore, just because it's accessible doesn't mean it's discoverable.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Which is a scene that some of us talked about this morning.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It's unfortunate that a lot of this is really great

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
content that's underutilized by the general public.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So basically a layman's way of working -- looking at our

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
proposal is to say that what we're proposing is building

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
something kind of like a link in profile,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
for every special library archive

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
or museum collection in the country.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
On a more technical kind of point of view,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
rather than hold a tool or a destination where websites,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
what we're proposing is building basically a platform

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that sympathize aggregation of collections, both big and small distributed.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And to also facilitate interoperability between these collections.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So as part of the Beta Sprint, Jason and I developed a set of wire frames.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I only have five minutes so I'm only going to show you two,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
but we have a poster outside where you can see for more.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
If you go to our site, you can see more of their also.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
I'm going to quickly highlight some of the features of this profile system.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We came up with this concept called minimal viable profile record,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
what is the minimal amount of metadata about a collection to be part of the system.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
A title URL, description, and a category.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
The idea is to have a really low barrier of entry so that

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
we can have really small collections represented in this.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
But the idea, we also introduced this concept of achievements.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Basically is a little discrete pieces of metadata that

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
could be attached to the profile to

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
extend the profile in many different ways,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
so we don't begin from an assumption of a single monolithic data structure.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
We feel that you could have perhaps 100 different

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
achievements which tackle different aspects of using the

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
collection, and that each collection can pick

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and choose achievements that make sense for that particular collection.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
In this particular example,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
you can think of these -- as widgets. A collection

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and a visitor in for what widget to collect data about

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
the actual physical collection that that represents.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Perhaps maybe encouraging access to the fit -- to the physical collection

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and also the last one here is just an example of -- we call it robot friendly,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and it's metadata to help with crawling.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
We propose a very open collaborative model,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
so there's not a single set of curators doing this,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
but it's like Wikipedia, very open.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Collection managers can update these records were volunteers,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
people in the general public can contribute to it.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Although we're showing screenshots of the website,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
the primary benefit of this is to help other third-party services ill services that aggregate

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and reuse some of this content,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
so you would have API access, to the collection.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
This is one way of doing it through JSON,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
but one can man in -- imagine a different serialization for getting at the score information.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And finally,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
this is a screenshot to sort of show our brainstorm on

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
where these -- this idea of achievements can go,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000
so we have several categories. Or motion, content, so content reuse,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
maybe you could have something like teaching tools,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
to help people engage with collections.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
A donate widget to help people get funds for their

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
collections, current awareness tools like RSS feeds,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
analytics tools, any number of ideas here.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
The idea is that a platform that allows these sort of metadata elements to grow

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and be attached to the collections.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So just to summarize our proposal,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
rather than think about the DPLA as a site or two or destination,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
we envision it as a networking platform that can help

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
cultural organizations both big and small maximize

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
the use and discovery of their content. With that, thank you.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
[Applause]

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Thank you, Tito and Jason. That was evocative and thoughtful.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Thank you. Last of the lightning sprinters,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
another of our great friends, Samuel Klein

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
but SJ to me. From what the media.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
One of the most important wiki manaics out there.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
He's going to fabless of final lightning sprint.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Thanks a lot. This is an amazing audience

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and I wanted to mention after the discussions earlier

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
today, John is rightly proud that this is both public

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and private partner. This is grassroots and institutional libraries

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and patrons from all different -- I'm immensely honored

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
to be here and I think that we can do some the tremendous.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Is going to be a supershort lightning talk.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
This is one of those simple ideas that four different

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
groups came to from different angles at the same time

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and we said, you know, let's do it. Better yet,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
not only is it a civil idea but it's easy to -- easily

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
distribute a bull amongst the ball.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And it's simply to upgrade the analog citation to make

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
people to get into rich understanding of the knowledge we have today.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
We talked about what to do with physical collections and digitization,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
but most work tomorrow is going to be digital. It's going to be self published.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And Wikipedia is an example of what you can get out of

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that kind of teaming, thriving, living environment.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
You need to know what is a reliable source that is hard to.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Any editor on Wikipedia with a source in his pocket as a godlike power and think are the most people don't know it.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
So unfortunately,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
there are any good canonical ways to find out whether a

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
source is reliable in a given context

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
or even how reliable it is in general

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
or to collect the comment about a source

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and to kind of cluster them by where they're using very as topics.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So our proposal is to develop a wiki for Kurt -- for crowd sourcing discussions

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and citations in general in their contexts -- sorry about that --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and our model is to build a central wiki that draws from

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
her post stories, links back -- repositories.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Links back -- I am not a Mac user, can you tell?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Yes, please. [Laughter]

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And then, implements an API that allows anyone who has their own

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
private or sort of specialized uses of citation information to

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
develop their own team wiki that might include private

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
data that they can't share with everyone.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And that allows them to push back any updates

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
or new information that they have to share with the world.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
We have all this in more detail.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I know this is a very small on his poster outside,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and we would love to take comments and suggestions from people.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
There are a bunch of matchups that have already been made.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We came up with this idea a couple years ago but really

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
got into it this past spring,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and throughout a call for people to suggest matchups.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Using social is you to capture oral histories that are.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Right now it's hard to generate permanent citations for oral histories.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Is being used to Cory available citation data to show you

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
everything in a field that you have used elsewhere within a group.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
On Wikipedia,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
people are going to use it to cache webpages

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and figure out which pages should be cached,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
because there is a tremendous amount of link rot online,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and what to have figured out how people visualize that,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
you can automatically cache them as used in what you

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
The audience and people who benefit from it are often editors

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and readers as well as general researchers,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
people who want to resolve citations for particular quotes,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and they don't quote they're not sure what comes from, they could pick

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and arbitrate I can they could like to send to have it resolved through the cloud of existing citations.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And for librarians

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and people who curtly have access to data,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
we would love to talk to people who do their own citation analysis.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
We are doing a couple of citation analyses to figure out how people use different classes of sources.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And how people respond to what are negative quality

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
references and what they do with them. Thank you very much.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
[Applause]

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
All right. Questions

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
or comments for any of the lightning round sprinters?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I see somebody has a mic. Yes?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I have a question for the MINT.  I like your idea.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
-- Bookworm team.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Do you see if it has any application beyond the academic

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
world?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Yeah,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I actually think one of the things that we learned from

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Google engrams is these visualizations are things that do

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
have a really broad range of appeal.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So when engrams it came out,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
there were something like 1 million queries in the first

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
24 hours. The majority of those were outside of academia,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
places like journalism to be sure,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
but it is something that beyond just academics,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
it's a very compelling way I think,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
for a lot of people to think about problems as having

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
historical patterns that can be solved.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
I don't think it solves all search problems obviously,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
but it's good for more people than I expected.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
As we pass the mic, one conception of the DPLA,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and we'll hear more about this with the work streams of

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
them is we could imagine developing a series of services, open services,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
where people develop things that are for specialized

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
audiences, which are not exclusive, right?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
I think the concept we've been talking about of interoperability

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and open APIs is to say we need lots of people to focus on different use cases

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000
and different kinds of communities and Bookworm may or may not be limited to one.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Does a great lot of post does a great blog post last

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
night by Dan, who responds to Bookworm ,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
there's a lot of conversation for whom these services will best apply.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Other comments on the lightning round?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
I did not expect the silence after the screw.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
I'm going to use the moderators prerogative to comment.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Richard Irvin,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
do you mind being called called in the audience?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
You're an expert on linked open data among many other

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
things and this has been thrown around in a figure,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
this is a mixed crowds of people may intuitively know why

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
a link to open data is important

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
and one thing people seem to know, it is a given

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and I wouldn't mind being given on why it is important in your view.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Thank you. I was getting called called on this, wasn't I.?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
In one way, there is a lot of buzz around link data

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
and output it as part of a continuum and for many years,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
it was a different way of expressing descriptions we have been doing before,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
structures that appear as catalog records

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and it is the same kind of metadata we have been doing in

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
the community for a long time.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Part of the changes being able to try to identify

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
and name those things in ways that were reliable.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
And finding simpler ways that don't mean that you have to

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
have a very sacked record structure by finding much more

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
creative ways to express the will to say about these resources

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:13.000
and be able to relate them in ways that let them travel into things like the ShelfLife

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
and ExtraMUROS project to start building things between people and libraries

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
and the ideas people have about collections and objects. Since that is obvious.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Civic in the course of the next 18 months,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000
what it means to have a good working people have ideas,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
many of us take it as received wisdom that is a very

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
important conceptual -- that we heard across otherwise.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Soon there are some differences in how linked data in the

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
cataloging we have done before

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
and I -- will come back to it.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000
We can go to a break early and because I cold call,

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000
anybody from the Sprint data review team that wants to comment on Bradley,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
you have volunteered more than what were bargaining for

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000
an end to make this space available.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:26.000
One alternate question.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
I guess if I asked how many of you have edited Wikipedia

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
before, you would raise your hands.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Can we ask?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000
And everyone raises their hand because you have done Google search

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.000
and they go to Wikipedia as a consumer of information we are not sure about the veracity

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
and how can we help Wikipedia and one thing is,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
working through a book scanning project and work,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
we can hover over a sentence and Wikipedia

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.000
and contextualize that automatically by searching through

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
the text and books that would go over to the site

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
and Wikipedia's, it has to be neutral

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
and has a neutral point of view

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
and how are you supposed to have a natural exposition of

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
a topic if you don't understand the scope

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
or how the citations fit into the literature more

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
probably so one of the things the wiki site is supposed

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000
to help editors of Wikipedia do is figure out how to do

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
the initial exposition and as a consumer,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
you can go there and actually verify that is true,

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
you can go to SI

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000
and develop your own interpretation of the authority

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
and reliability of the source I just want to express that

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
because a lot of people use it

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
and the two PLA has a lot of professional potential for helping in that space.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Soon as he that is reciprocal

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
and it is no secret that we are surprised that both of

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000
these projects are being funded at the highest level so I

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
have two tiny closing comments

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
and one is that the data Sprint review panel had the same

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
experience that many of us did in looking at the 39

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
amazing submissions and to be clear,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
there is no reward for these people other than an

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
obligation to sit on the stage in common talk,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
they promised to give all of the electro-property to the

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000
DPLA and there is no  monetary reward of any sort,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000
this is an extraordinary outpouring of volunteerism that

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
those well for America and the world of this project.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
I want to thank everybody who submitted a data Sprint

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000
and we could have gone on for hours and hours of please join me in thanking the entire Beta Sprint team.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
[Applause]

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
I hope very much a result of the data Sprint will be

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
rolled into a DPLA

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
and these projects will also extend on their own in many respects,

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:01.000
because CDs are independent efforts was very passionate

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
wonderful people behind them in one such project that the

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
review panel identified in her notes,

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
there are two pages, a public domain registry project

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
and this is one they flagged as an important

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000
and interesting one and her partner,

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Charles from Harvard is working on

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000
and is totally relevant

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
and interesting annulus collaborators

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
and was not chosen for this presentation but there are

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
lots of things like that that are worth reviewing in looking at.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000
And since this is my last time with a microphone today,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000
I wanted to make one dangerous thing of thinking one person in particular,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
there is a amazing human interoperability thing going on

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
