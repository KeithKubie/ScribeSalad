00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.495
This would be an example of a

00:00:01.495 --> 00:00:06.130
gain-of-function mutation because the hemoglobin-beta, or the

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.310
HBB protein, normally interacts with the other

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.830
HBB proteins. In this case, it's interacting

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.900
with them even more so. It's binding to them even more tightly, so that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.680
it forms these elongated stretches, which then

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.050
misshapes the cell. It's therefore gained a function.
