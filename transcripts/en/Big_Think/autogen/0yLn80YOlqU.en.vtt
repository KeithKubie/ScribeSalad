him off the airwaves and forcing

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:09.370
him off the airwaves and forcing
 

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.310
him off the airwaves and forcing
al-qaeda to deal for the first time in

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:11.320
al-qaeda to deal for the first time in
 

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:12.980

20 years with the succession crisis
 

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:14.790
20 years with the succession crisis
probably from the point of view of

probably from the point of view of
 

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.560
probably from the point of view of
al-qaeda's adversaries would be a good

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:16.570
al-qaeda's adversaries would be a good
 

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:18.990
al-qaeda's adversaries would be a good
objective so I think there are lots of

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000
objective so I think there are lots of
 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.790
objective so I think there are lots of
reasons why the hunt for him still

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800

can really do is look at what the system

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:32.890
can really do is look at what the system

see in retrospect is that he didn't have
the capability to do anything other than

00:09:59.850 --> 00:09:59.860
the capability to do anything other than
 

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:02.760
the capability to do anything other than
a media event but he appeared like an

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:02.770
a media event but he appeared like an
 

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:04.980
a media event but he appeared like an

the American people John Kerry still

00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:09.160
the American people John Kerry still
 

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.530
the American people John Kerry still

believes to this day it was a factor in
his defeat in a close election so at a

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:12.580
his defeat in a close election so at a
 

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:15.150
his defeat in a close election so at a
minimum I expect them to attempt media

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:15.160
minimum I expect them to attempt media
 

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:18.150
minimum I expect them to attempt media
events but if they have capability

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160
events but if they have capability
 

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.329
events but if they have capability
they'll probably use it during the fall

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:21.339
they'll probably use it during the fall
 

00:10:21.339 --> 00:10:23.850
they'll probably use it during the fall
season yeah
