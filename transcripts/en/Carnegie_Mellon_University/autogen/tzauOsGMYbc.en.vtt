visions and then the technology happens

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360
visions and then the technology happens
 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.180
visions and then the technology happens
and I think what I love about this

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190
and I think what I love about this
 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.790

project in La in general is it's not
 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.100
project in La in general is it's not
just about the technology you know

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110
just about the technology you know
 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.630
just about the technology you know
technology is kind of a dime a dozen

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640
technology is kind of a dime a dozen
 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.630
technology is kind of a dime a dozen
sometimes but it's what you do with the

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640
sometimes but it's what you do with the
 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.580
sometimes but it's what you do with the
technology it's how technology impacts

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590
technology it's how technology impacts
 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.490
technology it's how technology impacts
people it's how it spreads you know how

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500
people it's how it spreads you know how
 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.770
people it's how it spreads you know how
it how it changes people's lives how it

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780

and things like that that was that was
 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.790
and things like that that was that was
the hook you know technology was was a

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800
the hook you know technology was was a
 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.490
the hook you know technology was was a
part of it and an important part of it

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500
part of it and an important part of it
 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.960

units and computers have gotten a lot
 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.140
units and computers have gotten a lot
faster and they have you know you know

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150
faster and they have you know you know
 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.930
faster and they have you know you know
roughly 3,000 times faster or something

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940
roughly 3,000 times faster or something
 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.670
roughly 3,000 times faster or something
like that which sounds a lot i mean

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680
like that which sounds a lot i mean
 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.700
like that which sounds a lot i mean
three thousand times faster is great but

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710
three thousand times faster is great but
 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.270
three thousand times faster is great but
that's pales in comparison to other

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280

have gotten four million times cheaper

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370
have gotten four million times cheaper
 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.060
have gotten four million times cheaper
per byte which is incredible

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070
per byte which is incredible
 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.580
per byte which is incredible
I mean it's just amazing 4 million times

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:07.590
I mean it's just amazing 4 million times
 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:11.360
I mean it's just amazing 4 million times
better in 25 or 30 years and that's that

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370
better in 25 or 30 years and that's that
 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.760
better in 25 or 30 years and that's that
that's that's amazing networks have

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770
that's that's amazing networks have
 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.650
that's that's amazing networks have
gotten incredibly faster I mean there

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660
gotten incredibly faster I mean there
 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.600
gotten incredibly faster I mean there
was no such thing as a network you know

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610
was no such thing as a network you know
 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.280
was no such thing as a network you know
I remember the first network when I went

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290
I remember the first network when I went
 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.280

you know and then i watch that message

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970
you know and then i watch that message
 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.490
you know and then i watch that message
to go to this other computer and i

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:46.500
to go to this other computer and i
 

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.990
to go to this other computer and i
wanted to go to another computer and

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000
wanted to go to another computer and
 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.090
wanted to go to another computer and
then I want it to get and you'd have to

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100
then I want it to get and you'd have to
 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.320
then I want it to get and you'd have to
figure out the route of all your

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330
figure out the route of all your
 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.960
figure out the route of all your
messages and that was just a relatively

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:53.970
messages and that was just a relatively
 

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:56.780
messages and that was just a relatively
short time ago and now you know

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:56.790
short time ago and now you know
 

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:58.730
short time ago and now you know
international communication is pretty

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:58.740

googles mission is pretty simple it's to
 

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:46.910
googles mission is pretty simple it's to
organize the world's information and

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:46.920
organize the world's information and
 

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.650
organize the world's information and
make it universally accessible and

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:48.660
make it universally accessible and
 

00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:54.170
make it universally accessible and
useful we break that apart organized so

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:54.180
useful we break that apart organized so
 

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:57.230
useful we break that apart organized so

data isn't actually very valuable you
 

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.380
data isn't actually very valuable you
know you can store it on disk and stuff

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:03.390
know you can store it on disk and stuff
 

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.360
know you can store it on disk and stuff
but once you organize it you get

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:05.370
but once you organize it you get
 

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.790
but once you organize it you get
information but that's not enough you

information but that's not enough you
 

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.030
information but that's not enough you
have to make information accessible and

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040
have to make information accessible and
 

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.290
have to make information accessible and
then you have to make it useful on a

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300
then you have to make it useful on a
 

00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.600
then you have to make it useful on a
global scale and you'll see how that

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:14.610
global scale and you'll see how that
 

00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:16.910

computers and the storage and stuff a
 

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.740
computers and the storage and stuff a
lot better but it will allow people to

00:13:57.740 --> 00:13:57.750
lot better but it will allow people to
 

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:02.270
lot better but it will allow people to
generate much more complex data and that

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:02.280
generate much more complex data and that
 

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.030
generate much more complex data and that
data has to go somewhere so in the

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040
data has to go somewhere so in the
 

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.430

imagery case it's very obvious that you

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.480
can now build images there is 0 a size
and complexity that has never ever been

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:13.490

know let's say heart and then condition
 

00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:41.000
know let's say heart and then condition
so next to heart that that occurs on

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.010
so next to heart that that occurs on
 

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.690
so next to heart that that occurs on
pages 12 and 17 and 12 and condition

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:44.700
pages 12 and 17 and 12 and condition
 

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:49.210
pages 12 and 17 and 12 and condition
occurs on 12 35 and 40 and that index

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:49.220
occurs on 12 35 and 40 and that index
 

00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:51.500
occurs on 12 35 and 40 and that index
allows you to go through and find out

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:51.510
allows you to go through and find out
 

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:53.060
allows you to go through and find out
where heart and condition happened the

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:53.070
where heart and condition happened the
 

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:55.970
where heart and condition happened the
same time and when you do that through

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980
same time and when you do that through
 

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.760
same time and when you do that through
all the billions of web pages and rank

00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:58.770
all the billions of web pages and rank
 

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.650
all the billions of web pages and rank
them you'll find all the pages in the

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:00.660
them you'll find all the pages in the
 

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.870
them you'll find all the pages in the
entire world that have that in it and

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880
entire world that have that in it and
 

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:05.060
entire world that have that in it and
that's how the search engine works but

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.070
that's how the search engine works but
 

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:06.680
that's how the search engine works but
the interesting part about it is when

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:06.690
the interesting part about it is when
 

00:16:06.690 --> 00:16:10.820
the interesting part about it is when
you type a search thousands of machines

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:10.830
you type a search thousands of machines
 

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.580
you type a search thousands of machines
are working on your behalf

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:12.590

mean if I shrunken all the data down to

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:18.300
mean if I shrunken all the data down to
 

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:19.730
mean if I shrunken all the data down to
this which probably don't what happened

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740
this which probably don't what happened
 

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:20.900
this which probably don't what happened
now but it'll probably happen in the

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:20.910
now but it'll probably happen in the
 

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:23.210
now but it'll probably happen in the
next five years but the computational

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:23.220
next five years but the computational
 

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:25.520
next five years but the computational
power would still take you know I don't

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:25.530
power would still take you know I don't
 

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:28.310
power would still take you know I don't
know maybe three months to get that

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320
know maybe three months to get that
 

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.440
know maybe three months to get that
solution there and that's not quite fast

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:30.450
solution there and that's not quite fast
 

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.150
solution there and that's not quite fast
enough we found that latency is an

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160
enough we found that latency is an
 

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:35.540
enough we found that latency is an
important thing and so so it's it's

00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:35.550
important thing and so so it's it's
 

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.040
important thing and so so it's it's
interesting the way that the world has

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:37.050
interesting the way that the world has
 

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:42.350
interesting the way that the world has
changed you need computational power the

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:42.360
changed you need computational power the
 

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.990
changed you need computational power the
that's really the basis for what we're

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:45.000
that's really the basis for what we're
 

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.300
that's really the basis for what we're
calling the cloud now which is the

place I mean right now we've got to the
 

00:16:59.550 --> 00:17:00.740
place I mean right now we've got to the
point where you put a piece of

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:00.750
point where you put a piece of
 

00:17:00.750 --> 00:17:03.550
point where you put a piece of
information there and you can access it

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560
information there and you can access it
 

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.170
information there and you can access it
access that information from the phone

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:06.180
access that information from the phone
 

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:08.780
access that information from the phone
from a desktop computer now with google

it was the web when you went to a search

00:17:36.149 --> 00:17:36.159
it was the web when you went to a search
 

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:38.249
it was the web when you went to a search
engine you type something it was the web

was all you got and web was big and it's

00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:40.779
was all you got and web was big and it's
 

00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:42.629
was all you got and web was big and it's
obviously big you know at the time it

00:17:42.629 --> 00:17:42.639
obviously big you know at the time it
 

00:17:42.639 --> 00:17:44.639
obviously big you know at the time it
was a couple billion in a couple billion

was a couple billion in a couple billion
 

00:17:44.649 --> 00:17:47.099
was a couple billion in a couple billion
things but still it was just a couple

00:17:47.099 --> 00:17:47.109
things but still it was just a couple
 

00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:49.830
things but still it was just a couple
billion and now in the last nine years

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840

behind the back behind the curtains you
 

00:17:52.749 --> 00:17:55.710
behind the back behind the curtains you
know you now have the web you have

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:55.720
know you now have the web you have
 

00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:00.509
know you now have the web you have
images you have videos you have news you

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:00.519
images you have videos you have news you
 

00:18:00.519 --> 00:18:02.669
images you have videos you have news you
have email you have scholarly content so

00:18:02.669 --> 00:18:02.679
have email you have scholarly content so
 

00:18:02.679 --> 00:18:04.470
have email you have scholarly content so
all the scholarly content is migrating

00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480
all the scholarly content is migrating
 

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.629
all the scholarly content is migrating
on there so all that's accessible to you

00:18:06.629 --> 00:18:06.639
on there so all that's accessible to you
 

00:18:06.639 --> 00:18:09.539
on there so all that's accessible to you
now you know there's magazines there's

00:18:09.539 --> 00:18:09.549
now you know there's magazines there's
 

00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:13.560
now you know there's magazines there's
you know streets street view books you

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:13.570
you know streets street view books you
 

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.299
you know streets street view books you
know if we're going to organize all the

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:15.309
know if we're going to organize all the
 

00:18:15.309 --> 00:18:16.859
know if we're going to organize all the
world's information we can't leave out

00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:16.869
world's information we can't leave out
 

00:18:16.869 --> 00:18:19.289
world's information we can't leave out
something important like books you know

00:18:19.289 --> 00:18:19.299
something important like books you know
 

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:21.389
something important like books you know
books are kind of the thing that all

00:18:21.389 --> 00:18:21.399
books are kind of the thing that all
 

00:18:21.399 --> 00:18:24.210
books are kind of the thing that all
information has over the over eternity I

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:24.220
information has over the over eternity I
 

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:26.099
information has over the over eternity I
mean it's the storehouse of the world's

00:18:26.099 --> 00:18:26.109
mean it's the storehouse of the world's
 

00:18:26.109 --> 00:18:28.590
mean it's the storehouse of the world's
knowledge and has been for years and so

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:28.600
knowledge and has been for years and so
 

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:31.379
knowledge and has been for years and so
one of the implications of our mission

00:18:31.379 --> 00:18:31.389
one of the implications of our mission
 

00:18:31.389 --> 00:18:33.810
one of the implications of our mission
is to scan all the world's books and to

00:18:33.810 --> 00:18:33.820
is to scan all the world's books and to
 

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.269
is to scan all the world's books and to
try to put them in a in a place where

00:18:36.269 --> 00:18:36.279
try to put them in a in a place where
 

00:18:36.279 --> 00:18:39.629
try to put them in a in a place where
you can actually access them let me just

00:18:39.629 --> 00:18:39.639
you can actually access them let me just
 

00:18:39.639 --> 00:18:41.340
you can actually access them let me just
talk about one element and that's the

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:41.350
talk about one element and that's the
 

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.899
talk about one element and that's the
whole maps and satellite because i think

00:18:42.899 --> 00:18:42.909
whole maps and satellite because i think
 

00:18:42.909 --> 00:18:48.210
whole maps and satellite because i think
it's it's it it kind of puts the thing

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:48.220
it's it's it it kind of puts the thing
 

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.669
it's it's it it kind of puts the thing
in perspective nine years ago the web

00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679
in perspective nine years ago the web
 

00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:53.879
in perspective nine years ago the web
was not geo-located in any way so we had

00:18:53.879 --> 00:18:53.889
was not geo-located in any way so we had
 

00:18:53.889 --> 00:18:56.369
was not geo-located in any way so we had
two billion pages but they they weren't

00:18:56.369 --> 00:18:56.379
two billion pages but they they weren't
 

00:18:56.379 --> 00:18:59.190
two billion pages but they they weren't
anywhere right they weren't located as

00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200
anywhere right they weren't located as
 

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:02.580
anywhere right they weren't located as
on a point in space and you know as a

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:02.590
on a point in space and you know as a
 

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.399
on a point in space and you know as a
result they were less valuable and we

00:19:05.399 --> 00:19:05.409
result they were less valuable and we
 

00:19:05.409 --> 00:19:07.139
result they were less valuable and we
bought a little company called keyhole

00:19:07.139 --> 00:19:07.149
bought a little company called keyhole
 

00:19:07.149 --> 00:19:10.710
bought a little company called keyhole
and another small company that did maps

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720
and another small company that did maps
 

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.989
and another small company that did maps
and that brought us to really

00:19:12.989 --> 00:19:12.999
and that brought us to really
 

00:19:12.999 --> 00:19:14.729
and that brought us to really
interesting elements when is it brought

00:19:14.729 --> 00:19:14.739
interesting elements when is it brought
 

00:19:14.739 --> 00:19:17.909
interesting elements when is it brought
us maps that were explorable it was a

00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919
us maps that were explorable it was a
 

00:19:17.919 --> 00:19:20.940
us maps that were explorable it was a
met before a map was just a map and that

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:20.950
met before a map was just a map and that
 

00:19:20.950 --> 00:19:22.980
met before a map was just a map and that
but the idea that you could dive into a

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:22.990
but the idea that you could dive into a
 

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.070
but the idea that you could dive into a
map and you could slide it right

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080
map and you could slide it right
 

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:28.850
map and you could slide it right
left was new you know Bria knew no one

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:28.860
left was new you know Bria knew no one
 

00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:31.430
left was new you know Bria knew no one
had ever done slidable maps that you

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440
had ever done slidable maps that you
 

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.740
had ever done slidable maps that you
could move around and and so that was a

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:33.750
could move around and and so that was a
 

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:36.260
could move around and and so that was a
that was it was a start but then we

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:36.270
that was it was a start but then we
 

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:38.540
that was it was a start but then we
bought keyhole and we got satellite

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:38.550
bought keyhole and we got satellite
 

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:41.420
bought keyhole and we got satellite
imagery for the whole globe you know now

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:41.430
imagery for the whole globe you know now
 

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:42.920
imagery for the whole globe you know now
the satellite imagery it's something

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:42.930
the satellite imagery it's something
 

00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.010
the satellite imagery it's something
that you could do at you know I mean if

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:46.020
that you could do at you know I mean if
 

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.390
that you could do at you know I mean if
you were in a government maybe you had

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400
you were in a government maybe you had
 

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.280
you were in a government maybe you had
access to satellite imagery but nobody

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:49.290
access to satellite imagery but nobody
 

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:52.430
access to satellite imagery but nobody
else did and now when you take maps and

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:52.440
else did and now when you take maps and
 

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.380
else did and now when you take maps and
you overlay satellite imagery and then

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:54.390
you overlay satellite imagery and then
 

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.880
you overlay satellite imagery and then
you take all the web pages in the world

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:55.890
you take all the web pages in the world
 

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:58.430
you take all the web pages in the world
and you put them you know like push pins

00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440
and you put them you know like push pins
 

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.160
and you put them you know like push pins
on to the math now you have information

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:01.170
on to the math now you have information
 

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:03.770
on to the math now you have information
that you've never seen before and now

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:03.780
that you've never seen before and now
 

00:20:03.780 --> 00:20:06.020
that you've never seen before and now
people can take that information and put

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:06.030
people can take that information and put
 

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.510
people can take that information and put
create mashups place their information

00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520
create mashups place their information
 

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:12.170
create mashups place their information
on those maps just as well and then you

00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:12.180
on those maps just as well and then you
 

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.060
on those maps just as well and then you
would from there you have to ask well

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:14.070
would from there you have to ask well
 

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.740
would from there you have to ask well
what other things do you need to know

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:15.750
what other things do you need to know
 

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.960
what other things do you need to know
and that's what caused street view so

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:17.970
and that's what caused street view so
 

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.700
and that's what caused street view so
Street View said you know I'd really

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:19.710
Street View said you know I'd really
 

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.510
Street View said you know I'd really
like to know the information that is in

00:20:22.510 --> 00:20:22.520
like to know the information that is in
 

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.100
like to know the information that is in
you know the when i drive down the

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:25.110
you know the when i drive down the
 

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.810
you know the when i drive down the
street I get a totally different picture

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:26.820
street I get a totally different picture
 

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:29.210
street I get a totally different picture
of what something is then if I just look

00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:29.220
of what something is then if I just look
 

00:20:29.220 --> 00:20:31.970
of what something is then if I just look
at it from the map or satellite and so

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:31.980
at it from the map or satellite and so
 

00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.190
at it from the map or satellite and so
Street View was an attempt to say that's

00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200
Street View was an attempt to say that's
 

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.770
Street View was an attempt to say that's
really valuable information let's take

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780
really valuable information let's take
 

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.320
really valuable information let's take
all of that and let's overlay it and so

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:39.330
all of that and let's overlay it and so
 

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.390
all of that and let's overlay it and so
now I have web and I have maps and I

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400
now I have web and I have maps and I
 

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.550
now I have web and I have maps and I
have all these things all over late so

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:43.560
have all these things all over late so
 

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.960
have all these things all over late so
now there's piece of information that I

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:44.970
now there's piece of information that I
 

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:46.550
now there's piece of information that I
would never be able to get in any other

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:46.560
would never be able to get in any other
 

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.190
would never be able to get in any other
way and that information is now

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200
way and that information is now
 

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.960
way and that information is now
tremendously more valuable than it ever

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:50.970
tremendously more valuable than it ever
 

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.120
tremendously more valuable than it ever
was before and it's led to other things

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:53.130
was before and it's led to other things
 

00:20:53.130 --> 00:20:55.580
was before and it's led to other things
like you know what do you do input cases

00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:55.590
like you know what do you do input cases
 

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:59.030
like you know what do you do input cases
where there are no max you know if there

00:20:59.030 --> 00:20:59.040
where there are no max you know if there
 

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.130
where there are no max you know if there
are no maps in the world you know in

00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:01.140
are no maps in the world you know in
 

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:02.780
are no maps in the world you know in
many parts of the world how do you

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:02.790
many parts of the world how do you
 

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:06.080
many parts of the world how do you
create them well it turns out that the

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:06.090
create them well it turns out that the
 

00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:09.560
create them well it turns out that the
same method that it was used by of

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:09.570
same method that it was used by of
 

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.840
same method that it was used by of
user-generated content in other places

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:11.850
user-generated content in other places
 

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:14.540
user-generated content in other places
can apply to maps so what we did was we

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:14.550
can apply to maps so what we did was we
 

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.400
can apply to maps so what we did was we
created this thing called map maker and

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:16.410
created this thing called map maker and
 

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:18.950
created this thing called map maker and
Matt maker basically somebody lays out

00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960
Matt maker basically somebody lays out
 

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.930
Matt maker basically somebody lays out
the satellite imagery which we give them

00:21:20.930 --> 00:21:20.940
the satellite imagery which we give them
 

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:24.170
the satellite imagery which we give them
and they start drawing roads you know

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:24.180
and they start drawing roads you know
 

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.760
and they start drawing roads you know
they start drawing roads they start

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:25.770
they start drawing roads they start
 

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.770
they start drawing roads they start
laying in parts they start naming things

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780
laying in parts they start naming things
 

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.020
laying in parts they start naming things
and things like that and so for all

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:30.030
and things like that and so for all
 

00:21:30.030 --> 00:21:32.630
and things like that and so for all
these places we launched this tool which

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640
these places we launched this tool which
 

00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:34.700
these places we launched this tool which
is really fun and interesting tool and

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:34.710
is really fun and interesting tool and
 

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.410
is really fun and interesting tool and
then we have this creep they have this

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:36.420
then we have this creep they have this
 

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.570
then we have this creep they have this
great picture where they take the you

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:38.580
great picture where they take the you
 

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.379
great picture where they take the you
know the earth

00:21:39.379 --> 00:21:39.389
know the earth
 

00:21:39.389 --> 00:21:42.259
know the earth
imagery and they start populating with

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:42.269
imagery and they start populating with
 

00:21:42.269 --> 00:21:44.539
imagery and they start populating with
the maps that get submitted by everybody

00:21:44.539 --> 00:21:44.549
the maps that get submitted by everybody
 

00:21:44.549 --> 00:21:46.519
the maps that get submitted by everybody
else in the world and all of a sudden

00:21:46.519 --> 00:21:46.529
else in the world and all of a sudden
 

00:21:46.529 --> 00:21:48.560
else in the world and all of a sudden
little areas that were dark in the world

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:48.570
little areas that were dark in the world
 

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.049
little areas that were dark in the world
now light up with a map you know and

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:51.059
now light up with a map you know and
 

00:21:51.059 --> 00:21:53.419
now light up with a map you know and
qingyang the maps they're being used in

00:21:53.419 --> 00:21:53.429
qingyang the maps they're being used in
 

00:21:53.429 --> 00:21:56.209
qingyang the maps they're being used in
Haiti for the relief efforts were almost

00:21:56.209 --> 00:21:56.219
Haiti for the relief efforts were almost
 

00:21:56.219 --> 00:21:58.999
Haiti for the relief efforts were almost
all generated by people and map maker

00:21:58.999 --> 00:21:59.009
all generated by people and map maker
 

00:21:59.009 --> 00:22:01.489
all generated by people and map maker
and then they were used in a disaster

00:22:01.489 --> 00:22:01.499
and then they were used in a disaster
 

00:22:01.499 --> 00:22:04.579
and then they were used in a disaster
situation you know but but the maps were

00:22:04.579 --> 00:22:04.589
situation you know but but the maps were
 

00:22:04.589 --> 00:22:07.219
situation you know but but the maps were
created by people people are the ones

00:22:07.219 --> 00:22:07.229
created by people people are the ones
 

00:22:07.229 --> 00:22:08.690
created by people people are the ones
that are creating the interesting

00:22:08.690 --> 00:22:08.700
that are creating the interesting
 

00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:11.089
that are creating the interesting
content right now and I think that's a

00:22:11.089 --> 00:22:11.099
content right now and I think that's a
 

00:22:11.099 --> 00:22:15.949
content right now and I think that's a
huge change youtube you know the story

00:22:15.949 --> 00:22:15.959
huge change youtube you know the story
 

00:22:15.959 --> 00:22:18.019
huge change youtube you know the story
of you know we acquired youtube but the

00:22:18.019 --> 00:22:18.029
of you know we acquired youtube but the
 

00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:21.589
of you know we acquired youtube but the
backstory of youtube was that we had a

00:22:21.589 --> 00:22:21.599
backstory of youtube was that we had a
 

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:24.319
backstory of youtube was that we had a
product called Google video I was almost

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:24.329
product called Google video I was almost
 

00:22:24.329 --> 00:22:26.209
product called Google video I was almost
identical to YouTube in every way shape

00:22:26.209 --> 00:22:26.219
identical to YouTube in every way shape
 

00:22:26.219 --> 00:22:28.669
identical to YouTube in every way shape
or form you know it would play videos

00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679
or form you know it would play videos
 

00:22:28.679 --> 00:22:30.589
or form you know it would play videos
you know you click on it the video would

00:22:30.589 --> 00:22:30.599
you know you click on it the video would
 

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:33.259
you know you click on it the video would
play all that stuff was fine but YouTube

00:22:33.259 --> 00:22:33.269
play all that stuff was fine but YouTube
 

00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:36.589
play all that stuff was fine but YouTube
was going like this and Google video was

00:22:36.589 --> 00:22:36.599
was going like this and Google video was
 

00:22:36.599 --> 00:22:41.089
was going like this and Google video was
going like this why you know when we're

00:22:41.089 --> 00:22:41.099
going like this why you know when we're
 

00:22:41.099 --> 00:22:42.979
going like this why you know when we're
scratching our heads why is this big

00:22:42.979 --> 00:22:42.989
scratching our heads why is this big
 

00:22:42.989 --> 00:22:45.769
scratching our heads why is this big
difference and by the time we had

00:22:45.769 --> 00:22:45.779
difference and by the time we had
 

00:22:45.779 --> 00:22:48.829
difference and by the time we had
figured it out it was too late and the

00:22:48.829 --> 00:22:48.839
figured it out it was too late and the
 

00:22:48.839 --> 00:22:51.279
figured it out it was too late and the
difference was user-generated content

00:22:51.279 --> 00:22:51.289
difference was user-generated content
 

00:22:51.289 --> 00:22:55.729
difference was user-generated content
they made it easy to upload videos we

00:22:55.729 --> 00:22:55.739
they made it easy to upload videos we
 

00:22:55.739 --> 00:22:58.190
they made it easy to upload videos we
were indexing videos and doing a

00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200
were indexing videos and doing a
 

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.279
were indexing videos and doing a
fantastic job of it they were enabling

00:23:01.279 --> 00:23:01.289
fantastic job of it they were enabling
 

00:23:01.289 --> 00:23:04.699
fantastic job of it they were enabling
people to create videos the fundamental

00:23:04.699 --> 00:23:04.709
people to create videos the fundamental
 

00:23:04.709 --> 00:23:06.799
people to create videos the fundamental
difference and we were so far behind at

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:06.809
difference and we were so far behind at
 

00:23:06.809 --> 00:23:09.259
difference and we were so far behind at
that point we had to buy a company which

00:23:09.259 --> 00:23:09.269
that point we had to buy a company which
 

00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:12.319
that point we had to buy a company which
was very expensive to basically catch up

00:23:12.319 --> 00:23:12.329
was very expensive to basically catch up
 

00:23:12.329 --> 00:23:16.180
was very expensive to basically catch up
because we missed a huge and important

00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:16.190
because we missed a huge and important
 

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:17.959
because we missed a huge and important
transition in the world which is

00:23:17.959 --> 00:23:17.969
transition in the world which is
 

00:23:17.969 --> 00:23:20.089
transition in the world which is
user-generated content was going to be

00:23:20.089 --> 00:23:20.099
user-generated content was going to be
 

00:23:20.099 --> 00:23:24.799
user-generated content was going to be
more important than just indexing and I

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:24.809
more important than just indexing and I
 

00:23:24.809 --> 00:23:26.779
more important than just indexing and I
think that that that changed our whole

00:23:26.779 --> 00:23:26.789
think that that that changed our whole
 

00:23:26.789 --> 00:23:29.810
think that that that changed our whole
mindset of the company and I think it's

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:29.820
mindset of the company and I think it's
 

00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:32.180
mindset of the company and I think it's
been really really important you know

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:32.190
been really really important you know
 

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.639
been really really important you know
one thing that we didn't miss thankfully

00:23:34.639 --> 00:23:34.649
one thing that we didn't miss thankfully
 

00:23:34.649 --> 00:23:37.940
one thing that we didn't miss thankfully
was mobile and the importance of mobile

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:37.950
was mobile and the importance of mobile
 

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:43.269
was mobile and the importance of mobile
and if you look back five years ago a

00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279
and if you look back five years ago a
 

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:46.279
and if you look back five years ago a
mobile phone was a mobile phone it was a

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:46.289
mobile phone was a mobile phone it was a
 

00:23:46.289 --> 00:23:49.430
mobile phone was a mobile phone it was a
phone that's all it did and it's kind of

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440
phone that's all it did and it's kind of
 

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.859
phone that's all it did and it's kind of
amazing to think about the transition

00:23:51.859 --> 00:23:51.869
amazing to think about the transition
 

00:23:51.869 --> 00:23:53.290
amazing to think about the transition
that's happened in phones

00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:53.300
that's happened in phones
 

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.360
that's happened in phones
magically behind our back that we don't

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:56.370
magically behind our back that we don't
 

00:23:56.370 --> 00:24:01.100
magically behind our back that we don't
even think about I mean a phone now has

00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.110
even think about I mean a phone now has
 

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.040
even think about I mean a phone now has

something that I can't do sometimes

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:36.120
something that I can't do sometimes

you know so you can do things like the

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360
you know so you can do things like the
 

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.530
you know so you can do things like the
sky map which is actually a really nice

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:48.540
sky map which is actually a really nice
 

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:51.110

which is it wasn't on your list which is

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:54.810
which is it wasn't on your list which is
 

00:24:54.810 --> 00:24:56.810
which is it wasn't on your list which is
you can load the star map of the world

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:56.820
you can load the star map of the world
 

00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:58.940
you can load the star map of the world
and you can you can look like this and

00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:58.950
and you can you can look like this and
 

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.800
and you can you can look like this and
as you rotate the stars change behind

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:00.810
as you rotate the stars change behind
 

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:03.200
as you rotate the stars change behind
you you know and you can tell what

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:03.210
you you know and you can tell what
 

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.910
you you know and you can tell what
galaxies are out there and things like

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:04.920
galaxies are out there and things like
 

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.680
galaxies are out there and things like
that just by going across if there's

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:06.690
that just by going across if there's
 

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:08.270
that just by going across if there's
some interesting thing you can poke at

00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280
some interesting thing you can poke at
 

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.280
some interesting thing you can poke at
and you can learn more about it but it's

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:10.290
and you can learn more about it but it's
 

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:12.110
and you can learn more about it but it's
all because of the technology here it

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120
all because of the technology here it
 

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.560
all because of the technology here it
knows if it's moving it's got

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:14.570
knows if it's moving it's got
 

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:16.640
knows if it's moving it's got
accelerometers in it so it'll get it

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:16.650
accelerometers in it so it'll get it
 

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.650
accelerometers in it so it'll get it
knows when it's moving so this device

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:18.660
knows when it's moving so this device
 

00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:22.460
knows when it's moving so this device
now has become an input device for

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:22.470
now has become an input device for
 

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.460
now has become an input device for
learning lots about things it's also the

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:25.470
learning lots about things it's also the
 

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.490
learning lots about things it's also the
focus for a big technology shift that I

00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500
focus for a big technology shift that I
 

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.800
focus for a big technology shift that I
think the cloud has given us the ability

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:30.810
think the cloud has given us the ability
 

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:36.520
think the cloud has given us the ability
to do which is take information here

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:36.530
to do which is take information here
 

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:39.470
to do which is take information here
send it up to a cloud and do something

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:39.480
send it up to a cloud and do something
 

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.000
send it up to a cloud and do something
with it and there's a couple great

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:41.010
with it and there's a couple great
 

00:25:41.010 --> 00:25:42.470
with it and there's a couple great
examples that are coming right now I

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480
examples that are coming right now I
 

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.490
examples that are coming right now I
don't know that you guys have been

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:43.500
don't know that you guys have been
 

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.150
don't know that you guys have been
playing with with phones lately and

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:47.160
playing with with phones lately and
 

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:49.670
playing with with phones lately and
applications lately but but one of the

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:49.680
applications lately but but one of the
 

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:51.200
applications lately but but one of the
things that that this thing can do is

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.210
things that that this thing can do is
 

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:54.440
things that that this thing can do is
voice recognition now you guys know this

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:54.450
voice recognition now you guys know this
 

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.290
voice recognition now you guys know this
I mean I I personally at world and other

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:57.300
I mean I I personally at world and other
 

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.910
I mean I I personally at world and other
places have been investing in speech

00:25:58.910 --> 00:25:58.920
places have been investing in speech
 

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.080
places have been investing in speech
recognition pretty much for 25 years and

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:02.090
recognition pretty much for 25 years and
 

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:05.810
recognition pretty much for 25 years and
five years ago seven years ago I was

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820
five years ago seven years ago I was
 

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:06.560
five years ago seven years ago I was
convinced

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:06.570
convinced
 

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.820
convinced
it was a technology it would never

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:07.830
it was a technology it would never
 

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:11.360
it was a technology it would never
happen I mean worship I mean we are we

00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:11.370
happen I mean worship I mean we are we
 

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.249
happen I mean worship I mean we are we
all were investing it but it just we

00:26:13.249 --> 00:26:13.259
all were investing it but it just we
 

00:26:13.259 --> 00:26:14.990
all were investing it but it just we
never thought it would happen because it

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:15.000
never thought it would happen because it
 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.330
never thought it would happen because it
was just too hard of a problem but

00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.340
was just too hard of a problem but
 

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:19.909
was just too hard of a problem but
what's changed is if you can take speech

00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919
what's changed is if you can take speech
 

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:22.399
what's changed is if you can take speech
and you can have it work with a thousand

00:26:22.399 --> 00:26:22.409
and you can have it work with a thousand
 

00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:25.279
and you can have it work with a thousand
computers simultaneously doing it and if

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:25.289
computers simultaneously doing it and if
 

00:26:25.289 --> 00:26:27.110
computers simultaneously doing it and if
you can train it this was the thing I

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120
you can train it this was the thing I
 

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.090
you can train it this was the thing I
was always missing was the combination

00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.100
was always missing was the combination
 

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:33.220
was always missing was the combination
of doing of doing the computation and

00:26:33.220 --> 00:26:33.230
of doing of doing the computation and
 

00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:35.210
of doing of doing the computation and
then if you didn't know the right answer

00:26:35.210 --> 00:26:35.220
then if you didn't know the right answer
 

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:38.360
then if you didn't know the right answer
present a few answers and allow somebody

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:38.370
present a few answers and allow somebody
 

00:26:38.370 --> 00:26:40.669
present a few answers and allow somebody
to pick the right one and then all the

00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679
to pick the right one and then all the
 

00:26:40.679 --> 00:26:42.289
to pick the right one and then all the
machine learning algorithms have a

00:26:42.289 --> 00:26:42.299
machine learning algorithms have a
 

00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:44.389
machine learning algorithms have a
feedback loop and all of a sudden you

00:26:44.389 --> 00:26:44.399
feedback loop and all of a sudden you
 

00:26:44.399 --> 00:26:46.549
feedback loop and all of a sudden you
know magical things happen and and in

00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559
know magical things happen and and in
 

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:49.159
know magical things happen and and in
our case when we launched a language a

00:26:49.159 --> 00:26:49.169
our case when we launched a language a
 

00:26:49.169 --> 00:26:51.440
our case when we launched a language a
speech you know you know a new language

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:51.450
speech you know you know a new language
 

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:53.720
speech you know you know a new language
which we're doing I think we'll probably

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:53.730
which we're doing I think we'll probably
 

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:56.119
which we're doing I think we'll probably
be up to 20 languages by the end of this

00:26:56.119 --> 00:26:56.129
be up to 20 languages by the end of this
 

00:26:56.129 --> 00:26:58.999
be up to 20 languages by the end of this
year when we launched one it starts out

00:26:58.999 --> 00:26:59.009
year when we launched one it starts out
 

00:26:59.009 --> 00:27:01.940
year when we launched one it starts out
not that good but then what happens is

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:01.950
not that good but then what happens is
 

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.220
not that good but then what happens is
you tell it you know you do an SMS and

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:04.230
you tell it you know you do an SMS and
 

00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:06.259
you tell it you know you do an SMS and
you send it to somebody and and it goes

00:27:06.259 --> 00:27:06.269
you send it to somebody and and it goes
 

00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:08.600
you send it to somebody and and it goes
thing through and says you know here's

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:08.610
thing through and says you know here's
 

00:27:08.610 --> 00:27:10.549
thing through and says you know here's
what it think you said and then you can

00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559
what it think you said and then you can
 

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.470
what it think you said and then you can
correct it and lo and behold those

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480
correct it and lo and behold those
 

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.840
correct it and lo and behold those
Corrections go back to us or if you say

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:14.850
Corrections go back to us or if you say
 

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:17.869
Corrections go back to us or if you say
I want to find you know CMU and it says

00:27:17.869 --> 00:27:17.879
I want to find you know CMU and it says
 

00:27:17.879 --> 00:27:19.430
I want to find you know CMU and it says
some other thing but there's a list

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440
some other thing but there's a list
 

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.379
some other thing but there's a list
there and you point to it and you point

00:27:21.379 --> 00:27:21.389
there and you point to it and you point
 

00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:23.600
there and you point to it and you point
in it says CMU it will now know that

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:23.610
in it says CMU it will now know that
 

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:26.389
in it says CMU it will now know that
what you really uh turd with CMU and so

00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399
what you really uh turd with CMU and so
 

00:27:26.399 --> 00:27:28.220
what you really uh turd with CMU and so
now you can learn in ways that we have

00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:28.230
now you can learn in ways that we have
 

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:31.129
now you can learn in ways that we have
never been able to to do before and the

00:27:31.129 --> 00:27:31.139
never been able to to do before and the
 

00:27:31.139 --> 00:27:33.830
never been able to to do before and the
same thing with translation translation

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840
same thing with translation translation
 

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.990
same thing with translation translation
was also something I never thought would

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000
was also something I never thought would
 

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.909
was also something I never thought would
actually happen because the rules for

00:27:37.909 --> 00:27:37.919
actually happen because the rules for
 

00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:39.769
actually happen because the rules for
languages were way too complicated and

00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779
languages were way too complicated and
 

00:27:39.779 --> 00:27:42.259
languages were way too complicated and
then we threw that out you know the

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:42.269
then we threw that out you know the
 

00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:44.840
then we threw that out you know the
world has thrown out you know a

00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:44.850
world has thrown out you know a
 

00:27:44.850 --> 00:27:47.360
world has thrown out you know a
rule-based translation for the most part

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:47.370
rule-based translation for the most part
 

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.549
rule-based translation for the most part
right now and it's all statistical show

00:27:49.549 --> 00:27:49.559
right now and it's all statistical show
 

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:52.190
right now and it's all statistical show
me enough data in one language and show

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:52.200
me enough data in one language and show
 

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.139
me enough data in one language and show
me enough translations of exactly that

00:27:54.139 --> 00:27:54.149
me enough translations of exactly that
 

00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:56.629
me enough translations of exactly that
and I'll make up a mathematical model

00:27:56.629 --> 00:27:56.639
and I'll make up a mathematical model
 

00:27:56.639 --> 00:27:59.710
and I'll make up a mathematical model
that actually relates the two more data

00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720
that actually relates the two more data
 

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.779
that actually relates the two more data
better translation and so right now we

00:28:02.779 --> 00:28:02.789
better translation and so right now we
 

00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:04.399
better translation and so right now we
have translations probably in 40

00:28:04.399 --> 00:28:04.409
have translations probably in 40
 

00:28:04.409 --> 00:28:06.619
have translations probably in 40
languages you know and it's just amazing

00:28:06.619 --> 00:28:06.629
languages you know and it's just amazing
 

00:28:06.629 --> 00:28:08.749
languages you know and it's just amazing
what you can do this phone right now i

00:28:08.749 --> 00:28:08.759
what you can do this phone right now i
 

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:10.759
what you can do this phone right now i
mean i could probably demo it here but

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:10.769
mean i could probably demo it here but
 

00:28:10.769 --> 00:28:12.860
mean i could probably demo it here but
you know i can say you know find me a

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:12.870
you know i can say you know find me a
 

00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:15.110
you know i can say you know find me a
taxi and translate into one of 40

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120
taxi and translate into one of 40
 

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:17.570
taxi and translate into one of 40
different languages and well the speech

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:17.580
different languages and well the speech
 

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.129
different languages and well the speech
part doesn't actually work with 40

00:28:19.129 --> 00:28:19.139
part doesn't actually work with 40
 

00:28:19.139 --> 00:28:20.419
part doesn't actually work with 40
languages we call it 20 lang

00:28:20.419 --> 00:28:20.429
languages we call it 20 lang
 

00:28:20.429 --> 00:28:22.369
languages we call it 20 lang
just and it will be able to translate

00:28:22.369 --> 00:28:22.379
just and it will be able to translate
 

00:28:22.379 --> 00:28:24.320
just and it will be able to translate
that and I can hold it up to the cab

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:24.330
that and I can hold it up to the cab
 

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.330
that and I can hold it up to the cab
driver and I can tell it to take me to

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:26.340
driver and I can tell it to take me to
 

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:28.369
driver and I can tell it to take me to
the airport in any of those language so

00:28:28.369 --> 00:28:28.379
the airport in any of those language so
 

00:28:28.379 --> 00:28:31.629
the airport in any of those language so
that's what's changed data computation

00:28:31.629 --> 00:28:31.639
that's what's changed data computation
 

00:28:31.639 --> 00:28:34.100
that's what's changed data computation
phones are changing the world and

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:34.110
phones are changing the world and
 

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.570
phones are changing the world and
they're changing it really really fast

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:35.580
they're changing it really really fast
 

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:38.509
they're changing it really really fast
but that's not the big point that I was

00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519
but that's not the big point that I was
 

00:28:38.519 --> 00:28:42.019
but that's not the big point that I was
trying to make here that the thing

00:28:42.019 --> 00:28:42.029
trying to make here that the thing
 

00:28:42.029 --> 00:28:44.239
trying to make here that the thing
that's interesting about the world that

00:28:44.239 --> 00:28:44.249
that's interesting about the world that
 

00:28:44.249 --> 00:28:46.850
that's interesting about the world that
we're creating in all of this is the

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:46.860
we're creating in all of this is the
 

00:28:46.860 --> 00:28:51.200
we're creating in all of this is the
ability for individual people to post

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:51.210
ability for individual people to post
 

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:55.730
ability for individual people to post
things get that back and learn from the

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:55.740
things get that back and learn from the
 

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.060
things get that back and learn from the
environment in a way that we've never

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:58.070
environment in a way that we've never
 

00:28:58.070 --> 00:29:02.330
environment in a way that we've never
had any chance of doing before and I

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:02.340
had any chance of doing before and I
 

00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:03.950
had any chance of doing before and I
think that's going to change what we

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960
think that's going to change what we
 

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:07.659
think that's going to change what we
think of about a search engine you know

00:29:07.659 --> 00:29:07.669
think of about a search engine you know
 

00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:10.340
think of about a search engine you know
right now in some sense a search engine

00:29:10.340 --> 00:29:10.350
right now in some sense a search engine
 

00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:14.450
right now in some sense a search engine
is something that you use to find

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:14.460
is something that you use to find
 

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:18.080
is something that you use to find
something so if you know you type if

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:18.090
something so if you know you type if
 

00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:20.299
something so if you know you type if
you're interested in some topic you type

00:29:20.299 --> 00:29:20.309
you're interested in some topic you type
 

00:29:20.309 --> 00:29:23.720
you're interested in some topic you type
the topic in and we find all the people

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:23.730
the topic in and we find all the people
 

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.190
the topic in and we find all the people
that have said something about that

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200
that have said something about that
 

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.340
that have said something about that
particular topic and we're very happy

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:28.350
particular topic and we're very happy
 

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.350
particular topic and we're very happy
with the way that works but but there's

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:30.360
with the way that works but but there's
 

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:34.430
with the way that works but but there's
something else that you need is we need

00:29:34.430 --> 00:29:34.440
something else that you need is we need
 

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.460
something else that you need is we need
to become a search engine that is

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:37.470
to become a search engine that is
 

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:39.409
to become a search engine that is
capable that you come to as a place to

00:29:39.409 --> 00:29:39.419
capable that you come to as a place to
 

00:29:39.419 --> 00:29:42.560
capable that you come to as a place to
discover something not just to find

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:42.570
discover something not just to find
 

00:29:42.570 --> 00:29:44.600
discover something not just to find
something and there's a big difference

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:44.610
something and there's a big difference
 

00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:50.330
something and there's a big difference
between discovery and finding there was

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340
between discovery and finding there was
 

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.070
between discovery and finding there was
an article that was written recently

00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080
an article that was written recently
 

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:54.379
an article that was written recently
about our search engines making us dumb

00:29:54.379 --> 00:29:54.389
about our search engines making us dumb
 

00:29:54.389 --> 00:29:59.419
about our search engines making us dumb
and there's a there's a you know III was

00:29:59.419 --> 00:29:59.429
and there's a there's a you know III was
 

00:29:59.429 --> 00:30:00.980
and there's a there's a you know III was
a you know I mean I couldn't believe

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:00.990
a you know I mean I couldn't believe
 

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:02.960
a you know I mean I couldn't believe
anybody would say that because I always

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:02.970
anybody would say that because I always
 

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.100
anybody would say that because I always
thought they were making us a lot

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.110
thought they were making us a lot
 

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:05.570
thought they were making us a lot
smarter because there was a lot more

00:30:05.570 --> 00:30:05.580
smarter because there was a lot more
 

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.399
smarter because there was a lot more
information there but there was an

00:30:07.399 --> 00:30:07.409
information there but there was an
 

00:30:07.409 --> 00:30:09.859
information there but there was an
element of truth there that surgeons are

00:30:09.859 --> 00:30:09.869
element of truth there that surgeons are
 

00:30:09.869 --> 00:30:11.989
element of truth there that surgeons are
really good about finding something if

00:30:11.989 --> 00:30:11.999
really good about finding something if
 

00:30:11.999 --> 00:30:13.609
really good about finding something if
somebody else has already done the work

00:30:13.609 --> 00:30:13.619
somebody else has already done the work
 

00:30:13.619 --> 00:30:17.570
somebody else has already done the work
for you you know but it doesn't help you

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580
for you you know but it doesn't help you
 

00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:20.239
for you you know but it doesn't help you
actually do the work yourself in some

00:30:20.239 --> 00:30:20.249
actually do the work yourself in some
 

00:30:20.249 --> 00:30:24.080
actually do the work yourself in some
sense it it's not it's a great way for

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.090
sense it it's not it's a great way for
 

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:26.989
sense it it's not it's a great way for
learning but discovery is something

00:30:26.989 --> 00:30:26.999
learning but discovery is something
 

00:30:26.999 --> 00:30:29.450
learning but discovery is something
that's quite different and in discovery

00:30:29.450 --> 00:30:29.460
that's quite different and in discovery
 

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:31.430
that's quite different and in discovery
is a key element of humans I mean we've

00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440
is a key element of humans I mean we've
 

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.590
is a key element of humans I mean we've
advanced because of discovery

00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600
advanced because of discovery
 

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.510
advanced because of discovery
not because of anything else we have in

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520
not because of anything else we have in
 

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.909
not because of anything else we have in
advance because somebody else has done a

00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919
advance because somebody else has done a
 

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:40.010
advance because somebody else has done a
paper and we read it it's because

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020
paper and we read it it's because
 

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.930
paper and we read it it's because
somebody actually went to the to the

00:30:41.930 --> 00:30:41.940
somebody actually went to the to the
 

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.450
somebody actually went to the to the
trouble of learning something was very

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:44.460
trouble of learning something was very
 

00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:46.400
trouble of learning something was very
new and i think one when the interesting

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:46.410
new and i think one when the interesting
 

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.430
new and i think one when the interesting
things about discovery is how it's often

00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440
things about discovery is how it's often
 

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.820
things about discovery is how it's often
obvious in hindsight you know that once

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:52.830
obvious in hindsight you know that once
 

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:56.840
obvious in hindsight you know that once
you've actually got a solution you read

00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:56.850
you've actually got a solution you read
 

00:30:56.850 --> 00:30:58.850
you've actually got a solution you read
about now say oh that was obvious and i

00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860
about now say oh that was obvious and i
 

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.919
about now say oh that was obvious and i
think it's one of the reasons why you

00:31:00.919 --> 00:31:00.929
think it's one of the reasons why you
 

00:31:00.929 --> 00:31:03.220
think it's one of the reasons why you
know sometimes I you know great

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:03.230
know sometimes I you know great
 

00:31:03.230 --> 00:31:06.770
know sometimes I you know great
discoverers have not been appreciated in

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:06.780
discoverers have not been appreciated in
 

00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.380
discoverers have not been appreciated in
their own time because everything looks

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:09.390
their own time because everything looks
 

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:11.360
their own time because everything looks
obvious I mean Copernicus you know that

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:11.370
obvious I mean Copernicus you know that
 

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.399
obvious I mean Copernicus you know that
I mean how could anybody believe that

00:31:13.399 --> 00:31:13.409
I mean how could anybody believe that
 

00:31:13.409 --> 00:31:15.380
I mean how could anybody believe that
you know everything revolved around the

00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:15.390
you know everything revolved around the
 

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:16.930
you know everything revolved around the
earth you know was just so complicated

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:16.940
earth you know was just so complicated
 

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.220
earth you know was just so complicated
and in hindsight it seems simple but

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:19.230
and in hindsight it seems simple but
 

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.649
and in hindsight it seems simple but
even in the time it wasn't said it

00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659
even in the time it wasn't said it
 

00:31:21.659 --> 00:31:25.159
even in the time it wasn't said it
wasn't considered simple and and I feel

00:31:25.159 --> 00:31:25.169
wasn't considered simple and and I feel
 

00:31:25.169 --> 00:31:28.549
wasn't considered simple and and I feel
like right now we are actually in a very

00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559
like right now we are actually in a very
 

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:30.230
like right now we are actually in a very
interesting time because we as

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240
interesting time because we as
 

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.870
interesting time because we as
scientists and and as technologists I

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:32.880
scientists and and as technologists I
 

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.310
scientists and and as technologists I
think I've gotten to the point where

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320
think I've gotten to the point where
 

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.640
think I've gotten to the point where
we've made technology inaccessible in a

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:37.650
we've made technology inaccessible in a
 

00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.039
we've made technology inaccessible in a
certain strange way where we depend on

00:31:40.039 --> 00:31:40.049
certain strange way where we depend on
 

00:31:40.049 --> 00:31:41.990
certain strange way where we depend on
other people sometimes to solve a

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000
other people sometimes to solve a
 

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.880
other people sometimes to solve a
problem for us that we could solve

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:43.890
problem for us that we could solve
 

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:47.450
problem for us that we could solve
ourselves and an example of this my dad

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:47.460
ourselves and an example of this my dad
 

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.659
ourselves and an example of this my dad
and I used to laugh at at you know like

00:31:50.659 --> 00:31:50.669
and I used to laugh at at you know like
 

00:31:50.669 --> 00:31:52.039
and I used to laugh at at you know like
lots of different things that we would

00:31:52.039 --> 00:31:52.049
lots of different things that we would
 

00:31:52.049 --> 00:31:53.990
lots of different things that we would
see but one of the ones I remember

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000
see but one of the ones I remember
 

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.830
see but one of the ones I remember
pretty vividly was was a Dear Abby

00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840
pretty vividly was was a Dear Abby
 

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.320
pretty vividly was was a Dear Abby
column and there was Dear Abby as this

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:00.330
column and there was Dear Abby as this
 

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:02.299
column and there was Dear Abby as this
for people that are young they might not

00:32:02.299 --> 00:32:02.309
for people that are young they might not
 

00:32:02.309 --> 00:32:03.620
for people that are young they might not
even know it I think dear abby still

00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:03.630
even know it I think dear abby still
 

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:05.510
even know it I think dear abby still
around but you know people write letters

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:05.520
around but you know people write letters
 

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.669
around but you know people write letters
asking you know questions and Dear Abby

00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679
asking you know questions and Dear Abby
 

00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:10.430
asking you know questions and Dear Abby
would consult experts and those experts

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440
would consult experts and those experts
 

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.169
would consult experts and those experts
would tell the answer and one of the

00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179
would tell the answer and one of the
 

00:32:12.179 --> 00:32:13.850
would tell the answer and one of the
Dear Abby columns that my dad who is a

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860
Dear Abby columns that my dad who is a
 

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.700
Dear Abby columns that my dad who is a
mechanical engineer and and you know

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:16.710
mechanical engineer and and you know
 

00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.460
mechanical engineer and and you know
very you know love to solve problems

00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:19.470
very you know love to solve problems
 

00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:21.980
very you know love to solve problems
just in general but this Dear Abby thing

00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:21.990
just in general but this Dear Abby thing
 

00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:24.200
just in general but this Dear Abby thing
was a was a letter that says does a

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.210
was a was a letter that says does a
 

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:28.070
was a was a letter that says does a
shower use less water than then a tub

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080
shower use less water than then a tub
 

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.620
shower use less water than then a tub
and it was you know I mean so she

00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:30.630
and it was you know I mean so she
 

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.570
and it was you know I mean so she
consulted multiple experts and there was

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580
consulted multiple experts and there was
 

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.070
consulted multiple experts and there was
a little differences of opinion on

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080
a little differences of opinion on
 

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:37.210
a little differences of opinion on
whether showers use more water than tubs

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:37.220
whether showers use more water than tubs
 

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:39.680
whether showers use more water than tubs
and my dad and I just laughed

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:39.690
and my dad and I just laughed
 

00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:42.500
and my dad and I just laughed
hysterically for hours about this

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:42.510
hysterically for hours about this
 

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:44.600
hysterically for hours about this
because there's a simple way to test

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:44.610
because there's a simple way to test
 

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.080
because there's a simple way to test
this

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:46.090
this
 

00:32:46.090 --> 00:32:47.970
this
you get in the tub with a shower you

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:47.980
you get in the tub with a shower you
 

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:51.060
you get in the tub with a shower you
plug up to the bottom of the tub and you

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:51.070
plug up to the bottom of the tub and you
 

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:53.039
plug up to the bottom of the tub and you
take a shower and then you ask yourself

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:53.049
take a shower and then you ask yourself
 

00:32:53.049 --> 00:32:54.810
take a shower and then you ask yourself
at the end of that shower is there

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:54.820
at the end of that shower is there
 

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.510
at the end of that shower is there
enough water in the bath to have a bath

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:57.520
enough water in the bath to have a bath
 

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.409
enough water in the bath to have a bath
or not but somehow we have lost this

00:33:01.409 --> 00:33:01.419
or not but somehow we have lost this
 

00:33:01.419 --> 00:33:04.490
or not but somehow we have lost this
sins that people can solve problems and

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:04.500
sins that people can solve problems and
 

00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:07.289
sins that people can solve problems and
and I feel like that's what's missing

00:33:07.289 --> 00:33:07.299
and I feel like that's what's missing
 

00:33:07.299 --> 00:33:09.930
and I feel like that's what's missing
you know a lot of the science and

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:09.940
you know a lot of the science and
 

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:11.370
you know a lot of the science and
technology stuff that we're doing right

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:11.380
technology stuff that we're doing right
 

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.200
technology stuff that we're doing right
now why aren't people interested in

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.210
now why aren't people interested in
 

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.620
now why aren't people interested in
science anymore well somehow this whole

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:16.630
science anymore well somehow this whole
 

00:33:16.630 --> 00:33:20.909
science anymore well somehow this whole
thing of discovery you know is lost you

00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:20.919
thing of discovery you know is lost you
 

00:33:20.919 --> 00:33:22.529
thing of discovery you know is lost you
know the idea that i can solve problems

00:33:22.529 --> 00:33:22.539
know the idea that i can solve problems
 

00:33:22.539 --> 00:33:25.110
know the idea that i can solve problems
and i think we as technologists make

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:25.120
and i think we as technologists make
 

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:27.960
and i think we as technologists make
this problem worse because we make

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:27.970
this problem worse because we make
 

00:33:27.970 --> 00:33:29.549
this problem worse because we make
technology and accessible and we do it

00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559
technology and accessible and we do it
 

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:32.570
technology and accessible and we do it
all the time we create all this jargon

00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580
all the time we create all this jargon
 

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:34.860
all the time we create all this jargon
associated with our disciplines that

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:34.870
associated with our disciplines that

associated with our disciplines that
makes it seem like wow you're really

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:38.320
makes it seem like wow you're really
 

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.340
makes it seem like wow you're really
smart when a lot of times we're not

00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:41.350
smart when a lot of times we're not
 

00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:44.490
smart when a lot of times we're not
being smart we're confusing things we're

00:33:44.490 --> 00:33:44.500
being smart we're confusing things we're
 

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.769
being smart we're confusing things we're
making ourselves seem smarter I'm from

00:33:46.769 --> 00:33:46.779
making ourselves seem smarter I'm from

making ourselves seem smarter I'm from
computer architecture so there's lots of

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:48.580
computer architecture so there's lots of
 

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.279
computer architecture so there's lots of
examples in computer architecture I

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:50.289
examples in computer architecture I
 

00:33:50.289 --> 00:33:52.590
examples in computer architecture I
spent like so there's there's whole

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:52.600
spent like so there's there's whole
 

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.510
spent like so there's there's whole
graduate courses where pieces of them

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:54.520
graduate courses where pieces of them
 

00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:57.029
graduate courses where pieces of them
talk about pipelining it's it's a

00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039
talk about pipelining it's it's a
 

00:33:57.039 --> 00:33:59.370
talk about pipelining it's it's a
fundamental thing there's pipelining and

00:33:59.370 --> 00:33:59.380
fundamental thing there's pipelining and
 

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.519
fundamental thing there's pipelining and
super pipelining and all this stuff and

00:34:01.519 --> 00:34:01.529
super pipelining and all this stuff and
 

00:34:01.529 --> 00:34:04.470
super pipelining and all this stuff and
pipelining is the way CPU is basically

00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480
pipelining is the way CPU is basically
 

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.299
pipelining is the way CPU is basically
processed data in a very interesting way

00:34:06.299 --> 00:34:06.309
processed data in a very interesting way
 

00:34:06.309 --> 00:34:09.240
processed data in a very interesting way
so that you can overlap computation and

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:09.250
so that you can overlap computation and
 

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:11.700
so that you can overlap computation and
and there's lots of stuff there but when

00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:11.710
and there's lots of stuff there but when
 

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.710
and there's lots of stuff there but when
you get to the bottom of all of that

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720
you get to the bottom of all of that
 

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:17.639
you get to the bottom of all of that
it's a washer and a dryer that's all it

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:17.649
it's a washer and a dryer that's all it
 

00:34:17.649 --> 00:34:19.770
it's a washer and a dryer that's all it
is you know put stuff in a washer you

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:19.780
is you know put stuff in a washer you
 

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.060
is you know put stuff in a washer you
move it over the dryer you put more

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:21.070
move it over the dryer you put more
 

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:22.770
move it over the dryer you put more
stuff in a washer you know when the

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:22.780
stuff in a washer you know when the
 

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.329
stuff in a washer you know when the
dryer is done you take it out there you

00:34:24.329 --> 00:34:24.339
dryer is done you take it out there you
 

00:34:24.339 --> 00:34:26.750
dryer is done you take it out there you
move it that's all I did but but but

00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760
move it that's all I did but but but
 

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.430
move it that's all I did but but but
they didn't say that in my graduate

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440
they didn't say that in my graduate
 

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.220
they didn't say that in my graduate
computer architecture class you know it

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:32.230
computer architecture class you know it
 

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:34.290
computer architecture class you know it
took a while for you to figure out that

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:34.300
took a while for you to figure out that
 

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.820
took a while for you to figure out that
the thing that that's really what's

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:35.830
the thing that that's really what's
 

00:34:35.830 --> 00:34:38.940
the thing that that's really what's
happening here and and you know I feel

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:38.950
happening here and and you know I feel
 

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:41.310
happening here and and you know I feel
like I feel like we're the ones that are

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:41.320
like I feel like we're the ones that are
 

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.780

to change the philosophy is to start

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760
to change the philosophy is to start
 

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.879
to change the philosophy is to start
making data more accessible to people

00:34:50.879 --> 00:34:50.889
making data more accessible to people
 

00:34:50.889 --> 00:34:54.060
making data more accessible to people
start making ways to explore more

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:54.070
start making ways to explore more
 

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.909
start making ways to explore more
accessible and I think that really the

00:34:56.909 --> 00:34:56.919
accessible and I think that really the
 

00:34:56.919 --> 00:34:59.280

is about explorable imagery with tagging

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:13.690
is about explorable imagery with tagging
 

00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:16.770
is about explorable imagery with tagging
so those three things right and all of

00:35:16.770 --> 00:35:16.780
so those three things right and all of
 

00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:20.900
so those three things right and all of
them are fantastic the imagery section

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:20.910
them are fantastic the imagery section
 

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:24.200

mean our eyes are just marbles you know

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:33.220
mean our eyes are just marbles you know
 

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.820

in human biology I mean there's such

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:35.830
in human biology I mean there's such
 

00:35:35.830 --> 00:35:38.220

something as marvelous as the human eye

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:45.070
something as marvelous as the human eye
 

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:48.510
something as marvelous as the human eye
and but it's it's interesting at just

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520
and but it's it's interesting at just
 

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.210
and but it's it's interesting at just
how powerful those things are an image

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:51.220
how powerful those things are an image
 

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.580

is not just worth a thousand words and

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:53.590
is not just worth a thousand words and
 

00:35:53.590 --> 00:35:56.460
is not just worth a thousand words and
it's worth it's worth way more than that

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:56.470
it's worth it's worth way more than that

it's worth it's worth way more than that
and so the imagery stuff was very

00:35:59.640 --> 00:35:59.650
and so the imagery stuff was very
 

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:01.920
and so the imagery stuff was very
interesting to me and especially imagery

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:01.930
interesting to me and especially imagery
 

00:36:01.930 --> 00:36:04.290

at scale everything at Google is about

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:04.300
at scale everything at Google is about
 

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.990
at scale everything at Google is about
at scale so no matter what you do is it

to work I know this will work in a

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:11.290
to work I know this will work in a
 

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:13.160
to work I know this will work in a
really small domain but will it work

00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:13.170
really small domain but will it work
 

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.230
really small domain but will it work
broadly you know is it applicable to

00:36:16.230 --> 00:36:16.240
broadly you know is it applicable to
 

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.120
broadly you know is it applicable to
lots of different disciplines that's

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:18.130

what scaling is all about so when you

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:20.140
what scaling is all about so when you
 

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.920
what scaling is all about so when you
talked about imagery it was imagery at

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:22.930
talked about imagery it was imagery at
 

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:25.860
talked about imagery it was imagery at
scale it was democratization of image

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:25.870
scale it was democratization of image
 

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.440
scale it was democratization of image
and scale but the second hook was

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:28.450
and scale but the second hook was
 

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:32.490

explored explorable because exploration

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:32.500
explored explorable because exploration
 

00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.670
explored explorable because exploration
is a really important thing and I feel

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680
is a really important thing and I feel
 

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.260
is a really important thing and I feel
like it's something that's missing from

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:37.270
like it's something that's missing from
 

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.170
like it's something that's missing from
the ethos right now the idea that an

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:40.180
the ethos right now the idea that an
 

00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:42.450
the ethos right now the idea that an
image you can actually dive down in it

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:42.460
image you can actually dive down in it
 

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.370
image you can actually dive down in it
and go deep enough to learn something

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:44.380
and go deep enough to learn something
 

00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:47.010
and go deep enough to learn something
and nobody else knows you know that's

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:47.020
and nobody else knows you know that's
 

00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.110
and nobody else knows you know that's
the important thing and then the idea of

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:49.120
the important thing and then the idea of
 

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.480
the important thing and then the idea of
tagging that you can add a piece of

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:51.490
tagging that you can add a piece of
 

00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:56.400
tagging that you can add a piece of
information to a image on something that

00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:56.410
information to a image on something that
 

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:59.310
information to a image on something that
you found that nobody else knows and you

00:36:59.310 --> 00:36:59.320
you found that nobody else knows and you
 

00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:02.430
you found that nobody else knows and you
can share it with everybody those three

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440
can share it with everybody those three

exciting to me but but I think it's
 

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:25.370
exciting to me but but I think it's
important and I can't say that about

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:25.380
important and I can't say that about
 

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:28.550
important and I can't say that about
that many things that they're important

some interaction with the audience thank
you for the fantastic lecture

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:06.410
 

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.630
well I'm not the expert on it but but

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640
well I'm not the expert on it but but
 

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.250
well I'm not the expert on it but but
they don't train they don't change for

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.260
they don't train they don't change for
 

00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:13.099
they don't train they don't change for
particular voices you know which to me

00:39:13.099 --> 00:39:13.109
particular voices you know which to me
 

00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:15.079
particular voices you know which to me
is astounding that they don't because

00:39:15.079 --> 00:39:15.089
is astounding that they don't because
 

00:39:15.089 --> 00:39:17.690
is astounding that they don't because
the fact that it works across you know

00:39:17.690 --> 00:39:17.700
the fact that it works across you know
 

00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.760
the fact that it works across you know
the problem with the systems that you

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:19.770
the problem with the systems that you
 

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:20.960
the problem with the systems that you
have to training your voice is they

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:20.970
have to training your voice is they
 

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:22.700
have to training your voice is they
start out really inaccurate and they get

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:22.710
start out really inaccurate and they get
 

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:24.740
start out really inaccurate and they get
more and more accurate over time and so

00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:24.750
more and more accurate over time and so
 

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:26.180
more and more accurate over time and so
I never thought that you would actually

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:26.190
I never thought that you would actually
 

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:28.849
I never thought that you would actually
have a voice independent speech system

00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:28.859
have a voice independent speech system
 

00:39:28.859 --> 00:39:31.370
have a voice independent speech system
that would actually work I do think that

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380
that would actually work I do think that
 

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.170
that would actually work I do think that
tailoring two voices over time they'll

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180
tailoring two voices over time they'll
 

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:35.450
tailoring two voices over time they'll
actually be important and and since

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460
actually be important and and since
 

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.309
actually be important and and since
these are individual devices not shared

00:39:37.309 --> 00:39:37.319
these are individual devices not shared
 

00:39:37.319 --> 00:39:39.230
these are individual devices not shared
devices that we could do a really good

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240
devices that we could do a really good
 

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.859
devices that we could do a really good
job of that I also think that that it's

00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:42.869
job of that I also think that that it's
 

00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:46.640
job of that I also think that that it's
important to build language models for

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:46.650
important to build language models for
 

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:48.859
important to build language models for
you know now they're not just working

00:39:48.859 --> 00:39:48.869
you know now they're not just working
 

00:39:48.869 --> 00:39:50.000
you know now they're not just working
about language they're working about

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.010
about language they're working about
 

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.339
about language they're working about
dialects inside of languages so if you

00:39:52.339 --> 00:39:52.349
dialects inside of languages so if you
 

00:39:52.349 --> 00:39:54.530
dialects inside of languages so if you
can recognize particular dialects inside

00:39:54.530 --> 00:39:54.540
can recognize particular dialects inside
 

00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:56.599
can recognize particular dialects inside
of languages you can also often map them

00:39:56.599 --> 00:39:56.609
of languages you can also often map them
 

00:39:56.609 --> 00:40:00.950
of languages you can also often map them
in a speaker independent fashion but

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960
in a speaker independent fashion but
 

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:03.290
in a speaker independent fashion but
still with a dependent you know mapping

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300
still with a dependent you know mapping
 

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.900
still with a dependent you know mapping
to a particular language model so that's

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:05.910
to a particular language model so that's
 

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:07.579
to a particular language model so that's
the direction where we're trying to go

00:40:07.579 --> 00:40:07.589
the direction where we're trying to go
 

00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:09.950
the direction where we're trying to go
but I think you're right that the next

00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960
but I think you're right that the next
 

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.150
but I think you're right that the next
generation will actually will actually

00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.160
generation will actually will actually
 

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.620
generation will actually will actually
be much more personalized matter of fact

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:15.630
be much more personalized matter of fact
 

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:19.640
be much more personalized matter of fact
just in general the future will be

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:19.650
just in general the future will be
 

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:21.730
just in general the future will be
personalized across all information I

00:40:21.730 --> 00:40:21.740
personalized across all information I
 

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.290
personalized across all information I
feel like even search engines the future

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300
feel like even search engines the future
 

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.180
feel like even search engines the future
of that will involve personalization

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:26.190
of that will involve personalization
 

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:28.520
of that will involve personalization
when you search for something if you're

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:28.530
when you search for something if you're
 

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:30.319
when you search for something if you're
a cardiologist searching for something

00:40:30.319 --> 00:40:30.329
a cardiologist searching for something
 

00:40:30.329 --> 00:40:32.480
a cardiologist searching for something
on the heart what you want to get is

00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:32.490
on the heart what you want to get is
 

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:34.040
on the heart what you want to get is
very different than what my grandmother

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:34.050
very different than what my grandmother
 

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:36.349
very different than what my grandmother
wants to get on heart so the idea of

00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359
wants to get on heart so the idea of
 

00:40:36.359 --> 00:40:38.660
wants to get on heart so the idea of
personalization won't just apply to

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:38.670
personalization won't just apply to
 

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:44.420
personalization won't just apply to
speech it will apply to everything

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:44.430
 

00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:47.400
seems like Google's up by March last few

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.410
seems like Google's up by March last few
 

00:40:47.410 --> 00:41:00.950
seems like Google's up by March last few
years really hi uh Sam stall taking slow

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960
years really hi uh Sam stall taking slow
 

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:05.940
years really hi uh Sam stall taking slow
ya know I like Microsoft I actually know

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:05.950
ya know I like Microsoft I actually know
 

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:07.410
ya know I like Microsoft I actually know
a lot of people at Microsoft's are never

00:41:07.410 --> 00:41:07.420
a lot of people at Microsoft's are never
 

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.320
a lot of people at Microsoft's are never
say anything about Microsoft they're

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:10.330
say anything about Microsoft they're
 

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:14.190
say anything about Microsoft they're
great company the you know I think that

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200
great company the you know I think that
 

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:16.470
great company the you know I think that
the the major thing that we try to do is

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:16.480
the the major thing that we try to do is
 

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:20.640
the the major thing that we try to do is
is try to stay fast moving I think

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:20.650
is try to stay fast moving I think
 

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.680
is try to stay fast moving I think
that's the most important thing that you

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:22.690
that's the most important thing that you
 

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.650
that's the most important thing that you
can do as a company in anything that

00:41:25.650 --> 00:41:25.660
can do as a company in anything that
 

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.980
can do as a company in anything that
your company does too slow people down

00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:27.990
your company does too slow people down
 

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:31.280
your company does too slow people down
you have to fight pretty hard against

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:31.290
you have to fight pretty hard against
 

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:35.960
you have to fight pretty hard against
but as companies get big there are more

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:35.970
but as companies get big there are more
 

00:41:35.970 --> 00:41:39.870
but as companies get big there are more
they're more opinions and reaching

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:39.880
they're more opinions and reaching
 

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.840
they're more opinions and reaching
consensus takes a while I think the best

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:42.850
consensus takes a while I think the best
 

00:41:42.850 --> 00:41:45.060
consensus takes a while I think the best
thing you can do to avert that is just

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.070
thing you can do to avert that is just
 

00:41:45.070 --> 00:41:47.640
thing you can do to avert that is just
be incredibly transparent and then have

00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:47.650
be incredibly transparent and then have
 

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.349
be incredibly transparent and then have
clear lines of authority and decision

00:41:49.349 --> 00:41:49.359
clear lines of authority and decision
 

00:41:49.359 --> 00:41:51.330
clear lines of authority and decision
making but you have to be really careful

00:41:51.330 --> 00:41:51.340
making but you have to be really careful
 

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.120
making but you have to be really careful
because all great ideas come from the

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:54.130
because all great ideas come from the
 

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:55.859
because all great ideas come from the
bottom of the company I have not come up

00:41:55.859 --> 00:41:55.869
bottom of the company I have not come up
 

00:41:55.869 --> 00:41:57.270
bottom of the company I have not come up
with I've been there nine years I don't

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280
with I've been there nine years I don't
 

00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.560
with I've been there nine years I don't
think I've come up with a single good

00:41:58.560 --> 00:41:58.570
think I've come up with a single good
 

00:41:58.570 --> 00:42:02.130
think I've come up with a single good
idea but what has happened was I can

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:02.140
idea but what has happened was I can
 

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.890
idea but what has happened was I can
support some good ideas and so the

00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:04.900
support some good ideas and so the
 

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.990
support some good ideas and so the
important thing is to try to try to make

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:07.000
important thing is to try to try to make
 

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.340
important thing is to try to try to make
sure that you maintain a bottoms-up

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:08.350
sure that you maintain a bottoms-up
 

00:42:08.350 --> 00:42:10.740
sure that you maintain a bottoms-up
culture and try to get good ideas you

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:10.750
culture and try to get good ideas you
 

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.140
culture and try to get good ideas you
know funded and and try not to slow

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:13.150
know funded and and try not to slow
 

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:15.540
know funded and and try not to slow
people down you know the worst thing you

00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:15.550
people down you know the worst thing you
 

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.690
people down you know the worst thing you
can do is actually slow people down and

00:42:17.690 --> 00:42:17.700
can do is actually slow people down and
 

00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.800
can do is actually slow people down and
you know so that's what we concentrate

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:19.810
you know so that's what we concentrate
 

00:42:19.810 --> 00:42:21.980
you know so that's what we concentrate
on try to keep our groups small

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:21.990
on try to keep our groups small
 

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.660
on try to keep our groups small
fast-moving you know getting rid of

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:24.670
fast-moving you know getting rid of
 

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:27.560
fast-moving you know getting rid of
barriers you know clear decision making

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:27.570
barriers you know clear decision making
 

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:30.690
barriers you know clear decision making
but to try to just you know I don't know

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:30.700
but to try to just you know I don't know
 

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.160
but to try to just you know I don't know
support innovation that's the biggest

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:32.170
support innovation that's the biggest
 

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:43.959
support innovation that's the biggest
thing

00:42:43.959 --> 00:42:43.969
 

00:42:43.969 --> 00:42:50.169
the reticle responsibilities in terms of

00:42:50.169 --> 00:42:50.179
 

00:42:50.179 --> 00:42:59.149
displaying entities well we obviously

00:42:59.149 --> 00:42:59.159
displaying entities well we obviously
 

00:42:59.159 --> 00:43:06.309
displaying entities well we obviously
took a huge and controversial Stand to

00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319
took a huge and controversial Stand to
 

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:09.019
took a huge and controversial Stand to
take our search engine out of China and

00:43:09.019 --> 00:43:09.029
take our search engine out of China and
 

00:43:09.029 --> 00:43:16.309
take our search engine out of China and
move it to to Hong Kong because we we

00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319
move it to to Hong Kong because we we
 

00:43:16.319 --> 00:43:18.579
move it to to Hong Kong because we we
felt we can no longer participate in

00:43:18.579 --> 00:43:18.589
felt we can no longer participate in
 

00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:21.739
felt we can no longer participate in
censorship that was required to have you

00:43:21.739 --> 00:43:21.749
censorship that was required to have you
 

00:43:21.749 --> 00:43:24.890
censorship that was required to have you
know computers in China it was a very

00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:24.900
know computers in China it was a very
 

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.569
know computers in China it was a very
difficult decision on lots of different

00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579
difficult decision on lots of different
 

00:43:26.579 --> 00:43:30.409
difficult decision on lots of different
dimensions for us as a company because

00:43:30.409 --> 00:43:30.419
dimensions for us as a company because
 

00:43:30.419 --> 00:43:35.390
dimensions for us as a company because
we do believe in participation in in in

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400
we do believe in participation in in in
 

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:37.189
we do believe in participation in in in

00:43:37.189 --> 00:43:37.199
information our goal is to provide
 

00:43:37.199 --> 00:43:39.979
information our goal is to provide
information for people and when we went

00:43:39.979 --> 00:43:39.989
information for people and when we went
 

00:43:39.989 --> 00:43:41.390
information for people and when we went
in there it was one of the toughest

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400
in there it was one of the toughest
 

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.099
in there it was one of the toughest
decisions we made as a company because

00:43:43.099 --> 00:43:43.109
decisions we made as a company because
 

00:43:43.109 --> 00:43:45.319
decisions we made as a company because
we knew that by going in there and

00:43:45.319 --> 00:43:45.329
we knew that by going in there and
 

00:43:45.329 --> 00:43:46.729
we knew that by going in there and
putting our servers there we were going

00:43:46.729 --> 00:43:46.739
putting our servers there we were going
 

00:43:46.739 --> 00:43:48.729
putting our servers there we were going
to have to censor some amount of

00:43:48.729 --> 00:43:48.739
to have to censor some amount of
 

00:43:48.739 --> 00:43:52.339
to have to censor some amount of
information but we figured that the

00:43:52.339 --> 00:43:52.349
information but we figured that the
 

00:43:52.349 --> 00:43:53.779
information but we figured that the
ninety-nine percent that we weren't

00:43:53.779 --> 00:43:53.789
ninety-nine percent that we weren't
 

00:43:53.789 --> 00:43:55.579
ninety-nine percent that we weren't
censoring was more important than the

00:43:55.579 --> 00:43:55.589
censoring was more important than the
 

00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:58.969
censoring was more important than the
one percent that we were but that became

00:43:58.969 --> 00:43:58.979
one percent that we were but that became
 

00:43:58.979 --> 00:44:01.640
one percent that we were but that became
more difficult out of the time and we

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:01.650
more difficult out of the time and we
 

00:44:01.650 --> 00:44:03.679
more difficult out of the time and we
reversed ourselves on that decision and

00:44:03.679 --> 00:44:03.689
reversed ourselves on that decision and
 

00:44:03.689 --> 00:44:06.140
reversed ourselves on that decision and
decided that we couldn't do that anymore

00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:06.150
decided that we couldn't do that anymore
 

00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:08.599
decided that we couldn't do that anymore
that as an information being in the

00:44:08.599 --> 00:44:08.609
that as an information being in the
 

00:44:08.609 --> 00:44:10.479
that as an information being in the
information business had certain

00:44:10.479 --> 00:44:10.489
information business had certain
 

00:44:10.489 --> 00:44:14.569
information business had certain
requirements for us and that it wasn't

00:44:14.569 --> 00:44:14.579
requirements for us and that it wasn't
 

00:44:14.579 --> 00:44:16.099
requirements for us and that it wasn't
that we have any problem with sensory I

00:44:16.099 --> 00:44:16.109
that we have any problem with sensory I
 

00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:17.359

00:44:18.959 --> 00:44:21.559
philosophical statement about whether
censoring is good bad or indifferent but

00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:21.569
censoring is good bad or indifferent but
 

00:44:21.569 --> 00:44:24.709
censoring is good bad or indifferent but

parties so one of the things that a lot

00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:11.820
parties so one of the things that a lot
 

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.339
parties so one of the things that a lot
of search engines used to do is

00:47:13.339 --> 00:47:13.349
of search engines used to do is
 

00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:14.990
of search engines used to do is
basically sell search histories to other

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000
basically sell search histories to other
 

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.730
basically sell search histories to other
people and all this thing we don't do

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:16.740
people and all this thing we don't do
 

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:19.190
people and all this thing we don't do
that you know if you give it to us we're

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200
that you know if you give it to us we're
 

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.099
that you know if you give it to us we're
trying to provide the value to you and

00:47:21.099 --> 00:47:21.109
trying to provide the value to you and
 

00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:24.140

so that so so the first thing is make it
 

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.089
so that so so the first thing is make it
useful and the analogy I'd use as credit

00:47:26.089 --> 00:47:26.099
useful and the analogy I'd use as credit
 

00:47:26.099 --> 00:47:29.390
useful and the analogy I'd use as credit
cards I mean weevil may have lots of
