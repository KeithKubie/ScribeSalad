00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.273
 -Welcome to the Fake News
 Awards. -The Fake News Awards.

00:00:06.273 --> 00:00:07.808
JACKSON: We're headed
 to The Washington Post

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:10.744
to talk to some journalists--
AKA liars, losers, and haters--

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.212
about what it's like
to be nominated.

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:13.480
And since it's an awards show,

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.349
we're bringing the red carpet
to them.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.085
JACKSON: The glitz,
 the glamour, the lies.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:20.354
 We couldn't believe
 we were there on the floor

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:23.357
 of the world-famous,
 Jeff Bezos Washington Post.

00:00:23.357 --> 00:00:25.826
SHARP: Seriously,
 why did they let us in here?

00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.228
 We spoke to Margaret
 A. Sullivan, media columnist

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:30.898
 for The Washington Post,
 about this historic night.

00:00:30.898 --> 00:00:33.100
First-time nominee, because
it is the first time the awards

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.502
-have existed.
-Yes. Are you so excited?

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:39.106
Well, you know, I think the Fake
News Awards are a very bad idea.

00:00:39.106 --> 00:00:41.241
So you're saying it's an honor
just to be nominated.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:45.712
No, in fact, it's not only not
an honor to be nominated

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:49.449
but these awards
are actually, um, a disgrace.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.920
And the president
has really turned that phrase,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.925
"fake news," into a weapon
against the free press.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:00:59.793
And I disagree.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:02.129
Well, you know, you're entitled
to say whatever you want.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.630
Exactly.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.900
But that doesn't mean that
the public should believe it.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.169
Okay, and who are you wearing?

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.506
-No comment. Interesting.
-No comment.

00:01:12.506 --> 00:01:15.509
SHARP: Also excited for
 the awards, first-time nominee,

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.444
 media critic Erik Wemple.

00:01:17.444 --> 00:01:19.780
What's the deal
with this, uh, carpet remnant?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.848
-It's an awards show.
So we're... -Right. -Yeah.

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:25.252
I think, myself and most
of my... most of my colleagues,

00:01:25.252 --> 00:01:28.322
um, we got in the business,
uh, with the intention

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:31.725
of never receiving an award of
any sort from anybody we cover,

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.660
so I don't know...
I don't know why...

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.463
I don't know why you have
this carpet remnant here.

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.966
We came to sort of celebrate
the big deal,

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:41.034
the big awards show, you know,
big deal President Trump

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:44.104
nominating fake news,
uh, mainstream media,

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:46.640
sort of taking it down in sort
of a funny, presidential way.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.575
What do you think about that?

00:01:49.643 --> 00:01:51.111
Sir, sir, sir, sir.

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.313
Would you care to comment
on the Fake News Awards?

00:01:53.313 --> 00:01:55.048
Okay.

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:56.650
(sighs)

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.386
Don't you think the Fake News
Awards are pretty funny?

00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:02.255
You know, I really don't like to
use the expression "fake news,"

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.057
because I think
it's been weaponized.

00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:07.527
We need to stay close
to what is provable

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.796
and verifiable reality

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:13.400
and not get into the idea
of separate sets of facts

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.870
-that might please a particular
audience. -(music playing)

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.872
-We need to sort of...
-S-Sorry to interrupt.

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.474
They're telling me
you need to speed it up.

00:02:20.474 --> 00:02:22.209
-Yeah, they will play you off
if you take too long. -Yeah.

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:24.478
Okay, well, "fake news"
shouldn't be used anymore.

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:29.816
Don't you think news is true
if you believe it?

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:32.953
I think news is true
when you prove it.

00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:35.155
-Interesting. Interesting
opinion. -Yeah, what an...

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.490
No, that's not an opinion.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.991
Oh.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.326
That's not an opinion.

00:02:39.326 --> 00:02:41.495
Is there gonna be
a big after-party?

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:42.929
I don't really know
of any parties.

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:44.598
-I'm certainly not planning
to attend any. -See?

00:02:44.598 --> 00:02:45.999
People keep saying that to us,

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.135
-and it's as if either no one
respects these... -Right.

00:02:48.135 --> 00:02:50.070
...because they're a detrimental
force on our world,

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.471
or there's just
a secret party...

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.306
-Yeah.
-...that you don't want us at.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.574
No. It's actually

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.843
that they are a detrimental
force on our world.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.746
Okay, but do you know
where I can get cocaine?

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.215
I do not.

00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:05.118
-Fake News Awards red carpet.
-Good luck to everyone.

00:03:05.118 --> 00:03:06.119
Good luck!

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:07.120
JACKSON:
 So there's

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.255
-no after-party.
-Uh-uh.

00:03:08.255 --> 00:03:09.423
I guess nobody cares.

00:03:09.423 --> 00:03:10.724
Nobody cares about real news.

00:03:10.724 --> 00:03:12.626
-Yeah, as in the kind
that we agree with. -Right.

00:03:12.626 --> 00:03:14.928
-Do you have cocaine, though?
-Yeah, I have a D.C. guy.

00:03:14.928 --> 00:03:16.063
Oh, thank God.
