CARL SAFINA: All
right, well, we're

00:00:01.458 --> 00:00:04.120
going to talk about basically
the subtitle of this book.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.410
This book came out two days
ago, so it's brand new.

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.950
And we're going to start in
a kind of familiar place.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.090
Many of us have animals at home,
and we've often asked ourselves

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.890
these questions, right?

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.640
How many people have
asked themselves

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.699
if their cat or dog
really loves them, or just

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.990
wants food, or whatever, right?

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.260
That's pretty common.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.360
And we think, well,
it's impossible to know.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.310
But is it really?

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.360
Is it really impossible
to know what's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.500
going on in the mind and
the heart of our pets?

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.620
Well, in a way, no
and in a way, yes.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.980
What's really going on in
those minds is the question.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.450
Another question is-- it's
not showing up very well

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.190
there-- how are they like us?

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.530
But I don't like that
question so much.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.900
It's an inescapable
question because they

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.470
are in many ways like us.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.470
But when we say, how
are they like us,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.510
we put the attention back on us.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.800
And us is our favorite story.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.872
We like to talk about ourselves.

00:01:10.872 --> 00:01:12.830
And what we're really
supposed to be doing here

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.520
is asking, how are
they like us or not?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.120
Who are we here on Earth
with is really the point.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.500
And what is going on
in these minds that

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.150
are our co-voyagers
on planet Earth?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.810
Is there any way to
get into the mind

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.610
of an elephant, for instance,
or any other kind of creature?

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.920
Well, I think there are actually
several really good ways

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.620
of seeing in.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.250
You can look at their
brain and their mind.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.150
You can look at their body, at
the logic of their behavior,

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.260
at their evolution.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.510
So the first thing is if
we're interested in minds

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.890
is to know where is the mind?

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.490
In many parts of
human history, people

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.910
have thought the mind is
in the heart or the mind

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:01.800
is in the soul.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.880
The mind is a
disembodied spirit that

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.310
is our eternal presence
in the universe, all

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.300
these different kinds of things.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.240
So first of all,
where is the mind?

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.200
And a hint is that if
you have a heart surgery,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.819
it's not going to
damage your mind.

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.110
But if you have brain surgery
and something goes wrong,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.100
it's going to damage your mind.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.850
Your mind comes from your brain.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.220
The mind is in the brain.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.000
And we might say, oh, we
have no idea if animals

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.030
are experiencing anything.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.700
But we use their
experience all the time.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.640
For instance, if we want
to know if cosmetics

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.870
are going to sting us, we test
them on the eyes of rabbits

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.320
to see if they sting the rabbit.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.030
So if they sting the
rabbits, the rabbits

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.580
are having exactly
the same experience

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.140
of pain, the sensation of
stinging, as people have.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.300
When dogs are
depressed, or if dogs

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.550
have obsessive-compulsive
disorder,

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.460
they respond to the same
drugs in the same way

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.020
that we give to people--
antidepressant drugs.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.520
Why?

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.560
Because the part of the
brain that gets depressed

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.500
and the chemicals
that create depression

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.300
or obsessive-compulsive
disorders are exactly the same.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.660
They're not experiencing
an analogous problem.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.370
They're having the same
problem in the brain of a dog.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.380
Or even as low as
down below vertebrates

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.160
on the evolutionary timescale,
or before vertebrates,

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.200
something like a
crayfish, you can

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.870
make crayfish develop
anxiety by giving them

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.350
little electrical
shocks and making

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.130
them feel nervous and tense.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.800
And so they retreat
into their burrows.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.340
They stop exploring.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.350
They won't eat.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.990
You give them the same
anti-anxiety drugs

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.760
that work on people,
the crayfish relaxes,

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.880
comes out of its burrow,
and starts exploring again.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.910
So these are ways we
can manipulate minds

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.190
with different kinds
of tests and drugs

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.030
to see if they respond
the same way ours do.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.481
And that's a good way in.

00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:06.000
Now you can say, well,
we can see brains,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.540
but we can't see the mind.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.330
And that, in a sense, is
a fair enough statement.

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.930
I mean, it's true, right?

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.010
But I can't see your mind.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.510
You can't see my mind.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:18.839
It's always true.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.920
But where is our mind from?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.230
Where is the human mind from?

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:27.730
The human mind is from
the minds of non-humans

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.960
that were here before us.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.530
When evolution created--
in a sense-- humanity,

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.370
humanity evolved from something.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.590
We had to use the parts
that were already in stock

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.240
and make a few tweaks.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.470
And the parts that were in stock
are the highly developed brains

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.360
of the other mammals
from which we evolved.

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.770
So if you look at a mouse brain,
and you look at a human brain,

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.940
it's a very similar, very
recognizable kind of thing.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.320
The human brain looks different.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.420
It's got lots of convolutions
in the forebrain.

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.270
That's where a lot
of thinking happens

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.540
in humans-- human thinking.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.940
If you compare our brain
with a chimpanzee brain,

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.720
you see basically
that we are apes,

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.740
so it's not too surprising that
the human brain is basically

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.310
a very big chimpanzee brain.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.790
So it's not logical to think
that the human brain only

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.460
does things that only
humans do and nothing that

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:25.930
happens in any other brain.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.295
It's just completely illogical.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.460
We're all very insecure,
we human beings.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.700
We can soothe our
insecurity with the thought

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:39.980
that at least we have
the biggest brain, right?

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.170
Except, uh-oh, there's
a dolphin brand.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.500
It's not only much bigger.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.050
It has way more
convolutions than ours.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.630
It's doing something
with all of those neurons

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.926
and all of those
networked connections.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.840
We can see the
working of the mind

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.730
in the logic of behaviors
of other animals, the fact

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:11.370
that their responses and
emotions make sense to us.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.810
We don't see-- well, we'll
go through a few, OK.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:22.020
We say these albatrosses here,
they're dancing in courtship.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.280
And why do we say they're
dancing in courtship?

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.680
Because that's a very
recognizable thing.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.320
It happens at the same time
that humans dance in courtship.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.880
It's something that we do,
pre-bonding and pre-mating--

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.200
same with them.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.890
We look at elephants like this.

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.450
Now, elephants don't do
this if they're surrounded

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.250
by all kinds of dangers.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.180
And they don't do this
if they're famished.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.210
They do this if everything
is cool and nice,

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.640
and they're relaxed.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.920
And the parents are still
a little bit on guard

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.070
while they let the babies
lie down and not worry

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.180
about anything.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.770
That totally makes sense
to us, and it's totally

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:01.720
appropriate to the situation.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.710
So we can tell by the logic of
their behavior, something about

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:09.610
what's going on in their minds.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.550
They are protective
and parental,

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.070
like we are protective
and parental,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.500
whether they are humans or
elephants or mammals in water.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:23.710
The differences between us
are mostly the outer contours

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:27.220
and a few internal tweaks.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:33.800
So one analysis is only
humans have human skeletons.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.340
But it's not true that
only humans have skeletons.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.090
And only humans
have human minds,

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.195
but it's not true that
only humans have minds.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.780
When help is needed,
help is provided.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.760
They're not trying
to eat their baby.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.610
They're trying to
help it to its feet.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:53.520
I love this picture.

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.540
This is the cover of
the book, actually.

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.040
That's a newborn elephant that
has never stood up before.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.750
And its mother and two
cousins are helping it

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.630
to its feet for the first time.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.480
When animals are very
young, they're very curious.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.500
They don't know what
things like egrets are.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.170
They check everything
out, because they

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.570
have to learn what's
in their environment.

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:16.920
And many animals have to
learn just about everything.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.760
Baby elephants don't even
know that lions are dangerous.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.770
They have to be taught
by their parents

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:24.830
and by example that lions are
dangerous, that bees can sting

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.654
you, and these kinds of things.

00:08:26.654 --> 00:08:28.945
But when we're young, we do
lots and lots of exploring.

00:08:28.945 --> 00:08:31.250
And as we get a
little older, and we

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.794
know what's going on
in our environment,

00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:37.091
and what we have to do, we tend
to be less playful than when

00:08:37.091 --> 00:08:37.799
we were children.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:39.510
We tend to do less exploring.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.610
You can see that in others.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:44.390
And when something goes
wrong, or something

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.690
might be dangerous, you
see a very different set

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.960
of behaviors.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.900
And you see them
paying attention

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.670
in very different ways.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:54.880
When it's time to
relax and have fun,

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.920
they relax, and they have fun.

00:09:00.556 --> 00:09:02.180
Now, no one would
look at this and say,

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.630
I have no idea if the baby is
frightened out of its mind,

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.740
right?

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:07.740
It's not what you'd say.

00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:09.830
You can see that
they're just having

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.660
a nice time in the water.

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:14.560
And that not all
of their behaviors

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.610
are driven by the need to
survive in the next minute,

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.050
that there are other things
that help us to survive.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.680
A lot of these deep motivations
like love and like bonding,

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.380
these things, we don't just do
it in the minute it's needed.

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.710
We develop relationships
before these things

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:34.020
need to come into play.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.410
So the love and bonding
of family members

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:40.140
is something that provides
ongoing benefits in many ways.

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:41.900
But we don't think,
OK, let's see,

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.130
I'm going to get ongoing
benefits in many ways,

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:47.290
so I better love my
siblings, and my parents,

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:48.300
and my family members.

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.830
That's just not how
our minds are equipped.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:52.960
We just feel these
motivations, and then they

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.370
do what they are supposed to
do, what they're evolved to do.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.560
Albatrosses have these bonds
and maintain these pair bonds

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.636
in ways that are a bit
unusual among birds, actually

00:10:09.636 --> 00:10:11.010
even a bit unusual
among mammals.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:14.110
Because their pair bonds
are very, very long-lasting.

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:17.140
They can live many
decades in the wild.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.720
They mate with the
same mate every year.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.780
And if a mate dies, it usually
takes them two or three

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.280
years to court and re-mate.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.130
So you see the deep maintenance
of these bonds in them In a way

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.150
that I find quite touching
and really quite beautiful.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.370
All right, there are other
things that are unexpected,

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:44.190
I guess.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.960
Only unexpected
because our assumption

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.320
and what we've been
taught is that animals

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.320
have very, very simple
minds, and they're not

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.420
really aware of much.

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.980
And they just do things
without thinking about it,

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:56.450
without feeling about it.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:01.570
But it turns out that if
you broadcast the recorded

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:06.760
conversations of tourists,
farmers who farm away

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.650
from where the elephants live,
and pastoralist herders who

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:14.050
walk around with spears and
get into trouble with elephants

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:18.130
around water holes, and fairly
frequently hurt the elephants,

00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:22.560
that the elephants ignore the
conversations of the tourists.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.270
They ignore the
conversations of the farmers.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.490
And when they hear
the conversations

00:11:27.490 --> 00:11:30.370
of the herders broadcast
out of hidden speakers,

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.630
they react with alarm.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.854
The family bunches
up, and they run away.

00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:35.395
They can actually
tell the difference

00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:37.460
between human languages.

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.950
And they know which ones
are dangerous to them.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.080
They react exactly the
same way to clothes

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:45.490
that are worn by those
three different groups, that

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:47.950
are placed on trails where
elephants can encounter them.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.860
And that's been shown
with experiments.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:56.320
So let's get a little bit
deeper into a question here

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.781
that is fundamental, which
is, can animals think?

00:11:58.781 --> 00:12:01.030
Well, first of all, the
shortest answer is, of course.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.200
Because humans are animals.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.840
And human thinking
is animal thinking.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.010
But another thing is, we
need much better definitions

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:11.340
of these words that
we tend to use.

00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.950
So what do you mean by think
is the first question that you

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:14.450
should ask.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:15.574
What do you mean by grieve?

00:12:15.574 --> 00:12:18.110
What do you mean by empathy,
and all these questions that

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.245
are discussed with
different animals.

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.140
Thinking is the
processing of information

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.510
that's coming in through
the senses in ways

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.990
that help you make decisions.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:36.161
So a jaguar that is
trying to sneak up

00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:41.250
on a tapir or a peccary,
a wild pig, is thinking.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.950
He's making calculations.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:46.800
They know that the
intended prey will run away

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.860
if it detects them, and it
is trying to sneak up on it.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.580
So that's thinking.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:57.140
Somebody who is aiming an
arrow at a target is thinking.

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:01.700
And somebody who is entertaining
a proposal of marriage

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:04.105
should be thinking,
although perhaps not always.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:11.160
Consciousness is another
thing that the definitions

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.650
are all over the map.

00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:15.690
And some people think
that consciousness means

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:17.821
that you can plan years ahead.

00:13:17.821 --> 00:13:19.820
And consciousness means
these complicated things

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.940
that-- I don't really think
that that's what it means.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:29.420
Because if you are
given total anesthesia,

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.910
the difference between
conscious and not conscious

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:33.710
is induced by the anesthesia.

00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:37.760
Consciousness means you're
experiencing sensations.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:40.570
It's the thing that
feels like something.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:42.420
That's what consciousness is.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:47.830
So a motion sensor
senses, but it

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:49.660
doesn't experience sensations.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.000
Dogs playing on the beach
experience sensations.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.910
That's the difference between
an unconscious reaction

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.530
and consciousness.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:01.970
I think consciousness comes
into play in evolution

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:07.280
at the level where animals need
to make decisions about things.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.780
So if you simply cut your leg,
that's just a physical thing.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.010
And lots of
unconscious processes

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:16.610
start happening immediately
and automatically.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.500
The blood starts clotting.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.090
The cells begin to heal the cut.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.209
The immune system kicks
in to prevent infection.

00:14:24.209 --> 00:14:26.250
So those are physical
things if you cut your leg.

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:29.100
But if your leg hurts
when you cut it,

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.630
then you know you're conscious.

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:33.450
So that's just consciousness.

00:14:33.450 --> 00:14:36.100
There are, in a sense--
now this is just something

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:39.920
that I made up to try to
tease out different aspects

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:45.420
of consciousness--
these four interrelated

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.490
processes of consciousness.

00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:50.520
We detect the world
through our senses.

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.580
We get information in.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.760
Then if we think about
that information,

00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.740
if we evaluate that
information, that is thinking.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:01.610
If we just have an emotional
response to the information,

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.620
that's emotion.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:05.570
If it changes our mood
to see something--

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:07.390
we may see something
that frightens us.

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.720
We may see something
that makes us jealous.

00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.390
And then these moods
or these thoughts

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:17.920
give us motivations
and urges to act.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.350
Empathy is often talked
about as something

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.030
that is uniquely human.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:24.780
And when you are trying
to write a book about what

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.490
animals think and feel, you
read a lot about humans.

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.765
And you come across
constant claims

00:15:29.765 --> 00:15:34.120
about what makes us human and
what things are uniquely human.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:38.440
And most of them are wrong.

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.530
One of the things
that supposedly makes

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:43.622
us uniquely human is empathy.

00:15:43.622 --> 00:15:48.890
Well, empathy is the ability
to feel with your companions

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.300
and to match their moods.

00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:54.830
If you get scared, I get scared.

00:15:54.830 --> 00:16:00.300
You feel and look sad,
I get sad or concerned.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:01.370
That's empathy.

00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:04.140
It means your mind
is able to match

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.310
the mood of your companions.

00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:08.630
This is not something
new that just

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:11.480
started when people arrived,
and suddenly, here I

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.840
am, a human being,
suddenly, oh, empathy.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.880
The oldest form of empathy
is something really important

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:20.950
and really basic, which is,
if you're with companions,

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.030
and one of them is suddenly
startled and frightened,

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.650
you cannot wait around saying,
wow, what got into you?

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.470
Why did you just run away?

00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.100
Why is that?

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.150
Because the predator
will nail you.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:34.250
So empathy and
the mind's ability

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.540
to match moods instantly
with companions

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.350
is something very, very old.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.360
And the oldest
kind of empathy is

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:46.250
called contagious fear
or fear contagion.

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:50.006
There are different kinds
of empathetic responses.

00:16:50.006 --> 00:16:51.630
Contagious yawning
is the weirdest one,

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.180
because I don't even
know what yawning is.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:54.840
I don't think anybody even
knows what yawning is.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.880
And yet, it's contagious.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.630
It's very strange.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.880
And I think you can tease out
different kinds of empathy

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.410
as well.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:07.540
So there's basic empathy--
feeling with another.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.920
You match moods.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.040
A little bit away from that,
and a little distant from that

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.319
is what I call sympathy.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.630
You say, oh, my
grandmother died.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:18.880
I don't know your grandmother.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.540
It doesn't make me sad to
know your grandmother died.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.619
But it makes me a little sad to
know that that makes you sad.

00:17:24.619 --> 00:17:27.140
So that's a kind of
empathy I call sympathy.

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.590
And then if you see
something happening,

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:33.360
and you are moved to
act, I call that kind

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.460
of empathy compassion.

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:38.760
It's like sympathy
and the urge to help.

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.790
And the motivation to
help and do something

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:42.430
is what I call compassion.

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.160
So you see somebody
who's homeless,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.930
and you want to buy
them a sandwich.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:49.050
Or you want to sign a
petition to save the whales,

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.565
or anything like that,
where your mood is affected,

00:17:52.565 --> 00:17:54.950
and you are urged to act.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:57.200
That I call compassion.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.270
Human empathy is far,
far from perfect.

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.940
This thing, we like
to exalt ourselves

00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:03.840
and say, oh, we're
the most empathetic.

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.530
Well, maybe and maybe
not all the time.

00:18:07.530 --> 00:18:10.620
So on the left there is a
bunch of dogs bundled up

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:15.320
in a cage for a dog-eating
festival in China recently.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:17.940
And on the right-- I'm not sure
how well you can see that--

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:21.440
but that is a man in
a cage in Indonesia.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.140
He is a Burmese man.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:26.600
He is a slave.

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:29.010
This was a picture
taken this past March

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:34.610
when hundreds of Burmese
slaves were found being forced

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:37.050
to work on Thai fishing boats.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.840
Buy shrimp that has been
wild-caught in Thailand,

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:44.560
chances are pretty good
that slaves have caught it,

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:50.580
because human empathy is not
really so great all the time.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.150
A thing that I
find interesting is

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:56.780
that people who know essentially
nothing about the science

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.830
of animal behavior
know one thing,

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:03.330
and that is, you should
never use anthropomorphism.

00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:06.480
Everybody knows this tricky
word, anthropomorphism,

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.410
which is projecting human
thoughts and emotions.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:14.310
In the behavioral sciences,
doing such a thing,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:16.700
and attributing human thoughts
and emotions to animals,

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:20.210
has been for a few decades,
a total career killer.

00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.760
It's absolutely not
allowed in academia.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.190
And journalists write
about this all the time.

00:19:26.190 --> 00:19:28.890
And journalists try to be
very professional by saying,

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:33.580
oh, we can't
anthropomorphize the animals.

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.895
But since their minds
and their imperatives

00:19:35.895 --> 00:19:41.400
are very similar to ours because
we came from what they have,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:45.350
I think it's actually a
very helpful first step.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.810
And then if you know a little
bit something about animals,

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:50.300
you're not likely to
make many mistakes.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.760
For instance,
these two elephants

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:52.750
are consorting, right?

00:19:52.750 --> 00:19:56.290
That's a male on the right
and a female on the left.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.980
Actually, the female had
a baby just as the book

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.430
was going to the publisher.

00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:06.190
And if you saw them, and
you were really projecting,

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:07.850
you might say, oh, look at them.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.010
They're in love.

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.130
But if you talk to any
elephant researcher,

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:13.440
it's well-known that
elephants actually

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.440
don't have romantic love.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:21.500
They do find sex very exciting,
and that is very obvious.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.110
This one in the front has
just made it and run back

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:25.440
to her family.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.250
Her facial glands-- they
have glands on their faces,

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:30.140
kind of like we have
glands in our armpits.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.681
And when they get very emotional
about anything, when they're

00:20:32.681 --> 00:20:34.750
happy or frightened, at
a heightened emotion,

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:35.665
those glands stream.

00:20:35.665 --> 00:20:37.510
So she's just made it.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:39.050
Her family is reassuring her.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.341
And they're sniffing her,
and they're checking her out.

00:20:41.341 --> 00:20:43.550
But there's no pair bond
between her and the male.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.830
The male provides
no parental care.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:48.830
So it is obvious that they
do find sex thrilling,

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.760
but sex for them is not always
coupled with romantic love.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:55.100
I don't know if that sounds
familiar to any of you,

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:56.940
but I'm not going to ask, OK?

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.900
So the main thing that
evolution shows is that life

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.480
is on one continuum.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.810
There are no sharp breaks.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:09.310
Everything that
we see in people,

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.810
we see the beginnings
of in other animals.

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:13.600
Some things that we
see in people, we

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.410
see other animals that have
it far, far better developed.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.380
Many other animals have
superhuman response times,

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:23.340
superhuman strength,
superhuman homing abilities,

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:25.270
things like that that
we just don't have.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.400
And we have some things
that they don't have.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.800
But it's all on a continuum.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:36.320
All the way back to
worms, the chemicals

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.700
that worms make that
create mood and motivation

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.700
are some of the same
chemicals that create mood

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.850
and motivation in human brains.

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.620
Even plants make some
of those chemicals.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.180
And it's unclear whether
any plants actually

00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:55.460
have any sensations at all.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:58.440
They don't have a nervous
system like animals do,

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.330
so there's some
speculation on that.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:04.180
And many people say no, and
some people say, yes, probably.

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:08.630
But especially among animals,
there are no sharp breaks.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:16.300
So we recognize when an animal
looks hungry or thirsty,

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.640
we say, oh, it's hungry
and thirsty or it's tired.

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.910
And then when they're
happy, we say, oh, we

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:23.090
have no way of knowing.

00:22:23.090 --> 00:22:24.910
This is the science
of animal behavior.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:27.800
And actually, that is
just not scientific.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.310
It's really a bias.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:35.380
So denying that they have
thoughts and feelings

00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:40.800
helps us to retell our
own favorite story.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.170
What is our favorite
story, do you think?

00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.230
Who wants to take
a guess at this?

00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.780
Yes.

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:50.060
AUDIENCE: Animals are
here for us to use.

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:52.060
CARL SAFINA: That's one
of our main stories.

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:55.180
It's not our favorite story
that I was thinking of.

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.996
AUDIENCE: We're the endpoint
and the goal of evolution.

00:22:57.996 --> 00:22:59.870
CARL SAFINA: We're the
endpoint of evolution,

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.120
the goal of evolution.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:05.400
And we are absolutely special
and absolutely different

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.954
and better than everything else.

00:23:06.954 --> 00:23:08.620
And part of the reason
we tell ourselves

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:11.830
that story is so we can think
that all animals are here

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.000
for us to use, which
makes it easier

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.260
to make decisions about what
we're going to do to them.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.480
So those two things combined,
I think, help reinforce us.

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.820
It just makes it easier
for us to continue to think

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.320
and believe those things.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:29.310
What about love?

00:23:29.310 --> 00:23:31.980
Do animals feel love?

00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.040
This is a baby humpback
whale, a nursing age humpback

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.700
whale that washed up in East
Hampton a couple of summers

00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:39.900
ago.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.210
And the night that
that whale washed up,

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.020
the lighthouse
keeper at Montauk,

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:47.380
15 miles away,
said that she heard

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.600
incredibly mournful
sounding whale sounds coming

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.090
from the ocean all night.

00:23:54.090 --> 00:23:56.664
And she said, nobody would
believe me if I told you that.

00:23:56.664 --> 00:23:58.330
But I mean, she is
the lighthouse keeper

00:23:58.330 --> 00:23:59.600
at Montauk Point.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.050
So I do believe her.

00:24:02.050 --> 00:24:04.240
It sounded like there
was a whale out there

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.420
looking for its lost baby.

00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.120
So what do we mean
by this word love?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:13.250
Here's another definitional
problem for us, right?

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:19.050
Many of us would say
that we love our parents.

00:24:19.050 --> 00:24:22.600
We would say that we
love our children.

00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.680
We also say we love that movie.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.000
We love ice cream.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.920
We love having a glass
of wine before bed.

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.260
Some people love fighting.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:35.380
So if we use that
word, that word that's

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.960
so important, if we
use that word to cover

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.400
all kinds of things that we
like-- I love ice cream-- then

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:45.530
it is clear and inescapable
that animals love.

00:24:45.530 --> 00:24:48.800
Animals that care for one
another, your pets that

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.610
have a relationship with you
and seek contact and comfort

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.500
from you, that that is love.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.650
It may not be exactly
the same kind of love

00:24:58.650 --> 00:25:01.160
that you feel when
you talk about how

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:07.240
you love your spouse, or
your lover, or your children.

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.340
But the way you love
your spouse is not

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:13.070
the same exact way that your
spouse loves you, right?

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:16.270
So love is not all one thing.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:20.730
And I think we can safely
say that animals do often--

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:22.910
those animals that
really experience

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:27.320
these social bonds and these
protective bonds-- experience

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.020
love.

00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:32.770
Now, this guy here, that
elephant on the right, his name

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:34.790
is Philo.

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:40.030
And he's a 15-year-old
juvenile male in Kenya.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.570
And that's the last
photograph taken of him,

00:25:42.570 --> 00:25:44.940
because four days
later, that was him

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:48.900
on the lower right with a
bullet hole in his brain.

00:25:54.090 --> 00:26:00.120
Elephants are maybe the most
famous animals with regard

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:02.780
to their responsive grief.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:07.130
When an elephant goes down,
the family always rushes to it

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.770
and tries to lift it and aid it.

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:13.690
And if an elephant
dies, family and friends

00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:18.180
hang around, often for days,
and will revisit the bones,

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.760
often for years.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.240
And when they revisit
the bones, they usually

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.580
touch the parts that
they knew best in life--

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:28.860
the tusks, if there are
any tusks left, the teeth.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.490
Because when elephants greet,
they usually greet in a trunk

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:32.930
to mouth greeting.

00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:35.510
It's kind of a combination
handshake, hug, and kiss

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.960
that they do with their trunk.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.130
Grief is something that
I've noticed and read about,

00:26:42.130 --> 00:26:44.440
not only in elephants,
where it's really

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:50.110
pretty well-known and
well-documented, but in wolves.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:55.440
A researcher told me
about a female wolf

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.710
whose mate had died.

00:26:57.710 --> 00:27:01.420
And she had pups that
were less than a year old.

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:03.700
And she immediately left.

00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:05.260
She left her pups.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:06.490
It was winter.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:10.520
She went on a two-week trip
on the highest, bleakest parts

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.310
of Yellowstone
National Park, where

00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:13.610
there were no tracks of prey.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:15.460
There was nothing
she was doing there.

00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:18.650
She was just wandering,
kind of aimlessly.

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:20.780
And two weeks later,
she came back,

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.220
and she rejoined those pups.

00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:27.870
This sounds silly, but it
was very interesting to me.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.972
I had a pair of ducks, and
these ducks were inseparable.

00:27:31.972 --> 00:27:33.430
We had two ducks
and four chickens.

00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:34.840
They were inseparable.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.460
And the drake died.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:40.660
And the female spent weeks
wandering around the yard,

00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:42.259
quacking, and
calling, and looking,

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:43.300
and calling, and looking.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.130
And you could
really see that she

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.690
was taking a lot of time
out of her normal routine.

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.264
It wasn't her normal
routine at all.

00:27:49.264 --> 00:27:50.680
She wasn't eating
in the same way.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.570
She wasn't going
to the same spots

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.260
and resting in the same way.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.350
And a woman named
Barbara J. King,

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.260
who wrote a book
on grief, provided

00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.450
I think a very helpful
definition of that word, which

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:06.470
is that grief happens
when a companion is lost,

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:10.510
and the individuals who have
lost the companion change

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.810
their routine.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:12.800
They go off their feed.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.700
They look around.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:16.560
They're trying to find the
companion, that that's grief.

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.980
And that's pretty
much what we do.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.790
And our grief takes
different forms also.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:23.600
For some of us, we might
miss a day or two of work,

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:25.560
and then we're
kind of back to it.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.940
Go to the wake and come back.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.710
And others of us,
our entire lives

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:32.190
are upended and never
really the same.

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.110
It's similar to other families
of animals that I've seen,

00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:38.230
families of wolves, and
families of elephants,

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:43.460
where if something happens
to the adults, they get shot.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.150
They die really prematurely.

00:28:46.150 --> 00:28:50.790
The whole trajectory of the
family is changed forever.

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:52.710
We don't really tend
to know these things

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:56.590
because watching animals and
knowing them is very, very new.

00:28:56.590 --> 00:29:00.600
The first people who ever
systematically watched

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:04.910
wild animal behavior are
still alive-- Jane Goodall,

00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:07.230
and Cynthia Moss, and
one or two other people

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:12.080
who've been doing that for
about 40 years, since the 1960s.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.730
That's as far back as we
go to understand anything

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.540
about the family
lives of individuals.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:19.800
And they can tell
you, I've known

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.480
that elephant for 40 years.

00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:23.010
I knew who her mother was.

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:24.709
I know what happened
to her sisters,

00:29:24.709 --> 00:29:26.500
I know what she did
during the last drought

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:28.980
to keep the family alive.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.890
It's really incredible,
but it's not

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.230
something that has
seeped deep down

00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:35.484
into general human knowledge.

00:29:35.484 --> 00:29:36.650
All right, this I mentioned.

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:45.685
There's a lot of
grief in the world

00:29:45.685 --> 00:29:48.060
in and around
elephants nowadays.

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:50.090
That woman is Daphne
Sheldrick, and she

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:55.680
runs the very famous elephant
orphanage in Nairobi, Kenya.

00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.601
Kenya is only one
country in Africa,

00:29:57.601 --> 00:29:58.850
and that's only one orphanage.

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:03.650
And they're constantly
besieged right now

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:09.100
by orphans because there's
this war against elephants,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:10.290
really, going on.

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:13.680
I mean, it's basically an
extermination campaign going on

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:18.430
because of how out
of control the ivory

00:30:18.430 --> 00:30:21.360
market has gotten again.

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:26.230
But she will tell you, as she
told me, that an elephant can

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.856
actually die of grief.

00:30:27.856 --> 00:30:29.230
And many of these
young elephants

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:34.560
who've watched their families
in the turmoil of getting

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.885
demolished, come in
very, very traumatized

00:30:37.885 --> 00:30:40.030
and take many months
to settle down,

00:30:40.030 --> 00:30:43.150
and then years to try
to repatriate them

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.730
in these not very natural
artificial families

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:51.810
that they are creating
back in the wild.

00:30:51.810 --> 00:30:54.730
I had the extreme
good fortune of being

00:30:54.730 --> 00:30:57.610
allowed to go out with them
on these walks every day.

00:30:57.610 --> 00:31:00.700
They take these little
orphan baby elephants,

00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:02.450
let them out of their
pens in the morning.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:04.495
They know the keepers very well.

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:07.290
They bond with each other and
with the keepers, and they

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:07.970
walk around.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:10.410
And in a few minutes,
you're in the bush.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.270
You can't see them
most of the time.

00:31:12.270 --> 00:31:13.650
You can kind of hear them.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.980
If the keeper wants them
to go somewhere else,

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:19.540
we're going to go down this
hill now, they just call.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.650
All the babies come
out of the bush.

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.280
They follow them down.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:30.490
And it's really moving to
see and feel the capacity

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:32.880
that these creatures have.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.380
And just because we're
just discovering it,

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.850
doesn't at all mean it's new.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:37.720
It's not at all new.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.590
It's many, many
millions of years old.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.170
And it's the lives
that they have

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:42.840
and the vivid lives
that they lead.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:52.550
And as I mentioned, nowadays,
all these elephants literally

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:54.280
have a price on their head.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:57.360
It's very, very remarkable
that this guy-- his name

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.315
is Tim-- that he is still alive.

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.840
Around Roman times,
when Europeans first

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.520
took an interest
in ivory, elephants

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.385
lived everywhere from
the Mediterranean

00:32:13.385 --> 00:32:15.010
to the bottom of the
Cape of Good Hope,

00:32:15.010 --> 00:32:19.100
except for the bleakest
parts of the Sahara Desert.

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:23.450
The African elephant
covered all of Africa.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:30.790
And you can see how its
range has shrunken since 1980

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:35.200
and is just fracturing
into splinters now.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:38.120
That is the geography
of an animal

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:40.325
that we are driving
to total extinction.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.530
In another part of my
travels for the book,

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:53.910
I went to Yellowstone
Park to look at wolves.

00:32:53.910 --> 00:32:56.850
Wolves are really, really
incredible animals.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.600
They're very, very much like us.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.230
They live in family groups
with a breeding pair

00:33:01.230 --> 00:33:04.140
and the youngsters of
several different ages,

00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:05.590
usually one to three years old.

00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:07.270
And then after
that, the youngsters

00:33:07.270 --> 00:33:12.460
leave and try to find and
establish their own packs.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.780
These two adults
from one of the main

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.430
packs-- this one was a
really, really famous wolf.

00:33:18.430 --> 00:33:21.400
Lots and lots of people watched
her and photographed her.

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.630
And she was very well-known.

00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:29.060
They left the park and were
almost immediately shot.

00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.040
And their whole family
kind of fell apart.

00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.310
The alpha male was
left with no mate.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:38.750
That guy on the top
right was his brother.

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.150
Basically, his
hunting companions

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.650
and the ones who held down
the territory were gone.

00:33:43.650 --> 00:33:46.310
He had no mate.

00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:50.030
Two new males came in.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.280
He lost his family, basically.

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:57.330
And then this daughter, who
was the most precocious one

00:33:57.330 --> 00:34:00.400
in the pack, got ganged
up on by these two

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.070
sisters, who wanted to be the
mates of the two new males.

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:09.070
And they forcibly ejected
her from her own family

00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:12.469
permanently and wouldn't
let her back in.

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.350
Now, I knew that
wolves live in packs.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.820
And I knew that the packs
were families-- that I knew.

00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:19.300
And I knew that, in that
way, they were a lot like us.

00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:23.440
But what I had no idea
about was the turmoil

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.739
that would happen in the
family when something happened

00:34:25.739 --> 00:34:31.830
to the parents-- the coalitions,
the vendettas, the politics.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:33.759
It was really all too human.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:44.159
So that one that got run out,
she had to eventually leave

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.460
the park, and she got shot.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:50.739
And this guy, who
was the alpha male,

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:53.440
the breeding male
that lost everything--

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:57.340
he lost his family, he lost his
mate, he lost his territory,

00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:02.845
and it was winter, and he was
not young-- he, incredibly

00:35:02.845 --> 00:35:05.830
enough, against all
odds, he is still alive.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:14.340
That's him sitting on a rock.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.430
He had just been calling
to another female

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.270
that he was trying to
draw out of another pack

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.980
to try to take her as his
mate and start a new pack.

00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.492
So anyway, that was him when I
was there, and this is him now.

00:35:28.492 --> 00:35:29.950
And he's still
alive, which I think

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:31.866
is quite remark-- it
makes me feel really good

00:35:31.866 --> 00:35:33.030
that he survived.

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:34.170
We like survival stories.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.130
What do you think that is?

00:35:41.112 --> 00:35:42.610
AUDIENCE: A dog?

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.170
CARL SAFINA: You
think it's a dog.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:46.300
Who thinks it's a dog?

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.330
Who thinks it's a wolf?

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:48.960
All right some
dogs, some wolves.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:49.920
OK.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:56.280
Well, it's a full-blooded wolf.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:36:00.290
And an interesting
thing about dogs

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.980
is that before people
understood evolution,

00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.330
but they started applying
Latin names to animals,

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:18.040
the dogs were called Canis
familiaris, the familiar canid.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.900
And wolves were Canis lupus.

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:23.570
But now we know enough
about their genetics

00:36:23.570 --> 00:36:30.160
to realize that dogs are
so minutely differentiated

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.660
from their wolf ancestors,
that their Latin name

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.890
got changed back to wolf.

00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:39.130
So the dog's Latin name is
now Canis lupus-- wolf--

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:40.360
familiaris.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:42.760
So it's a wolf,
but it's our wolf.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.975
Domestication doesn't mean a
tame, wild animal in captivity.

00:36:49.975 --> 00:36:54.130
It means an animal or a
plant genetically changed

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.600
from its wild type.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.840
Almost all animals
that are domesticated

00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:02.600
are domesticated
for tameness first.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:06.530
And it turns out, weirdly,
that the same genes that

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.835
make animals tame
and tractable also

00:37:09.835 --> 00:37:14.020
create certain similar
physical changes.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:18.150
They create floppy ears,
blotchy-colored coats,

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.830
coats of different
textures, curled

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.320
tails, passive personalities.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:28.010
The same genes, not a
suite of different genes.

00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.430
So dogs show a lot of that.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:32.640
Farm animals show a lot of that.

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.770
Who else shows some of that?

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:37.079
AUDIENCE: Foxes.

00:37:37.079 --> 00:37:37.870
CARL SAFINA: Foxes.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:38.545
OK.

00:37:38.545 --> 00:37:42.220
Well, that gets to
an interesting story,

00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:44.600
which is that most
of this stuff that's

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.050
known about what's called
domestication syndrome

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:50.260
is known because of a
40-year experiment with foxes

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.320
done in Russia, where
they selected them only

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.700
for tameness.

00:37:55.700 --> 00:38:00.160
The ones that were tame and
friendly, they let breed.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:05.390
And the ones that weren't,
they basically killed.

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:08.240
After a few generations,
they got tame foxes

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.110
that wag their tails,
seek their humans,

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:15.435
and have floppy ears, blotchy
coats, and curly tails.

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:20.650
These are hand raised wolves.

00:38:20.650 --> 00:38:23.440
They act remarkably like dogs.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:30.110
They have not been bred for
10,000 years around people.

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:33.950
These are our wolves at
home, our two wolves.

00:38:33.950 --> 00:38:36.820
They're not fighting,
they're playing.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.700
They're good friends.

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.020
Other aspects of domestication
include a lot of sex

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.120
outside the breeding
season that does not

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:49.580
result in offspring, passive
behavior, conformity,

00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:52.540
reduced brain size, and neoteny.

00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:57.710
Neoteny means you carry juvenile
traits way into maturity,

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.580
right?

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.380
That's what it means.

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.290
So, can anybody think
of any other animal

00:39:02.290 --> 00:39:04.292
that does all of this?

00:39:04.292 --> 00:39:05.000
AUDIENCE: Humans?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.890
CARL SAFINA: Humans.

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:08.820
Right, humans.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:16.270
Now, why would humans
have those traits?

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:20.340
If you look at the bottom
thing there, farm animals,

00:39:20.340 --> 00:39:23.500
we brought animals onto farms
to live a passive, settled

00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:27.350
crowded life, and be able to
conform and get used to it

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:28.910
and do OK there.

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:31.530
And we inadvertently had to
do exactly the same thing

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:32.270
to ourselves.

00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.820
So in the process of
domesticating animals,

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:40.080
we slightly, at least,
domesticated ourselves.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:44.280
We are also like
big juveniles, many

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:48.880
of us, as you can clearly
see by all the themed

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.357
sections of this building.

00:39:51.357 --> 00:39:54.279
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:57.210 --> 00:39:59.140
All right.

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.560
In the interest of time,
and because we stopped late,

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.460
I think I'm going to stop there.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:04.710
Because I really want to
have some discussion and some

00:40:04.710 --> 00:40:06.014
questions.

00:40:06.014 --> 00:40:07.430
So I think I said
we stopped late.

00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:08.810
We started late.

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:10.955
So I'm going to just
stop right there.

00:40:10.955 --> 00:40:14.840
And anybody have any
questions about animals?

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.810
Animal thinking,
animal emotions,

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:18.310
objections to anything I said?

00:40:18.310 --> 00:40:19.970
We can just take it all on.

00:40:19.970 --> 00:40:21.442
Yes?

00:40:21.442 --> 00:40:25.816
AUDIENCE: I wanted to know your
opinion about studies where

00:40:25.816 --> 00:40:28.732
scientists assess
animal intelligence

00:40:28.732 --> 00:40:30.676
and give equivalents,
like, oh, a dog's

00:40:30.676 --> 00:40:32.944
equivalent to a three-year-old,
like an octopus is

00:40:32.944 --> 00:40:34.277
equivalent to an eight-year-old.

00:40:34.277 --> 00:40:35.540
What's your opinion on that?

00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:37.498
CARL SAFINA: Yeah, what's
my opinion of studies

00:40:37.498 --> 00:40:39.130
that equate the
intelligence of animals

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:42.606
with humans at certain ages.

00:40:42.606 --> 00:40:44.105
Well, in a way,
they're interesting.

00:40:44.105 --> 00:40:47.070
And in a way, they're
the wrong question.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:51.660
And I came to see that it's
the wrong question because I

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.300
asked Cynthia Moss, who
has been studying elephants

00:40:54.300 --> 00:40:56.260
for 40 years.

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.190
This, I thought, was
the big question.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:03.480
I said, what has watching
elephants for 40 years taught

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:05.870
you about human nature?

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.410
And I thought that was
a really deep question,

00:41:08.410 --> 00:41:11.650
and it was going to be so
interesting to talk about.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:15.340
And she said, I'm not
really interested in that.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.390
I'm interested in elephants.

00:41:17.390 --> 00:41:19.160
I want to learn about elephants.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:24.810
Comparing an elephant or a
raven's performance on a puzzle

00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:29.260
to a human toddler doesn't
interest me at all.

00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:31.980
And I was very
taken aback by that.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:35.000
I also felt kind of stupid
for asking that question,

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.850
considering her response.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.300
And I thought about that.

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:43.870
It took me a few days for me to
really do a full mental reset

00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:45.080
on that question.

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:47.660
The problem with
comparing a raven

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.330
to a toddler or
the communication

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:56.090
ability of a chimpanzee
to a small child

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:59.560
is not that it
tells you nothing,

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.700
but that it doesn't
ask the question that

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:03.570
lets you get the full answer.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.650
It's always about us.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:09.880
Tell me, what could you learn
about the ability of a raven

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.830
to solve a puzzle by
comparing it with a child?

00:42:12.830 --> 00:42:15.360
You learn, again,
that humans are better

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:18.700
at solving puzzles than ravens.

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:21.450
But you don't really
learn a lot about what

00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:25.625
ravens do in their
complicated, vivid lives

00:42:25.625 --> 00:42:29.820
that they lead among their
friends and their rivals

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:33.820
in familiar territories,
how they seek status, how

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.860
their status gets deposed over
the course of their life, how

00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.090
their life follows
the arc of a career.

00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:40.690
You don't learn any
of that about them

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:43.140
by comparing them
to a three-year-old.

00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.420
So the whole question
of what intelligence

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:49.380
is, is a very
fraught definitional

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:52.140
question anyway,
because there are just

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:53.690
different kinds of capacities.

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:56.290
And usually with
humans, we think

00:42:56.290 --> 00:43:00.730
of intelligence, more
or less, as the ability

00:43:00.730 --> 00:43:04.780
to solve novel problems.

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.730
And many humans have
a pretty good ability

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.310
to solve novel problems.

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:14.070
But who was more intelligent,
Henry Ford or Pablo Picasso?

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:17.835
Does intelligence mean
anything at most levels

00:43:17.835 --> 00:43:20.240
of performance and existence?

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.610
And many animals do things
that we can't do at all.

00:43:23.610 --> 00:43:26.000
But if we can do anything,
we give ourselves

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.200
an enormous amount of credit.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:30.317
Like we have the
ability to learn music,

00:43:30.317 --> 00:43:32.150
for instance, just to
think of one thing off

00:43:32.150 --> 00:43:33.160
the top of my head.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.560
We can learn music, and we can
learn how to play instruments

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.610
that other people have invented
for us to play and make music.

00:43:39.610 --> 00:43:41.050
We just have a musical ability.

00:43:41.050 --> 00:43:43.830
We don't have such a
great homing ability.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.220
We can't home for
thousands of miles

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:49.770
across open ocean just
based on our perception

00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.070
of the Earth's magnetic
field, and things like that.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:56.050
So fish and birds that can do
that, we just discount that.

00:43:56.050 --> 00:43:59.250
We don't say, oh, my god,
they're brilliant at this.

00:43:59.250 --> 00:44:01.140
They are geniuses
compared to us.

00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:01.990
We never say that.

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.512
We just say, oh, who cares?

00:44:04.512 --> 00:44:06.500
Well, we can play
an instrument, or we

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.170
can solve a problem,
or something like that.

00:44:09.170 --> 00:44:12.190
There have been experiments
done with ravens,

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:15.891
with certain kinds of puzzles,
where the ravens can figure it

00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:16.390
out.

00:44:16.390 --> 00:44:20.050
And dogs and toddlers are left,
in the words of one researcher,

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.020
"not even realizing there
was a puzzle to solve."

00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:27.870
So to me, it just isn't
really all about us,

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:29.054
and it's not all about now.

00:44:29.054 --> 00:44:30.720
And we have to get
outside of ourselves.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.840
Every time, we're always
looking at the world

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:34.570
through our eyes,
which of course is

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.770
the normal starting place.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:38.720
But when you look
from the inside out,

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.410
you only can see an
inside out world.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:44.090
When you can get
outside yourself,

00:44:44.090 --> 00:44:46.935
like the famous iconic
first photograph

00:44:46.935 --> 00:44:52.420
of Earth from space orbit, you
get a different perspective.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:55.560
And what I've really tried to
do in my work, in my thinking,

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:59.000
and this book is get
outside of ourselves

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.710
and look at humans
in perspective,

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:06.110
in the whole sweep of life, and
the history of life on Earth,

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:08.920
and the whole family of living
things that are here with us.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:10.410
Because there's a lot at stake.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:14.510
And not only is there
a need, I think,

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:18.610
to show what is at
stake as we take

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:20.430
more and more from
the rest of the world,

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:25.140
but I wanted to show
also who is at stake.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:26.770
Yes.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.391
AUDIENCE: Do you think animals,
like a dog sitting next

00:45:29.391 --> 00:45:34.990
to a windowsill, can daydream
and have thoughts unassociated

00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:37.030
to what they see?

00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:38.740
CARL SAFINA: Do I
think animals have

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:41.520
daydreams and thoughts
unassociated from what

00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.520
they're actually seeing?

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:46.360
Yeah, sometimes they do.

00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:48.540
And I see that in my own dogs.

00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:50.680
Sometimes my dogs
might be lying around.

00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:52.802
And then they'll
suddenly get up,

00:45:52.802 --> 00:45:54.760
and they'll run outside
to go and check and see

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:56.360
if there are any squirrels
at the bird feeder.

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.026
Because they love
chasing swirls around.

00:45:58.026 --> 00:45:59.620
So things occur to them.

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:01.615
Sometimes they get up
and they come over.

00:46:01.615 --> 00:46:06.150
If I'm writing, and the
dog is napping nicely,

00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:08.587
they'll sometimes wake up,
especially one of them.

00:46:08.587 --> 00:46:10.420
She'll wake up, she'll
come, and she'll just

00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:11.890
start hitting me with her paw.

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.554
And the door is open.

00:46:13.554 --> 00:46:14.470
So what does she want?

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:17.570
She's just thought that she
wants me to go out with her.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.070
She wants to maybe go for a run.

00:46:19.070 --> 00:46:23.420
She's trying to get me to engage
with her, because these things

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.846
cross her mind.

00:46:24.846 --> 00:46:27.310
If she could never think
about going for a run

00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.210
unless we were
going for a run, she

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:31.390
wouldn't be coming and
bothering me to go for a run.

00:46:35.364 --> 00:46:37.030
Well, yeah, we'll
just leave it at that.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:38.990
I can tell you other stories,
but it's more or less

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.580
the same point.

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:40.010
Yes.

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:41.760
AUDIENCE: So outside
of humans as animals,

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.850
did you observe that some
of these other animals,

00:46:43.850 --> 00:46:46.490
the same species, would develop
different cultures depending

00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:48.130
on where they were?

00:46:48.130 --> 00:46:50.570
CARL SAFINA: Some animals do
develop different cultures

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:52.400
depending on where they were.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.906
A couple of the most notable are
killer whales and chimpanzees.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.990
Chimpanzees make simple tools.

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:07.920
But the tools they
make are different

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.290
in different populations
of chimpanzees.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:14.455
So there are some chimpanzees
that fish for termites

00:47:14.455 --> 00:47:16.650
by using twigs and
pieces of grass.

00:47:16.650 --> 00:47:18.940
They stick it in
the termite hole,

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.134
and the termites bite it
to try to defend the hole.

00:47:21.134 --> 00:47:22.800
And then they pull
it out, and then they

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:24.710
eat the termites, right?

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.610
Some of the chimpanzees
that do that live in

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:31.120
places where there are really
hard nuts, and there are rocks.

00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:34.310
But they have never
figured out that you

00:47:34.310 --> 00:47:36.030
can use rocks to crack nuts.

00:47:36.030 --> 00:47:38.700
But there are other
chimpanzees that

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.090
use rocks to crack
nuts all the time

00:47:41.090 --> 00:47:43.110
and actually use
rocks on another rock

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.510
like an anvil to crack nuts.

00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:48.550
Those ones that have figured
that out have an advantage.

00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.060
They get more calories because
they have a whole other food

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:52.640
source that's available to them.

00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:54.640
So they learn it
from one another.

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:57.010
That's the definition
of culture.

00:47:57.010 --> 00:47:58.360
They're not born that way.

00:47:58.360 --> 00:47:59.840
They learn from one another.

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:01.920
But the other population
doesn't have it yet.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.455
So when you think
about humans, you

00:48:04.455 --> 00:48:08.580
have to try to think of before
globalization of any kind,

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:12.620
before ships got
all around anyplace.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.850
Human cultures were often
very, very different

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:15.640
from one another.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.639
The technologies were
often very, very different

00:48:17.639 --> 00:48:18.420
from one another.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.400
So you see the inkling
of that in chimpanzees

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:24.470
with simple tools.

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:27.690
And those chimps have
stone and anvils.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.820
And some of them have
wooden clubs and anvils.

00:48:30.820 --> 00:48:36.170
That's not terribly dissimilar
to the most advanced tools

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:41.810
that many people had until
recently, not that long ago,

00:48:41.810 --> 00:48:44.237
where there are many cultures
where the most advanced tool

00:48:44.237 --> 00:48:45.070
was a bow and arrow.

00:48:45.070 --> 00:48:46.527
They had no machine of any kind.

00:48:46.527 --> 00:48:48.360
They had nothing that
had an internal moving

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.040
part of any kind.

00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:53.730
They mostly had digging
sticks, and they had pounders,

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:56.910
and they had spears,
and bows, and arrows.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.790
So anyway, that's chimpanzees.

00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:01.510
And with killer whales,
the cultural differences

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:04.430
are strange.

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:08.670
One is they have vocal
cultural differences.

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:12.120
But the strange part is
that different groups have

00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:15.870
some of the same calls, some
calls specific to their group

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:17.020
only.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.270
Other groups they
socialize with do not

00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:22.730
pick up on the calls
of that other group.

00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:24.939
It helps to define
which group is which.

00:49:24.939 --> 00:49:26.980
And even though they
mingle, and even though they

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.870
hear each other, they
don't copy all of those

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.525
sounds that clearly
those ones in the groups

00:49:32.525 --> 00:49:35.160
learn from the other ones.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:40.260
And some of the groups mingle.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:45.230
And some of the groups get close
to each other and never meet.

00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:48.450
and never mingle,
like ethnic groups

00:49:48.450 --> 00:49:51.910
that don't like each
other for some reason.

00:49:51.910 --> 00:49:55.110
And it's not explained,
but it's a weird thing.

00:49:55.110 --> 00:49:58.090
And the closest thing to
what those killer whales do

00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:02.170
is humans, where there
are different tribes that

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:04.330
won't mix even though
we're all exactly

00:50:04.330 --> 00:50:07.730
the same, except for
small cultural or language

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:08.230
differences.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:10.144
It's mostly where you're
born is what it is.

00:50:10.144 --> 00:50:11.560
And with those
killer whales, it's

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.400
mostly where they're born,
what pod they're born into.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.310
And they carry that identity,
and they won't mix with others.

00:50:18.310 --> 00:50:20.602
And it's very odd.

00:50:20.602 --> 00:50:21.435
Any other questions?

00:50:21.435 --> 00:50:21.934
Richard.

00:50:21.934 --> 00:50:22.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:27.197
By the way, that's similar
to certain jungle birds.

00:50:27.197 --> 00:50:29.430
And they'll go into
these big, mixed flocks.

00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:32.790
And they will pay
attention to warning cries

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:35.190
of predators from another
species or another group.

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:37.110
And but then they will
segregate out again,

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:38.365
so it's very similar.

00:50:38.365 --> 00:50:39.990
The question I want
to ask you is this.

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.990
You say you kept wolves.

00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:43.590
I didn't know that
you kept wolves.

00:50:43.590 --> 00:50:44.340
CARL SAFINA: What?

00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:44.980
AUDIENCE: Wolves.

00:50:44.980 --> 00:50:46.688
CARL SAFINA: I didn't
keep wolves myself.

00:50:46.688 --> 00:50:47.775
No, no, I have dogs.

00:50:47.775 --> 00:50:48.850
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:50:48.850 --> 00:50:50.115
Well OK, I have dogs.

00:50:50.115 --> 00:50:54.856
And one thing that
I've read recently

00:50:54.856 --> 00:50:57.844
is that one of the innate
differences-- and I'm

00:50:57.844 --> 00:51:01.330
asking you if you know
whether this is true or not--

00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:08.875
between dogs and wolves is
that dogs will follow a human's

00:51:08.875 --> 00:51:10.612
gaze looking at something.

00:51:10.612 --> 00:51:11.320
CARL SAFINA: Yes.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:13.870
And right, and you're going to
say, and wolves don't, right?

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:14.480
MALE SPEAKER: And wolves don't.

00:51:14.480 --> 00:51:15.360
CARL SAFINA: That's baloney.

00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:15.890
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:17.598
CARL SAFINA: And here's
why it's baloney.

00:51:17.598 --> 00:51:20.290
And here's why a lot of the
laboratory studies of animals

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:24.940
and animal behavior are
too simplistic to capture

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:25.860
what's there.

00:51:25.860 --> 00:51:30.600
Dogs were tested to follow
pointing with their owners,

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:32.810
the people they knew the best.

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:34.750
So you take your dog into a lab.

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:37.890
And they say, OK, you stand
there, and put the dog there.

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:38.930
OK, sit.

00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:40.790
OK, ready, go.

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:42.020
Now, point.

00:51:42.020 --> 00:51:44.050
OK, so the owner points.

00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:45.780
The dog looks.

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:48.190
Then they take
wolves with humans

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.551
that they don't know it all.

00:51:49.551 --> 00:51:52.050
They put them behind a chain
link fence because, oh, my god,

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:53.500
they're wolves.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.330
And they point.

00:51:54.330 --> 00:51:56.980
And a wolf behind a chain link
fence surrounded by strangers

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.490
doesn't look where the
other person is pointing.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:01.180
But it turns out
that when you take

00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:03.630
hand raised wolves
with familiar people,

00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:06.060
without a chain link fence
between them, and you point,

00:52:06.060 --> 00:52:08.740
the wolves perform
as well or better

00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:11.220
than the dogs with no training.

00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:14.280
Because they are
incredibly keyed into one

00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.250
another in their social groups.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.130
When a wolf goes like
that, all the other wolves

00:52:19.130 --> 00:52:21.410
have to see what's
interesting over there.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:22.920
Are we about to hunt?

00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:24.310
Did they just see something?

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:25.050
What's going on?

00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:27.310
AUDIENCE: Well, the claim was
that that they did not do that.

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:28.520
CARL SAFINA: The
claim is disproven.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:29.130
MALE SPEAKER: Good.

00:52:29.130 --> 00:52:30.320
CARL SAFINA: Put a
big X on that claim.

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.437
One more question, yes.

00:52:31.437 --> 00:52:33.103
AUDIENCE: It's actually
related to that.

00:52:33.103 --> 00:52:35.803
You're talking-- there's
blurb about your book

00:52:35.803 --> 00:52:39.486
where you describe these
cooperative hunting behaviors,

00:52:39.486 --> 00:52:42.680
like whales knocking a seal
off an ice floe and lions

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.123
attacking in wings.

00:52:44.123 --> 00:52:45.566
How does that
communication work?

00:52:45.566 --> 00:52:47.971
Do we know about
how they coordinate

00:52:47.971 --> 00:52:50.390
those kind of things?

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:52.740
CARL SAFINA: In
some cases, we know.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:57.210
And I would say in most
cases we pretty much know.

00:52:57.210 --> 00:53:02.330
And that is, they're very,
very tuned into one another.

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:05.630
So you mentioned the
killer whales that

00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:06.850
wash the seals off the ice.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.370
What was the other thing
that you mentioned?

00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:08.980
AUDIENCE: The lions.

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.230
CARL SAFINA: The lions, right.

00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:13.170
So I actually saw some of
the thing with the lions.

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:19.260
And I didn't see the behavior
develop because they knew

00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:21.160
exactly what they were doing.

00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.250
But I saw them do it.

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:26.536
So what I saw was
lions are sleeping.

00:53:26.536 --> 00:53:27.660
We're watching these lions.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:29.350
We were watching
those particular lions

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:32.310
because that particular
pride had a habit of hunting

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:33.870
during daylight,
which is unusual.

00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:36.110
So we went to watch and
see if they were going

00:53:36.110 --> 00:53:37.910
to do something really cool.

00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:39.980
And they were sleeping,
and then they woke up.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:41.960
And when they woke
up, they got up

00:53:41.960 --> 00:53:45.560
and they did a big rally with
each other, a big greeting.

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.420
They're all licking
each other's faces,

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:50.720
and they're all smushing their
faces together and everything.

00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:52.580
And then they're
going to go hunt.

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:56.470
Now, first of all, you don't
need to lick somebody's face

00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:58.360
in order to go hunting, right?

00:53:58.360 --> 00:53:59.570
But they do that.

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:00.410
Why do they do that?

00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:02.530
Because that's a reaffirmation.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:04.920
It's just like we wake up
and we say good morning

00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.500
to everybody in our family.

00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.070
It's a reaffirmation.

00:54:08.070 --> 00:54:08.710
We're here.

00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:10.130
We know who we are.

00:54:10.130 --> 00:54:11.060
We're together.

00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.880
This is our group identity.

00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:18.100
So that thing, reestablished
in the course of their day,

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:21.080
they then leave the
area where they were all

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.470
lying around sleeping.

00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:24.960
And they leave together,
because that greeting

00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.230
helped coordinate them.

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:27.400
OK, we're all up now?

00:54:27.400 --> 00:54:29.500
OK, let's go.

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.430
They go to a hill.

00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:33.370
Obviously, they know
exactly what hill

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:35.670
they're going to because
they just went there.

00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:37.050
They just go to the hill.

00:54:37.050 --> 00:54:42.470
And then they walk along
the crest of the hill.

00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:44.690
One of them sits down,
and the others keep going.

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:47.405
And why did that lion just sit
down and the other keep going?

00:54:47.405 --> 00:54:50.830
A second lion sits down,
and the rest keep going.

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:52.240
A third lion sits.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:55.340
A fourth lion sits,
until there is a picket

00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.630
fence of yellow lions
in the yellow grass

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:58.900
at the crest of this hill.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:03.250
And one lion walks
toward the zebras that

00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:05.400
are about a quarter mile away.

00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:10.300
And the plan is-- which
they've obviously done before

00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:11.800
and they knew exactly
what they were

00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:14.410
doing-- we'll all wait here.

00:55:14.410 --> 00:55:17.310
You go chase the
zebras up the hill.

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:18.770
The zebras were no fools.

00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:21.430
They detected the
lion that was coming,

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:24.316
and they spooked and
went farther away.

00:55:24.316 --> 00:55:26.190
So what I saw was really,
really interesting,

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:29.410
It wasn't incredibly dramatic
because the hunt really

00:55:29.410 --> 00:55:31.330
didn't engage.

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:35.004
As far as the killer
whales, they fan out,

00:55:35.004 --> 00:55:37.170
and they're looking in the
pack ice, those ones that

00:55:37.170 --> 00:55:38.190
wash the seals off.

00:55:38.190 --> 00:55:40.670
They fan out, and they're
looking around the pack ice.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:43.890
They can hear each other a
long distance underwater,

00:55:43.890 --> 00:55:46.500
and they call a lot.

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.830
They recognize each
other's voices,

00:55:48.830 --> 00:55:50.640
like you recognize
people on the telephone.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:52.600
They know who's
calling underwater.

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.320
And they're looking
mostly for Weddell seals.

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.410
It's a certain kind of seal
that they particularly like.

00:55:58.410 --> 00:56:00.800
So if they're not
food stressed, they're

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.890
looking for Weddell seals.

00:56:02.890 --> 00:56:05.860
One of them finds
a Weddell seal.

00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:08.845
It doesn't immediately try
to attack the Weddell seal.

00:56:08.845 --> 00:56:14.120
It backs off and calls until
the rest of the group which

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.660
might, in that case, be
three or four individuals,

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:17.890
they all come together.

00:56:17.890 --> 00:56:20.850
They swim away from the ice.

00:56:20.850 --> 00:56:26.040
And then on some signal, either
vocal or visual behavioral,

00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:28.830
it's OK, now, and
then they all go.

00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:32.260
And they all pump their
tails like this in unison,

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.430
and that creates a big moving
wave right above the tails.

00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:38.560
And they go right
to the ice, and then

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:39.990
they just dive under the ice.

00:56:39.990 --> 00:56:41.900
That wave breaks over the ice.

00:56:41.900 --> 00:56:45.380
It washes the seal off, and
then they get the seal that way.

00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:49.950
And killer whales, more than
any other animal in the world,

00:56:49.950 --> 00:56:50.950
they share their kills.

00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:53.900
They share a really high
percentage of their kills.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:57.550
So it's a really, really
cooperative hunting thing.

00:56:57.550 --> 00:57:00.520
I mean, wolves share the kills
too but in a more passive way.

00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:02.540
The thing is down,
and it's just there,

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:04.080
and they all eat from it.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:08.660
But the whales actually pull
it apart and bring pieces

00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.740
and give to one another.

00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.230
Because they're in a more
fluid environment like that.

00:57:13.230 --> 00:57:15.832
So I'm happy to stay
a few more minutes.

00:57:15.832 --> 00:57:17.540
I don't want to keep
you too much longer,

00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:19.550
because we did start late.

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:21.920
And I want to thank you very,
very much for coming out.

00:57:21.920 --> 00:57:22.820
Obviously, we've got
some books in the back.

00:57:22.820 --> 00:57:23.720
Thank you.

00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:26.770
[APPLAUSE]
