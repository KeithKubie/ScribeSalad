00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.680
Superhero films are the dominant form of entertainment
at the box office these days, which means

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.889
just about everyone is interested in doing
a Marvel or DC movie.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.020
The shared universes have scooped up numerous
talents, ranging from rising stars to established

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.500
A-listers to Academy Award winners.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.530
Landing a coveted role in just one of these
projects can be a dream come true for an actor,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:28.530
but there are those that are lucky enough
to play in both worlds.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.430
Typically, one endeavor is more successful
than the other, but it’s still impressive

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.200
to have that on your résumé.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.940
Here are 10 famous actors who have been in
Marvel and DC films.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.640
Ben Affleck

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.550
In the early days of the superhero boom, Ben
Affleck tried to jump in by taking the lead

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.800
role in Daredevil.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.690
Unfortunately, it was far from a hit thanks
to its mixed reviews and only took in $179

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.050
million worldwide in 2003.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.961
Many years later after turning his career
around, Affleck got a chance at comic book

00:00:55.961 --> 00:01:00.760
redemption, signing on to play Bruce Wayne
in the highly anticipated Batman V Superman.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.530
The announcement of his casting was met with
criticism, but Affleck’s performance was

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.969
one of the most praised elements of the film.

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:11.140
Now that he’s locked in to direct a solo
Batman movie and help produce Justice League,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.229
Affleck is the clear face of the DCEU.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:16.319
Ryan Reynolds

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:20.929
Reynolds first dived into the comic book realm
with roles in Marvel adaptations Blade: Trinity

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:22.619
and X-Men Origins: Wolverine.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.979
Neither struck a chord with fans, and the
latter of those two was particularly maligned

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.110
for its portrayal of the Deadpool character.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.070
Reynolds figured that jumping to the DC side
of things might lead to better results, but

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:34.920
he couldn’t have been more wrong.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.579
Green Lantern was a disaster, bombing at the
box office and with critics.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:43.670
It took a while, but Reynolds has finally
carved out a spot for himself in the pantheon

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.729
of great superhero performances.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.329
The standalone Deadpool movie received widespread
praise and shattered records.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:53.530
A sequel is now on the way.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.619
Chris Evans &amp; Idris Elba

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.849
Evans and Elba are two of the most famous
faces in the MCU, having lent their talents

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:04.070
to multiple installments in the Captain America,
Thor, and Avengers series.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.130
To many, they’re Marvel royalty, but they’ve
also worked with the fine folks at DC.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.630
They both starred in the Vertigo adaptation
The Losers in 2010, but that film failed to

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.709
make much impact in the zeitgeist.

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.500
Coincidentally enough, Evans and Elba has
also appeared in Marvel titles that are not

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.250
associated with Disney’s brand.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.750
Evens played the Human Torch in two Fantastic
Four films, while Elba was in the second Ghost

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.990
Rider movie.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.130
Tim Robbins

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.420
Looking over Tim Robbins’ filmography, you’ll
see Oscar nominated works like The Shawshank

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.190
Redemption, Mystic River, and The Player,
but the actor clearly didn’t have the same

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.470
kind of luck when it came to choosing which
comic book movies to star in.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.450
He’s been a part of horrible flops for both
Marvel and DC.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.540
In 1986, he was in the failed Howard the Duck
movie, which grossed just $37 million worldwide.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.280
25 years later, he was back at it with Green
Lantern in 2011.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.080
Superhero films aren’t for everyone, and
maybe Robbins should just look at other genres

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.350
for now until a better offer comes along.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.350
Laurence Fishburne

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.980
The world of comic books has a multitude of
characters with a seemingly infinite range,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.660
and nobody represents that better than Laurence
Fishburne.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.260
He provided the voice for the titular Silver
Surfer in the second Fantastic Four film,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.570
giving life to an all-powerful individual
capable of anything.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.700
In 2013, he played the human and decidedly
powerless Perry White, editor of the Daily

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.700
Planet.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.070
None of his forays into the superhero genre
have been critical hits, but Fishburne has

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.670
consistently been a strong presence in all
of them.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.190
He even had some good moments of comic relief
in Batman V Superman, so hopefully we see

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.300
more of him in the DCEU.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.300
James Marsden

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.900
It’s frequent for actors to collaborate
multiple times with a certain director that

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.080
they enjoy working with.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.520
It would appear that James Marsden is loyal
to filmmaker Bryan Singer, and not just one

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.130
comic book franchise.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.130
Marsden and Singer worked together on the
first two X-Men films in the early 2000s,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.080
kick starting the superhero movie craze we
currently live in.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.130
In 2006, when Singer jumped to DC to helm
Superman Returns, Marsden went with him to

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.750
play Lois Lane’s boyfriend.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.910
As a result, Cyclops was killed off early
in X-Men: The Last Stand, which angered many.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.440
J.K. Simmons

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.940
One of the most pitch perfect castings in
all of superhero films has been J.K. Simmons

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.910
as Daily Bugle boss J. Jonah Jameson in the
original Spider-Man trilogy.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.819
He so accurately embodied the spirit and look
of the character that the future cinematic

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:24.229
incarnations of the property have stayed away
from Jameson completely.

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:28.029
Now that Simmons’ time with Marvel is done,
he’s shifting gears to DC.

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:32.300
The Oscar winner was recently cast as Batman
ally Commissioner James Gordon in the Justice

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.270
League film, becoming the next acting great
to bring life to the iconic character.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.159
Audiences can’t wait to see Simmons share
the screen with Affleck’s Batman.

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:42.509
Tommy Lee Jones

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.710
Jones has one of the most varied filmographies
in all of Hollywood, so it’s no surprise

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.940
he’s done his fair share of comic book movies.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.319
His first appearance was as the villainous
Two Face in Joel Schumacher’s Batman Forever,

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:56.509
delivering a campy and over-the-top performance.

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.139
Years later, he had a more subdued turn in
Captain America: The First Avenger as Colonel

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.009
Phillips, Steve Rogers’ commanding officer
in the U.S. Army.

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.310
He provided a sense of gravitas to that role
and proved to be a memorable supporting character.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.289
It’s a shame his time in the MCU is complete,
but maybe there’s some room for him in the

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:14.919
DCEU somehow.

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:15.919
Will Smith

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.219
By now, everyone knows that Will Smith played
Deadshot in Suicide Squad, turning in a strong

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.960
performance as the assassin with a heart of
gold.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.199
Many can’t wait to see to see the character
return in future DCEU installments.

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:31.530
But years before Smith played Floyd Lawton,
he was in a Marvel Comics adaptation.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.970
It’s a little known fact, but Men in Black
was an obscure comic book before it was turned

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.699
into an entertaining summer blockbuster.

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:42.229
There, Smith displayed excellent chemistry
with co-star Tommy Lee Jones in a part that

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.370
firmly established his place among the Hollywood’s
elite.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.820
Smith headlined a trilogy, but now with Deadshot
he seems to be fully committed to DC.

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.039
Josh Brolin &amp; Michael Fassbender

00:05:54.039 --> 00:05:57.409
Jonah Hex is considered one of the worst comic
book films of all-time.

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:01.669
It’s surprising to see so many top tier
actors in its cast.

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:06.449
Among the names were Josh Brolin and Michael
Fassbender, and they both got superhero redemption

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:07.940
later on in their careers.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.770
Fassbender went on to play a young Magneto
in the X-Men: First Class trilogy, earning

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:15.240
much praise for his performances as the complex
antagonist.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.539
Brolin is in place as Thanos in the MCU, making
a cameo in Guardians of the Galaxy before

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.499
his role expands greatly in 2018’s Avengers:
Infinity War.

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:46.289
Both have to be happy with the way this turned
out.

00:06:46.289 --> 00:06:49.900
Those are just some of the actors who have
been in Marvel and DC films.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:50.999
