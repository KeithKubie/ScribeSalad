Modern art helps us understand not only the artist, but also, ourselves. This video is

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:17.340
called Art &amp; Identity, a theme will explore
using three works. Since their marriage in

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.189
1929, Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo had been
Mexico's most well-known couple. While Diego

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:28.980
was a painter who was famous for his large
murals, Frida was a painter who was famous

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.340
for being his wife. But in 1938, Frida's paintings
were starting to get attention. So she takes

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:43.580
her first solo trip abroad. She has her first
solo shows in Paris and London. Her style

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.100
was unique.Was it Mexican Folk Art? was it
Surrealism? When asked, Frida simply said:

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.690
I paint my own reality. Picasso gives her
earrings. The Louvre buys a painting. Both

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.280
shows are a success. She returns home, divorces
Diego Rivera and paints "Self-Portrait with

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.960
Cropped Hair." Her art had always been in
response to her life. I would imagine that

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.780
it would be a process that was sometimes very
hard for her. She used her artistic process

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:16.250
as sort of an outlet. She marries her love
Diego Rivera and she paints this. She divorces

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.600
her love Diego Rivera and she paints this.
She was determined not to simply be the ex

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.829
Mrs. Rivera. Diego had loved her long hair
and her colorful dresses. Frida painted herself

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.799
without either. She's seated in this chair
with a pair of shears in one hand and a piece

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.799
of her long hair in the other. She seemed
to reveal a lot about herself as an artist.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:47.569
She was willing to kind of go to those places
that not everybody is willing to go. In 1940,

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:56.380
this is how Frida saw herself. In 1993, Glenn
Ligon asked ten friends how they saw him.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.609
Ligon instructed his friends: Imagine that
I've gone missing and how would you describe

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:04.310
me as a missing person. Get straight to the
point. What are the essential details. Here's

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.530
what they said. A black man. 5' 8" Very short
haircut. Nearly completely shaved. Stocky

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:21.770
build. 155-165 lbs. If you read it, the information
is about me, but also, it's not about me.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:29.040
He takes those descriptions and prints them
beneath 19th century images of slaves. He

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:40.940
called it "Runaways." The series was made
up of ten prints. Now part of the point in

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:45.200
doing this is to try to get at the ways that
slavery and the language around it continues

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:54.340
to be important to us today. They read and
looked very similar to the real thing. We

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.180
always imagine that slavery is something in
the past and that we as a society have gotten

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.860
over it. It's sort of gone. But we still feel
its effects. A reminder that his identity

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:16.590
was still shaped by that past. Marilyn Monroe's
identity, however, was shaped by the public.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.060
In 1953, this is how America saw her. One
of many publicity photos for the film, Niagara.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.650
She was about to become one of the most famous
people alive. A decade later she dies of a

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.030
drug overdose. Within a few months, Andy Warhol
takes that publicity photo and creates this

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.260
painting. The tabloid culture as we know it
took off in the 1950s. The American public

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:53.390
was no longer satisfied by this. They wanted
this. After Monroe's death, everyone is trying

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:59.370
to tell her story. Paint the definitive portrait.
Who was she really? "Who wants to truth? That's

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.250
what show business is for. To prove that,
it's not what you are that counts, it's what

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.230
they think you are." Warhol takes the publicity
photo and creates this. A silkscreen of a

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.170
photo. A reproduction of a reproduction. Against
gold. "I don't know where the artificial stops

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.979
and the real starts." It was Warhol's definitive
portrait of Marilyn Monroe, the tabloids and

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:25.039
the public. How America saw Marilyn Monroe
in 1962, how Glenn Ligon's friends saw him

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:28.349
in 1993 and how Frida Kahlo saw herself in
1938.
