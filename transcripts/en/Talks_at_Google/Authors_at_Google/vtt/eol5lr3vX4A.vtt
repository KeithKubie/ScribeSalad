00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.450
JASON ANDREAS: Guys,
thanks for coming.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.560
This is Talks at Google.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.870
My name is Jason Andreas.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.930
I'm here with Dr.
Howard Markel, author

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.230
of "The Kelloggs: The Battling
Brothers of Battle Creek."

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.340
This book actually 2017 National
Book Critics Circle Award

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.065
finalist for nonfiction.

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:23.190
So congratulations on that.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.000
HOWARD MARKEL: Thank you.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.840
JASON ANDREAS:
The paperback just

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.330
came out today as we were just
discussing a little bit ago.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.221
Let's please give Dr.
Markel a big Google welcome.

00:00:30.221 --> 00:00:33.588
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.960
So we were talking about
this a little bit earlier.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.780
The book is quite thick for
those of you that can't see.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.870
It's fantastically
a detailed recount

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.517
of the Kellogg brothers.

00:00:46.517 --> 00:00:48.600
How did you initially
become interested in writing

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.100
this book?

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.870
Where did the spark come from
to kind of dig into these two

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.120
brothers lives and really
kind of flesh it out

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.231
as much as you have?

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:56.730
HOWARD MARKEL: Well,
this was really

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.650
a great leap from
my previous work

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.230
where I've written quite
a bit about epidemics.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.489
And the book before this
one was about Sigmund Freud

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.030
and his discovery of
cocaine, which he'd

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.885
liked a little bit too much.

00:01:09.885 --> 00:01:11.826
JASON ANDREAS: We've
heard the stories.

00:01:11.826 --> 00:01:13.200
HOWARD MARKEL: He
was a wild man.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.680
And actually this project began
as a project of convenience,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.630
which I've never done before and
hopefully won't do soon after.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.420
But I had just injured
my back terribly

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.130
while I was finishing the
research for the last book.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.562
I injured myself in Vienna
and herniated a disk

00:01:31.562 --> 00:01:32.520
and then a second disk.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.680
So I wasn't very mobile.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.490
And I knew that John Harvey
Kellogg's papers were mostly

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.320
at the Bentley
Historical Library

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.789
at the University of Michigan.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.080
So I started playing with them.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.790
And I'd known about him.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.950
But the more I played with
the papers and looked at them,

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.800
I figured, well, there was a
book in that life and the span

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.440
of time he lived
in American history

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.150
and in American medicine.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.440
But as I wrote more and
more about the book,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.070
I realized that if you told
the story of John Harvey

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.710
Kellogg the doctor,
you had to also tell

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.430
the story of his little brother
Will Kellogg, the Corn Flake

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.289
king, because they
worked together

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.200
for 25 years at the
Battle Creek Sanitarium.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.350
They co-invented what
became Corn Flakes.

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.680
And then they ruptured
their relationship.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.000
And, of course, Kellogg's became
the world famous food giant

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.034
that it is today.

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:27.450
JASON ANDREAS: Well, I think
one of the interesting things

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.041
about the book is the
dynamic between the brothers.

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:33.540
You start off by kind of laying
a foundation of how they got

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.831
to the United States, and
how they settled in Michigan,

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:39.150
and really foundationally
from a geography standpoint.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.610
But then you start to explain
how they were each brought up

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:42.110
differently.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:47.250
John, for the most part, had
a pretty easy path in life,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.030
we'll say.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.980
He was always kind of
the favorite child.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.940
Everyone who met him said he was
this great intelligent person,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.830
and went through
multiple medical schools,

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.570
was always kind of
lauded in his time.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:00.360
Where Will on the other
side was initially

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.381
seen as being dimwitted,
which eventually--

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:04.380
HOWARD MARKEL: That's the
word his teacher used.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.796
JASON ANDREAS:
Dimwitted-- I know.

00:03:05.796 --> 00:03:07.590
I don't use that word
often in my life.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.510
That's a quote, which was
ultimately kind of attributed

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.510
to nearsightedness, I
believe, eventually.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.380
HOWARD MARKEL: Which wasn't
diagnosed until he was 20.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.580
JASON ANDREAS: Which
is why, I know.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.670
HOWARD MARKEL: So imagine that.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.211
JASON ANDREAS: But
I think that plays

00:03:20.211 --> 00:03:22.336
into too when he eventually
started his foundation.

00:03:22.336 --> 00:03:24.585
A lot of what they do-- we'll
talk about that a little

00:03:24.585 --> 00:03:25.100
later--

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.930
is focus on children's health,
kids' health, and eyesight

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.085
in general as well.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:30.585
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.959
HOWARD MARKEL:
Ocular Eye health.

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.460
In fact, the University of
Michigan Kellogg Eye Center,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.610
that's not by accident.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.550
JASON ANDREAS:
Sure, of course not.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.950
He had a little bit of
a harder kind of life

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.930
where a lot of folks
were not as nice to him.

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.600
Even his parents didn't
necessarily treat him as well.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.400
He sold brooms for
his family, where

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.650
his brother was off at
these fancy medical schools

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.450
across the country.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.330
Yet, when you think of
the Kellogg name now,

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.480
especially, people probably
associate more with Will.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.690
He's got kind of the longer
legacy that's lasted.

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.780
How did you go about kind
of deciphering the play

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.430
between the two brothers?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.197
If we transported ourselves back
to the late 1800s, early 1900s,

00:04:09.197 --> 00:04:11.280
John would probably be the
more famous of the two.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.655
HOWARD MARKEL: Absolutely.

00:04:11.655 --> 00:04:13.800
JASON ANDREAS: Whereas
100 years later Plus,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.220
now Will is kind of the one
who's left the longer legacy.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.829
How did you go about kind of
breaking that apart and really

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.690
also tying it together as well?

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.620
HOWARD MARKEL: Well, you
make a very good point.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.520
In real time, John
Harvey Kellogg

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.720
was one of most famous
doctors in America.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.060
He was a best-selling author.

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.560
He lectured all over.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.590
The Battle Creek Sanitarium
was a very popular place

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.450
where tens of
thousands of people

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:43.380
came to this medical
resort/spa/grand hotel/hospital

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.430
because they did operations, and
medical treatments, and so on.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:53.190
And during that period, Will
called himself JH's lackey.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.470
And it wasn't until Corn Flakes
became a product that the name

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.300
Kellogg became synonymous
with Will's work.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.300
What was great about writing
about both these brothers

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.260
was the conflict.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.300
And so as a writer,
I love conflict.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:10.750
I don't like it in my own life.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.230
But I love it when I'm writing
about other people's lives.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.010
And it's a great
tool that I've used

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.930
as a literary device
for many of my books

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.440
to go back and forth
between two or more people

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.482
because it makes the story far
more interesting and richer.

00:05:26.482 --> 00:05:28.690
And it brings the reader--
when they're in one place,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.730
they want to go to the
next place, and so on.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.870
So it's a way of holding
the interests of the reader,

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.890
but also of the writer.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:38.170
Because if the writer is
not interested in the book,

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.840
it's very hard to convey
that to an audience.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.620
So I found their relationship
just fascinating.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.220
And each of them were
remarkable in their own way.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.370
And yet, they were
probably at their best

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.960
when they worked together even
though they were at their worst

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.620
when they worked together.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.700
John Harvey treated
Will very badly.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.300
He would make him run
around beside him as he

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.420
rode his bicycle to take notes.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.000
If he was having one of his
five daily bowel movements--

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.840
the doctor is a big believer
in that he had constipation--

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.220
he would make Will come into
the bathroom and take dictation,

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.460
I mean, all these kind
of demeaning things.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.440
He paid him very badly.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.070
Will rarely had a day off.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:27.190
And yet, Will ran the
place beautifully.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:32.030
His great genius was in
business, and administration,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:33.310
in process.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.890
He had to manage all these
people, different types

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.480
of people, doctors, nurses,
orderlies, masseuses,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.690
hydrotherapists,
cooks, you name it.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:43.360
And so you couldn't
find a better place

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.150
to learn how to run an
international corporation

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.450
like Kellogg's than running
the Battle Creek Sanitarium

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.220
for his brother Dr. Kellogg.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.660
JASON ANDREAS: Sure.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.000
I grew up with an older brother.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.290
As I was reading the
book, I kept laughing.

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.480
I was like, jeez, I
thought my brother was

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.646
mean to me when I was young.

00:06:59.646 --> 00:07:02.320
This guy was pretty
rough on his brother.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.161
But, again, ultimately I loved
the dynamic, like you said.

00:07:06.161 --> 00:07:07.160
It's really interesting.

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.350
It was almost like a script
for a movie or something

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.815
where you've got the one
brother who is super successful,

00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:12.690
the other who is not.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.000
And they end up kind of crossing
paths as the story continues.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.930
And, again, as you
said ultimately,

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.290
they worked best together.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:22.930
But ultimately, they also had a
difficult relationship as well.

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:23.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.420
HOWARD MARKEL: Because
their greatest moment,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:30.430
their great eureka moment, was
coming up with flaked cereals.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.750
First, it was wheat.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:34.840
Then it was corn because it
was cheaper and tasted better.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.240
And then it tasted
even better when

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.010
Will added a little
sugar and salt

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.990
that the doctor was against.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.540
But if you think
about corn flakes,

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:46.330
it changed the way
people ate breakfast.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:49.730
Because breakfast was
an ordeal, particularly

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.200
in an era of wood burning stoves
and when mothers were really

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:55.390
the primary homemakers.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.150
They would have to get up
early to start the fire.

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:01.390
They would make, for example,
bacon, or salted meats,

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.880
or fried potatoes.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:07.750
Or even if you made
oatmeal, it was a big to-do.

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:11.440
Now you could just simply
pour breakfast out of a box.

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:12.970
Even dad could make it.

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:15.580
So really in 1906
when it came out,

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.940
it took the world by storm.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.640
JASON ANDREAS:
Truly revolutionary.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.830
I mean, we take it
for granted today.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:22.960
I've got 10 boxes of
cereal in my pantry.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.640
But you don't think
about that this

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:28.000
was a revolutionary kind of
introduction when it came out

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.900
in the early 1900s.

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.710
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah, and it
was made as a health food.

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.350
It was made for
invalids who could not

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:33.850
digest their food very easily.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:38.350
And indeed, flaked cereals are
perhaps too easy to digest.

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.789
You break it down as soon
as you start eating it.

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:42.789
And in fact, we
know that has what's

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:46.720
called a high glycemic index,
meaning it raises your blood

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.340
sugar and then your insulin.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.290
And then it
precipitously goes down.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.560
Then you're hungry long
before noon, before lunch,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.760
while a low glycemic index,
oatmeal, you stay full

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.530
or you feel full longer.

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:02.290
But Will's brilliant
idea was that there's

00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:05.020
a lot more regular
healthy people who

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.020
need a nutritious breakfast
than sick people who

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.760
need a health food breakfast.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.140
And so that was his brilliance.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.280
JASON ANDREAS: Can
you talk about--

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.180
you mentioned this a lot.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:14.890
And this is a recurring
theme in the book

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:18.810
is both John and Will's
obsession with kind

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.090
of this healthy lifestyle,
which was actually fairly

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.890
revolutionary at the time too.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.485
You lay a foundation
early on, as I mentioned,

00:09:26.485 --> 00:09:31.974
of what kind of a difficult
time the late 1800s were.

00:09:31.974 --> 00:09:34.390
Their family grew up kind of
on the west side of Michigan,

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.630
a little bit on the frontier
and how unhealthy people were

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:40.570
at this time and how they
kind of revolutionized

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.139
this idea of health,
this idea of wellness.

00:09:43.139 --> 00:09:44.680
HOWARD MARKEL: Of
wellness, wellness.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.320
JASON ANDREAS:
Yeah, wellness, kind

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.290
of this all encompassing,
which included things

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:50.434
like eating better, but also
exercise, and fresh air,

00:09:50.434 --> 00:09:51.850
and all of these
different things.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:54.210
HOWARD MARKEL: No nicotine,
no alcohol, no caffeine.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.960
JASON ANDREAS: Which
was a complete U-turn

00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.293
for a lot of people at the time.

00:09:57.293 --> 00:09:59.020
Can you talked a
little bit about how

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.370
they were raised in that era
and how they kind utilized

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.800
that motivation to
focus their life

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.981
on this idea of well-being,
both of them did?

00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:08.480
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.980
HOWARD MARKEL: And
their parents who

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.640
came from Massachusetts to
Michigan really were pioneers.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.220
And when they came
in the 1830s, they

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:16.940
came before Michigan
was even a state.

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.670
It was still a territory.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:21.640
And one of their
brothers describes a wall

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.610
of trees on either side
of a little dirt road

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:28.450
that they took originally
to Flint, then to Jackson,

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:31.360
and then to Battle Creek.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.034
But people ate remarkably
badly in the 19th century.

00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:37.200
JASON ANDREAS: Butter, lard.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.741
HOWARD MARKEL:
Vegetables were always

00:10:38.741 --> 00:10:43.140
cream, a lot of butter, a lot
of lard, a lot of animal fat.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.840
You would save the
grease from dinner

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.320
to fry up breakfast
the next morning.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.170
Lot of molasses, and syrup, and
heavily sugared foods, a lot

00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:57.195
of alcohol.

00:10:57.195 --> 00:11:01.200
The consumption of
alcohol in say 1900

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.840
if you look at the
data is staggering,

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.800
which gives you a lot of reasons
why people wanted prohibition

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.550
in the late '20s.

00:11:08.550 --> 00:11:09.060
JASON ANDREAS: It
was out of control.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.090
HOWARD MARKEL:
Yeah, and a lot of--

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:11.070
people smoked.

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:13.080
And they drank a lot of
coffee, a lot of tea.

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.890
So the American diet
was not a good one.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.740
Now the Kelloggs
were early acolytes

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.170
of the Seventh Day
Adventist Church,

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.240
which has a great many edicts.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.740
They were based in Battle Creek.

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:30.840
Now one of the most famous is
the prediction of the advent,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.060
the second coming
of Jesus Christ,

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.430
and the destruction
of the mortal world,

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:37.690
and the good people
going up to heaven.

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:38.940
That's what really well known.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:43.500
But even more intriguing to
me as a historian of medicine

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.030
was the founders of the
church, Ellen and James White,

00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:49.980
their edicts on what they
called health reform.

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:54.270
So the idea was that
your body is a temple.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.150
If you want to go to
heaven, you not only

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.790
have to be clean of mind and
spirit, but also of body.

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:03.300
And so she worked with a
lot of people of that era

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.420
in terms of healthy diets,
of wellness, as you said.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.570
Dr. Kellogg called
it biologic living.

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.390
But they work with people
like Sylvester Graham of--

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:12.870
JASON ANDREAS: Graham Crackers.

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.640
HOWARD MARKEL:
--Graham Cracker fame.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:13.880
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, of course.

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.838
HOWARD MARKEL: And that
was a whole wheat grain

00:12:15.838 --> 00:12:17.200
that he recommended.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.031
And there were many other
people, vegetarians and such.

00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:22.530
They were not the
majority, but they

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.050
were saying this is what
we ought to be eating,

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:28.410
this is how we ought to
be exercising and taking

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:31.890
care of ourselves, spiritually--
the issues of worry,

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:34.970
and not sleeping well,
things like that.

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:39.040
It's just remarkable
how much they suggested.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.160
And if you look at
the early progress

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.220
in American public health,
it is very intricately

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:50.130
tied to Christianity in
various sects of Christianity

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.421
that are telling their flock
to take care of themselves.

00:12:53.421 --> 00:12:55.920
JASON ANDREAS: You also talk
about a conflicting idea though

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.450
with the Adventists
as well in terms of--

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.940
since they thought that
the Advent was coming

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.850
and there was this ultimate
return of the creator,

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.550
that they put kind
of a low focus

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:11.730
on like higher education
and lasting education.

00:13:11.730 --> 00:13:16.560
Yet, coming up in a very
religious kind of base,

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.522
both brothers became kind
of revolutionary in the way

00:13:19.522 --> 00:13:21.480
that they kind of tackled
some of these things.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.616
They were kind of difference
makers in their fields

00:13:23.616 --> 00:13:24.990
where it seems
really interesting

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.430
because they did
focus on education,

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:27.600
whereas the
religious [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.340
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah,
yeah, I mean, Will

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:32.317
was not educated beyond grade
school because his parents

00:13:32.317 --> 00:13:33.400
thought, what's the point?

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:33.930
JASON ANDREAS: What's the point?

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:35.346
HOWARD MARKEL: And
a lot of people

00:13:35.346 --> 00:13:37.680
felt that in that community.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.630
It is interesting though
that even the Whites,

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.210
who are predicting
an Advent, they're

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:45.120
much more careful than
other denominations that

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.645
are saying the same thing in
that they're not giving a date.

00:13:47.645 --> 00:13:48.770
JASON ANDREAS: Right, yeah.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:49.950
HOWARD MARKEL: That was
really quite brilliant.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.270
JASON ANDREAS: Predicting 2022.

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:52.800
HOWARD MARKEL: There was
one guy, William Miller, who

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.390
predicted this particular date.

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.937
It didn't happen.

00:13:55.937 --> 00:13:58.270
JASON ANDREAS: It's good to
predict the day if it works.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.450
If not, you basically
lose your credibility.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:01.270
HOWARD MARKEL:
Well, if it works,

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:02.520
that's not so good
either considering

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:03.478
what you're predicting.

00:14:03.478 --> 00:14:04.890
JASON ANDREAS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:06.390
HOWARD MARKEL: But
at the same time,

00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:09.090
the Whites were
building an empire.

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:11.530
They were building churches
all over the country

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:13.290
and then later, the world.

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:18.030
They had missionaries going
out to bring more people in.

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:20.070
They had a huge
publishing company

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.310
that published a
newspaper, Bible tracks,

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.570
all sorts of things.

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.960
It's sort of an early Google.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.300
They are transmitting
information

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:31.560
using 19th century
methods of technology

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.610
but to spread the word.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:38.310
And John Harvey was sent to good
medical schools by the Whites.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.860
They paid for it because
they wanted someone

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.280
to run what was then called
the Western Health Reform

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.460
Institute, which ultimately
became the Battle Creek

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:48.240
Sanitarium.

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.090
So they could see far
enough into the future

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:53.364
to take care of things that
would extend their empire.

00:14:53.364 --> 00:14:55.905
JASON ANDREAS: Can you talk a
little bit about the sanitarium

00:14:55.905 --> 00:14:59.235
because it's in the
story of the Kelloggs?

00:14:59.235 --> 00:15:02.900
And, again, if we shot
back to the late 1800s,

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.690
everyone would know about
the Battle Creek Sanitarium.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.810
A lot of folks might not
know as much about it.

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.809
Again, you say the word
Kellogg's a lot of folks

00:15:10.809 --> 00:15:14.130
would obviously think about the
food brand or the foundation.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:16.700
They wouldn't necessarily think
about the sanitarium itself.

00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:20.046
So can you talk a little bit
about what the sanitarium was?

00:15:20.046 --> 00:15:21.420
You talked a little
bit about how

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.700
it started with the Whites kind
of educating John and bringing

00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:25.200
him back.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.380
But what did that look
like back in the day?

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:30.690
Why was it such an important
part of health and wellness

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:31.530
at the time?

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.750
HOWARD MARKEL: Well, it
started basically in 1866

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:36.580
as a little house with
some quacky doctors

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.690
and some pretty bad food.

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:41.260
They used to give a lot of
what was called hydrotherapy,

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.702
baths of all kind.

00:15:42.702 --> 00:15:44.410
But they didn't always
have enough water.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.020
So sometimes they had
a reuse the bathwater

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.360
on different patients,
which for some reason

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.760
was not well received.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:53.890
One woman said, it's
as if we were all

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:56.830
dipped into the same gravy.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:16:01.030
And when John Harvey
came back in 1876

00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:04.870
from going to Bellevue Hospital
Medical College in New York

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:07.960
City, he said, I'll do it on
a couple of conditions, one,

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.630
that I get to run it
as the most modern

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:15.010
medical and scientifically
oriented place I can muster.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.870
And, two, I don't
want any interference

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:19.840
from the religious elders.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.270
He did not want
laypeople to tell him

00:16:22.270 --> 00:16:24.460
how to run his hospital.

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:26.980
But he was very, very ambitious.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:30.130
And he kept building
on and more and more

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:31.960
to the Battle Creek Sanitarium.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.050
It became bigger and better
with each passing year.

00:16:35.050 --> 00:16:41.800
The Battle Creek Sanitarium
was the most popular train stop

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.090
on the Michigan Central Railway
between Detroit and Chicago.

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:49.420
And as I said earlier, more
than 10,000 people a year

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:53.290
came there for all sorts
of therapies, and spas,

00:16:53.290 --> 00:16:54.550
and lectures.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.080
He called it a sanitarium.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.690
He made that name up--

00:16:57.690 --> 00:17:00.160
sanitas from health,
Latin for health.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.380
And it was his
university of health.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:06.400
It was there not just to be a
hospital where sick people were

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.460
treated, but where
people came to be well

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.592
and to lead healthy lives.

00:17:11.592 --> 00:17:12.925
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:17:12.925 --> 00:17:15.609
You talked about John's
experience in Bellevue.

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:18.619
And to go back a
little bit about kind

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.430
of the dynamic of
health at the time,

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:24.190
you mentioned that the mortality
rate at Bellevue Hospital,

00:17:24.190 --> 00:17:26.648
which is one of the most famous
in the country at the time,

00:17:26.648 --> 00:17:27.400
was 16 or 17%--

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.260
HOWARD MARKEL: Oh, it was huge.

00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:29.170
JASON ANDREAS: --or
something like that.

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:31.270
So basically out
of every 100 people

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:33.837
who checked into the hospital,
only around 80 of them

00:17:33.837 --> 00:17:34.420
actually left.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.020
HOWARD MARKEL: Went home.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.540
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah,
which if that happened

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.789
at University of Michigan,
we'd be in a lot of trouble

00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:40.060
right now, right?

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:42.760
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah, not you.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.260
I would.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.030
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, sure.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:45.530
HOWARD MARKEL: You
don't work there.

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:50.230
But, first of all,
so this is 1874.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:52.420
And think about
what medicine had

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:54.550
to treat people at that time.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.040
And the answer is
not a whole lot.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.290
JASON ANDREAS: Not much, yeah.

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.030
HOWARD MARKEL: And
most of hospital care

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.290
was what we would call
today nursing care.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.610
There was no IV fluids.

00:18:03.610 --> 00:18:06.370
That didn't happen
till the 1930s.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.300
Surgery in terms of antiseptic
and the later aseptic surgery

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.540
so you don't die of a
post-operative infection

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.400
was just beginning at the time.

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.540
So, generally, an operation
could end up in death.

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.150
And you didn't do a lot
of exploratory surgery

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:25.000
inside the gut, let
alone the chest.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.050
It was largely amputations
or external procedures.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.020
There were very few drugs
that would treat diseases.

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:36.640
And so people did not
live very long and healthy

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.740
lives, particularly
those who went

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.570
to hospitals like Bellevue.

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.210
This was a public
hospital for the poor.

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:45.160
The rich would never
find themselves

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.010
at Bellevue Hospital.

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:49.570
And there was a
distinction of how

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.870
the poor were taken care of
as opposed to how the wealthy.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:54.460
Sound familiar?

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.080
That's not a problem
we have yet solved.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:01.000
But it was not a healthy
place to find yourself,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.270
and most people back when
John Harvey Kellogg walked

00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:06.910
the wards of Bellevue
would avoid it at all costs

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:07.510
if they could.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.000
JASON ANDREAS: Can you talk
about some of the methods

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.220
for treating diseases--

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.109
bleeding, use of
mercury, things like

00:19:15.109 --> 00:19:16.400
that I mean you're [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.400
HOWARD MARKEL:
Arsenic, strychnine.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.150
JASON ANDREAS: How
could this be possible?

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:22.132
But, again, 150 years
ago these were fairly--

00:19:22.132 --> 00:19:23.590
HOWARD MARKEL:
These were standard.

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:26.410
JASON ANDREAS:
[INAUDIBLE] experimental.

00:19:26.410 --> 00:19:28.630
HOWARD MARKEL: But
a lot of laypeople

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.030
don't read a lot of the
history of medicine.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.910
Don't understand fully is
that while a lot of people

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:37.300
were called MD, that they've
graduated from a college that

00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.180
gave them that degree,
different schools taught

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.190
different forms of medicine.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:44.200
So the University of
Michigan, for example,

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.740
taught what's called allopathic
medicine, which is still what

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:52.720
is practiced, what my MD is in.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.210
And that's the notion
of medications,

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:57.820
or drugs, and
operations, and so on.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:19:59.680
But they're also homeopaths.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:01.180
In fact, University
of Michigan used

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:03.190
to have a homeopathic
medical school

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:06.730
from the 1870s to
the early 1920s, who

00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:10.840
taught that infinitesimally
small doses of a drug that

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.200
created the same symptoms
of the disease you had

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.300
would be curative.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:16.630
There were osteopaths.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:18.270
There were botanical doctors.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:19.900
There were eclectic doctors.

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:23.140
So not all MDs were alike.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.320
And even if you were from
the best medical school

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.300
of that era, what
was being taught

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:32.830
and what you had in your
arsenal was pitifully small

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:35.012
compared to today or even
compared to 50 years ago.

00:20:35.012 --> 00:20:37.470
JASON ANDREAS: I'm glad things
have progressed beyond the--

00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:38.386
HOWARD MARKEL: Me too.

00:20:38.386 --> 00:20:41.586
JASON ANDREAS: --the 1920s
when it comes to medicine.

00:20:41.586 --> 00:20:42.960
Progressing forward
a little bit,

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:48.630
then so from the
sanitarium in Battle Creek,

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:52.090
where did the kind of invention
of corn flakes come to be?

00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:54.270
How did that progress
from kind of this health

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:57.952
retreat to now creating
what would eventually

00:20:57.952 --> 00:20:59.160
become the Kellogg's Company?

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.285
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah, well,
John Henry Kellogg-- one

00:21:01.285 --> 00:21:05.550
of his big pursuits as a
scientist was inventing foods.

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.050
He had a food laboratory.

00:21:07.050 --> 00:21:10.290
And he thought there are certain
healthy or healthier foods.

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:12.840
He was a big fan of nuts.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.090
In fact, he probably
invented peanut butter.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:16.920
People always
disagree about that.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.636
And his peanut butter was
made out of boiled peanuts

00:21:19.636 --> 00:21:20.760
and didn't taste very good.

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.650
But he came up with foods that
were palatable because eating

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.260
mushy, overcooked
vegetables or grains

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.330
is not really attractive.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.980
And he wanted people
to eat healthy

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.650
when they left the
sanitarium, as well as when

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.540
they were at the sanitarium.

00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:39.360
And so one of his
theories was that if you

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:45.600
took a starch in a grain and
you cooked it or baked it

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:51.330
for a long period of time, you
broke down the starch molecules

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.490
into a simple sugar dextrose.

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.680
And he called that
dextrinization.

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.260
And that would be
easier to digest.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.030
And a lot of people
with bad stomachs

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.250
would come to the sanitarium.

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:07.500
I mean, after dyspepsia,
stomach aches, constipation,

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.680
autointoxication,
where pieces of meat

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.400
were theorized to be
festering in your gut

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.230
and giving off poisons, they
all came to Battle Creek.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:20.945
And so he first fed them
double-baked biscuits,

00:22:20.945 --> 00:22:22.330
Zwieback.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.530
And the way the story goes,
whether it's true or not--

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:28.200
a woman bit into a
biscuit and broke

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.500
her dentures and
demanded $10, which

00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.410
was quite a lot of money
in 1880 from the doctor

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:35.675
to pay for the dentures.

00:22:35.675 --> 00:22:37.800
Well, he didn't want to do
that for other patients.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.410
So he came up with
different ways

00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.080
that people wouldn't have
to bite into a hard biscuit.

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:44.900
First, he ground it down.

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.330
And it became a
little tiny particles.

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:50.776
He called that granola until
somebody sued him because they

00:22:50.776 --> 00:22:51.650
had the name granola.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:52.090
JASON ANDREAS: They
had already made it.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:52.530
Yeah.

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:54.446
HOWARD MARKEL: And then
they called it granos.

00:22:54.446 --> 00:22:58.560
And then he played around
with batches of dough--

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.990
will and John did
this for years--

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:04.050
of how to cook it,
boil it, bake it.

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:07.530
So it was both dextinized,
it was easy to digest,

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.930
but also palatable
and reproducible.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.400
But you can make a lot of it.

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.560
And they finally
hit on flaked cereal

00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.049
one day when they
had a batch of dough.

00:23:17.049 --> 00:23:18.090
They had worked all week.

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:19.590
And they were very tired.

00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:21.300
And the doctor was
either called away

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:23.040
for a medical
emergency or they just

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.990
both wanted to just go to bed.

00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:26.580
And Will was very cheap.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:29.850
So he took that batch of dough
and put it in a container

00:23:29.850 --> 00:23:30.870
overnight.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:33.990
And probably what happened
is that the dough tempered.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:38.340
And tempering is a process where
the water content in a dough

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.280
evens out across
the entire batch.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:43.140
And you don't get air bubbles.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.900
And it's a little moldy,
but not too moldy.

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.580
Then it alters the taste.

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:49.230
Bakers know about
this quite well.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.370
But they didn't.

00:23:50.370 --> 00:23:53.500
And then when they rolled it
out very flat and baked it,

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.290
and then it would cut
little pieces off,

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:57.390
they got perfect flakes.

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.125
And so that's how wheat
flakes of flaked cereal

00:24:00.125 --> 00:24:00.750
were developed.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.880
And then Will went
back to the lab

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.010
and tried this batch,
and that batch,

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:07.410
and adding this,
or taking this out.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.494
And then eventually they
came up with corn flakes.

00:24:09.494 --> 00:24:11.826
JASON ANDREAS: And this was
healthy at the time compared

00:24:11.826 --> 00:24:13.770
to the other ways
that they were eating.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:15.180
I think it's interesting--

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:19.780
so both of the brothers in their
pursuit with the sanitarium

00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:23.460
then ultimately
with corn flakes,

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:25.922
they were really kind of after
this like American pursuit

00:24:25.922 --> 00:24:27.630
of wellness or kind
of credited for this.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:29.580
And you talk about
that a lot in the book.

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.180
But when you mention
the name Kelloggs today,

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.790
again, bringing
it to present day,

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:37.350
it's not necessarily
synonymous with wellness.

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:39.840
I don't say John Kellogg
or Will Kellogg--

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.420
oh yeah, they've created
this whole American movement

00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.440
of wellness.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:47.234
In fact, as I was talking to
people about this talk today

00:24:47.234 --> 00:24:49.650
with you, and I mentioned the
word Kellogg's, I would just

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.816
kind of ask them, what do
you think of when you hear

00:24:51.816 --> 00:24:52.320
Kellogg's?

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.320
A lot of the responses
are Frosted Flakes,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.270
Frosted Mini-Wheats, Pop Tarts.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:59.960
Like all of these sugary treats.

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.310
And now, obviously, that's
probably a product of time.

00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:05.490
This is not something that
they created initially.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:09.120
So the name Kellogg's and
wellness don't necessarily

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.180
go completely together.

00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:16.200
What's the lasting legacy of all
of this work that they put in

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:19.260
to establish this base
of American wellness

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:20.310
and how it looks today?

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.775
What do you think the legacy
of the brothers is based on?

00:25:22.775 --> 00:25:23.700
HOWARD MARKEL: Well, a
couple of things-- first,

00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:25.408
I can tell your age
because you called it

00:25:25.408 --> 00:25:27.220
Frosted Flakes and not
Sugar Frosted Flakes

00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:27.780
JASON ANDREAS: Sugar
Frosted Flakes.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:28.280
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.800
HOWARD MARKEL: Which is what
they were called in the 1960s.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.540
They are great.

00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:32.850
JASON ANDREAS: Fair.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:34.100
HOWARD MARKEL: They are great.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.450
They're fantastic.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.690
That actually happened after
Will died in the mid '50s.

00:25:39.690 --> 00:25:42.860
There was another CEO
who noticed, particularly

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.990
in the television
era, that cartoon

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:48.810
characters and sugary
cereals sold like hotcakes.

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.380
And of course, they did.

00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:53.480
Will cereals-- he prided
himself on knowing

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.690
a lot about nutrition and
making nutritious cereal.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.620
So his product
line was basically

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.200
Corn Flakes, Rice
Krispies, and bran cereals,

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.180
and later shredded wheat.

00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:09.700
And most of those while
they're not perfect cereals,

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.500
we'd consider them healthier
than the products you just

00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:13.610
mentioned.

00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:15.865
The doctor was against
added sugar completely.

00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:17.240
JASON ANDREAS: In
any way, right?

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.323
HOWARD MARKEL: In any way.

00:26:18.323 --> 00:26:21.620
He called them sugar inebriates.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:28.340
These were not ingredients
that he would have advocated.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.270
And the Kellogg's
Food Company today

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:36.410
is a conglomerate of, I
think, 180 different brands.

00:26:36.410 --> 00:26:38.540
JASON ANDREAS: And many
of them very healthy.

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:40.250
HOWARD MARKEL: Some
healthy, some not.

00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.380
And the other notion
too by the way

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.930
is they're processed
food, which today

00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:46.706
is sort of a dirty, dirty word.

00:26:46.706 --> 00:26:48.830
JASON ANDREAS: Processed,
chemically altered foods.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:50.510
HOWARD MARKEL: But
then it represented

00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:55.160
the advent of modernity because
you took a product, corn,

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.160
and you ran it through five
miles of conveyor belts,

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.220
and baking, and toasting,
and this, and that.

00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:03.050
And it came out a completely
different product, corn flakes,

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:05.030
that does not exist in nature.

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:07.790
You are processing and
manufacturing food.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.480
And so at the time, they were
thought to be very healthy.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.200
What the company does to make
their reputation healthier

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.340
is up to them.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:19.190
They have not asked
me for advice.

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:26.620
But if we think about
wellness and a lot of products

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.210
that the doctor
advocate, including

00:27:28.210 --> 00:27:33.010
soy milk, and almond milk, and
probiotics, and the lifestyle

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:36.490
he suggested, we may
not think of his name.

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:39.760
But we do think of his
prescriptions all the time.

00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.710
And I think the doctor
would have preferred

00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:44.710
to have been known
for that, but was also

00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:49.240
enough of a zealot for
his cause that he'd say,

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:52.240
it's OK as long as people
are living healthier lives.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.680
JASON ANDREAS: You talk a
lot in the book too about--

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.900
you talk about the legacy.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.850
And you mentioned
this as well with

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:00.220
some of the modernization
of some of the foods

00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:03.180
that Kellogg's produces now.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:07.330
About the movement
that Will in particular

00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:09.790
started around just advertising
in general and brand

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.100
advertising, which
we all know so well--

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.110
a lot of us are in
advertising here at Google.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.680
And so that struck a
chord with me as well.

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.590
He spent a lot of
money on advertising

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.650
when Corn Flakes and
subsequent cereals came out.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:28.150
He kind of spearheaded some
of these ideas around jingles,

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.480
and catchphrases, and as you
mentioned, cartoon characters.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:34.480
He also kind of had
some early inclinations

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.220
of how to kind of
market cereals and foods

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.564
in particular to children with
putting toys in cereal boxes.

00:28:40.564 --> 00:28:42.730
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah, he
invented the toy in the box.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:44.479
JASON ANDREAS: A lot
came from him, right?

00:28:44.479 --> 00:28:47.170
It was obviously carried on and
duplicated across the board.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:49.420
I think that's a really
interesting concept too is not

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.961
only were they
revolutionary in terms

00:28:50.961 --> 00:28:52.870
of food production, and
health, and wellness,

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:55.180
but also that extended into
the business world as well.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:56.263
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah, yeah.

00:28:56.263 --> 00:28:57.310
It is incredible.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:58.900
What was so much
fun about this book

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:02.680
is that even though it's about
two brothers in a small city,

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:05.500
it's sort of like spokes on
a wheel of American history

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:10.120
at that time and how Will
seized on advertising

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:13.840
at that moment in 1906 on.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:17.110
It's just when three
and four color printing

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.920
is beginning, when Linotype
machines are being developed,

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:24.840
when national magazines and
newspapers are requiring

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.930
advertisements to
fill their pages.

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:31.960
And his big demographic
were basically

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.450
children, who had
asked their mothers.

00:29:34.450 --> 00:29:36.070
And mothers were the
other demographic

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:37.390
who bought the food.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:41.080
And he advertised to
both those demographics

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.780
fairly well in all
sorts of creative ways

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:46.760
that we now take for granted.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:50.650
And he also was very early
an advertiser on radio, then

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:56.590
television, and I suspect on
Google, and the internet today.

00:29:56.590 --> 00:29:58.600
He was brilliant at that.

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.660
Other things were happening
in American industry too that

00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.820
helped Kellogg's
become Kellogg's.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:08.890
You had a shift from
coal-burning factories

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:13.330
to electrical-powered factories,
so you could start and stop

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:15.800
your conveyor belt at
the push of a button.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.550
You had all sorts of new
machinery, and conveyor belts,

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.800
and toasting ovens, and so on.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.570
You had good railways that
went across the country

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.220
and had refrigerated cars.

00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:30.430
You had clean
pasteurized milk that

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:33.250
was just starting
to be distributed

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:34.690
in America at that time.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:36.580
And you can't have a
bowl of corn flakes

00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.960
unless you have some milk.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.970
So that was going on as well.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.000
You had the telephones.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.900
So Will could call up Iowa
from his Battle Creek office

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:45.560
and say, what's the
corn production?

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:46.310
What's going on?

00:30:46.310 --> 00:30:50.090
And you could instantly make
your plans based on that.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:53.920
And so all these advents
of new technologies

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.500
occurred just when he
was starting his company.

00:30:56.500 --> 00:31:00.680
And so while he was a creator
of a great many things,

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.350
he was also an early adopter
of other people's technologies

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:06.696
and improvements.

00:31:06.696 --> 00:31:08.320
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah,
we had talked too.

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.390
So all of this
information-- this

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:12.490
is all incredibly
interesting stuff.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.147
And the book is quite
thick and filled with lots

00:31:15.147 --> 00:31:16.230
of tidbits of information.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:17.860
We talked before we started.

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.920
This idea that there's
a lot of information

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.930
out there about John,
not so much about Will.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:25.240
A lot of the
information in terms

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:28.840
of biographical information
and documentation around Will

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:32.260
is tightly controlled by the
Kellogg Foundation to this day

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.380
where you actually
have to sign a release

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.970
and potentially give--

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.910
not potentially, but actually
give them some final editing

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:42.490
rights to the information that
you pull from those documents

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:44.110
before they can be published.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.050
How did you gather
so much information

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.136
in terms of-- again, you
mentioned John there's

00:31:49.136 --> 00:31:50.260
quite a bit of information.

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:52.120
But with Will, how did you
pull all of that information

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.000
together?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.980
You also mentioned
at the beginning

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.355
that this is a
bit of a departure

00:31:55.355 --> 00:31:59.269
from your previous work
in terms of working on

00:31:59.269 --> 00:32:01.060
some of the epidemics
and some of the books

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:01.930
that focus on that.

00:32:01.930 --> 00:32:04.450
So what was that process
in terms of research

00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:06.210
looked like for
you in this book?

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.570
And how did it differ
from the other books

00:32:07.570 --> 00:32:08.403
that you've written?

00:32:08.403 --> 00:32:11.290
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah,
well, it is an issue that

00:32:11.290 --> 00:32:13.870
the Kellogg Foundation,
which owns the Kellogg,

00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.540
Will's papers--

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.220
and they're beautifully
archived and lovingly kept.

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.800
You can't get to them unless
you sign such a release.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.160
And no serious writer
or historian can do so.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:28.490
Fortunately, Will wrote
thousands, millions of memos,

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:30.340
which went to other people.

00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.610
You can get a sense
of his advertising

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:37.000
and work from the actual ads.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:40.180
And he sued a great many
people and would be deposed.

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.340
And there's just
stacks of depositions

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:44.090
that are taller than I am.

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.270
And so you got a great
sense of his life,

00:32:46.270 --> 00:32:48.880
and who he was,
how he spoke, how

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.250
he fought with other people.

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.730
So while it wasn't
perfect, I could create

00:32:54.730 --> 00:32:57.970
a rounded portrayal of him.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:01.150
There are also memoirs
of him by his grandson,

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:04.180
privately printed memoirs that
we have at the Bentley library.

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:07.610
So I was lucky to be able
to get access to that.

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.790
And there are a few
biographies and such that

00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.830
had been written in the '50s.

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:13.120
They're corporate biographies.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.670
But they were not unhelpful.

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.840
They actually were very helpful.

00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.460
So how did I do this
compared to my other books?

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.160
In a very similar process.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.760
First of all, you find people
or events that has a great paper

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.840
trail, and not everyone keeps
paper, particularly today,

00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:34.114
but even back then.

00:33:34.114 --> 00:33:35.530
When you design
an experiment, you

00:33:35.530 --> 00:33:38.480
have to make sure there
the experiment can be done.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.380
And so if there's no archival
material, you can't do that.

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:45.190
Now in this case, there was
tons of archival material

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:48.740
even with the limitation
we just discussed.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.430
And then you just jump
in and you read paper.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:54.610
And the more paper you read,
the more ideas you get.

00:33:54.610 --> 00:33:56.527
And it's sort of like
swimming in a deep lake.

00:33:56.527 --> 00:33:57.734
You don't know where you are.

00:33:57.734 --> 00:33:59.290
You don't know
where you're going.

00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:02.590
And then suddenly, thankfully,
at least in my experience,

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.640
you have this moment that's
how it's going to be.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:08.290
And then I told
this to my editor

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:11.350
at the time when I was going to
change the focus from just John

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:12.791
Harvey Kellogg to the brothers.

00:34:12.791 --> 00:34:15.290
She goes, oh, I knew you were
going to do that all the time.

00:34:15.290 --> 00:34:17.123
I said, well, you
could've at least told me.

00:34:17.123 --> 00:34:19.179
You would have saved
me about eight months.

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.770
As a writer, you figure it out.

00:34:21.770 --> 00:34:24.699
I've always been
very blessed with--

00:34:24.699 --> 00:34:26.300
I don't believe
in writer's block.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.139
I believe in not
wanting to write.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:32.455
I write every day even
if I throw it out.

00:34:32.455 --> 00:34:35.920
I'm always interested
in reading about people

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.969
and writing about them.

00:34:36.969 --> 00:34:40.120
And so the more you
play with the topic--

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:42.489
play is not the precise word.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:46.150
The more you work with
the topic you've chosen,

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.330
you figure it out.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:48.080
You figure it out.

00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.679
And it [INAUDIBLE] jigsaw puzzle
work because you're trying

00:34:50.679 --> 00:34:51.340
to create--

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:53.710
at least I do when
I write books.

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:55.840
I'm what's called a
narrative historian.

00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.290
I really want to convey a
story with a beginning, middle,

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.630
and ab end to my readers.

00:35:01.630 --> 00:35:03.340
These are the stories
I like to read.

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:05.840
And I hope my readers
like them as well.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.380
JASON ANDREAS: And with such
a deeply researched book like

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:09.760
the Kellogg's--

00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:11.380
I'm just curious myself--

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:14.260
what's like the
split of time you

00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.880
spend researching to
time you spent writing?

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:21.691
I'm asking because it seems
like you did a ton of research

00:35:21.691 --> 00:35:23.440
on this, and digging
through these stacks,

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.600
and not necessarily having
access to Will's papers,

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.360
and having to go in a roundabout
way to find other methods,

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:35.530
and reading through these piles
of letters and depositions.

00:35:35.530 --> 00:35:37.660
Did that take longer
than your previous books?

00:35:37.660 --> 00:35:39.040
Was there more
research that went

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:41.579
into this because of some of
the slight difficulties in

00:35:41.579 --> 00:35:42.120
finding this?

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.599
So what's the time average on--

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:45.640
I'm just curious as to
what that might look like.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.056
HOWARD MARKEL:
Well, my first book

00:35:47.056 --> 00:35:49.870
was about two epidemics in
1892 within seven months

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:50.740
of each other.

00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:52.240
And it took me seven
years to write.

00:35:56.119 --> 00:35:58.160
But even though there was
a lot of research done,

00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.080
it wasn't a long period of time.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:06.040
And this book was my
longest and most complicated

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:09.640
book because it covers
almost 100 years of history

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:11.440
from about 1830--

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:14.740
actually, more than 100
years-- to about 1951.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.540
And there's a great many
changes that are going on.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:19.060
So first, you get the paper.

00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:20.980
First, you get the
archival materials.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.310
And then you start reading
it either on microfilm or I

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:26.200
like the hard copy.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.020
And then you start taking notes,
and thinking about things,

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.700
and reading more,
and reading more.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.330
It took me about two years
of just reading paper.

00:36:34.330 --> 00:36:36.610
And then I figured
out where I was going.

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.870
And then I started writing it.

00:36:37.870 --> 00:36:39.100
Now I'm a rewriter.

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:41.260
I write things over and
over and over again.

00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.755
And for people out there
who want to be a writer,

00:36:43.755 --> 00:36:47.860
I became a published writer
when I started rewriting.

00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:51.689
And I rewrite things 10, 20, 30,
40 times, probably even more.

00:36:51.689 --> 00:36:52.480
JASON ANDREAS: Wow.

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.000
HOWARD MARKEL: And I will
play with a sentence.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.010
And I'm just lucky
that I enjoy that.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.750
I actually like
playing with sentences

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.240
and trying to make things
more clear, or more

00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.440
exciting, or more interesting.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.459
And so it took another
three years to write.

00:37:07.459 --> 00:37:09.250
But actually this book
from start to finish

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:10.129
took only five years.

00:37:10.129 --> 00:37:11.170
JASON ANDREAS: Less than.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.560
HOWARD MARKEL: And I told
you that first book--

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:12.670
JASON ANDREAS: Seven, yeah.

00:37:12.670 --> 00:37:15.044
HOWARD MARKEL: --20 years ago
or 25 years ago took seven.

00:37:15.044 --> 00:37:16.840
So maybe I'm getting
better at it.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.789
I don't know.

00:37:17.789 --> 00:37:19.330
JASON ANDREAS: Did
your writing style

00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:20.871
have to change for
this book since it

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:24.615
was a bit of a departure from
these stories of epidemics?

00:37:24.615 --> 00:37:25.990
Did you change
your writing style

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.880
or did you keep the same style.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:29.720
Just changed the
story a little bit?

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.136
HOWARD MARKEL: I
think the latter.

00:37:31.136 --> 00:37:36.167
I mean, you can't help
but create a writing style

00:37:36.167 --> 00:37:37.250
if you write a great deal.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:39.200
And I do.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:41.150
I wrote for "The New
York Times" for 10 years.

00:37:41.150 --> 00:37:43.280
Now I write for "PBS NewsHour."

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.730
And I wrote for "Science
Friday" for many years.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:48.850
And I've written many books.

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:52.190
And I also have written for
academic audiences as well as

00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:53.420
a professor.

00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.780
And over a period
of time, you develop

00:37:56.780 --> 00:37:58.850
a way of expressing yourself.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:01.850
And I think I've
gotten better at that.

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:08.340
I feel a greater command
of the pen, so to speak,

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:10.040
on this my eighth
or ninth book--

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:14.720
I've lost count-- than
I was 20 years ago.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.107
I feel I know what I'm doing.

00:38:17.107 --> 00:38:18.440
But the process is very similar.

00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:19.523
It's never really changed.

00:38:19.523 --> 00:38:21.620
And what also has
never changed--

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:26.570
I bring as much joy to my desk
in the morning this morning

00:38:26.570 --> 00:38:28.860
as I did 25 years ago.

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.170
JASON ANDREAS: That's great.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.609
What's next?

00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:32.900
I don't mean to rush you along.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.786
I know this book just--

00:38:34.786 --> 00:38:37.840
I believe it came
out in mid 2017.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.590
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah,
came out last summer.

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.715
JASON ANDREAS: Last summer.

00:38:40.715 --> 00:38:42.792
Yeah, so we're about
12 months past release.

00:38:42.792 --> 00:38:44.000
Are you working on something?

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.610
Are you taking time off?

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:46.965
You said, you're always writing.

00:38:46.965 --> 00:38:47.840
So that's [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.600
HOWARD MARKEL: I start a
book as soon as I finish one.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:50.260
JASON ANDREAS:
Almost immediately.

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:51.205
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah.

00:38:51.205 --> 00:38:51.800
JASON ANDREAS: Never ending.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.090
HOWARD MARKEL: It's a
magnificent obsession.

00:38:54.090 --> 00:38:55.631
JASON ANDREAS: Can
you share with us?

00:38:55.631 --> 00:38:57.650
HOWARD MARKEL: Yeah, sure.

00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:58.220
It's funny.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:01.340
Whenever you do a book
talk by the way, invariably

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.959
the question is, what's next?

00:39:02.959 --> 00:39:04.500
Well, I want to talk
about this book.

00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.915
JASON ANDREAS:
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:06.915 --> 00:39:08.971
You had mentioned
you write every day.

00:39:08.971 --> 00:39:10.220
And sometimes I throw it away.

00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:12.847
And that actually kind of
connected the question.

00:39:12.847 --> 00:39:15.180
Is there something that's out
of that writing every day?

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:17.138
HOWARD MARKEL: I'm just
starting a new book now

00:39:17.138 --> 00:39:20.570
on the discovery of
the structure of DNA,

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:23.970
which is a great story.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:25.550
I was fortunate
enough in October

00:39:25.550 --> 00:39:29.660
to be a research fellow at
the Rockefeller Foundation

00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.117
Center in Bellagio.

00:39:31.117 --> 00:39:32.450
I love saying I was in Bellagio.

00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:36.620
JASON ANDREAS: Not the
casino in Las Vegas.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:36.740
HOWARD MARKEL: No, no,
no, no, no, the real one.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:37.770
JASON ANDREAS: Like
Lake Como [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:38.811
HOWARD MARKEL: Lake Como.

00:39:38.811 --> 00:39:40.442
And the view from my room--

00:39:40.442 --> 00:39:41.900
JASON ANDREAS: Both
very beautiful.

00:39:41.900 --> 00:39:43.816
HOWARD MARKEL: Oh, the
view I had from my room

00:39:43.816 --> 00:39:44.910
was just incredible.

00:39:44.910 --> 00:39:45.800
And I would read.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:48.020
I thought to
myself, what's next?

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.750
And I thought of
writing a long big book

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:52.100
of American medical history.

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:54.470
But it was too
choppy and episodic.

00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:57.500
And as I was saying, I'm
a narrative historian.

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.440
It's sort of like the equivalent
of a short story collection

00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.420
as opposed to a novel
when you're telling

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:04.360
a longer type of a story.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:07.940
And I thought to myself, well,
are there any light switch

00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.280
moments that everyone
sort of understands

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.250
that changed everything
in terms of how

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:14.580
we understand the human body?

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.570
Because I'm a physician
and historian in medicine.

00:40:17.570 --> 00:40:20.720
And I had just taught
to my medical students--

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:25.280
before I left, we have a
class I call Great Papers,

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.530
sort of great books.

00:40:26.530 --> 00:40:29.570
And we take great papers
from the history of medicine

00:40:29.570 --> 00:40:31.480
and talk about them
and what the context,

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.250
the historical times
were, and so on.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.580
And we read the Watson and
Crick paper from "Nature"

00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:40.460
in 1953, which is an
amazingly short paper.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.080
It's 900 words.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.650
And there's not a
scintilla of data.

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:45.050
It's all theory.

00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:47.600
It was the work of
Wilkins and Franklin

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.990
that did the X-ray
crystallography studies that

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:55.130
proved Watson and Crick's theory
correct about the double helix.

00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:57.980
And there's several books
about the double helix,

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.459
mostly by participants.

00:40:59.459 --> 00:41:01.250
And the more I read,
I thought, this really

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:05.000
needs a more fully-rounded
historical account.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.686
And my literary agent
and my publisher

00:41:08.686 --> 00:41:10.310
agreed, which is
always a good feeling.

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:11.434
JASON ANDREAS: That's good.

00:41:11.434 --> 00:41:13.970
HOWARD MARKEL: And, in
fact, in a couple of weeks,

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:16.714
I'll be meeting with Dr.
Watson to interview him.

00:41:16.714 --> 00:41:17.630
So I'm just thrilled--

00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:18.260
JASON ANDREAS: Oh,
that's exciting.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.460
HOWARD MARKEL: --to
have that chance.

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:21.380
And, of course, I've been
going through the archives

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:22.010
quite a bit.

00:41:22.010 --> 00:41:24.860
I was in England for
about a month and a half

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.660
at Cambridge where
they did their work

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.360
and a lot of the
participants papers are

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.010
as well as U. London.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:33.230
And I'll be going to
Cold Spring Harbor where

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.180
Dr. Watson's papers are.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.820
And then I'll get to Dr. Crick's
papers, which are in San Diego.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:41.180
So I'm having a ball.

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.160
And I just started it.

00:41:42.160 --> 00:41:44.690
JASON ANDREAS: Yeah, so
you're early in that research

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:47.005
phase of just absorbing
as much as you can

00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:49.130
and trying to figure out
where the story takes you.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:50.088
HOWARD MARKEL: Exactly.

00:41:50.088 --> 00:41:52.785
And somebody once asked, well,
what part of writing a book

00:41:52.785 --> 00:41:53.285
do you like?

00:41:53.285 --> 00:41:54.850
And, well, I like them all.

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:57.710
And so I like this
phase that I'm doing.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:00.530
Writing is not-- there's
this romantic view.

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:03.020
When I go to a party, people
go, well, I have a book in me.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:07.140
And I often think, well, maybe
that's where it should stay.

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:09.830
But, yeah, writing is hard work.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.070
But it's wonderful work.

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:11.990
I love the writing.

00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.280
I love the rewriting.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.272
I love the editing process,
working with a good editor.

00:42:16.272 --> 00:42:17.605
I love when it's set in galleys.

00:42:17.605 --> 00:42:19.910
You can start to see
what it's looking like.

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.800
I love talking about
it once it's done.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:25.124
So it beats a real job
any day of the week.

00:42:25.124 --> 00:42:26.415
It's been a really good career.

00:42:26.415 --> 00:42:27.682
JASON ANDREAS: That's awesome.

00:42:27.682 --> 00:42:29.390
Well, we'll have to
have you back in when

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:30.330
the next book comes out.

00:42:30.330 --> 00:42:31.100
Not to pressure you [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:32.030
HOWARD MARKEL: Give
me a couple of years.

00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.810
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:34.730
JASON ANDREAS: Call us in a few
years when it's ready to go.

00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:35.120
HOWARD MARKEL: I will.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:35.810
JASON ANDREAS: We'll
get you back in.

00:42:35.810 --> 00:42:36.570
HOWARD MARKEL: Great, great.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:37.820
JASON ANDREAS: Well, listen,
thank you, Dr. Markel.

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:38.870
Thank you for sharing.

00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:40.590
Like I said, the
book is fantastic.

00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:42.770
I really enjoyed
it front to back.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.330
I really did.

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:46.604
Very historically relevant
and also relevant to

00:42:46.604 --> 00:42:47.520
what's going on today.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.390
There's so many pages
where I was like, oh, this

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.130
is tying so many
things together for me

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:55.220
that I hadn't known from
health and wellness all the way

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.600
to pop culture.

00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.329
Very interesting
across the board.

00:42:58.329 --> 00:42:59.120
Thanks for sharing.

00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.070
Best of luck with
everything moving forward,

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:01.955
the research phase.

00:43:01.955 --> 00:43:03.080
Thank you again for coming.

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:03.350
HOWARD MARKEL: Thank
you for having me.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:04.080
JASON ANDREAS: We
really appreciate it.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:04.460
HOWARD MARKEL:
Thank you very much.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.501
JASON ANDREAS: Thank you.

00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:08.110
[APPLAUSE]
