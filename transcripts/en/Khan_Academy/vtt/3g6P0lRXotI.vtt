00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.770
After the farmer
and the pie chain

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.100
get involved in this
forward contract,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.200
a few questions start to pop
up in each of their minds.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.890
The main one is, what
if the other party isn't

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.700
able to uphold their
end of the contract?

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.550
And this is called counterparty
risk, which is essentially,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.570
the counterparty to the
farmer is the pie store.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.730
And the counterparty to the
pie chain is the farmer.

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.240
It is the risk that
the other party

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.630
won't be able to uphold
their end of the contract.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.120
The other thing that starts
to worry either one of these

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.995
is what if they start
to have second thoughts

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.580
about this forward
contract they entered into.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.330
Would they be able to
maybe sell their obligation

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.680
to someone else?

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.890
So is there any way
to trade the contract?

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.670
And then there's another
issue, that even if you

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.460
were to trade the
contract, how do

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.510
we know that the other party
to the whoever you might want

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.170
to trade with would be cool with
a million pounds, or $200,000.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.790
Maybe they would want to
deal with a smaller quantity.

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.739
Maybe they would only
want 1,000 pounds

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.000
or $100,000 worth of apples.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.680
So the local brain
comes up with an idea.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.760
He's like, why
don't we standardize

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.670
these forward contracts?

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.250
Why don't I just create a
bunch of contracts, whenever

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.740
someone wants to enter to one
of these forward contract,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.070
but I standardize them.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.050
And I say that it is 1,000,
instead of having a million

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.760
apples, I do a small
enough increment.

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:39.700
So I say 1,000 pounds of apples
for the delivery on let's say

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.390
on November 15.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.980
And every one of these
contracts say the same thing.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.480
1,000 pounds of apples
for delivery on 11/15.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.080
And this guy, he's also
the richest guy in town.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.270
He's already been
running a stock exchange.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.270
And so to help alleviate
the counterparty risk fear,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.770
he also says that I'm
going to guarantee

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.980
any of these contracts.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:10.110
So essentially he's taking on
all of the counterparty risk

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.370
to make people more
comfortable with trading.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.550
So all of a sudden, what
happens is that now these guys

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.750
don't have to do a
one off contract.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.440
They don't have to do this
one off the forward contract.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.480
There are these
standardized contracts

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.000
that this exchange
can now trade.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.950
And what happens is
that smaller farmers.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.560
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.530
You have farmer A,
farmer B. Farmer B

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.030
can now can now transact
with, I should say,

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:49.240
I guess we could call it
customer C and customer D.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.590
Where they could agree
to have a fixed price,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.200
but they could do
smaller increments,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.052
more granular increments.

00:02:55.052 --> 00:02:56.760
And if any of them
want to get out of it,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.660
they can by selling
their contract

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.890
to another person
on the exchange.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.260
And these more standardized
forward contracts, they're

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.057
still essentially
the same thing.

00:03:05.057 --> 00:03:06.140
They're just standardized.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.470
They're agreements to
transact at a future date,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.720
give a certain amount of
money for a certain amount

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.950
of something else.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.260
It could be a security.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.840
It could be apples.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.200
These things, these standardized
forward contracts, these

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.040
are called futures, where
they're standardized,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.596
and they are traded
on an exchange.
