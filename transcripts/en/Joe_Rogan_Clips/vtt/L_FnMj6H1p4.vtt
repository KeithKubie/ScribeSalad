00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.460
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.210
<v 1>I think if there's a real concern about Ai,</v>

3
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.580
I think the real concern is AI is going to rationally analyze our behavior and

4
00:00:10.581 --> 00:00:15.581
our reliance on emotions and all these human rewards systems that we have built

5
00:00:16.311 --> 00:00:20.270
in the way it's affecting our society and the way it's affecting how we govern

6
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:22.970
ourselves and how we behave amongst ourselves.

7
00:00:22.971 --> 00:00:27.330
And it's gonna think we're unfixable.
It's going to look at it like,
well,
this is,

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.150
this is,
they have too much monkey in them.

9
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.450
They have so much monkey instincts and monkey DNA.

10
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:36.820
But now they live in this rational,
modern world of,
you know,

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:41.830
five g internet on your phone and satellite communication and 24,

12
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:46.160
seven news cycle.
But yet they have these primate jeans

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.850
<v 0>officially intelligence,
uh,
subjects about,</v>

14
00:00:48.851 --> 00:00:53.851
which I know very little seems to me that it would on some level behalf to be

15
00:00:54.311 --> 00:00:59.050
derived from a particular aspect of human understanding of rationalism.

16
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.060
So we're represent in one aspect of our nature and prioritizing it.
Logic,

17
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.740
uh,
organization.

18
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.100
But what you refer to is sort of primitive and monkey ish for me envelops and

19
00:01:13.211 --> 00:01:16.990
involves the most beautiful aspects of our nature.

20
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.530
I'm a little romantic about human being still.

21
00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.120
I still feel that.

22
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.710
I feel that one of the great problems we've had is that philosophically we have

23
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.450
overvalued materialism rationalism and like kind of knowing a little bit about

24
00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:35.620
philosophy primarily from that bloody podcast that you and I tagged a minute ago

25
00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:39.290
before we was recording.
Who's that as far as this.
So like what,

26
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.130
why understand for that?
He's like punished enlightenment.

27
00:01:42.131 --> 00:01:44.260
We've started to prioritize rationalism.

28
00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:46.600
So if you prioritize rationalism and organization,

29
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:47.890
which obviously has a lot to offer,

30
00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:51.430
the organization of resources is incredibly in,
hugely important.

31
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.600
You forget that a huge part of the human experience is nothing to do with that.

32
00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.340
The other thing we were chatting about before we went live with DMT now know

33
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.140
artificial intelligence is going to understand that there is access to a realm

34
00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:10.141
of consciousness that continually exists that doesn't seem to be bound by

35
00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:12.370
physical laws as we understand them.

36
00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.290
And if the physical laws that we abide by our parochial and relevant only to

37
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:21.220
this level of existence,
why are we allowing ideas,

38
00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:24.680
resources from there to govern all of our systems.
You know,

39
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:26.890
it will even listen to you talk about the empty and you know,

40
00:02:26.891 --> 00:02:28.330
I encountered these gestures.

41
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:33.220
I their gestures are went through this membrane into another realm and checking

42
00:02:33.221 --> 00:02:35.820
out Mike Tyson when he was on here.
No,
no,
no.
Yeah,

43
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.710
I love that moment was so amazing.

44
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.420
Like a clear like you know,
I only,

45
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:48.400
I took acid when I was a teenager and even in very unhealthy can,

46
00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:52.270
no,
I'm healthy but Blatt,
unbridled,
mad teenage boy conditions.
I,
you know,

47
00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:55.180
I want to be there with a guy in a lab coat with a pen and going,
well Mr Brian,

48
00:02:55.181 --> 00:02:59.260
sit down and look at these Rorschach tests instead of which I'm in new cross,

49
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.460
in a bed set,
dropping acid and staring at my own hands and recognizing,

50
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:07.120
oh my God,
I am not me.
The very idea of me as a construct,

51
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:12.010
I'm just tuned into a particular aspect.
I AI,
we'll build a systems that are,

52
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.780
that are predicated on rationalism organization and I uh,
on on,

53
00:03:16.781 --> 00:03:18.910
on that basically I can see why they would at some point.
Yeah,

54
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:22.540
go all sky net and then I lay us.
But that is,

55
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.730
I believe the problem with our society is that the materialistic aspect of our

56
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:29.830
nature is not the priority.

57
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:32.740
It's just one thing we should be doing because we need good roads,

58
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:35.140
calls me in the hospitals,
schools,
food,
et cetera.

59
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.750
But we need to find a way of honoring the sacred.

60
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.460
And I'm fascinated in the experiences you're having in these psychedelic

61
00:03:42.461 --> 00:03:46.120
explorations and how it's influencing the rest of your life.

62
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.860
Like how you're saying like how your,

63
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.490
how does it influence the rest of your decisions,
the way you see the world,

64
00:03:51.491 --> 00:03:52.510
the way you see relationships,

65
00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:56.860
the way you see the vulnerable young man you were prior to building your own

66
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.980
Isay personal religion of Marcia Lars,

67
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.770
excellence in your chosen field of standup comedy.

68
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.040
How do you incorporate that vulnerable kid?

69
00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:09.160
Cause I'm still very aware of the vulnerable person.
I was like,

70
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.700
I'm going on a rant man.
Um,

71
00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.830
like when Kevin Hart was on here who I think he's amazing and he was amazing on

72
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:17.260
this,
I fought fucking know like,
well I've,

73
00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:21.710
I've got to offer the world when Kevin Hart has got this kind of force,

74
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.580
you don't come in the bubble.
And not while I was like,
my God,

75
00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.270
this guy is so positive.
What a role model while he's got to offer.

76
00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.350
And then I thought,
well like any of us,
well I've got to offer is who I am.

77
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.620
Just who I am as a vulnerable floors,
human being.

78
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.830
There's still feels connected to the kid I was when I didn't feel good enough.

79
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:42.930
I still feel that I can walk in a room and filled out.
But I also know that,

80
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.120
that that's not real because I've had spiritual experiences,

81
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.740
hallucinogenic experiences that make me feel that the relationships we should be

82
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:55.150
building half the honor,
that we are both,
we are vulnerable and flawed,

83
00:04:55.151 --> 00:04:58.150
but also capable of greatness.
There has to be room for all of this.

84
00:04:58.151 --> 00:05:01.030
And I feel that part of what we're doing and part of why we're experiencing such

85
00:05:01.031 --> 00:05:03.790
superficial polarity in politics and culture,

86
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.870
it's cause we're not acknowledging that underneath this surface activity of
left,

87
00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:11.320
right,
left,
right.
And you know,
from Sam Harris,
them little experiments,

88
00:05:11.321 --> 00:05:13.280
you stick garbage in front of a pest.
I'm on there.

89
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.510
They become Republican pretty quickly.
Or You,
you know,
you scare people,

90
00:05:16.511 --> 00:05:18.250
they become less democratic.
You know,

91
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.270
I think all that stuff is pretty superficial and at depth in that realm of the

92
00:05:22.271 --> 00:05:25.000
gestures and the membrane of Psychedelia,

93
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.690
we have access to oneness and that should be what's influencing the way we set

94
00:05:28.691 --> 00:05:30.720
up our tribes,
our systems,
and our relationships.
