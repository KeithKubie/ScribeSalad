suppose watching both Noah and Brad that
they<00:11:40.830><c> say</c><00:11:41.070><c> is</c><00:11:41.220><c> probably</c><00:11:41.340><c> just</c><00:11:41.550><c> building</c><00:11:41.880><c> for</c>

the fourth one um okay I the two movies
 

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
the fourth one um okay I the two movies
because<00:11:47.370><c> they</c><00:11:47.520><c> could</c><00:11:47.700><c> be</c><00:11:47.820><c> self-contained</c><00:11:48.360><c> as</c>

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:48.570 align:start position:0%
because they could be self-contained as
 

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
because they could be self-contained as
well<00:11:49.250><c> and</c><00:11:50.250><c> there</c><00:11:50.490><c> was</c><00:11:50.700><c> nothing</c><00:11:51.210><c> in</c><00:11:51.330><c> here</c><00:11:51.540><c> that</c>

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:51.570 align:start position:0%
well and there was nothing in here that
 

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.570 align:start position:0%
well and there was nothing in here that
directly<00:11:51.990><c> said</c><00:11:52.320><c> to</c><00:11:52.500><c> be</c><00:11:52.620><c> continued</c><00:11:53.160><c> or</c><00:11:53.310><c> another</c>

directly said to be continued or another
 

00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
directly said to be continued or another
it's<00:11:53.700><c> not</c><00:11:53.850><c> like</c><00:11:54.000><c> Empire</c><00:11:54.330><c> Strikes</c><00:11:54.600><c> Back</c><00:11:54.750><c> where</c>

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:55.170 align:start position:0%
it's not like Empire Strikes Back where
 

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.700 align:start position:0%
it's not like Empire Strikes Back where
obviously<00:11:55.440><c> there's</c><00:11:56.160><c> gonna</c><00:11:56.340><c> be</c><00:11:56.520><c> another</c><00:11:56.790><c> one</c>

00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:57.710 align:start position:0%
