00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.450
BERLIN CRYSTAL
KELLY: To me there

00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.533
was always the dream of
do really well in finance.

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:06.850
And I wrote down my goal is to
make money and help the world.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.900
I had climbed my way up
through a large multinational

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.950
organization.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.900
It was really about
the bottom line.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.710
My lifestyle was going from
my cubicle to a bar stool

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.180
to my bed and back.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.370
It wasn't the best for me.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.220
NARRATOR: This is Berlin
Crystal Kelly, and many of us

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.110
can probably relate
to her dilemma,

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.090
working endlessly to climb
the corporate ladder,

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.520
but feeling stuck, uninspired.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.520
Berlin decided she'd had enough.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.400
LAURA LING: So then what
compelled you to make a change?

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.960
BERLIN CRYSTAL KELLY: I'd always
wanted to have my own company.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.850
I decided I was
only going to do it

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.830
if I felt like there was
something meaningful I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.294
could do with it, tie it into
something meaningful somehow.

00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:47.960
NARRATOR: Like many
young entrepreneurs,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.850
Berlin wanted to
create something

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.570
that valued both the planet
and profits in equal measure,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.810
so she started Proud Pour,
a wine label that helps

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.977
fund environmental programs.

00:00:57.977 --> 00:00:59.685
BERLIN CRYSTAL KELLY:
We spend about half

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:01.790
of our money on rebuilding
these ecosystems,

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.082
and half of our
money on the wine.

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:05.540
To me it's really
important that we

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.560
start with fixing our planet,
so we pay the causes first.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.450
NARRATOR: For the past
two years Proud Pour

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.820
has been helping to
fund the Billion Oyster

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.210
Project, an organization
that restores oyster reefs

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.280
in the Hudson River estuary.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.720
This habitat once supported
220,000 acres of reefs,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.840
before they were destroyed
by over harvesting, dredging,

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.280
and pollution.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.290
LAURA LING: Why are oysters
so important to the ecosystem?

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.450
BERLIN CRYSTAL KELLY: So
there's a lot of benefits.

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.320
One is that one oyster cleans
30 gallons of water per day.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.750
The other thing is that
oysters create reefs,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.430
just like coral reefs do.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.560
So when those reefs
come in, you also

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.080
get the crab, sea horses,
starfish, sea bass, shrimp,

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.900
everything else starts to
come back and regenerate.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.790
NARRATOR: Naturally
formed oyster reefs are

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.100
dependent on old oyster shells.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.370
Young oysters settle on these
old shells and over time,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.500
a reef system is established.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.470
The Billion Oyster
Project reuses shells

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.700
from New York restaurants
to engineer this process.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.870
These commercially
farmed oysters help

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.960
form the foundation upon
which new wild oysters

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.897
can settle and ultimately
rebuild the reef.

00:02:12.897 --> 00:02:14.480
BERLIN CRYSTAL KELLY:
For every bottle

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.410
we produce, we restore
100 oysters locally.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.710
And in we've, been able to
restore over 3 million oysters

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:22.664
so far.

00:02:22.664 --> 00:02:24.080
The wine was also
really delicious

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.020
and sustainably grown,
so it fit our model,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.041
so it really worked out.

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:30.290
LAURA LING: And I hear it
goes very well with oysters.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.748
BERLIN CRYSTAL
KELLY: Yes, it does.

00:02:31.748 --> 00:02:34.970
That was part of the idea was
that it would pair with oysters

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.730
and more people would be,
hopefully eating oysters

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.780
with this wine.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.720
I figured why not
use that industry

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.330
to help connect people
to the local environment

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.860
and make a change.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.440
LAURA LING: You can drink
your wine, have some oysters,

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.050
and feel as though
you are contributing

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.965
to the regeneration and
revitalization of these reefs.

00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:56.090
BERLIN CRYSTAL KELLY: Yeah.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.580
LAURA LING: Who knew that
oysters had such power?

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.290
BERLIN CRYSTAL KELLY: I thought
nobody really knows about this,

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.010
and this is crazy,
and it's so important.

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.889
And it's a solvable problem.

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.430
NARRATOR: And Berlin is hoping
socially conscious millennials

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.990
will help make the difference.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.720
A generation that's
redefining consumerism

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.295
by rewarding companies that
practice social responsibility.

00:03:14.295 --> 00:03:15.920
BERLIN CRYSTAL KELLY:
Forty-two percent

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.100
of the wine consumed last
year was by millennials.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.050
But those same millennials
also really care

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.180
about global issues,
environmental issues,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.076
social justice.

00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:26.450
They're willing to spend more
to support a company that's

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.740
doing good work.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.300
NARRATOR: Proud
Pour was recently

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.600
featured on Wine Awesomeness,
an online wine club that

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.540
highlights distinctive wine
labels and the unique stories

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:36.410
behind them.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.450
It's this kind of
support that's helping

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.189
Berlin's company expand.

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:42.230
LAURA LING: So what's next
for you and the label?

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.650
BERLIN CRYSTAL KELLY: I was
just in Oregon yesterday

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.160
and this weekend, talking
with our next winemakers

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.830
about our Pinot
Noir, that's going

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.091
to be the pollinator Pinot.

00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:54.590
We're going to use
the sales of that

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.650
to help native bee
species by planting 3,500

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.390
wild flowers for every bottle.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.890
I think it could
really change the role.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.831
