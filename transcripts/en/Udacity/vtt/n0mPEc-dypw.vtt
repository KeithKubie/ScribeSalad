00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now what I want you to do is write for me the code for the function solve.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Solve takes an unfilled formula with letters in it,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and if it can find a solution in which you can fill in all the digits,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it returns the string with the digits filled in properly.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If not, it should return None.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Put your code here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You can assume that we already have the correct definition of what

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
a valid filled-in formula is.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
You can assume that we have a function called "fill_in" that I'm not showing yet.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Fill_in takes a formula and generates a collection of all the possible filling ins of the letters.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You pass it the string ODD plus ODD equals EVEN,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and it passes you back first string filled in with, say, a 1 for the O and a 2 for the Ds and so on.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Then the next string filled in with different numbers filling in each of the possible digits,

00:01:01.000 --> 09:59:59.000
and so on and so on.
