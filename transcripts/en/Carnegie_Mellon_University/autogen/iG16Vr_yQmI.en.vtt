education and technology empowerment and
 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:24.029
education and technology empowerment and
that's a little unusual because what we

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:24.039
that's a little unusual because what we
 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:25.890
that's a little unusual because what we
are all about is empowering people with

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900
are all about is empowering people with
 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.019
are all about is empowering people with
technology to change their own world and

very important empowerment project so I

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439
very important empowerment project so I
 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:33.750
very important empowerment project so I
have to start by telling you how i got

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760
have to start by telling you how i got
 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.030
have to start by telling you how i got
empowered about electric cars and how

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040
empowered about electric cars and how
 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.920
empowered about electric cars and how
that's led to where we are now so these

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930
that's led to where we are now so these
 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.110
that's led to where we are now so these
are the two cars that I have built in my

that they have to engender community

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939
that they have to engender community
 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.840
that they have to engender community
engagement just with these two cars with

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850
engagement just with these two cars with
 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.609
engagement just with these two cars with
the one on the left I understood and

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619
the one on the left I understood and
 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.200
the one on the left I understood and
appreciated how elegantly simple

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210
appreciated how elegantly simple
 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.510
appreciated how elegantly simple
electric cars can be because they have

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520
electric cars can be because they have
 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.340
electric cars can be because they have
so few moving parts less than one

the community at large is about the idea

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509
the community at large is about the idea
 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.599
the community at large is about the idea
of electric car transportation I drive

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609
of electric car transportation I drive
 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.099

batteries does it have questions like
 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.989
batteries does it have questions like
these and so in fact what we determined

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:45.999
these and so in fact what we determined
 

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:48.239
these and so in fact what we determined
with this car which again is elegantly

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.090
works in the winter works in the summer
no problem is that the range it has

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100
no problem is that the range it has
 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.879
no problem is that the range it has
which is 120 miles and the way that we

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:56.889
which is 120 miles and the way that we

that don't have the kind of street noise

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229
that don't have the kind of street noise
 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.790
that don't have the kind of street noise
that we that leads to loud streets and

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800
that we that leads to loud streets and
 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.590
that we that leads to loud streets and
crowded streets and polluted streets on

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600
crowded streets and polluted streets on
 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.800

so that's where this project began and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400
so that's where this project began and
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.850
so that's where this project began and
now the beauty of having a robotics lab

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860
now the beauty of having a robotics lab
 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.340
now the beauty of having a robotics lab
is that you can have your students hack

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350
is that you can have your students hack
 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.830
is that you can have your students hack
commercial vehicles so in fact we hacked

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
commercial vehicles so in fact we hacked
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.960
commercial vehicles so in fact we hacked
that electric car got into its computer

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970
that electric car got into its computer
 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.930
that electric car got into its computer
system and started to note what kind of

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940
system and started to note what kind of
 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.730
system and started to note what kind of
measurements of power there are going in

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740
measurements of power there are going in
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.230
measurements of power there are going in
and out from the batteries to the motors

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240
and out from the batteries to the motors
 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.060
and out from the batteries to the motors
and back and that was interesting

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070
and back and that was interesting
 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.710
and back and that was interesting
because we weren't expecting something

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720
because we weren't expecting something
 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.840
because we weren't expecting something
that has so much noise up and down as

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850
that has so much noise up and down as
 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:41.970
that has so much noise up and down as
you can see there's a whole lot of

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980
you can see there's a whole lot of
 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.980
you can see there's a whole lot of
discharge events below the flat horizon

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990
discharge events below the flat horizon
 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.290
discharge events below the flat horizon
line and is a great deal of charging

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300
line and is a great deal of charging
 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.700

events for instance when you're stopping

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:47.710
events for instance when you're stopping
 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.530
events for instance when you're stopping
at a red light or a going down a hill

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540
at a red light or a going down a hill
 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.480
at a red light or a going down a hill
that's all the peaks that are going up

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:51.490
that's all the peaks that are going up
 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.670
that's all the peaks that are going up
above the horizon what was interesting

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680
above the horizon what was interesting
 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920
above the horizon what was interesting
about that is the idea that an electric

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930
about that is the idea that an electric
 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.600
about that is the idea that an electric
cars battery is doing something that

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610
cars battery is doing something that
 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.770
