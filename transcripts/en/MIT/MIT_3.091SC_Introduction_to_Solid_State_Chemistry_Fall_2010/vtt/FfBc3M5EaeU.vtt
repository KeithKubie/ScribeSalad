PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.150
Settle down.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:25.890
Settle down.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.770
The weekend doesn't start
until after the lecture.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.740
First we learn.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.030
All right.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.920
So couple of announcements, the
big one being the reminder

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.490
about that little celebration
next Wednesday, coverage

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.500
through the end of the lecture
on Monday, there'll be no

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.160
weekly quiz next Tuesday, and
Hilary wanted me to announce

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.200
that there's a job opening for
someone who's in class

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.690
anyways, and wants to-- if you
take decent notes and your

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.250
handwriting is legible, you want
to make $9 an hour, go

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.630
see Hilary.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.980
All right.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.060
Let's get into the lesson.

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:00.200
Got a lot to cover today.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.940
Last day, we were looking at
the formation of molecular

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.120
orbitals by linear combination
of atomic orbitals into

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.050
molecular orbitals.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.710
So we had our SLI six-letter
initialization, and we saw the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.800
formation of sigma and pi
molecular orbitals.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.620
And the way you distinguish
between sigma and pi is based

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.610
on electron distribution.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.210
Specifically, in a sigma
molecular orbital, you have

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.920
continuous electron density
between the nuclei.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.410
That is to say, no holiday.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.350
So I've drawn a sigma orbital
here where I've taken two P

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.140
orbitals lying on their sides,
so they're bonding

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.590
longitudinally and when the
bond is formed, the one

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.360
nitrogen nucleus is here and the
other nitrogen nucleus is

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.020
here and you can see that
there's continuous electron

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.620
density, no holidays between
the two nuclei.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.660
So this would be called
a sigma bond.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.270
The pi molecular orbital, on
the other hand, has a nodal

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.270
plane containing both nuclei.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.430
So since the nuclei are in a
nodal plane, that means that

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.650
you've got to have two lobes,
one above the plane and one

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.440
below the plane, and
that's shown here.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.670
This is the example of nitrogen,
where it forms both

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.930
sigma and pi bonds and to form
the pi bonds, you take the

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.390
lateral smearing.

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.340
And so this is what
I call the 88.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.670
If you take the 88, you're
going to make a pi bond.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.310
So that's lateral smearing
of the p atomic orbitals.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.240
And the last thing I want to
make sure that you appreciate

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:40.230
is that when you form multiple
bonds, you have to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.280
have sigma and pi.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.780
You can only form one sigma
bond because you have no

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.890
holidays between the two nuclei
so now you can't go and

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.110
invade that same space
with a second bond.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.310
So that means you're going to
have to get beyond that zone

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.360
and that means you have
to go into pi.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.020
So if we've got only
bond, it's a sigma.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.310
If you've got two, it's
a sigma and a pi.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.530
If it's three, it's a
sigma and two pis.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.080
That's what we saw in the
case of nitrogen.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.510
I didn't complete it here, but
there's two pi bonds because

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.530
this is a triple bond.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.490
So there's a sigma and
there's two pi's.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.880
One pi is shown here, and that's
vertical to the board,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.180
and the other pi is the sigma
x, which would be orthogonal

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.330
coming in and out of the
plane of the board.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.950
So those smear give us two of
these and then we've got the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.040
sigma bond.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.630
And we even extended this to
hybrid systems, and towards

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.900
the end of the lecture, we
looked at ethylene, and I just

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.120
wanted to come back to that for
a second because I raced

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.050
through it there.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.540
And so we wanted to look at
C2H4, which is ethylene.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.010
And in the case of C2H4, we
recognized that when we went

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.110
through the Lewis structure, we
had a molecule that looked

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.410
like this, and the thing to note
here is that we have a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.770
double bond.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.710
So once you see this double
bond, then that means I'm

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.160
going to need a mix
of sigma and pi.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.450
Now earlier we had
studied methane--

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.240
methane, which was CH4, and to
get methane, we hybridize sp3.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.170
sp3, which gave us four
identical struts coming off

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.280
the carbon.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.910
Well, we recognized that
wouldn't work here because we

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.350
needed to make a sigma and a pi
so the gambit here was to

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.820
reserve a p orbital.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.875
Reserve a p orbital.

00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:35.300
Don't combine all of the
three p orbitals.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.410
Combine only two of the p's and
that gave us sp2 plus a p.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.170
And the box notation for
that looked like this.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.660
Here's the p orbital that's
not been hybridized.

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.500
These are the sp2 orbitals that
are a mix of S, and I've

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.080
taken two of the p's
and I'm leaving

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.130
one of the p's unmixed.

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.110
And now I've got four electrons
to put in here and

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.550
that's where I ran out
of gas last day.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.280
I have to put the fourth
electron in here.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.820
These are still degenerate.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.710
So now I've got still
the capability of

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.230
forming four bonds.

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:09.460
You can see-- whenever you
see carbon, there's an

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.210
interesting--

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.940
just something to train your
eye, if you see carbon in a

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.320
structure, you need four sticks
coming out of the

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.980
carbon, or else there's
a spelling error.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.050
So look here.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.150
This is carbon with
four hydrogens.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.140
One, two, three, four.

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.890
This is carbon one,
two, three, four.

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:26.710
Here's a carbon one,
two, three, four.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.730
It's always got four struts.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:29.950
That's not what's
different here.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.150
It's the arrangement
of the struts.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.340
These are all four going at 109
degrees in three space.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.860
This one is going to have
three of them identical,

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.650
because we studied last day
the principle that equal

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:52.070
energies, equal bond
energies, imply--

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.500
I want to get the
spelling here.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.240
Equal bond energies imply equal
spatial disposition.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.210
Equal spatial disposition
of those bonds.

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.100
So if we have four bonds of
equal energy, we have the

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:06.890
tetrahedron.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.890
If we have three bonds of equal
energy, how do I take

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:13.650
three sticks coming out of a
central carbon and make them

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.310
uniformly distributed
in space?

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.360
They're going to lie in a plane
and they're going to be

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.250
120 degrees apart.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.070
That's the consequence of
having this structure.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.700
All of this follow and why
did we get to this?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.280
Octet.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.020
So here we are.

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.400
Here's the three of them and
here the fourth bond is p, and

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.880
it's normal to the plane of the
board, and now we can take

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.490
one of these and bond it to
another one, bring them in

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:42.600
along here.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.010
This is an sp2 and an
sp2 and they bond to

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.540
make a sigma bond.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.110
How do I know?

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.850
Look, no holidays.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.740
Continuous electron density.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.490
And now in the plane normal to
the board, I have lateral

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.920
smearing, and I make a pi.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.170
So I've got a sigma and a pi.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:03.010
That gives me the double bond
and let me just show you the

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.650
cartoons here because we've
got some nice artistic

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.770
renderings.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:09.390
So here we are.

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.350
This is the top view of the
three sp2's and then the p's

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:14.630
are vertical.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.640
so we're going to move along the
z axis, bring two of these

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.260
together-- there's the smearing
of the sp2's on axis.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.460
So this is a sigma bond, No
electron density holidays from

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:30.730
one nucleus to the other, and
now we're going to smear the

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:38.120
lobes of the p orbitals
of the unmixed carbon.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.690
That gives us the double
bond and there we are.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:42.530
This is the same thing
taken from your book.

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.670
This is the sigma orbital and
then chemists like to do this.

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:48.560
You see this sort
of slashed line?

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.430
It sort of indicates
it's receding.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.970
It's going into the plane and
then these are coming out.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.340
This hydrogen is coming out at
us and that other one's going

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:00.250
way, way in the back and this
is in the plane and there's

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:04.830
the lobes colored is they
irritate me always.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:07.840
By the way, they've chosen to
make this the z-axis, which I

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.080
don't like.

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.950
The z-axis should be the axis
along which they bond.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.620
And then here's acetylene.

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:18.910
Acetylene is a compound
that C2H2.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.650
C2H2, and I'm not going to
go through this in class.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:24.650
You can try it when you have
nothing else to do.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.170
and so it's got a triple bond.

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.800
it's got a triple bond between
the carbons and then hydrogens

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.490
on either side.

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:35.150
Again, look at the carbon:
one, two, three, four.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.400
But now we're going to have to
have two lateral smears, so

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.320
that means I'm only going to
take one of the p orbitals and

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.170
leave two in reserve.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.890
so when I do that, I'm going to
end up with this, starting

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.030
with the box notation.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:55.680
Here's carbon as it would
exist without any

00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.970
hybridization.

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.500
An S and three p orbitals.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.130
And what I want to do--

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.460
I want to have two pi's and a
sigma, so I'm going to just

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.910
capture one of these and reserve
two p's as unmixed, so

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.450
that will give me this.

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:13.230
This is one S and one p,
so this is called sp

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.270
hybridization.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.690
And then I've got the two p's
unmixed, so now I've got one,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.900
two, three, four.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:23.090
are both orthogonal
to one another and

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.300
these two are what?

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:26.790
I've got two struts coming
off the carbon.

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.170
How do I get two struts coming
off a carbon symmetrically

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.740
disposed in space?

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:33.940
That's it.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.140
So look at the shape
of the molecule.

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:37.290
You see it here.

00:09:37.290 --> 00:09:38.190
There's the--

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:42.220
the sigma orbital is here and
then we have vertical and then

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.600
out on the plane.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.390
And so you first would say,
wow, I understand that.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.800
That looks a lot
like nitrogen.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.850
And then, of course, I looked
at that, and I said, what

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.930
about the right-hand rule?

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:55.790
And according to the right-hand
rule, the z is

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:56.690
going in this direction.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.520
It's a little more subtle, but
I pick up on stuff like that.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:01.480
I can't help it.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:01.860
OK.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.350
So this is good.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:08.220
So what I've done here is gone
through a number of instances

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.650
where we start with electronic
structure.

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:13.010
sometimes we hybridize,
sometimes we don't.

00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:14.770
But what follows here?

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:18.660
When we start with the octet
rule and we start playing with

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.110
the energetics and forming the
orbitals, can you see that

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.740
there's a connection between
electronic structure, which

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.840
then dictates the bond
disposition in space, which

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.170
ultimately dictates the
architecture of the molecule?

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.390
Molecular architecture.

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:40.920
So there's a way of doing this
There's a way of doing this

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.170
systematically.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.160
I just got ahead of myself.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.980
Before we get to that, I wanted
to just pause here for

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:55.430
a second and reflect upon the
properties of the covalent

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.840
bond as contrasted to the
properties of the ionic bond.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:10.140
So let me get to that first.
Properties of covalent bond.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.480
OK.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.220
The first property I want to
highlight is the fact that the

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:16.130
bond is saturated.

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:18.790
Remember when we said that the
ionic bond was saturated?

00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:19.380
So what does it mean?

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.400
Saturated?

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.745
It means that there's
two atoms only.

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:29.670
Once you've got the electron
pair between the two atoms,

00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:32.440
the bond is formed and that's
the end of the story, whereas

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.630
with ionic bonding, you can
keep by electrostatic

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.780
attraction piling on
and piling on.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.160
So this is the concept
of saturation.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.610
So we have the shared
electron pair.

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.570
Shared electron pair
and that's all

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.180
there is to the story.

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:51.650
The other thing about the
covalent bond is that it is

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.900
directional.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.455
And so the bond spatial
arrangement--

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.110
these are the positioners.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:08.620
You can't put atoms where there
are no bonds and since

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.940
the bonds have a direct spatial
arrangement, then

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:15.560
that's going to inform molecular
architecture.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.245
Dictates molecular
architecture.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.855
So what I'd like to do next--

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.320
so for example, here's
one that we know.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:29.120
You've seen this one.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.040
This is methane.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.450
This is sp3 hybridization.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:36.800
So we learn that methane
is tetrahedronal.

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:41.985
We say that the four corners of
the hydrogen positions form

00:12:41.985 --> 00:12:42.830
a tetrahedron.

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:44.780
So we call this molecule
tetrahedral.

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:51.260
So I could look at other
molecules that have sp3

00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.110
hybridization.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:55.240
So if I look at something like
titanium tetrachloride, which

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.550
we met earlier to make titanium,
this is titanium in

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:00.820
the center and the
four chlorines.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.190
It's the same molecular shape.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:06.420
If you see leaded gasoline,
the compound in unleaded

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.820
gasoline is tetraethyl lead.

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:11.580
Lead at the center, ethyl's
at the four corners of the

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.230
tetrahedron.

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.920
So all of these-- and
same over here.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:20.380
This one here, sp2, this means
the molecule is planar.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.970
The carbons and the hydrogens
lie in a plane.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:25.500
The whole molecule lies in
the plane of the board.

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.500
If I give you any molecule
that's got sp3 hybridization

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.900
and has one, two, three, four,
five, six atoms, in other

00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.380
words, all the bonds have atoms,
the molecular is going

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:38.950
to be a planar molecule with
this, the 120 degrees.

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:43.930
So we've got a grand scheme here
that allows us to codify

00:13:43.930 --> 00:13:49.100
this behavior and the connection
between molecular

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:56.950
structure and the electronics
arrangement and it's written

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.610
up here under the term
Valence-Shell

00:14:00.610 --> 00:14:02.740
Electron-Pair-Repulsion Model.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.460
Let's write that down.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.440
I'm going to go through
some examples.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.860
Valence-Shell--

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.090
hyphenated--

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.340
Electron-Pair-Repulsion.

00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:30.270
That's the model, and it goes by
the acronym VSEPR, which is

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:31.700
a five-letter acronym.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:35.790
This is not an initialization
because chemists reverse

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:38.760
these, and they call it VSEPR,
because the V and the S is

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.650
kind of hard to pronounce unless
you have Slavic blood.

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:49.380
So it's called VSEPR, and that
is the scheme that's up here.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.000
So I'm going to go through some
examples and show you how

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.490
you can start with electronic
structure and figure out what

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.060
the molecular architecture is.

00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:02.170
So I'm going to follow this.

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.830
So first thing we're
going to do is

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:04.960
write the Lewis structure.

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.470
And the example I want to
start with is sulfur

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:08.270
hexafluoride.

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:09.710
I want to--

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.570
so the question is, what is the
molecular architecture of

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:13.610
sulfur hexafluoride?

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.320
Can we predict the shape?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.590
And this is an interesting
molecule.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.640
It's very dense.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.480
It's about five times-- it's
a gas at room temperature.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.050
It's about five times
the density of air.

00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:28.760
It's got an atomic mass of about
150, and it's used in

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.800
the light metal industry.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.010
It's used as a blanket gas for
casting of aluminum and

00:15:33.010 --> 00:15:35.460
magnesium to keep the air away
from the liquid metal.

00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:37.730
Otherwise, the metal
would oxidize.

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.310
But unfortunately, the sulfur
fluorine bond is a really good

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:45.020
infrared absorber, and when this
stuff leaks out, it's a

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.250
fantastic greenhouse
gas trapper.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:49.835
It's got a greenhouse gas
coefficient that's, I don't

00:15:49.835 --> 00:15:52.990
know, something like 10,000
times that of CO2.

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:57.290
So there's a lot
of conversation

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:58.610
about banning this.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.300
If we ban this, we're going to
have to find a substitute.

00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.250
There is no readily available
substitute.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:06.830
And what that'll mean is the
cost of aluminum castings and

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:10.880
magnesium castings will go up,
which means that they won't be

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.040
used in automobiles.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:14.790
Instead, cheaper steel will be
used in automobiles, which

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.490
means the mass of the automobile
will go up, fuel

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:20.390
economy will go down, tail pipe
emissions will go up and

00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:22.300
greenhouse gas emissions
will go up.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:26.120
So how do we get ourselves
out of this situation?

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:29.640
Do we ban SF6 or not?

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.500
How do you go about thinking
about that problem?

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.720
Well, if you're in Washington
today, it's the lobbyists with

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.350
the biggest bag of money
that comes in.

00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:39.400
That's what's going
to dictate policy.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.840
But if we lived in an ideal
world, we'd have people like

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.470
you who understand the chemistry
and what would be

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.160
the analysis?

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.480
You'd look at all the SF6
emitted from the cast shops in

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:56.490
a given year and compare that
to the increase in tail pipe

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:01.010
CO2 emissions if you replaced
the aluminum with steel, and

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.060
then you figure out what
the trade off is.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:06.410
And maybe what you'd do is set
up a policy where you would

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:08.480
gradually phase this
out with--

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.560
heaven forbid--

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.270
solid research support to
give us what we need.

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:15.720
That way we get clean air
and everything else.

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.040
OK.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.900
So that's what we would like.

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.100
Now let's look at the Lewis
structure of this thing

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.540
because that's the first thing
we're supposed to do

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.000
according to VSEPR.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.460
So I'm going to put sulfur here
and I know sulfur's got--

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.710
it's 3s2 3p4.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:35.140
So it's got six valence
electrons.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:38.750
I'm going to put them
symmetrically around the

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.300
sulfur, and then I'm going
to bring in the fluorine.

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:44.170
I'll bring in one fluorine,
and I know it's got seven

00:17:44.170 --> 00:17:49.030
valence electrons: one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:52.090
And the same thing with
the other fluorines.

00:17:52.090 --> 00:17:54.880
So I'm going to put one, and
then for the electron pair,

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.740
I'm just going to draw a line.

00:17:56.740 --> 00:17:57.250
OK.

00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:58.050
You're smart.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:58.840
You can figure that out.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.220
That's just shorthand.

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:00.380
OK.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:01.530
Here's another fluorine.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:02.720
One, two, three.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.610
So there's two, four,
six, seven.

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:09.480
There's one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.670
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:17.660
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:18.430
Beautiful.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:18.760
OK.

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.950
So now what I want to
do is identify all

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:23.820
of the bonding orbitals.

00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:28.380
So I see around the sulfur,
I've got one, two, three,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:35.120
four, five, six, six bonding
orbitals, six bonding domains,

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.730
if you like.

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:39.790
Well, that's 12 electrons.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:41.150
I said octet stability.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.730
Looks like sulfur took that
idea and ran with it.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:48.080
And it turns out that this does
happen on occasion in

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.470
elements that are very
electronegative.

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:55.090
Very, very strong non-metals
will form what is known as an

00:18:55.090 --> 00:18:56.450
expanded octet.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.500
And here we've got--

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.280
here's a list of elements.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.530
[MICROPHONE ADJUSTMENT]

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.432
PROFESSOR: We need a
high-tech tie clip.

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.280
Pull out a little more, maybe
it's constrained.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.770
It's tethered.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:22.925
the bond is too tight.

00:19:22.925 --> 00:19:24.480
That's what it is.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.080
It's not flexible.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.140
It's covalent, you see.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:28.450
All right.

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:32.020
So here we are with the
elements, and the ones shown

00:19:32.020 --> 00:19:37.620
in the in the grayish-blue
here are the ones that on

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:42.270
occasion might form
an expanded octet.

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:47.720
Not always, but if you do see 10
or 12 electrons around one

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.660
of those elements,
don't be alarmed.

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.920
If you see 10 or 12 electrons
around the potassium, that's

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.160
probably a mistake.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:54.480
OK.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.040
So we have six bonding domains
and what else do we have?

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.760
We have six bonding domains, and
we have zero non-bonding

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:11.090
domains, and in total, we have
six electron domains, in other

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:16.590
words, six electron
pair systems

00:20:16.590 --> 00:20:18.310
around the central sulfur.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:22.090
And on the basis of the total
of bonding and non-bonding,

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.805
this is what dictates the
skeletal structure.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.440
In this case, the skeletal
structure is trivial.

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.580
It's the same as the atomic
structure because there are no

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.670
non-bonding domains.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.800
And so I've got six of them.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:38.760
They're equivalent.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.510
So what's that going to mean
in terms of shape?

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:48.240
Well, I'll put the sulfur in the
center and I've got one,

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.660
two, three, four, five, six.

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.980
So two in one plane crossways
and then two vertical.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.050
And then I put the fluorines--

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:01.570
one, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.130
So there's the molecular
architecture and it's termed

00:21:05.130 --> 00:21:07.440
octahedral.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:09.330
I know at first this throws you

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:10.820
because you see six struts.

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:12.200
Where do you get
the octahedral?

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.390
Well, if we connect the four
fluorines along with the

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:18.500
sulfur, they lie in a plane, and
if we were to pitch a tent

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.940
here, we could pitch a tent to
the upper fluorine, and we'd

00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.800
end up with four faces.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:25.270
So this is Greek.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.570
Eight faces.

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:28.850
So there's four above
and four below.

00:21:28.850 --> 00:21:30.870
I know it's sort of like a
Jasper Johns painting.

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:31.850
You say, octahedral.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.530
You hear octa, you're thinking
eight and you're seeing six

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.660
fluorines or seven.

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:38.880
Anything but eight.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:41.740
So this is anything but eight,
but it's eight faces.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.970
Last thing-- let's look
at the energetics.

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:46.380
To hybridize like this, we
needed to do something

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:52.690
different because we know that
the base structure of sulfur

00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.240
would be 3s2 3p4.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.550
So this is 3s and this is 3p.

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:06.440
So that's 3s2, and then 3p4
would be one, two, three--

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:06.930
whoops!

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:09.210
I violated the polyexclusion
there.

00:22:09.210 --> 00:22:09.610
OK.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:10.630
There we go.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:12.720
So I can't form six
bonds with this.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.330
I only have two bonds.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:16.360
So you say, well, okay,
let's make sp3.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.950
Well, if I make sp3, sp3
will give me this.

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:23.310
So now I got one, two, three,
four, and then I'm going to

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.390
put five, six.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.040
I'm still down with two bonds.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.810
I need to have six unpaired
electrons.

00:22:28.810 --> 00:22:31.590
So I've already consumed
my s's and my p's.

00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:34.850
Where else can I go shopping
for orbitals?

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:36.710
I go to the orbital store
and the orbital

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:38.550
store is over here.

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.800
Here's 3d.

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.470
One, two, three, four.

00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:45.520
So I've got one, two, three,
four, five d orbitals.

00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.420
So what I'm going to do is, I'm
going to take the s, I'm

00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:51.880
going to take all three of the p
and I'm going to lop off two

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.400
of the d's.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.860
So now I'm going to have one,
two, three, four, five, six

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:04.160
and I'll leave three
d's by themselves

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.485
and here's now sp3d2.

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.130
And now I've got
six electrons--

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.190
one, two, three, four, five, six
and now I have six equal

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:18.300
energy states, which means
I have to have six struts

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:24.020
equally disposed in space and
everything makes sense.

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.060
All right.

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.086
Is this polar or nonpolar?

00:23:27.086 --> 00:23:30.710
Is this molecule polar
or nonpolar?

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:32.800
Nonpolar, good.

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:34.030
Let's look at it carefully.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:34.900
What do we have?

00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.230
I've got sulfur fluorine.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.030
Whenever you see fluorine,
that's the biggest electron

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:43.880
hog on the Periodic Table so you
know you're going to have

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.390
a dipole moment on the bond.

00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:48.690
But I have six such
bonds and they're

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:50.730
symmetrically disposed in space.

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:53.970
All of the fluorines lie on the
surface of a sphere so the

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:58.130
center of local negative charge
is right on top of the

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:01.110
sulfur nucleus, which is where
the center of locally

00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:02.540
positive charge is.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.730
No electron displacement,
no net dipole moment.

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:08.770
OK.

00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:10.150
This is working.

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.640
Let's try another one.

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:11.940
Let's see.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.520
What do I have here?

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.450
I got bromide pentafluoride.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:19.950
So start--

00:24:19.950 --> 00:24:24.140
let's go back to the
VSPER rules.

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.630
There we go.

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:25.900
OK.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:26.760
VSPER rules.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.950
So I put bromine in the center
and it's got seven valence

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:30.760
electrons--

00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:35.060
one, two, three, four,
five, six--

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:37.230
and I'll put the seventh
up here.

00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:38.660
And I'm going to bring
in the fluorines--

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:44.780
one, two, three, four, five and
just as before, there's

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:48.890
one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:53.020
So you get a bond with
each fluorine.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.270
A bond with each fluorine.

00:24:59.430 --> 00:25:00.180
All right.

00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:03.410
So what do we have now?

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:05.220
How many electron domains?

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.360
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.450
Six electron domains as before,
but one of them's

00:25:12.450 --> 00:25:13.870
nonbonding.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:16.650
I get to use the colored
chalk again.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:16.960
All right.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.280
So this is one nonbonding
domain and

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.870
five bonding domains.

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:27.910
One, two, three, four, five.

00:25:27.910 --> 00:25:31.110
One bond to each of the
fluorines, five bonding, and

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:36.370
the total is six electron
domains, so that means

00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.020
octahedral structure.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.850
The total number of
electron domains

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:42.270
dictates skeletal structure.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.050
So man said put six.

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.120
So I put the bromine here,
and I go, one, two,

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:49.550
three, four, five, six.

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:51.140
That's the skeletal structure.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.620
Those are the bonds and space.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.530
Now I know one of those is
a nonbonding domain.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.330
So where do I put it?

00:25:58.330 --> 00:25:59.390
Well, they're all equivalent.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:00.510
It doesn't make any
difference.

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:03.260
Nobody knows where the real
x is in this world.

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:07.110
So just for grins and chuckles,
I'll make--

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:10.460
I'll put the nonbonding
pair down here.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:14.590
And then I put the fluorines
at the other struts.

00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.830
And so now what's the shape
of the molecule?

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.650
You don't see these electrons.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:21.530
And in fact, this is only done
by chemistry professors, the

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.510
other ones, not me.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.180
I only do this to let you know
what the books are doing

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.340
because we all know that
those nonbonding

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.550
electrons are in here.

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:31.990
They're right up tucked
against the bromine.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.260
So if you walked in the
room, what do you see?

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.760
The bromine and the four
fluorines lie in a plane, and

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.500
then you've got this
thing sticking up.

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.600
So the molecule is a pyramid
with a square base.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.130
So it's called square
pyramidal.

00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:57.700
And how about polar
or nonpolar?

00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.270
Is there a net dipole moment?

00:26:59.270 --> 00:27:01.310
Yes or no?

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:05.070
Yes, because we got the-- in
the plane with the bromine,

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.430
everything is centered, right?

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.360
The fluorines pull out,
but they all pull out

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.900
symmetrically, but
then there's the

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.250
fluorine pulling up.

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.700
So this is polar.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:19.870
This is polar and it's got
a dipole setup like this.

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:21.180
Good.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:21.760
All right.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.450
Let's do one more.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:24.490
I'm having so much fun.

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:27.190
I'm going to do as many as I can
until I run out of time.

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:29.745
This is the best part because
colored chalk.

00:27:29.745 --> 00:27:30.990
That's the end.

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:31.290
All right.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:32.380
Let's do this one.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.670
Tetrafluoroiodate.

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.190
IF4 minus.

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:39.750
This is cool because it's got
a net charge, but it's a

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:43.630
covalent anion.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.600
So same thing.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.740
Lewis structure.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.390
So we're going to put iodine
first. Iodine and it's just

00:27:49.390 --> 00:27:50.210
like bromine.

00:27:50.210 --> 00:27:55.530
It's got one, two, three,
four, five, six--

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:58.670
I'm going to put a seventh
electron here because I'm

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.010
anticipating.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:01.130
Just to mix things up.

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.380
See, last time I put the
seventh electron up.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:06.440
I could put the seventh electron
down, but it's got a

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.620
net charge.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.070
How'd it get the net charge?

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:11.990
By accepting an electron.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:14.140
So that electron's got
to be here, too.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:16.350
So I'm going to indicates
that that extra

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:18.580
electron's here as well.

00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.200
So iodine's got eight already.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.365
So we're off to a
roaring start.

00:28:23.365 --> 00:28:27.300
It's got eight and it hasn't
even started bonding yet.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.720
So we know where we're
going here.

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:31.220
We're going to expanded
octet land.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:31.490
All right.

00:28:31.490 --> 00:28:32.740
So we need four more fluorine.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.480
I'm going to put four
fluorines--

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:37.700
one, two, three, four--

00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:51.520
and as before, so
we've got bonds.

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.180
One, two, three, four.

00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:58.830
And we've still got some other
orbitals lying next to the

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:01.510
iodine and they bond
to nothing.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:07.390
So we have two nonbonding, and
we have four bonding for a

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:10.960
total of six electron domains.

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.925
Again, octahedral structure.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:16.830
Octahedral skeleton.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.780
So I'm going to put
iodine here.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.810
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:29.250
All right.

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:31.510
Now comes the part--
see, we said--

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.160
this VSPER consists
of valence-shell.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.050
I've been doing a lot of
valence-shell thought here,

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.670
but I haven't said anything
about electron-pair repulsion.

00:29:39.670 --> 00:29:41.450
Now I'm going to show you
how electron-pair

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.120
repulsion comes into play.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.020
So I can put four fluorines
around here in

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.460
two different ways.

00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:52.290
One way is to put the four
fluorines into play

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.000
and then I have the--

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
these are called lone pairs.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.850
Why are they lone?

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.030
Because they don't
bond to a second.

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:04.040
So sometimes chemists call
these lone pairs.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.490
They're all alone.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:08.280
It's Friday and all alone.

00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.920
So here they are.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.830
So that's one way to put them,
but there's another way to put

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.660
them, and that's
this one here.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.700
I'm going to go way over
to the other side, and

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.290
here's the other way.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:24.660
The other way to put them is to
put the pairs in the same

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:30.480
plane next to each other,
because if I put the pairs

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:32.000
opposite each other,
that's equivalent.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.710
It doesn't matter.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:35.430
It just-- whether on the
x-axis or y-axis.

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:39.910
So if you think about this as
a globe, you think about the

00:30:39.910 --> 00:30:46.250
molecule as a globe, so in this
case over there, I put

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.690
all the fluorines on the
equatorial position.

00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:54.180
You can think of this plane at
the waistline as the equator.

00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.710
So these are all at the
equatorial position, and the

00:30:57.710 --> 00:31:00.900
electron pairs are
at the poles.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:03.540
So the lone pairs are
at polar positions.

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.420
In this case, the lone
pairs are lying

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.790
in equatorial positions.

00:31:08.790 --> 00:31:11.110
Now what do you know about
electrons when

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:13.400
they get close together?

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.310
They repel.

00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:16.190
And it's a really strong
repulsion.

00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:17.780
That's the Bourne exponent.

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.230
Electron-pair repulsion is
really strong and it'll jack

00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:22.620
the energy way up.

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.110
So if you've got a choice of
putting electrons here close

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:30.000
together or here farther apart,
which one is going to

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.160
be the lower energy condition?

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:35.810
This, because this minimizes
electron-pair repulsion, and

00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:38.020
in fact, this is the
one that's favored.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:43.010
So by using valence-shell
thought, bonding, nonbonding

00:31:43.010 --> 00:31:45.770
skeletal structure, and then
finally electron-pair

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:48.410
repulsion, you conclude that
this is the correct form, and

00:31:48.410 --> 00:31:51.210
so you don't see these electron
pairs because we know

00:31:51.210 --> 00:31:53.080
they're really tucked
in tight here.

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.080
What do you see if you
do a spectroscopic

00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:56.270
analysis of this thing?

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:58.260
All five atoms lie in a plane.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:01.610
So this molecule is planar.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:05.790
It's planar, just as the sp2
ethylene was planar, but this

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:08.980
is planar for a different
reason.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:10.230
Is this polar or nonpolar?

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.380
See, it's negative.

00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:16.450
It's not negative.

00:32:16.450 --> 00:32:19.130
If I were a cation, I'd
be drawn in like this.

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:21.580
So is it polar or nonpolar?

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.590
Where's the net displacement?

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:26.260
The fluorines are pulling away
from the iodine, but they're

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.840
pulling away symmetrically.

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:28.960
So there's no net
dipole moment.

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.000
It's cool, huh?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.650
No net dipole moment, but
net negative charge.

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:35.560
I love it.

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:37.160
It just--

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.340
it's the best. OK.

00:32:38.340 --> 00:32:41.610
So now let's look
at some others.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:43.480
We've looked at CF4.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.900
We know CF4.

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.640
CF4, you could do this
one in your head.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.480
This would be just like
methane, right?

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.690
This would be tetrahedral.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:53.790
I'm not even going to
write that out.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:58.460
This tetrahedral and it would
be sp3 hybridization and we

00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:00.990
just did IF4 minus.

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:02.560
See the stoichiometry.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.420
It's four fluorines.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:07.510
Four fluorines with something
and it's not the same

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:08.260
architecture.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.610
So stoichiometry doesn't
dictate molecular

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:12.180
architecture.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.460
Very important.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:14.920
You can say, well, it's
a net charge.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.590
A net charge doesn't
do-- it's this.

00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:18.840
This is square planar.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.290
Yeah, so I'm going
to add that.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:26.710
It's not only planar, it's
planar and it's a square,

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:28.980
whereas the other one
is trigonal planar.

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:32.440
So this is square planar.

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.160
So I'm going to do another F4,
just to show you, make the

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.640
point that this thing
doesn't--

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.010
so I'm going to do sulfur
hexafluoride.

00:33:41.010 --> 00:33:44.480
You say, gee, sulfur
hexafluoride.

00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:47.870
I bet it's just like carbon
because carbon, sulfur--

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.070
no.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.230
Let's look carefully.

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:55.720
So I'm going to put the sulfur
here and we're going to put--

00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:57.160
how many electrons?

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:01.710
One, two, three, four,
five, six.

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:02.520
OK.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.450
And then we're going to bring
in the fluorines, one, two,

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.890
three, four.

00:34:08.890 --> 00:34:10.800
So each of the fluorines is
going to form a bond.

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:11.800
Do I have to do this?

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.990
Can I just do this?

00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.880
Yeah, that's enough.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.230
I'm not--

00:34:17.230 --> 00:34:18.430
I'm raising--

00:34:18.430 --> 00:34:20.170
we're accelerating now.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:23.720
Now I'm going to stop talking
and I'll just think about it

00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.970
and you'll get it.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.640
All right.

00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:28.650
So here we go.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:29.620
Bonding domains.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:31.980
One with the fluorine, two with
the fluorines, three with

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.630
the fluorine, four with the
fluorine and there's two

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:35.670
electrons, and they'll
just sit together in

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:37.540
a nonbonding domain.

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:38.460
So how many domains?

00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.660
One, two, three, four, five.

00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:43.180
Five electron domains.

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:49.380
Four bonding, one nonbonding
It all adds up.

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.040
Good.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.020
But now I got to put
five struts.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.910
This gives me the skeletal
structure.

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:56.915
As before, skeletal structure.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.150
So I've got to--

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:03.790
how do I put five struts
around something

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:07.340
uniformly in space?

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.760
One, two and I'll put
three in the plane.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:12.790
Three in the plane.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:16.790
So three at the equator
and two at the poles.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:18.076
That's the skeletal structure.

00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.900
This is called a trigonal
bipyramid.

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:27.570
Because I can make a pyramid
above, right?

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:31.280
I got a tent with
three corners.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:36.270
So that's a pyramid
with three faces.

00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:37.520
So that's called trigonal.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:41.100
It's trigonal--

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:41.680
three--

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.390
and then I've got it
above and below.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.530
So that's trigonal bipyramid.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:49.312
See, you're going to learn
all these new words.

00:35:49.312 --> 00:35:51.650
When you go out tonight, you're
going to be able to

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:56.900
impress people to the point
they'll walk away from you.

00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:57.260
All right.

00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:02.623
So now let's start putting
the fluorines--

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:06.440
again, we've got choices here.

00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:07.250
They're not equivalent.

00:36:07.250 --> 00:36:11.770
So one possibility is to put the
lone pair at the equator

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:16.400
and then the fluorines go
here, and the other

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:21.410
possibility is to put the--

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:21.860
let's see.

00:36:21.860 --> 00:36:23.680
I've got room up there.

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.880
The other possibility is--

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.390
let's make the trigonal
bipyramid--

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:32.770
is to put the lone pair at a
polar position and put all the

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:37.760
fluorines in the equatorial
plane.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.760
And so now we have to think
about this for a second and

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.170
try to convince ourselves which
situation has greater

00:36:44.170 --> 00:36:46.480
electron-pair repulsion.

00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:49.510
So the way to think about it
is, in which position does

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:53.430
that lone pair come into more
contact than otherwise?

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:54.760
The other thing to know is--

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.260
I didn't say this earlier, but
it just occurred to me-- is

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:00.200
that if you've got a choice of
bonding electrons versus

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.390
nonbonding electrons,
nonbonding

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.210
electrons want more room.

00:37:04.210 --> 00:37:05.140
Why?

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:06.550
Because they're not
tightly confined.

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:09.460
When you get something in a
bond, it's on axis between the

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:13.330
two atoms, and so things are
much more tightly confined.

00:37:13.330 --> 00:37:15.150
So these things want
a lot of room.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:17.490
So if I'm sitting here, I
interact with this fluorine

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.420
and this fluorine--

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:20.510
these two are far away.

00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:23.700
If I'm here, I interact
with three fluorines.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:28.420
So it turns out the equatorial
position is favored.

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.890
Give more space nonbonding--

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.600
place nonbonding domains at
equatorial positions in

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.390
trigonal bipyramid.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:35.640
That's what number five means.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:41.840
If somebody asked you to test
the microphone, instead of

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.630
saying number nine, number nine
or one, two, three, say,

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.910
place nonbonding domains at
equatorial positions and a

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:50.260
trigonal bipyramid.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.580
And they'll ask you to step
away from the microphone.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:54.310
OK.

00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:58.000
So this structure here
is, in fact, the

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.850
shape of the molecule.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.230
You don't see this.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:05.260
And this molecule is called
seesaw, like a teeter totter.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.800
You remember, when
you were kids.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.990
You don't remember that.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.290
OK.

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:11.680
So how about polar
versus nonpolar?

00:38:14.890 --> 00:38:15.550
It's obvious.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:18.790
If it's asymmetric and you've
got the fluorines and the

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.260
non-pair, this is definitely
polar.

00:38:22.260 --> 00:38:24.600
And where's the net dipole?

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:27.340
Where's the negative side?

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.800
Well, along this axis, it's
pulled right to the center.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.570
So along this axis, clearly the
fluorines are pulling so

00:38:33.570 --> 00:38:36.700
you have something that
looks like this.

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.830
And how about the energetics?

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:40.140
How do we get five of these?

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:43.350
If we've got five struts, it
means we must have five

00:38:43.350 --> 00:38:46.690
hybridized orbitals
of equal energy.

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:51.230
Well, we got six before and
before that, we had four.

00:38:51.230 --> 00:38:52.800
Before that, we had three.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.980
Well, now we're going
to get five.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:57.230
So how do we make
five orbitals?

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.180
So in this case I start--

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:08.370
I want s, p, d, and
I want five.

00:39:08.370 --> 00:39:12.190
So one plus three is four
plus one is five and

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:14.660
that gives me sp3d.

00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:22.560
Gives me five and then,
what do we got?

00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.480
One, two, three.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.050
It's good.

00:39:26.050 --> 00:39:26.730
OK.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:29.210
Now--

00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:30.750
so we've covered a lot.

00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:31.050
All right.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.330
So some parting comments.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.200
We've been sticking other
things-- what we could do is

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.230
we could do this one.

00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:41.670
We could take carbon and I'm
going to go now sp3.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.330
only instead of putting
hydrogens, I'm going to put

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:48.040
carbons here.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.190
So what happens now?

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.450
One, two, three, four.

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:52.870
I'll put another carbon here.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:55.620
One, two, three, four,
et cetera.

00:39:55.620 --> 00:40:03.530
So this is sp3, all carbon, and
this is called diamond.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.180
This is called diamond sp3.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:08.930
So these are all sigma
bonds, all sigma

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:12.490
bonds everywhere, sp3.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:15.733
And these are very, very strong
bonds and these are

00:40:15.733 --> 00:40:18.660
very tight bonds-- and one of
the properties of diamond is

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:24.400
that it has a very high
refractive index

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.690
because high energy--

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.790
and these are tight,
tight bonds.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:28.975
So the electrons aren't
easily excited.

00:40:28.975 --> 00:40:31.410
It's transparent, divisible
light, which means that when

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.880
light shines on this, there's
no expectation,

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.500
but there is bending.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.060
So it's very, very high
refractive index and a high

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:41.170
refractive index is what makes
this such a troublesome

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:43.270
compound because it concentrates
light.

00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:46.530
So you can imagine there's
somebody in a dimly lit cafe,

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:49.690
and she's sitting over in the
corner with a candle in front,

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:52.130
and she's wearing a diamond
stud, and it takes those few

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:53.510
candellas of energy.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:56.030
It concentrates, it shoots
it in the room, and some

00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:59.210
unsuspecting fellow gets hit
in the eye, is attracted to

00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.610
the person wearing the earrings,
and that's when the

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:04.060
trouble begins.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.850
So this is very, very dangerous,
very dangerous, and

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:11.690
it's a consequence of these
strong sigma bonds.

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:13.770
But there's another way.

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:16.260
There's another way that
we can bond carbon.

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.550
We can make sp2 hybrids.

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:22.280
So if we make sp2 hybrids,
that now looks like this.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:26.500
The carbon lies in the plane,
120 degrees, which means we're

00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:32.330
going to end up with something
that looks like this, et

00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:33.650
cetera, et cetera.

00:41:33.650 --> 00:41:36.100
And this is graphite.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.150
This is graphite.

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:41.400
And now we have a mix of sigma
bonds in the plane that are

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.090
very strong.

00:41:42.090 --> 00:41:45.280
In fact, they're every bit as
strong as these bonds, but

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:45.820
there's a fourth.

00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:47.370
I said, you always
have to find four

00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:48.230
struts off the carbons.

00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:49.910
So where's the fourth strut?

00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:52.460
It's the pi bond that comes
out of the board.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.710
So there's a pi bond here and
a pi bond here and a pi bond

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:57.680
here and what we're going to
learn later is that these

00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.930
things are delocalized.

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:06.000
Because of the spacing here, the
electrons can form a bond

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.150
here that then forms a bond
here, but it can actually

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.710
resonate in such a way that
the electrons can move

00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:15.100
everywhere throughout the
crystal of graphite and this

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.860
is what gives graphite its
electrical conductivity,

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.750
whereas diamond is a
strict insulator.

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:24.370
So these are very strong bonds
in the plane, but not between

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:26.800
planes, which gives graphite
its lubricity.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:29.430
It's a dry-lock lubricant
and so on.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.170
OK.

00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:31.870
So this is very good.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:36.590
So we have a mix of sigma
and pi bonds.

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:45.860
And it's an absorber
and it's dark.

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.310
It's an absorber so it appears
black, whereas this diamond is

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:50.580
transparent to visible light.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:57.860
And if you look in your book,
this is all categorized for

00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.420
you, everything that we've
done here with VSPER.

00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:00.780
All right.

00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:02.210
Look at this.

00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:04.670
All nice big system.

00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:05.370
OK.

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:08.940
So here's diamond, which I was
trying to draw over here, four

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.390
struts sp3 hybridized.

00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:14.560
this is graphite sp2, and these
are pi bonds in between.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.010
OK.

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:20.590
Now suppose this fellow asks
this girl out, and things get

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:21.940
serious and they get--

00:43:21.940 --> 00:43:24.380
I'm going to use an adverb
here-- really serious and he

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:27.540
decides maybe he wants to make
a commitment and he wants to

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:31.350
buy her a ring, an engagement
ring, and the custom is that

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.180
the engagement ring
has a stone in it.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:38.570
Now being an MIT student, he
knows that he wants to have

00:43:38.570 --> 00:43:40.850
symbolism in that stone.

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:45.540
Now the custom is to get
diamond, but it turns out that

00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:49.030
if you look carefully, the
stable form of carbon at room

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.050
temperature and atmospheric
pressure is not

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:53.270
diamond, it's graphite.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:57.270
So if he wants to give his
love this stone that

00:43:57.270 --> 00:44:02.390
symbolizes eternal commitment,
wouldn't he choose the stable

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:05.910
form and not the one that's
metastable and doesn't

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:08.380
represent the natural state
at room temperature?

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:12.000
That's the truth.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.740
That's the truth.

00:44:13.740 --> 00:44:15.120
Graphite is the stable form.

00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.180
I leave it up to the young man
to persuade the young lady

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:23.120
that the gemstone is going
to have graphite

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.730
in it and not diamond.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:26.210
OK.

00:44:26.210 --> 00:44:29.480
Now something very interesting
happened.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:32.650
What I wanted to play for you as
you're leaving today is an

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:35.580
old Beatles song, Lucy in
the Sky With Diamonds.

00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.950
And what happened--

00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:39.810
before I get to it, what
happened was-- and this is

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:43.630
even in today's Le Tech if you
look on the second page, "New

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.840
Fossil Skeleton from africa
Predates Lucy." It was just

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.570
discovered.

00:44:48.570 --> 00:44:49.270
I'm not kidding you.

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:50.500
This isn't a joke.

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.340
I heard this on NPR
last night.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:58.240
So it's a female skeleton of a
pre-hominid, 4.4 million years

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:00.980
old, which is a million
years older than Lucy.

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:05.880
Lucy was discovered in
Ethiopia in 1974 and

00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.820
considered to be 3.18
million years old.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.360
This new one is 4.4 million
years old, about four feet

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:18.070
tall, and it just turns the
clock even farther back.

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:20.240
The interesting thing
is the name.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:24.290
How did the skeleton
discovered in 1974

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.920
get the name Lucy?

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.050
Interesting story.

00:45:27.050 --> 00:45:29.670
There were two American
archaeologists that were head

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:34.650
of the team that did the dig,
and they were so excited the

00:45:34.650 --> 00:45:38.330
night they found this
pre-hominid skeleton.

00:45:38.330 --> 00:45:41.890
They knew it was a female, and
they hadn't dated it yet, but

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:45.440
they knew that it was roughly
way, way back, but it was

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.630
definitely female.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:49.740
So they were back at the
campfire, kicking back,

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:54.470
drinking, probably heavily, and
singing songs, and one of

00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:56.950
the songs they were singing
was Lucy in the Sky With

00:45:56.950 --> 00:46:02.380
Diamonds and that night, they
named the skeleton Lucy.

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.100
But the story doesn't
end there.

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.680
Where did this Lucy in the Sky
With Diamonds come from?

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:09.800
John Lennon, one of the--

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.800
you may have heard of this group
or not, but there was

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:13.130
this group called The Beatles.

00:46:13.130 --> 00:46:16.940
So one of the lead composers
was John Lennon.

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:20.980
His six-year-old son came home
from school one day with a

00:46:20.980 --> 00:46:24.290
piece of artwork, and the father
asks, what is this?

00:46:24.290 --> 00:46:30.600
He says, it's a painting of my
classmate Lucy, and it was

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:32.390
Lucy and he had diamonds
in the sky.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:34.510
So it was Lucy in the Sky with
Diamonds, and then they wrote

00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:36.360
the song about it.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.660
The real Lucy just
died this week.

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:39.450
She had Lupus.

00:46:39.450 --> 00:46:41.700
She died at the age of 46.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:46.000
And all of these things have
come together just because we

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.210
had this lesson today about
covalent bonding, which took

00:46:51.210 --> 00:46:54.990
us to this, which then took us
to Ethiopia, which then takes

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:56.390
this up here.

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:58.910
and so with that, I think
we'll go for an early

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:02.470
dismissal, and I'll wish
you a pleasant weekend.
