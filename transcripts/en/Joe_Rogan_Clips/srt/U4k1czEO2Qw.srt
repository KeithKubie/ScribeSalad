1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:05,490
The Joe Rogan experience. So I'm
gonna say listen to people too much.

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:08,580
Corey mean that's the problem. My wife
said all the time, like every morning,

3
00:00:08,581 --> 00:00:11,820
she's like, no negativity today as
she always stay the fuck off line.

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,050
That's what you should do.

5
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:17,370
Now I'm doing the hunting stuff and
I'll pose this stuff. It's like,

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,310
as I got to put it, it pops on my
pop up in MMA questions. Yeah. Like,

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,470
or at the top of the screen it dropped
down or pop up in the notification or I

8
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:30,130
get an email notification. Somebody
say, you see half of it and I'm like,

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,870
don't open. Don't did I drive
and I wanted the rest of his day.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,310
It could be a good thing. It might be
bad. And actually open it up later on.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,510
If somebody is saying something bad, it's
just like, like my wife just said, shit,

12
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:44,980
if I got it, just don't pay
no attention to it. But yes,

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,060
you're, you'll allow negativity into
life that you don't need. I mean,

14
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:51,670
you think about your camp,
you got all these positive people,

15
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:55,420
all these motivated people, all
these professionals, you know,

16
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:56,980
exceptional human beings,
right?

17
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:00,310
Everybody training and grind together
and then you got schmoes that are

18
00:01:00,311 --> 00:01:04,570
contacting you on Twitter or Instagram
or whatever and just saying a bunch of

19
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:07,270
nonsense and that could fuck
with your head. You know,

20
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,480
and these are not people that would ever
say that if they were in front of your

21
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:14,530
face. It's, it's a, it's a gross way to
communicate. It's just, it's not a hell.

22
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,393
It's like,

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,110
it's like passing by a shitty fast food
restaurant being drawn in to eat and

24
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:23,740
then you eat and you're like, God, why did
I eat that garbage? It's the same thing.

25
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:27,080
It's like you're eating, it's like
fast food for your brain. It's,

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:31,450
it's so tempting because you just want
to read those comments and most of the

27
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:35,020
people are probably good people
who are fans, most of them,

28
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,370
but all it takes is 10% assholes and
never want to look at your comments again.

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,900
One out of 10 it's not hard
to get 10% 10% assholes.

30
00:01:43,901 --> 00:01:46,090
It's like pretty damn good
in the real world. You know,

31
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,410
if you only run into one out of 10 that's
an asshole in or one out of a hundred

32
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:52,690
even if it was one out of a hundred
and your comments have shitty,

33
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:55,690
you don't want to read those comments.
It's just for a fighter man.

34
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,870
It's so much of it is about mindset and
just being focused and not having any

35
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:04,990
distractions. And I think those comments
are a giant distraction. You know,

36
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,840
you don't need anybody telling you
what to do. John, Mark fucking Henry,

37
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,950
you've got Ricardo Elmeda, you've got
all these world champions around you,

38
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:16,120
like you don't need any, any
other information. You get
in plenty of information,

39
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,820
you know, fuck all that shit.
You shouldn't even look at it.

40
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,410
You should post and just run away. Just
post something and don't even look out.

41
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,370
Keep going. Just keep going.
Just I got to work it.

42
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,160
I know I've got to work on it
because what you're saying right now,

43
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:34,600
all the things you were saying about
beating Glover about beating Alere Latifa

44
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:38,830
yet, but you're saying it like you're
arguing with somebody. You're saying like,

45
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,240
someone told you you can't do it,

46
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:42,880
but who gives a fuck what
they said you did do it.

47
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,300
So why argue with someone who clearly
doesn't know what the fuck they're talking

48
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:49,210
about anyway, right. But in
your head and you're like,

49
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,940
they said I couldn't do this.
Like, see, you still have that.

50
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,470
It's he know what I'm talking about
because I have that battle 100%

51
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,020
because mark and they tell me all
the time like, Bro, quit feed.

52
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,860
Don't tell you where I come
from. Smart. Me and my brother,

53
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:04,210
we always had that mentality.
Like people were like,

54
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,090
you're talking to this and this.
Yeah, we weren't the type to,

55
00:03:06,091 --> 00:03:07,570
we ain't gonna sit there
and talk back and forth.

56
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,950
It was like my first respond to anybody.
He's talking shit like, all right,

57
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,450
put your hands up. Let's all
right, I'm ready to fight.

58
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,480
Or you say I'm gonna prove you wrong.
That's telling me my time.

59
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,270
Like they always say at Corey couldn't
do this. You wouldn't do that.

60
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:21,910
You wind it is my whole life.
Like in college, like core,

61
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,290
you're not good enough to go to Miller's.

62
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:27,070
We only take five guys on team and I'm
guaranteed coaching going to take you

63
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,360
where the two years I was there,

64
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:30,640
I was the guy I went to middle
of the first pick. Every time.
