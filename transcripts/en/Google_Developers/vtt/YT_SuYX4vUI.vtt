[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:05.460
KATHARINA PROBST: Hi.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:06.400
I'm Katherine Probst.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.222
I am a tech lead and manager on
the Google Compute Engine team.

00:00:10.222 --> 00:00:11.680
Why don't you
introduce yourselves?

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.962
SARAH NYQUIST: Hi,
I'm Sarah, and I

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.920
am an intern on the Google
Compute Engine Team.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.628
ASHLIE MARTINEZ: I'm
Ashlie, and I'm also

00:00:16.628 --> 00:00:18.170
an intern on the
Compute Engine team.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.419
KATHARINA PROBST: And we're
joined here today by Ryan.

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.070
Why don't you introduce
yourself, too.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.460
RYAN COLEMAN: Hi.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.910
I'm Ryan Coleman,
product manager

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.564
for the Puppet Forge
at Puppet Labs.

00:00:25.564 --> 00:00:26.730
KATHARINA PROBST: Excellent.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.855
So today we're going to
talk a little bit about how

00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:31.350
Google Compute Engine
and Puppet Labs

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.080
can actually work together
to make great things happen.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.770
We want to jump right
in and show you a demo,

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.380
and Sarah will describe a little
bit what the demo will do.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.070
SARAH NYQUIST: So
in this demo, we're

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.820
going to create four
Google Compute Engine

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.070
instances with Puppet.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.110
And we're going to install
Apache on them, which

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.110
will make web pages
for each of them,

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.320
and it will have a load balancer
that will allow HTTP traffic

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.755
to go between those web pages.

00:00:53.755 --> 00:00:54.630
KATHARINA PROBST: OK.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.887
Let's do it.

00:00:55.887 --> 00:00:57.470
ASHLIE MARTINEZ: So
to start off with,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.470
we're going to do puppet
cert list -all on our master

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.470
node that has Puppet
Enterprise installed on it.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.760
And as you can see, there's
no managed Puppet nodes

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.450
on this master.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.970
So now that we know
there's no managed nodes,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.820
we're going to apply
our manifest file.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.900
And what our manifest
is going to do

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.560
is it's going to
create persistent disks

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.090
and instances-- virtual
machines in Google Compute

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.160
Engine-- and those
virtual machines

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.940
are going to have Puppet
installed on them,

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.910
as well as Apache.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.460
We're also going to create
a forwarding rule so that we

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.380
can direct traffic
to our new instances,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.320
and a load balancer that will
direct all the traffic that we

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.360
point at the forwarding rule
across those four instances.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.360
KATHARINA PROBST: Great.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.840
So let's take a little bit of
a look at the manifest itself,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.520
and maybe Ryan can help walk
us through a little bit of what

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.116
this does.

00:01:55.116 --> 00:01:56.300
RYAN COLEMAN: Thank you.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.180
So what we're looking at here
is Puppet's language, the Puppet

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.030
DSL.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.261
And Puppet is all about managing
the end state of a machine

00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:04.260
that you want to manage.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.910
So you're not
setting up a script

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.966
in terms of actions that
you'd like to complete.

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:10.090
You're telling Puppet how
you would like the system

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.970
to be configured
at the end the day,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.970
and Puppet takes care of
all the details in between.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.664
So Puppet can manage everything
at the very atomic level,

00:02:17.664 --> 00:02:19.330
whether it's a file
that you're managing

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.871
on your machine, a
service that you'd

00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.440
like enabled, a package
you'd like installed.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.800
And that translates to Google
Compute Engine module as well.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.530
And so what we're
using here for our demo

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.090
is several resources that
describe a firewall that I'd

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.230
like to provision, a
health check, target

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.650
pool, and forwarding rule
that make up the load

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.390
balancer we're
using for the demo.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.270
And then further
down on the page,

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.570
we actually have the Google
Compute disk and instances

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.770
that are running up it
and running our operating

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.010
systems to provide the demo.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.845
And so this is a very readable,
executable documentation

00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:52.220
that you can hand
to someone else

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.400
to describe exactly how things
are going to be configured

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.090
when Puppet gets a hold of it.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.360
We've managed the Puppet Forge
in Google Compute Engine,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.267
and we, in fact, use this module
to describe how the Puppet

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:05.140
Forge instances are configured.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.410
And we use the Google
Compute load balancer

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.774
to split traffic
between different zones.

00:03:09.774 --> 00:03:11.190
And so we can hand
this to someone

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.773
who gets started on
our team, and they

00:03:12.773 --> 00:03:14.782
can take a look at
instances and disks

00:03:14.782 --> 00:03:17.460
and resources that look
just like this, describing

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.364
how the Puppet
Forge is deployed.

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:21.030
And then they can go
down a level deeper

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.770
and see how the
service is managed

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.720
at the very high level and
all the way down to the ground

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.340
on the individual
units that we're

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.656
managing on a Puppet node.

00:03:30.656 --> 00:03:32.230
And to me, that's
one of the best

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.880
things about this combination.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.280
KATHARINA PROBST: Yeah,
that makes perfect sense.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.120
And under the hood, the way
this is implemented, actually,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.300
is it uses Google Compute
Engine's public API.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.740
So anybody can call
the public API,

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.910
and it allows you to do things
like you mentioned-- set up

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.170
disks, create disks,
create instances, set up

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.650
forwarding rules, and so forth.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.310
Let's switch back to the demo
and see how we're doing there.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.489
So as you can see, the
demo is still running.

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.030
So let's back up a little bit
and just talk a little bit more

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.900
generally.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.030
We've already heard a
little bit about Puppet.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.480
Let's talk a little bit more
about what Google Compute

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.950
Engine is and what it does.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.280
I've already mentioned that
we have a public API that

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.120
allows you to create
instances and create disks,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.870
so that already
alludes to the fact

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.000
that Google Compute Engine
is Google's infrastructure

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.149
as a service offering.

00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:21.930
So we have compute.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.040
We have storage.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.790
So all of the nodes can have
disks associated with them,

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.010
and that is network storage.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.870
We also have things like
networking provisions,

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.777
such as the load balancer
that we keep hearing about.

00:04:34.777 --> 00:04:37.360
And I'm actually super excited
to talk about the load balancer

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.710
because it is very fast,
and it is actually also

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.160
consistently fast.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:44.740
It requires no warm up time.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.010
You don't have to manage
any nodes or anything.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.645
It just works.

00:04:47.645 --> 00:04:49.020
You set up your
forwarding rules,

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.519
and you start sending
traffic there.

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:52.660
And it can handle
a lot of traffic.

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.700
It looks like our demo has
finished, so why don't we

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.650
see what we've created now
with Puppet and Google Compute

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:00.530
Engine.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.760
ASHLIE MARTINEZ: So
first, what we have to do

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.470
is we have to get the IP
address of our forwarding rule

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:07.700
so that we can actually
send traffic to it.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.730
If we just send traffic
to our instance's IPs,

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.280
it won't be balanced across
all of the instances, which

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.319
is why we need this IP address.

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:16.610
KATHARINA PROBST: That's right.

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.860
So we are going to, as
Ashlie mentioned, we're

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.577
going to be sending traffic to
that external IP address that

00:05:21.577 --> 00:05:23.160
represents a forwarding
rule, and then

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.160
our load balancer that
I keep talking about

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.290
will balance the traffic
between the nodes.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.690
And as you can see here,
with our Puppet manifest,

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.260
we've actually installed
Apache in a customized web

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.690
page on each of the nodes.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.840
And the traffic is
balanced between them,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.120
as you can see it
bouncing around.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.120
Let's switch back to the slides.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.910
And Ryan, why don't you
say a little bit more

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:52.080
about what your
experience has been

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.411
in working with Puppet and
Compute Engine together.

00:05:57.411 --> 00:05:58.660
RYAN COLEMAN: Yeah, thank you.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.190
So I think that the demo
sort of demonstrates

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.266
how these things
get put together.

00:06:03.266 --> 00:06:04.890
And whenever you
describe the instances

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.520
that you're going to manage
with Google Compute Engine,

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.180
we'll automatically build out
either a Puppet open source

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.260
or Puppet Enterprise
master and agent

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.250
that you can
immediately get started

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.054
managing the infrastructure you
want on Google Compute Engine.

00:06:17.054 --> 00:06:18.220
KATHARINA PROBST: Excellent.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:25.160
So if you'd like to find out
more, on this particular slide,

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.710
here are some links
that you can follow.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.497
We have a link to the demo where
you can find out a little bit

00:06:30.497 --> 00:06:32.080
more of the demo
we've just shown you,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.880
and it should give
you enough information

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:36.020
to actually reproduce
it for yourself.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.950
We have some Docs that give you
a little bit more information

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:40.060
as well.

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.450
And then you can go
off and also learn more

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.700
about Google Cloud
Platform and Puppet Labs,

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.430
and hopefully use
them both together

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.790
in a very productive way.

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:51.330
That's it from here today.

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.630
So thank you for
watching, and enjoy

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.900
using Puppet in
Google Cloud Platform.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:56.400
Bye.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:57.950
RYAN COLEMAN: Thank you.
