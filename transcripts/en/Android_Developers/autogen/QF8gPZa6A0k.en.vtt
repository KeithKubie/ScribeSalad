right away we also have a number of
 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.940
right away we also have a number of
performance improvements under the hood

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950
performance improvements under the hood
 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.670
performance improvements under the hood
we've greatly improved the caching for

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
we've greatly improved the caching for
 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.980

leaderboard scores if for instance your

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
leaderboard scores if for instance your
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.010
leaderboard scores if for instance your
user switches back and forth between

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
user switches back and forth between
 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.109

daily weekly and all-time leader board

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
daily weekly and all-time leader board
 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.429
daily weekly and all-time leader board
scores that will be much faster we do a

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
scores that will be much faster we do a
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.859
scores that will be much faster we do a
better job of batching and submitting

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
better job of batching and submitting
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.810
better job of batching and submitting
leaderboard scores if the user plays a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
leaderboard scores if the user plays a
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.480
leaderboard scores if the user plays a
bunch offline then comes back online all

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
bunch offline then comes back online all
 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100
bunch offline then comes back online all
of their leaderboard scores all their

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110
of their leaderboard scores all their
 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.039
of their leaderboard scores all their
score submissions will be submitted in

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049
score submissions will be submitted in
 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.929
score submissions will be submitted in
one nice little batch instead of saying

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939
one nice little batch instead of saying
 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.789
one nice little batch instead of saying
multiple score submission so that'll be

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
multiple score submission so that'll be
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.249
multiple score submission so that'll be
nice that'll be a lot more efficient we

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
nice that'll be a lot more efficient we
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.100
nice that'll be a lot more efficient we
have exposed that call as well if you

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110
have exposed that call as well if you
 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.039
have exposed that call as well if you
want to for instance submit a couple of

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049
want to for instance submit a couple of
 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.139
want to for instance submit a couple of
scores to a couple of leaderboards all

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
scores to a couple of leaderboards all
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.030
scores to a couple of leaderboards all
at once we now

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040
at once we now
 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.760
at once we now
have a call available for you to

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770
have a call available for you to
 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.350
have a call available for you to
basically batch all those up and make

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360
basically batch all those up and make
 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.480
basically batch all those up and make
those in one Network call which is

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490
those in one Network call which is
 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.860
those in one Network call which is
really nice the kind of you know saves

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
really nice the kind of you know saves
 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.990
really nice the kind of you know saves
on battery and performance and all of

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000
on battery and performance and all of
 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.150
on battery and performance and all of
that stuff we've also made just a number

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160
that stuff we've also made just a number
 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.060
that stuff we've also made just a number
of bug fixes and enhancements in in

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070
of bug fixes and enhancements in in
 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.830
of bug fixes and enhancements in in
general sort of performance improvements

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840
general sort of performance improvements
 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.870
general sort of performance improvements
under the hood and so we encourage you

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880
under the hood and so we encourage you
 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.400
under the hood and so we encourage you
to check it out I do want to let you

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410
to check it out I do want to let you
 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.740
to check it out I do want to let you
know about a couple of gotchas first

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750
know about a couple of gotchas first
 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.450
know about a couple of gotchas first
there are two new frameworks that are

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460
there are two new frameworks that are
 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.060
there are two new frameworks that are
required by this new library

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070
required by this new library
 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.070
required by this new library
specifically cortex framework and quartz

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080
specifically cortex framework and quartz
 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.930
specifically cortex framework and quartz
chord framework so if you haven't

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940
chord framework so if you haven't
 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.490
chord framework so if you haven't
included those in your project you'll

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500
included those in your project you'll
 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.040
included those in your project you'll
need to also with this new library

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050
need to also with this new library
 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.810
need to also with this new library
you're going to need a deployment target

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:43.820
you're going to need a deployment target
 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.550
you're going to need a deployment target
of iOS 6.0 or greater chances are you're

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560
of iOS 6.0 or greater chances are you're
 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.900
of iOS 6.0 or greater chances are you're
probably already doing that with your

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910
probably already doing that with your
 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.660
probably already doing that with your
game but if not you are going to need to

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670
game but if not you are going to need to
 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.040
game but if not you are going to need to
change your deployment target if you're

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050
change your deployment target if you're
 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.080
change your deployment target if you're
using this new library and so this

week's topic which is cloud save and so

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570
week's topic which is cloud save and so
 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.240
week's topic which is cloud save and so
cloud save is a really I think it's a

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250
cloud save is a really I think it's a
 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.840
cloud save is a really I think it's a
great feature

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:13.850
great feature
 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.330
great feature
I think this service is a little

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340
I think this service is a little
 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.789
I think this service is a little
underutilized right so it's missing on

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799
underutilized right so it's missing on
 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:19.849
underutilized right so it's missing on
so many games like

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859
so many games like
 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.379
so many games like
I've lost count how many times I've

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389
I've lost count how many times I've
 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.760
I've lost count how many times I've
played a game and wished it had clouds

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770
played a game and wished it had clouds
 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.159
played a game and wished it had clouds

say yeah I mean if you like if you
change devices and then have to lose all

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150
change devices and then have to lose all
 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.920
change devices and then have to lose all

I suppose Google employees might have

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080
I suppose Google employees might have
 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.219
I suppose Google employees might have
more devices than your typical consumer

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229
more devices than your typical consumer
 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.839
more devices than your typical consumer
but even now you're starting to see

00:04:35.839 --> 00:04:35.849
but even now you're starting to see
 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:37.969
but even now you're starting to see
consumers with a lot of devices in the

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979
consumers with a lot of devices in the
 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.890
consumers with a lot of devices in the
household right like maybe they've got

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900
household right like maybe they've got
 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.480
household right like maybe they've got
more than one phone maybe they've got a

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490
more than one phone maybe they've got a
 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.089
more than one phone maybe they've got a
phone and a tablet and they switch back

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099
phone and a tablet and they switch back
 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.309
phone and a tablet and they switch back
and forth between them and it would be

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:46.319
and forth between them and it would be
 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.559
and forth between them and it would be
great for your users if they could keep

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569
great for your users if they could keep
 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.450
great for your users if they could keep
their progress between you know one

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460
their progress between you know one
 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.149
their progress between you know one
device and the next if they suddenly you

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159
device and the next if they suddenly you
 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.619

phone to opening up your game on the
 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.189
phone to opening up your game on the
tablet and they realize that they have

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199
tablet and they realize that they have
 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.050
tablet and they realize that they have
to start over again all the way from

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060
to start over again all the way from
 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.760
to start over again all the way from
level one they're probably just not

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770
level one they're probably just not
 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.200
level one they're probably just not
going to play your game on that on that

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210
going to play your game on that on that
 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.330
going to play your game on that on that
device and you know maybe suddenly they

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340
device and you know maybe suddenly they
 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.219
device and you know maybe suddenly they
decide they've lost interest in it you

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229
decide they've lost interest in it you
 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:07.969
decide they've lost interest in it you
know they're not playing your game

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979
know they're not playing your game
 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.559
know they're not playing your game
anymore they're not seeing ads they're

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:09.569
anymore they're not seeing ads they're
 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:11.300
anymore they're not seeing ads they're
not buying in-game items they're not

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310
not buying in-game items they're not
 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.279
not buying in-game items they're not
telling their friends about it and you

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289
telling their friends about it and you
 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.980
telling their friends about it and you
know it's it's it's bad for for your

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990
know it's it's it's bad for for your
 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.540
know it's it's it's bad for for your
users and it's bad for you too

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550
users and it's bad for you too
 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.999
users and it's bad for you too
so we really encourage you to look into

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009
so we really encourage you to look into
 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:21.980
so we really encourage you to look into
cloud save it's really just designed to

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990
cloud save it's really just designed to
 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.629
cloud save it's really just designed to
do one thing and one thing only and

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:23.639
do one thing and one thing only and
 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:25.459
do one thing and one thing only and
that's kind of sync your users progress

00:05:25.459 --> 00:05:25.469
that's kind of sync your users progress
 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.059
that's kind of sync your users progress
from one device to the next and so with

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069
from one device to the next and so with
 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.249
from one device to the next and so with
that big preamble out of the way let's

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:31.259
that big preamble out of the way let's
 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:33.080
that big preamble out of the way let's
go into a demo actually before we go

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090
go into a demo actually before we go
 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.760
go into a demo actually before we go
into the demo it's important to notice

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770
into the demo it's important to notice
 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.930
into the demo it's important to notice
that a cloud save is actually

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940
that a cloud save is actually
 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.680
that a cloud save is actually
cross-platform

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690
cross-platform
 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.350
cross-platform
so you can even have again if your game

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360
so you can even have again if your game
 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.689
so you can even have again if your game
runs on Android and iOS I mean you can

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699
runs on Android and iOS I mean you can
 

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:43.879
runs on Android and iOS I mean you can
save your state on Android and then pick

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889
save your state on Android and then pick
 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.619
save your state on Android and then pick
up the same state where they left off on

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:45.629
up the same state where they left off on
 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:48.350
up the same state where they left off on
iOS or vice-versa so that's good for

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360
iOS or vice-versa so that's good for
 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.329
iOS or vice-versa so that's good for
households that have like one iPad and

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:50.339
households that have like one iPad and
 

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:52.399
households that have like one iPad and
then one Android and one iPhone and then

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409
then one Android and one iPhone and then
 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.890
then one Android and one iPhone and then
another Android so that is very true I

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900
another Android so that is very true I
 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.659
another Android so that is very true I
mean that's starting to become a common

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669
mean that's starting to become a common
 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:58.700
mean that's starting to become a common
situation households will have you know

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710
situation households will have you know
 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.829
situation households will have you know
Android phones and iPads or they'll have

00:06:00.829 --> 00:06:00.839
Android phones and iPads or they'll have
 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:03.619
Android phones and iPads or they'll have
you know a nexus 7 and iPhone and being

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629
you know a nexus 7 and iPhone and being
 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.570
you know a nexus 7 and iPhone and being
able to play your game and continue

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580
able to play your game and continue
 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.760
able to play your game and continue
progress between those devices what

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770
progress between those devices what
 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:09.829
progress between those devices what
would really be fantastic and if your

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:09.839
would really be fantastic and if your
 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:11.360
would really be fantastic and if your
game also works on the web you can also

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370
game also works on the web you can also
 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.839
game also works on the web you can also
share that state on the web so that's

00:06:14.839 --> 00:06:14.849
share that state on the web so that's
 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:16.790
share that state on the web so that's
pretty handy that is very true too all

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800
pretty handy that is very true too all
 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.320
pretty handy that is very true too all
right so with that in mind we're gonna

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330
right so with that in mind we're gonna
 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:21.439
right so with that in mind we're gonna

this is by Glu Mobile partly because
 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.149
this is by Glu Mobile partly because
it's a it's a pretty good example of

save to the cloud automatically however
 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.900
save to the cloud automatically however
because we're in a demo situation I'm

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:32.910
because we're in a demo situation I'm
 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:37.250
because we're in a demo situation I'm
going to manually enforce a save so it's

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:37.260
going to manually enforce a save so it's
 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:39.380
going to manually enforce a save so it's
gonna say ok I'm gonna save to the cloud

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:39.390
gonna say ok I'm gonna save to the cloud
 

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.180
gonna say ok I'm gonna save to the cloud
next that's next chance I have and

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.190
next that's next chance I have and
 

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.600
next that's next chance I have and
hopefully it's doing that right now

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:43.610
hopefully it's doing that right now
 

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.070
hopefully it's doing that right now
alright now let's let's switch to our

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080
alright now let's let's switch to our
 

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.270
alright now let's let's switch to our
tablet and see if that worked

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280
tablet and see if that worked
 

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.710
tablet and see if that worked
alright so I'm on the I'm on the Nexus

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720
alright so I'm on the I'm on the Nexus
 

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.590
alright so I'm on the I'm on the Nexus
10 now and I'm just gonna force a cloud

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:51.600
10 now and I'm just gonna force a cloud
 

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.719
10 now and I'm just gonna force a cloud
load here by going into the cloud load I

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:53.729
load here by going into the cloud load I
 

00:07:53.729 --> 00:07:55.520
load here by going into the cloud load I
mean you notice that normally this would

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:55.530
mean you notice that normally this would
 

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.960
mean you notice that normally this would
happen automatically we're just forcing

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:56.970
happen automatically we're just forcing
 

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.340
happen automatically we're just forcing
it so that we can actually do this in

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:58.350
it so that we can actually do this in
 

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.900
it so that we can actually do this in
that in a demo time frame instead of

00:07:59.900 --> 00:07:59.910
that in a demo time frame instead of
 

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:00.950
that in a demo time frame instead of
sitting around waiting for it to load

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960
sitting around waiting for it to load
 

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.190
sitting around waiting for it to load
but normally this the user would would

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:04.200
but normally this the user would would
 

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.659
but normally this the user would would
not have to do this so now we're loading

00:08:05.659 --> 00:08:05.669
not have to do this so now we're loading
 

00:08:05.669 --> 00:08:07.130
not have to do this so now we're loading
the game again so remember that Todd

00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:07.140
the game again so remember that Todd
 

00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.590
the game again so remember that Todd
upgraded the character on the Galaxy

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:09.600
upgraded the character on the Galaxy
 

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.330
upgraded the character on the Galaxy
Nexus so what we should see when the

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:11.340
Nexus so what we should see when the
 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.980
Nexus so what we should see when the
game loads is that the character is

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:12.990
game loads is that the character is
 

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:15.440
game loads is that the character is
gonna be upgraded so we should see a

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:15.450
gonna be upgraded so we should see a
 

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:16.820
gonna be upgraded so we should see a
higher level character should see that

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:16.830
higher level character should see that
 

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.719
higher level character should see that
work fingers crossed

00:08:17.719 --> 00:08:17.729
work fingers crossed
 

00:08:17.729 --> 00:08:21.440
work fingers crossed
yep let's see here I'm gonna start and

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.450
yep let's see here I'm gonna start and
 

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.280
yep let's see here I'm gonna start and
and there we go yep so same level level

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:25.290
and there we go yep so same level level
 

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.320
and there we go yep so same level level
3 you are level 3 before it well yeah or

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.330
3 you are level 3 before it well yeah or
 

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.760
3 you are level 3 before it well yeah or
I guess level 2 that option is to

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:28.770
I guess level 2 that option is to
 

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.890
I guess level 2 that option is to
upgrade to level 3 oh yeah

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:30.900
upgrade to level 3 oh yeah
 

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.649
upgrade to level 3 oh yeah
point being it's a my progress is

00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:33.659
point being it's a my progress is
 

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.089
point being it's a my progress is
carried over from one device to the next

00:08:35.089 --> 00:08:35.099
carried over from one device to the next
 

00:08:35.099 --> 00:08:36.699
carried over from one device to the next
and now I can keep playing

00:08:36.699 --> 00:08:36.709
and now I can keep playing
 

00:08:36.709 --> 00:08:38.649
and now I can keep playing
on the Nexus 10 which actually is a much

00:08:38.649 --> 00:08:38.659
on the Nexus 10 which actually is a much
 

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:40.569
on the Nexus 10 which actually is a much
better framerate so this is a this is a

00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:40.579
better framerate so this is a this is a
 

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:42.639
better framerate so this is a this is a
better platform to play on anyway yep so

00:08:42.639 --> 00:08:42.649
better platform to play on anyway yep so
 

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:44.319
better platform to play on anyway yep so
I'm just gonna take this with me after

00:08:44.319 --> 00:08:44.329
I'm just gonna take this with me after
 

00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:48.069
I'm just gonna take this with me after
the show okay so there we go alright so

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:48.079
the show okay so there we go alright so
 

00:08:48.079 --> 00:08:49.299
the show okay so there we go alright so
conflict management

00:08:49.299 --> 00:08:49.309
conflict management
 

00:08:49.309 --> 00:08:52.329
conflict management
so cloud safe I mean it's it's pretty

00:08:52.329 --> 00:08:52.339
so cloud safe I mean it's it's pretty
 

00:08:52.339 --> 00:08:53.679
so cloud safe I mean it's it's pretty
convenient it can save and it can load

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:53.689
convenient it can save and it can load
 

00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:55.629
convenient it can save and it can load
but then imagine what happens if two

00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:55.639
but then imagine what happens if two
 

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:57.879
but then imagine what happens if two
devices try to save conflicting states

00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:57.889
devices try to save conflicting states
 

00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:59.559
devices try to save conflicting states
at the same time to the cloud so I'm

00:08:59.559 --> 00:08:59.569
at the same time to the cloud so I'm
 

00:08:59.569 --> 00:09:01.689
at the same time to the cloud so I'm
playing here on my tablet and then I

00:09:01.689 --> 00:09:01.699
playing here on my tablet and then I
 

00:09:01.699 --> 00:09:04.299
playing here on my tablet and then I
upgrade my character to level 2 and then

00:09:04.299 --> 00:09:04.309
upgrade my character to level 2 and then
 

00:09:04.309 --> 00:09:06.429
upgrade my character to level 2 and then
on my phone I upgrade the same character

00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:06.439
on my phone I upgrade the same character
 

00:09:06.439 --> 00:09:08.919
on my phone I upgrade the same character
to level 4 without sinking sinking up

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:08.929
to level 4 without sinking sinking up
 

00:09:08.929 --> 00:09:10.329
to level 4 without sinking sinking up
the changes what's gonna happen is

00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:10.339
the changes what's gonna happen is
 

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:12.069
the changes what's gonna happen is
what's called the carb save conflict so

00:09:12.069 --> 00:09:12.079
what's called the carb save conflict so
 

00:09:12.079 --> 00:09:14.319
what's called the carb save conflict so
you need to think about those save

00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:14.329
you need to think about those save
 

00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:16.389
you need to think about those save
conflicts and then handle them in a way

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:16.399
conflicts and then handle them in a way
 

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:17.710
conflicts and then handle them in a way
that makes sense for your app so if you

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:17.720
that makes sense for your app so if you
 

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.629
that makes sense for your app so if you
wanna take a look this is that link over

00:09:19.629 --> 00:09:19.639
wanna take a look this is that link over
 

00:09:19.639 --> 00:09:22.239
wanna take a look this is that link over
there is a link to to a white paper that

00:09:22.239 --> 00:09:22.249
there is a link to to a white paper that
 

00:09:22.249 --> 00:09:25.059
there is a link to to a white paper that
we wrote that talks about how many

00:09:25.059 --> 00:09:25.069
we wrote that talks about how many
 

00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:27.040
we wrote that talks about how many
strategies to handle clouds of conflicts

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.050
strategies to handle clouds of conflicts
 

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.960
strategies to handle clouds of conflicts
and how to make that in a way that makes

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:28.970
and how to make that in a way that makes
 

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.119
and how to make that in a way that makes
sense and that especially and this is

00:09:31.119 --> 00:09:31.129
sense and that especially and this is
 

00:09:31.129 --> 00:09:32.470
sense and that especially and this is
especially important in a way that

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480
especially important in a way that
 

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.819
especially important in a way that
doesn't lose any progress for the user

00:09:33.819 --> 00:09:33.829
doesn't lose any progress for the user
 

00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:37.379
doesn't lose any progress for the user
right so it's a it's a pretty in-depth

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:37.389
right so it's a it's a pretty in-depth
 

00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:41.530
right so it's a it's a pretty in-depth
bit of bitter reading my takeaway if you

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:41.540
bit of bitter reading my takeaway if you
 

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.509
bit of bitter reading my takeaway if you
just want some general advice is when

00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519
just want some general advice is when
 

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:45.929
just want some general advice is when
you're trying to resolve to cloud saves

00:09:45.929 --> 00:09:45.939
you're trying to resolve to cloud saves
 

00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:48.340
you're trying to resolve to cloud saves
resolve these two states in isolation

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:48.350
resolve these two states in isolation
 

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.100
resolve these two states in isolation
don't assume based on sort of the local

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:51.110
don't assume based on sort of the local
 

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:53.110
don't assume based on sort of the local
users game state or anything you know

00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120
users game state or anything you know
 

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.749
users game state or anything you know
more than in sort of what you get from

00:09:55.749 --> 00:09:55.759
more than in sort of what you get from
 

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:59.049
more than in sort of what you get from
the cloud save data just because you

00:09:59.049 --> 00:09:59.059
the cloud save data just because you
 

00:09:59.059 --> 00:10:01.889
the cloud save data just because you
it's it gets a little tricky but due to

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:01.899
it's it gets a little tricky but due to
 

00:10:01.899 --> 00:10:04.449
it's it gets a little tricky but due to
some times the way we give you these two

00:10:04.449 --> 00:10:04.459
some times the way we give you these two
 

00:10:04.459 --> 00:10:07.169
some times the way we give you these two
states to resolve they might not be

00:10:07.169 --> 00:10:07.179
states to resolve they might not be
 

00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:09.759
states to resolve they might not be
actually in the the timeframe that you

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:09.769
actually in the the timeframe that you
 

00:10:09.769 --> 00:10:12.879
actually in the the timeframe that you
expect so long long story short try and

00:10:12.879 --> 00:10:12.889
expect so long long story short try and
 

00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:15.009
expect so long long story short try and
reserve these try and resolve these two

00:10:15.009 --> 00:10:15.019
reserve these try and resolve these two
 

00:10:15.019 --> 00:10:17.439
reserve these try and resolve these two
states as if this is the only data you

00:10:17.439 --> 00:10:17.449
states as if this is the only data you
 

00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:19.269
states as if this is the only data you
have and just try and forget about the

00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279
have and just try and forget about the
 

00:10:19.279 --> 00:10:20.470
have and just try and forget about the
rest of the world when you're when

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480
rest of the world when you're when
 

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.600
rest of the world when you're when
you're doing that and I suppose there's

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:22.610
you're doing that and I suppose there's
 

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:23.889
you're doing that and I suppose there's
there's a couple ways you can kind of

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:23.899
there's a couple ways you can kind of
 

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:26.559
there's a couple ways you can kind of
look at this problem one way is you know

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:26.569
look at this problem one way is you know
 

00:10:26.569 --> 00:10:29.169
look at this problem one way is you know
if you want to be clever do it do it

00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:29.179
if you want to be clever do it do it
 

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:32.439
if you want to be clever do it do it
Bruno's way would be you can you can

00:10:32.439 --> 00:10:32.449
Bruno's way would be you can you can
 

00:10:32.449 --> 00:10:33.970
Bruno's way would be you can you can
essentially just you can look at the be

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:33.980
essentially just you can look at the be
 

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.350
essentially just you can look at the be
the two states and see if there's a

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360
the two states and see if there's a
 

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.939
the two states and see if there's a
clever way in which you can merge them

00:10:36.939 --> 00:10:36.949
clever way in which you can merge them
 

00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:39.400
clever way in which you can merge them
together instead of just picking one or

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:39.410
together instead of just picking one or
 

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.379
together instead of just picking one or
the other sometimes it might just make

00:10:41.379 --> 00:10:41.389
the other sometimes it might just make
 

00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:42.639
the other sometimes it might just make
sense to pick one or the other but

00:10:42.639 --> 00:10:42.649
sense to pick one or the other but
 

00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:44.079
sense to pick one or the other but
sometimes if you notice that they have

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:44.089
sometimes if you notice that they have
 

00:10:44.089 --> 00:10:46.389
sometimes if you notice that they have
discrepancies it might make sense to

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399
discrepancies it might make sense to
 

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:48.039
discrepancies it might make sense to
sort of like merge them intelligently

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:48.049
sort of like merge them intelligently
 

00:10:48.049 --> 00:10:49.960
sort of like merge them intelligently
together so this is what for instance

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:49.970
together so this is what for instance
 

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.449
together so this is what for instance
sample collect all the stars do does

00:10:52.449 --> 00:10:52.459
sample collect all the stars do does
 

00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:54.280
sample collect all the stars do does
which is for instance if you unlock a

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:54.290
which is for instance if you unlock a
 

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:55.990
which is for instance if you unlock a
few levels on one device and then I look

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:56.000
few levels on one device and then I look
 

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.490
few levels on one device and then I look
at different set of levels on different

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:57.500
at different set of levels on different
 

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:59.499
at different set of levels on different
device then what it does is it actually

00:10:59.499 --> 00:10:59.509
device then what it does is it actually
 

00:10:59.509 --> 00:11:01.689
device then what it does is it actually
combines those two saves into one it

00:11:01.689 --> 00:11:01.699
combines those two saves into one it
 

00:11:01.699 --> 00:11:02.860
combines those two saves into one it
doesn't choose one doesn't choose the

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:02.870
doesn't choose one doesn't choose the
 

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.480
doesn't choose one doesn't choose the
other but actually combines them into a

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:04.490
other but actually combines them into a
 

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.519
other but actually combines them into a
single save that has all of those levels

00:11:06.519 --> 00:11:06.529
single save that has all of those levels
 

00:11:06.529 --> 00:11:09.189
single save that has all of those levels
unlocked so yeah if you think about a

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:09.199
unlocked so yeah if you think about a
 

00:11:09.199 --> 00:11:11.769
unlocked so yeah if you think about a
lot of games you know cut the rope Angry

00:11:11.769 --> 00:11:11.779
lot of games you know cut the rope Angry
 

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:13.480
lot of games you know cut the rope Angry
Birds where's my where's my water

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:13.490
Birds where's my where's my water
 

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.090
Birds where's my where's my water
where's my Mickey which is awesome you

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:16.100
where's my Mickey which is awesome you
 

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.280
where's my Mickey which is awesome you
know if you think about the way those

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:18.290
know if you think about the way those
 

00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:20.410
know if you think about the way those
games work in general you know you have

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:20.420
games work in general you know you have
 

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:22.329
games work in general you know you have
stars on every level and you have high

00:11:22.329 --> 00:11:22.339
stars on every level and you have high
 

00:11:22.339 --> 00:11:24.460
stars on every level and you have high
scores on each level and that can be

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:24.470
scores on each level and that can be
 

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.769
scores on each level and that can be
pretty safely Union between two

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:26.779
pretty safely Union between two
 

00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:28.689
pretty safely Union between two
conflicting sets of data right if you

00:11:28.689 --> 00:11:28.699
conflicting sets of data right if you
 

00:11:28.699 --> 00:11:30.639
conflicting sets of data right if you
have you know two stars on level one

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:30.649
have you know two stars on level one
 

00:11:30.649 --> 00:11:32.590
have you know two stars on level one
four on this device and three stars and

00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:32.600
four on this device and three stars and
 

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.730
four on this device and three stars and
level one four in this other device

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:33.740
level one four in this other device
 

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:35.050
level one four in this other device
that's something you can very easily

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:35.060
that's something you can very easily
 

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.030
that's something you can very easily
merge just by saying let's let's take

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040
merge just by saying let's let's take
 

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.920
merge just by saying let's let's take
the greater number of stars yeah but be

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:38.930
the greater number of stars yeah but be
 

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.889
the greater number of stars yeah but be
careful about stars may may be an easy

00:11:41.889 --> 00:11:41.899
careful about stars may may be an easy
 

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:43.480
careful about stars may may be an easy
case but be careful about stuff like the

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:43.490
case but be careful about stuff like the
 

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:44.769
case but be careful about stuff like the
virtual currency and stuff like that

00:11:44.769 --> 00:11:44.779
virtual currency and stuff like that
 

00:11:44.779 --> 00:11:46.540
virtual currency and stuff like that
because it can get actually into into

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:46.550
because it can get actually into into
 

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.110
because it can get actually into into
into too hard to predict problems so the

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:50.120
into too hard to predict problems so the
 

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:52.269
into too hard to predict problems so the
more details about that in the and the

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279
more details about that in the and the
 

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:53.860
more details about that in the and the
white paper and then of course if you

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:53.870
white paper and then of course if you
 

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.990
white paper and then of course if you
don't want to be clever just asking the

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000
don't want to be clever just asking the
 

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.699
don't want to be clever just asking the
user say hey you know what we found

00:11:57.699 --> 00:11:57.709
user say hey you know what we found
 

00:11:57.709 --> 00:11:59.530
user say hey you know what we found
these two sets of cloud data this one

00:11:59.530 --> 00:11:59.540
these two sets of cloud data this one
 

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.720
these two sets of cloud data this one
looks like it was saved on you know July

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:01.730
looks like it was saved on you know July
 

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.210
looks like it was saved on you know July
30th on this device and this one looks

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:04.220
30th on this device and this one looks
 

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.129
30th on this device and this one looks
like it was saved on August 1st you know

00:12:06.129 --> 00:12:06.139
like it was saved on August 1st you know
 

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:07.900
like it was saved on August 1st you know
at this time on this device you're at

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:07.910
at this time on this device you're at
 

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.689
at this time on this device you're at
level you know for with a thief on on

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:10.699
level you know for with a thief on on
 

00:12:10.699 --> 00:12:12.519
level you know for with a thief on on
this one and you're at level 5 with a

00:12:12.519 --> 00:12:12.529
this one and you're at level 5 with a
 

00:12:12.529 --> 00:12:15.040
this one and you're at level 5 with a
paladin on this device which one do you

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.050
paladin on this device which one do you
 

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.230
paladin on this device which one do you
really want you know ask we user bring

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240
really want you know ask we user bring
 

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.059
really want you know ask we user bring
up the dialogue chances are the user

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:19.069
up the dialogue chances are the user
 

00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:20.860
up the dialogue chances are the user
will know which one they want examine

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:20.870
will know which one they want examine
 

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.490
will know which one they want examine
and go with what they pick yep so if you

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:24.500
and go with what they pick yep so if you
 

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.249
and go with what they pick yep so if you
want more information check the docs you

00:12:27.249 --> 00:12:27.259
want more information check the docs you
 

00:12:27.259 --> 00:12:28.329
want more information check the docs you
probably knew we were going to say that

00:12:28.329 --> 00:12:28.339
probably knew we were going to say that
 

00:12:28.339 --> 00:12:30.429
probably knew we were going to say that
but but there's the there say that on

00:12:30.429 --> 00:12:30.439
but but there's the there say that on
 

00:12:30.439 --> 00:12:33.249
but but there's the there say that on
every show we kind of do like go to the

00:12:33.249 --> 00:12:33.259
every show we kind of do like go to the
 

00:12:33.259 --> 00:12:35.199
every show we kind of do like go to the
doc is all go or not we we spent a lot

00:12:35.199 --> 00:12:35.209
doc is all go or not we we spent a lot
 

00:12:35.209 --> 00:12:37.689
doc is all go or not we we spent a lot
of time on them you should read them we

00:12:37.689 --> 00:12:37.699
of time on them you should read them we
 

00:12:37.699 --> 00:12:39.699
of time on them you should read them we
have a link to cloud save they're on you

00:12:39.699 --> 00:12:39.709
have a link to cloud save they're on you
 

00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:41.110
have a link to cloud save they're on you
know sort of general concepts you can

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120
know sort of general concepts you can
 

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:43.179
know sort of general concepts you can
read up more about it read Bruno's white

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:43.189
read up more about it read Bruno's white
 

00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:45.340
read up more about it read Bruno's white
paper yeah and if of course if you are

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:45.350
paper yeah and if of course if you are
 

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.049
paper yeah and if of course if you are
if you want some real excitement you can

00:12:47.049 --> 00:12:47.059
if you want some real excitement you can

if you want some real excitement you can
try out of sample app just collect all

00:12:48.819 --> 00:12:48.829
try out of sample app just collect all
 

00:12:48.829 --> 00:12:50.470
try out of sample app just collect all
the stars and we have versions for

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480
the stars and we have versions for
 

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:52.780
the stars and we have versions for
collect all the stars on Android iOS and

collect all the stars on Android iOS and
 

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.449
collect all the stars on Android iOS and
web so you can you can see what it looks

00:12:55.449 --> 00:12:55.459
web so you can you can see what it looks
 

00:12:55.459 --> 00:12:57.939
web so you can you can see what it looks
like saving one state from on one device

00:12:57.939 --> 00:12:57.949
like saving one state from on one device
 

00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:59.410
like saving one state from on one device
and another state another completely

00:12:59.410 --> 00:12:59.420
and another state another completely
 

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:00.930
and another state another completely
different device

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:00.940
different device
 

00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:02.640
different device
watching your progress carryover it's

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:02.650
watching your progress carryover it's
 

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:04.230
watching your progress carryover it's
it's pretty much and it's a very

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240
