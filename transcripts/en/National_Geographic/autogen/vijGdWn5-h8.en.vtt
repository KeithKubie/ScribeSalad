00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:04.780
Fungi and slime molds race to decompose

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.920
dead matter on the forest floor.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.350
Many spread by releasing spores

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.785
up to thirty thousand a second.

00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:18.285
(scary music)

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.560
If just one of these spores

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.193
lands in the right place,

00:00:24.193 --> 00:00:26.083
and takes root,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.626
it can colonize a whole new area.

00:00:30.626 --> 00:00:33.126
(scary music)

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.763
But not all fungi feed on the dead.

00:00:42.856 --> 00:00:45.356
(scary music)

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.483
Days ago, a spore landed on this ant,

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.813
now she's acting strange.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.423
A network of roots has
infiltrated her muscles.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.260
Her body has been

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.273
taken over by cordyceps,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.640
a parasitic fungus.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.100
It floods her brain with chemicals,

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.830
drugging her, compelling her

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:36.933
to head where conditions are perfect.

00:01:38.672 --> 00:01:41.172
(scary music)

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:49.010
Just the right amount of light.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.210
Just the right amount of humidity

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.833
for the parasite growing inside.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.653
It forces her to clamp
down in a death bite.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.843
And cordyceps reveals
it's gruesome nature.

00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:12.281
(scary music)

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.743
After three weeks of growth,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.823
cordyceps can release its own spores.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.713
Infecting more ants.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.323
Releasing more spores.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.720
Infecting more ants.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.000
Releasing more spores.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.810
Infecting more ants.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.787
Infecting more ants.

00:02:51.787 --> 00:02:52.620
More ants.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:53.453
More ants.

00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:54.286
More ants.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.080
(scary music)

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.780
Cordyceps can wipe out
entire ant colonies.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.713
But more than just ants are at risk.

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:16.879
(scary music)

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:25.660
There are over six hundred

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.853
species of cordyceps
spread across the world.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.940
Most are found in jungles

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.573
where they prey on a
whole host of victims.

00:03:38.748 --> 00:03:41.248
(scary music)
