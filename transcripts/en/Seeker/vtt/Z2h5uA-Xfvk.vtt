00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:03.350
Drinking alcohol is like borrowing happiness
from tomorrow.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.970
Assuming all goes well, you and your friends
have a good time, and then the next morning

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.920
you’re paying that debt back in the form
of a hangover.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.260
And trust me, the older you get, the steeper
the interest rate.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.710
Why isn’t there some miraculous pill I could
take that lets me do what I want without any

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.710
consequences?

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.119
It turns out there might be, the catch is
it’s only for mice at the moment.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.259
First let’s talk about hangovers, just to
get it out of the way as soon as possible.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.410
Don’t worry, I’ll dim the lights and talk
quietly.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.970
Alcohol plays a number of tricks on your body
that set you up for a rough morning.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.260
It tells your pituitary gland to stop producing
vasopressin, a hormone that helps you retain

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.329
moisture.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.970
Without it your liquids go to your bladder,
which is why you have to pee all the time

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.500
when you’ve been out drinking.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.059
Fast forward to the next day and you’re
dehydrated like the plants in my house I keep

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.059
forgetting to water.

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.170
You’ve peed away things your cells and muscles
need to function -- like salt, magnesium,

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.289
and potassium.

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.690
And your other organs have stolen water from
your brain, causing it to literally shrink

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.379
and pull on the membranes that attach it to
your skull.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.640
Consequently your head feels like it’s being
crushed by a Mountain, it’s like being Oberyn

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.640
Martell.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.560
Now on top of all that, there’s a byproduct
of alcohol that can make hangovers even worse.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.990
The most common way your liver breaks alcohol
down is a two step process, and unfortunately

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.790
the first step turns alcohol into acetaldehyde.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.870
Acetaldehyde is highly toxic and makes your
headache and nausea worse.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.820
Oh, and it’s a known carcinogen.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.870
If you’re drinking at a moderate pace your
liver can break it down into the more benign

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.870
acetate.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.810
But drink too much and the enzymes can’t
keep up, so we get a buildup of this nasty

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.420
acetaldehyde.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.960
So with that in mind researchers have been
trying to give your liver a hand.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.851
Inspired by how the liver cells work, they
created a combination of three enzymes to

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:46.940
neutralize alcohol: alcohol oxidase (AOx),
catalase (CAT), and aldehyde dehydrogenase

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.940
(ALDH).

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.290
The first two break the alcohol down to acetaldehyde,
and the last one is the same enzyme your body

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830
uses to turn acetaldehyde into acetate.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.060
These enzymes are nothing new, but the real
trick was figuring out a safe and effective

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.300
way to get them to the liver where they could
provide reinforcements.

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.080
The researchers chose to wrap each of the
enzymes in a protective shell that’s already

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.450
FDA approved, creating nanocapsules of enzymes
that would build up in the liver.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.410
You can’t go straight to testing something
like this in humans, so the researchers used

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.340
drunk mice instead.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.710
Now I don’t know how they got the mice drunk,
but I like to imagine teeny tiny shot glasses

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.970
were involved.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.950
Anyway once drunk and passed out, the researchers
injected the mice with their triple enzyme

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.950
elixir.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.840
In four hours the blood alcohol level of the
treated mice dropped 45% more than the untreated

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.210
ones, and acetaldehyde levels stayed extremely
low.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.920
This could be a major boon not just for the
shambling Sunday morning masses, but for emergency

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.330
situations like alcohol poisoning too.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.470
Right now treatments for alcohol overdose
mostly rely on the body’s own pathways to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.700
break down alcohol.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.340
The fast elimination of the carcinogen acetaldehyde
could reduce the risk of cardiovascular and

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.800
liver cancer as well.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.120
The next step is making sure these nanocapsules
are safe with no unforeseen side effects.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.320
If testing goes well on animals, clinical
trials on humans could start as soon as 2019.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.150
Until then, just remember what’s lurking
for you

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.840
A saline drip is supposedly a miracle hangover
cure since it rehydrates you intravenously,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.310
but it turns out the saline we use is based
on terrible science.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.480
Find out why here.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.190
Did you know darker liquors can cause more
severe hangovers because of the impurities

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.080
called congeners that give them their color.
