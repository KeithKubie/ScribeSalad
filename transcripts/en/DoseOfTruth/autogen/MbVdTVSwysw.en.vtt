looking at it there is more diversity

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840
looking at it there is more diversity
 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.400
looking at it there is more diversity
within groups of people than between so

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410
within groups of people than between so
 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.590
within groups of people than between so
like men and women differ to some degree

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
like men and women differ to some degree
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.299

male group and women within the male
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.840
male group and women within the male
group than there is between the average

group than there is between the average
 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.930
group than there is between the average
or typical male and female so it's a

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
or typical male and female so it's a
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.880

stupid wait let's assume that what you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890
stupid wait let's assume that what you
 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.240
stupid wait let's assume that what you
want the organization is pursuing a

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
want the organization is pursuing a
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.029
want the organization is pursuing a
complex goal and you want a variety of

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039
complex goal and you want a variety of
 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.459
complex goal and you want a variety of
skills that would be suited to that goal

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
skills that would be suited to that goal
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860
skills that would be suited to that goal
then you want there to be enough

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870
then you want there to be enough
 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.620
then you want there to be enough
diversity of ability within the group so

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
diversity of ability within the group so
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.870
diversity of ability within the group so
that the goal can be achieved in a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880
that the goal can be achieved in a
 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.340
that the goal can be achieved in a
efficient and and and inexpensive manner

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350
efficient and and and inexpensive manner
 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.990
efficient and and and inexpensive manner
right because what do you want

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000
right because what do you want
 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.550

not so there's a presumption that you

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
not so there's a presumption that you
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.210
not so there's a presumption that you
get diversity by using identity politics

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
get diversity by using identity politics
 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.039
get diversity by using identity politics
categories but there's absolutely no

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049
categories but there's absolutely no
 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.719
categories but there's absolutely no
evidence for that whatsoever so that's

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729
evidence for that whatsoever so that's
 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.300
evidence for that whatsoever so that's
why diversity defined by race or

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310
why diversity defined by race or
 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.480
why diversity defined by race or
ethnicity or gender is not only not a

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
ethnicity or gender is not only not a
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.719
ethnicity or gender is not only not a
moral good it's actually a moral evil

idea of confidence it just replaces it
 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.940
idea of confidence it just replaces it
with the assumption that if you randomly

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
with the assumption that if you randomly
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.800
with the assumption that if you randomly
select from the population because

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810
select from the population because
 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.170
select from the population because
that's how you would get real equity you

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180
that's how you would get real equity you
 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.450
that's how you would get real equity you
randomly select from the population that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
randomly select from the population that
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.639
randomly select from the population that
that gives you the best qualified group

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
that gives you the best qualified group
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.370
that gives you the best qualified group
of people well that's just that's you

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380
of people well that's just that's you
 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.990

wouldn't do that to select the Plumber

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
wouldn't do that to select the Plumber

selecting for anything randomly you know
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.979
selecting for anything randomly you know
there's no difference between selecting

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989
there's no difference between selecting
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.070
there's no difference between selecting
randomly and selecting accidentally so

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
randomly and selecting accidentally so

now you might say well it would be
better if 50% of that were elected it's

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159
better if 50% of that were elected it's
 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.159
better if 50% of that were elected it's
like maybe it would be better but it

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169
like maybe it would be better but it
 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.089
