00:00:07.726 --> 00:00:13.146
&gt;&gt;We're at the age of accountability
in schools with No Child Left Behind.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:19.226
And- and schools, you know,
schools have, you know,

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:21.476
have goals to meet
with their testing.

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:25.586
But I really feel that students,
unless they feel a sense

00:00:25.586 --> 00:00:31.156
of connectedness to school
and unless they, you know,

00:00:31.156 --> 00:00:34.866
if they don't feel a sense of
belonging, they're not gonna achieve

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.476
at the academic level that
you want them to achieve.

00:00:37.476 --> 00:00:40.766
You know, there are a lot of
things out there right now

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:45.846
in school reform quick--
what I call a quick fix,

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.656
you know, for test scores.

00:00:47.656 --> 00:00:53.696
And those things are things that
I don't feel are long-lasting

00:00:53.876 --> 00:00:56.236
or in the best interest
of- of the school.

00:00:56.396 --> 00:01:01.606
I think that you have to lay the
foundation and build the sense

00:01:01.606 --> 00:01:04.906
of community within the school
and put the systems in place

00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:08.356
of how you do business
and how you operate.

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:12.986
And once that foundation is
laid, the test scores will come.

00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:16.376
But that cultural piece
has to be there.

00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:20.716
You know, you- you can't have one
I don't believe, without the other.

00:01:21.686 --> 00:01:24.696
One of the things that I
like to do as principal is,

00:01:25.616 --> 00:01:29.276
I like to have conversations
with teachers about ideas

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:33.026
and say "Now could you go and
share this with other teachers

00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:36.316
in your department or could
you share it with your team?"

00:01:36.366 --> 00:01:40.516
Because I think a lot of times
principals get more resistance

00:01:40.516 --> 00:01:45.206
from teachers if feel like that
it's coming from the top down.

00:01:45.776 --> 00:01:51.876
I think you know, you-- I think you
get a much greater sense of buy-in

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:55.976
when teachers are taking
ideas to other teachers.

00:01:55.976 --> 00:01:59.846
And- and so I think
your job as principal,

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:04.226
needs to be to support teacher
leaders and teachers wanting to-

00:02:04.926 --> 00:02:09.746
to develop creative and innovative
things within your school.

00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:12.406
And so I think that
is a key component.

00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:16.386
I also think that-- because you
know, you've got to get buy-in

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.856
from everybody before you
do something like this.

00:02:19.816 --> 00:02:22.136
I think my leadership style is one

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:25.656
where I've always been a
person that's welcomed debate.

00:02:26.556 --> 00:02:31.126
I've always been one that I
do not feel that, you know,

00:02:31.126 --> 00:02:33.576
I have to be the center of
the universe as principal.

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:39.426
I enjoy other people
stepping up and taking- taking

00:02:39.426 --> 00:02:44.566
on the responsibilities and jobs
that need to be performed in schools

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:49.456
because I think true greatness
comes when everybody is involved,

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:51.586
when it's a- when it's
a collaborative effort.

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:55.226
And you know, everybody feels

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:58.846
that they're a partner
in- in the great work.

00:02:58.846 --> 00:03:00.976
And not only staff
but students as well

00:03:01.116 --> 00:03:03.396
and parents and community members.

00:03:03.396 --> 00:03:07.236
And so I think when you get
all of those pieces together,

00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:12.836
you have the ingredients, you have
the recipe for- for great things.

00:03:12.836 --> 00:03:14.276
And that's- that's where we're at.

00:03:14.276 --> 00:03:16.566
You know, we're very
early on in our work.

00:03:17.056 --> 00:03:21.486
This is the-- in fact, this is just
year two of a- of a new school.

00:03:22.096 --> 00:03:26.186
But the- the ingredients, the
recipes that need to be there,

00:03:26.186 --> 00:03:31.456
the interaction the way that
business is done within the school,

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:36.806
the way that people
can speak up and debate

00:03:37.016 --> 00:03:39.756
and share issues and
talk about things.

00:03:41.146 --> 00:03:46.176
Those things are vital
to continual growth.

00:03:47.406 --> 00:03:50.816
We became an all boys'
school this year as well.

00:03:51.416 --> 00:03:59.246
And so in doing that and- and for us,
the boys had received the majority

00:03:59.246 --> 00:04:00.786
of the referrals over girls.

00:04:00.986 --> 00:04:06.346
So we doubled our boys' population
when we be- when we became all boys.

00:04:06.346 --> 00:04:10.826
And we reduced our referrals in half.

00:04:10.826 --> 00:04:15.386
We reduced our placements of
in-school suspensions in half.

00:04:16.106 --> 00:04:19.996
Reduced suspensions overall,
out of school suspensions.

00:04:20.516 --> 00:04:24.216
And- and we have increased our
attendance, our pupil attendance,

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:28.486
every single people month as
compared to the previous year.

00:04:28.596 --> 00:04:30.126
We're going on 12 months now.

00:04:30.386 --> 00:04:38.996
So created an environment I think,
of less problems in the classroom

00:04:38.996 --> 00:04:41.636
and in the school in terms
of behavior and a sense

00:04:41.636 --> 00:04:44.216
of students wanting to be at school.

00:04:45.156 --> 00:04:51.366
We also do surveys as a district,
comprehensive school surveys.

00:04:51.366 --> 00:04:57.446
And before Care For Kids, about
56, 57 percent of the students felt

00:04:57.446 --> 00:05:00.336
like their teachers care about
them, a little over half.

00:05:01.016 --> 00:05:05.986
When we surveyed our boys last year,
that number turned to 85 percent.

00:05:06.786 --> 00:05:09.926
And so we saw a huge
increase in terms

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:17.226
of how the boys saw their teachers
and how they looked upon school

00:05:17.226 --> 00:05:18.976
as a whole and they
wanted to be here more.

00:05:20.246 --> 00:05:22.126
