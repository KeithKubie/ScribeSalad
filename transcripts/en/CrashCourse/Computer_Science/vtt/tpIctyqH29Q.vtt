00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:04.100
Hello world!

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.430
I’m Carrie Anne Philbin and welcome to Crash
Course Computer Science!

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.340
So, computers really have allowed us to do
some pretty amazing things - think global

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.020
telecommunications, international commerce,
global transportation, breakthroughs in medicine,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:24.240
distributed education, online shopping, online
dating, just the Internet in general.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.850
Computers are allowing us to explore our own
world and other worlds, and of course some

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.300
seemingly mundane things like permitting us
to spy on our pets from work or communicate

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.390
with our friends in a nearly indecipherable
stream of emoji!

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:36.930
But don’t call computers magical.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.819
They are not, I repeat ARE NOT, magical.

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:43.960
So before we get into what we are going to
talk about in this course, it might be useful

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.909
to tell you what we aren’t going to talk
about.

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.379
We aren’t going to teach you how to program.

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.889
Programming is a really crucial aspect of
computer software, and we will get to the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:54.429
rules that guide the logic of hardware and
software design.

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.289
But we aren’t going to teach you how to
program an Arduino Uno to water your plant

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.800
or how to change the CSS on your grandma’s
sewing blog so visitors’ cursors turn into

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.800
kittens.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.819
This also isn’t a computing course.

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.920
Or at least how computing is thought of in
the U.S. Computing here is a goal - it’s

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.920
what computers do.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.340
And we’ll talk about some of that for sure,
but OUR goal for this course is much broader.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.990
But computing means other things in other
countries.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.750
It’s all pretty confusing.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.759
But what we are going to look are the history
of computers… even before we had electricity.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.740
We’re going retrace the design decisions
that have given us our president-day components.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.229
We’re going to talk about how Operating
Systems work… or don’t work… how the

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.520
YouTubes get to you over the Internet, how
our smartphones and other smart devices are...

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.969
well getting smarter, and of course mysterious
futuristic stuff like quantum computing and

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.109
frustrating present-day stuff like hacking!

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:45.359
It’s a lot to cover, but I suppose before
we get started I should introduce myself.

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.969
I’m Carrie Anne Philbin!

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:47.969
Hello!

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.329
I'm an award winning secondary Computing teacher,
author of 'Adventures in Raspberry Pi' and

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.399
the creator of a YouTube video series for
teenagers called the Geek Gurl Diaries, which

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:58.829
includes stuff like interviews with women
working in technology, computer science based

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.469
tutorials, and hands on digital maker style
projects.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.130
In my day job, I help people learn about technology
and how to make things with computers as Director

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.100
of Education for the Raspberry Pi Foundation,
which is a charity based in Cambridge in the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.100
UK.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.750
Needless to say, I am passionate about this
stuff, but not because computers are these

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.410
amazing devices that are always making our
lives easier (sometimes that’s debatable)

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.830
but because computers inarguably have become
pivotal in our society.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.780
From our cars and thermostats to pacemakers
and cellphones, computers are everywhere,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.070
and it’s my hope that by the end of this
course you’ll have a better understanding

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.890
and appreciation for how far we’ve come
and how far they may take us.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.780
I’ll see you next week.
