00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.500
You’ve seen Thor, the film that tided fans
over until The Avengers

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.430
Now experience the film that will tide fans
over until The Avengers 2:

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.740
Thor: The Dark World.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.610
Thor is back in another perfectly adequate
Marvel movie that pleasantly killed a few

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.170
hours of your time,

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.450
with enough cool visuals, action, and humor
to keep you from wondering:

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.840
why does the elf man want to shoot magic Kool-Aid
into the sky holes?

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.390
Return for another post-Avengers movie full
of references to the Avengers

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.470
“You were in New York!”

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.570
"That was for New York.”

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.470
but no actual Avengers.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.640
Instead of Earth’s mightiest heroes, watch
Thor team up once again with

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.120
Heimdall, the watchful guardian who can see
everything

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.100
except for this spy...

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.520
and Thor’s girlfriend...

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.630
“I can’t see her.”

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.450
and this gigantic spaceship directly above
him.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.109
The Warriors Three, who are so replaceable
they switched out one of the actors and you

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:09.639
totally didn’t notice.

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:15.249
And everyone’s favorite, Loki, the charismatic
trickster who no one should trust by now.

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:17.179
“You still don't trust me brother?”

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.969
"Would you?"

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:18.759
No, idiot.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.369
When he’s not battling another forgettable
bad guy, watch as the mighty Thor mopes around

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:25.590
Asgard in a Snuggie

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.490
because he’s still hung up on a girl he
spent one long weekend with and hasn't called

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.270
in 2 years.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.049
"Where were you?!"

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.389
Natalie Portman returns as Jean Grey from
the X-Men Phoenix saga

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.299
With the help of her wacky sidekick,

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.969
her other wacky sideckick,

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.139
and her other wacky sidekick’s wacky sidekick,

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:45.009
they’ll discover “the convergence”,

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.060
a piece of science mumbo-jumbo everyone keeps
trying to explain.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.859
"Once a cycle, all the worlds align."

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:55.450
"The alignment is only temporary. You must
be in exactly the right place at the right

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.649
time."

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.129
"Physics is gonna go ballistic! Increases
and decreases in gravity, spatial extrusions--"

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:03.240
Whatever. Can we just see Thor hit something
with a hammer again?

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:08.530
Thank you!

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.470
Travel across the 9 realms, ranging from Earth

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.560

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.470

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.640
to Asgard,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.680
home of the most penetrable impenetrable city
ever.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.160
So ride along with the god of Thunder

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.250
"WE ARE NOT GODS!”

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.810
... so ride along with the Guy of Thunder,
for another celebration of the male form in

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.610
