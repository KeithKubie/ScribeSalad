00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.617 --> 00:00:06.950
MICHAEL WINSER: Hello, everyone.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.130
My name is Michael Winser.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.441
I'm a product manager lead
in Apps and Cloud Platform.

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:14.190
I've been at Google
for about three years.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.530
But I've been building
developer tools, and platforms,

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.404
and various things, and
obviously using them,

00:00:18.404 --> 00:00:20.370
for 30-plus years or so.

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.580
I'm very happy be here
with you today and also

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.580
the livestream audience.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.470
Welcome.

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.090
And this is my colleague Geva.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.260
GEVA RECHAV: Hi, I'm Geva.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.010
I've been at Google
for five years.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.610
I'm the project
manager for App Maker.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.440
I've worked on Photos
and Maps before.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.310
And before then I
had my own startups.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.510
For those of you here
in the audience--

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.968
and probably in
the livestream-- we

00:00:43.968 --> 00:00:48.780
assume you're business
analysts, IT software engineers,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.680
maybe you're a partner or
ISV writing business apps

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.960
for your customers.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.140
There are probably
some CIOs, CTOs here.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.730
And all of you share some
workflow challenges, custom

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.269
information handling in your
companies, or as we assume,

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.130
you came to hide from
the sun in the shade.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.460
We're going to tell
you about App Maker

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.190
today, why we built it,
what you can do with it.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.750
We will have a demo and
show you how it works.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.130
We have some customer
stories to share with you.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.650
And we'll tell you where we
are today with the product

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.102
and what's ahead of us.

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:31.810
If we have some time
at the end, there'll

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.350
be a few questions
that we can take.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.270
MICHAEL WINSER: So
very high level,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.420
App Maker is a rapid application
or low code development tool.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.030
It's intended to
allow your businesses

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.830
to build their own internal
applications quickly,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.450
efficiently, and
generally much easier.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.860
It extends the range of
things that you can do

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.479
and the range of people who
can do those things to build

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.770
applications for your business.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.784
We start with really
the core, key benefits.

00:02:00.784 --> 00:02:03.200
I think speed is the number
one thing that we think about.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.866
Time to getting
that solution built,

00:02:04.866 --> 00:02:07.490
ease with which you do so, speed
is the most important thing we

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.320
bring here.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.550
But it's also deeply
integrated with all the G Suite

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.750
functionality of the APIs
and all the applications,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.630
as well the other parts of
Google Cloud Platform and Maps

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.350
and so forth.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.980
Another key point
about App Maker

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.370
is that it's compliant
with your Drive policies.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.950
So as a domain
administrator, applications

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.970
built using App Maker
are automatically

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.710
compliant with policies
you've applied.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.050
So the data and the applications
are limited to the domain

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.750
the same way you did
control with Drive.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.510
So when we think about the kinds
of problems that people have,

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.980
people are building
applications,

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.260
they're using applications,
every business

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.340
has their core line
of business software,

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.360
their operational software,
their productivity software.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.506
And then there's all
these gaps in between.

00:02:52.506 --> 00:02:53.880
And these gaps
tend to get filled

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.080
out with either manual
processes or, in the past,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.860
with SharePoint and
even Lotus Notes.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.990
And an unreasonably large
amount of spreadsheets

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.490
get used and built up to handle
all these little things that

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.620
are essential to the
running of the business,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.820
filling the gaps between
these high order services,

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.810
but are not core
to the business,

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.300
not easy to build efficiently.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.560
Often they're being
driven by actual people

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.907
in the business rather than IT.

00:03:19.907 --> 00:03:21.240
So they're not product managers.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.370
They don't know what
they're trying to do.

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.100
They just know the problem
they're trying to get to.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.190
That space leaves a lot
of unfulfilled potential

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.190
in the business for automation,
for efficiencies, and so forth.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.060
App Maker is here to make
that space easier to fill,

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.571
easy to address without creating
compliance and management

00:03:38.571 --> 00:03:39.070
problems.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:44.930
GEVA RECHAV: I would like to
set the picture here for you.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.970
We at Google had
similar problems.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.410
A few years ago, our HR
people and recruiters

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.160
came over to our
IT organization,

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.900
which we call CorpEng.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.400
And they asked us to help
them with some issues

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.840
they had with recruiting.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.000
So we started getting
a lot of candidates.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.900
And the numbers went up very
quickly, thousands a month.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.850
Each one of these candidates is
interviewed by several people

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:11.920
at Google.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.510
And each interviewer produces
quite a lengthy feedback.

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.370
And we realized that it's really
difficult to process all this

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.090
and calibrate our candidates
across some skill sets

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.620
that we care about.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.740
Hiring committees also had
a hard time deciding which

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.250
candidates to give offers to.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.930
And we noticed that our
response time to candidates

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:37.720
is really lagging.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.760
So we realized in IT that we
need to help our HR department.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.030
And we built an
internal app for them.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.270
More requests came from
other parts of Google.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.640
And applications
started to be asked

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:55.410
for from many
different departments.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.240
One example is a
global holiday lookup.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.260
As we expanded and our offices
reached beyond 70 countries,

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.887
we needed to know which
country has a holiday today.

00:05:05.887 --> 00:05:07.720
So if we want to schedule
a meeting with one

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.530
of our colleagues, we don't do
it on a national vacation day.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.160
Another example is our
education reimbursement system.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.060
So our employees are allowed
to take some personal courses,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.080
and the company
pays a part of that.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.230
And so in order to
approve this, monitor

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.300
the correct use of that, and
also handle all the budget

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.160
and money transfers, we
needed an internal app.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.530
And we built that one, as well.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.450
The IT department itself
was getting good appetite

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:46.980
and wanted to track their
own internal projects

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:52.160
as they became larger with
a kind of custom dashboard.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:55.070
And so they built an
app for that, as well.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.450
We realized that we need a low
code application development

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.450
tool so that we could make our
engineers more efficient, spend

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.530
less time on these internal apps
and the majority of their time

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.870
building things that solve
our hard technical problems,

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.990
and also to empower other people
across the company to build

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.020
their own apps using App Maker.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:25.050
A handful of applications
became very many

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.320
over a relatively
short course of time.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.390
And we now have around
400 applications inside

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.780
Google itself.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.305
These are used by thousands
of Googlers every day,

00:06:37.305 --> 00:06:39.180
many of which don't even
realize that they're

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.480
using App Maker built apps.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.600
And the fact that we
are most proud about

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.800
is that 80% of
these applications

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.340
have been built by people
outside of the IT organizations

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.904
who are not trained
software engineers.

00:06:56.542 --> 00:06:58.500
MICHAEL WINSER: I think
it's important to think

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.000
about the space that
App Maker can fill,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.520
and specifically, the kind of
applications you can build.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.230
These are not the applications
that you're currently

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.610
building today because most
businesses have basically

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.700
figured out what apps
they have to have

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.510
and they're building them with
their normal IT organizations.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.810
It's all those applications
that you've just never

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.179
been able to take on.

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:18.220
And this has a transformative
effect on business.

00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.310
Because all of a sudden,
the business stakeholders,

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:21.600
the people right
there in the trenches

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.410
solving day-to-day
business problems,

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.900
can go from a need to a
solution very quickly.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.590
And it transforms
the whole business,

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.540
in terms of the potential
of what you can do

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:32.190
and the empowerment
every team has

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.520
to go off and automate or
manage their various solutions.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:37.920
And so our long term goal
is to bring that power

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.330
to make more and more people
able to get from a business

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:44.710
need to a business solution
without IT being overwhelmed

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:45.695
by these things.

00:07:45.695 --> 00:07:47.820
And when you look at your
business, think of it not

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:49.710
in terms of, am
I going to change

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.010
how I'm building my core line
of business or operational apps?

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.607
Think of it in terms
of, what new apps

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:56.940
will I be able to build with
relatively little resources

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.958
that I could never
have taken on before?

00:07:58.958 --> 00:08:01.650
Next slide.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:03.664
So now Geva is going
to give a quick demo.

00:08:03.664 --> 00:08:05.330
We'll do some live
coding here on stage.

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:07.020
So what could possibly go wrong?

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.020
If we could switch over
the demo screen, please.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.190
And he's going to talk you
through actually building

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.510
an App Maker app from scratch.

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:13.650
And you'll see just
how quickly and easily

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:14.941
we can go off and build things.

00:08:14.941 --> 00:08:16.205
Over to you, Geva.

00:08:16.205 --> 00:08:18.080
GEVA RECHAV: So what I
want to show you today

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.570
is how I built a project tracker
for my own little company.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:25.850
And as in many cases
with many cases,

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.670
it's based off a sheet that
we used to use in the past.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:38.370
And we now want to make it
have UI that's easy to use.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.350
And I'll start doing this
with a new app in App Maker.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.290
There some pages that
are predefined here.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:49.920
The first step that we do
is to bind our data source

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.000
to the app.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.840
So I'm going to
connect the sheet

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.830
that I've just showed you to
App Maker's internal storage.

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:01.410
Let's call it "Project."

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:06.750
And I'll import the fields
from a Google spreadsheet.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.060
So I only have one here,
which I've showed you.

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.640
I get a quick preview
of the fields.

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.500
So I can confirm that
this is the actual data

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:16.420
model that I want.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:20.520
Each of the columns
is a variable here.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.040
And I can see that they are
defined before I create them.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.020
I can also add fields
to this data model.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:32.860
So I'd like to add a new field
for the Owner of the project.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:42.230
And I can also move this
around to be the first column.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:50.670
And I also add a field
for the Budget allocated

00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:54.270
to the project.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.646
I can move that one over here.

00:09:56.646 --> 00:09:58.520
I'd like to show you
some more functionality.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.820
For example, for Priority, if
I click the Advanced tab here,

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.240
I can choose whole
numbers and actually

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.586
set values for the Priorities
of all the projects

00:10:09.586 --> 00:10:10.460
that I want to track.

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:17.580
So now that we have
our data model,

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:22.460
we can go over to design
the UI of the application.

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.630
So I'll start off
with the Main page.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:28.280
And what I want to
have here is a table

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.070
that will show all my projects.

00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:33.500
So I open our widget,
our widgets here.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:42.470
And I drag a table onto my page.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.710
I get prompted to ask which data
source I want to bind this to.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:52.970
And I'll make all the fields
except the Owner and the Name

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.840
editable.

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.680
Choose the default. And we
have our table defined here.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.600
There is also the
FAB here, which

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:13.710
I want to add an action to
so that when you click on it,

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:19.461
I want to open a dialog that
will go to the Create Project

00:11:19.461 --> 00:11:19.960
page.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.240
So now let me go to the Create
Project page, where I'll choose

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:33.030
another widget, which is
a form for data entry,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.890
also bind it to my data source.

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:40.830
And here we don't
need the Done field

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:44.440
because this is just
when we add in projects.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.270
For the Owner field, I'd like
to show you a functionality

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:51.410
that we have here, which
is the User Picker.

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.050
I can drag that into the form.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:57.600
And I'm prompted to ask whether
I need this data model--

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.590
the directory one--

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:01.400
and I do.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:10.380
I will bind the owner to
that field in our data model

00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.162
and put a label so that when
we have the form in the app

00:12:14.162 --> 00:12:15.140
it's readable.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:19.920
And I can delete the
simple Owner Input field.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:27.120
So now I have this form where
I can add in my projects.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:33.060
The one thing I'll do is
on clicking the Submit,

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:34.870
I would like to
close this dialog,

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:38.370
so I can add a custom action
where I can actually add

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:58.770
some code to close the dialog.

00:13:03.637 --> 00:13:04.470
I can do that later.

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:12.760
And so now when I want to add
some more visuals to our demo,

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:23.560
I can go back to the Main
page and add a bar chart

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.265
to show how our
budget is utilized.

00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:27.640
This will be tied
to the Project.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.490
And for each project,
we'll show the bars.

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:46.665
So what we do right now is
we create the application.

00:13:46.665 --> 00:13:50.840
We can do a preview
and see a version

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.160
of what I've built so far.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:09.620
And we do need to go some
authorizations for data access

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.940
the first time that we do this.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.670
And I'd just like to make a
few shortcuts here and move

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:33.960
to the finished app that
would be created from this.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.550
And so it would look like this.

00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:38.490
We have the chart here, the
bar chart, with projects

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.500
that I have already added.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:45.990
I can click on the FAB to
get the form in front of me

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:48.989
and add another
project for Devin,

00:14:48.989 --> 00:14:50.280
who is an engineer in our team.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.040
I can choose a Priority
for this project

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.640
and ask Devin to do it
by the end of next week.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.820
MICHAEL WINSER: Probably
need to refresh.

00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:24.520
GEVA RECHAV: And let me try and
add another project for myself.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.104
I can show you my
Inbox that's empty.

00:15:26.104 --> 00:15:27.520
I've added some
functionality here

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.836
to send an email to myself.

00:15:30.836 --> 00:15:34.130
Hope this will work.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:35.230
Here is the User Picker.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.790
This is high priority
to finish this demo.

00:15:47.115 --> 00:15:47.615
Today.

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.440
And here you can see
the email in my Inbox.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:05.370
Or supposed to be here.

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:05.870
We--

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.953
MICHAEL WINSER: All right.

00:16:06.953 --> 00:16:07.860
That's the mail.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.280
GEVA RECHAV: OK.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.840
So I just showed you how you can
build a Project tracker pretty

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.550
quickly.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.240
Except for some things
that we didn't see here,

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.407
I think it went really well.

00:16:19.407 --> 00:16:21.740
Obviously, when you start
building this out on your own,

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.140
it would probably take you
more than just 10 minutes.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.190
We had prepared some
things in advance,

00:16:26.190 --> 00:16:29.129
but that's about the scale
of building a small app.

00:16:29.129 --> 00:16:31.420
MICHAEL WINSER: Can we flip
back to the slides, please?

00:16:34.321 --> 00:16:34.820
Advance.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:40.010
So as you saw, Geva
was able to build

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.010
a mostly functional application
in just a matter of minutes,

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:43.800
live on stage.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.675
Usually when you have
a little bit more time,

00:16:45.675 --> 00:16:47.240
you can go deeper
and flesh it out.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.910
Whether it's building a project
management tool, or an event

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:53.160
tracker, or some automation
system for your business,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.630
it's all very straightforward.

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.800
What I'd like to do now is talk
a little bit about how this all

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.340
works, what's
underneath the covers

00:16:58.340 --> 00:16:59.589
and how we built these things.

00:16:59.589 --> 00:17:01.050
So next slide.

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.940
So we'll start with the
editing environment,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.089
the IDE for building
up microapplications.

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:07.339
It's a standalone application.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:09.547
It happens to be running on
top of Google App Engine.

00:17:09.547 --> 00:17:11.530
We're trying to self-host
as much as possible.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.839
That editor creates
and publishes

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.260
an application that runs in
the execution environment.

00:17:16.260 --> 00:17:18.540
The execution environment
is Google Apps Script.

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.290
So if you've ever used
Google Apps Script,

00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:21.839
it'd be very familiar territory.

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:22.926
It runs the same way.

00:17:22.926 --> 00:17:24.550
We've done a lot of
work to Apps Script

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:28.020
to beef up both its performance,
its capacity, how long you

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.740
can run big apps, and so forth.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.490
And we're continuing to extend
out the API surface for Apps

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:36.360
Script, as well, to make it more
capable for these applications.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.030
Within that, we have
a storage model.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.350
It's built-in storage as
part of the App Maker thing.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.058
So you don't have to
provision databases.

00:17:42.058 --> 00:17:44.770
You don't have to go off and
spin up a SQL Server, something

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:45.270
like that.

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.370
It has built-in
storage as part of it.

00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:49.329
And we have data
connectors that allow

00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:51.120
us to connect to a
variety of external data

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.460
sources such as
MySQL, Cloud SQL,

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.070
of course, Postgres and
other third-party resources.

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:58.390
And that's an area we
will continue to invest.

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:00.570
Next slide.

00:18:00.570 --> 00:18:04.020
App Maker will be delivered as
part of G Suite for Business.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.130
So if you are a G Suite
for Business customer,

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.487
you can get App Maker.

00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:10.570
You will have an unlimited
number of applications,

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:12.570
unlimited number of databases.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.300
It's basically just tied to
the price in the business

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.810
model of G Suite for Business.

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:19.310
And then you can build out as
many applications as you want.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:20.850
We know that these
applications tend

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:23.130
to be small and have medium
usage every now and then

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:24.890
but can spike crazily.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.730
We've scaled-- we've
built our whole scaling

00:18:26.730 --> 00:18:29.304
model around the G Suite
for Business licensing model

00:18:29.304 --> 00:18:30.970
as it just scales
with your organization

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:32.340
and lets you build
out as many solutions

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:33.590
as you need for your business.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:34.386
Next slide.

00:18:36.986 --> 00:18:39.360
A key part of App Maker-- and
we heard this early on with

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.526
our own internal development,
and our customers have

00:18:41.526 --> 00:18:42.650
reiterated this point--

00:18:42.650 --> 00:18:45.760
is integration with as many
Google services as possible.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:49.360
So every G Suite API, many,
many Google Apps API's,

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.880
many of the YouTube and
ads, a lot of ad systems

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.310
run through Apps
Script, as well.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:58.130
Cloud Platform, of course,
is also deeply integrated.

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:01.730
All of these things are directly
accessible from within App

00:19:01.730 --> 00:19:02.290
Maker.

00:19:02.290 --> 00:19:05.060
Some of them have high level
widget support and other things

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.101
where you can just go off
and write code directly

00:19:07.101 --> 00:19:08.200
to access it.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.522
Next slide.

00:19:09.522 --> 00:19:11.480
So now what I'd like to
do is talk a little bit

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.813
about some of the things that
our customers have already

00:19:13.813 --> 00:19:15.780
been doing with App
Maker, just to give you

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.696
a sense of the different
kinds of applications

00:19:17.696 --> 00:19:18.984
people can build.

00:19:18.984 --> 00:19:20.400
So there's a company
called Ocado.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:23.647
They're an online retailer
in the United Kingdom.

00:19:23.647 --> 00:19:25.730
Very strong technology-focused
company, so they've

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.230
been really building
from the ground

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.510
up with a lot of
technology investment.

00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:32.450
But even there, their IT
organization, as I said before,

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:35.150
is very much focused on
their line of business,

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:36.850
their core operational needs.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:40.584
And so a lot of the gaps in
between were left unfulfilled.

00:19:40.584 --> 00:19:42.250
In particular, they
have-- like Google--

00:19:42.250 --> 00:19:44.155
they actually have a pretty
aggressive training program.

00:19:44.155 --> 00:19:45.550
Can we go back a slide, please?

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.450
Can you go back a slide?

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:54.580
Thank you.

00:19:54.580 --> 00:19:57.872
They had an internal process
for managing training requests,

00:19:57.872 --> 00:20:00.330
so their staff can go off and
sign up for various trainings

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:01.230
and conferences.

00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:02.979
And the management
approvals, the tracking

00:20:02.979 --> 00:20:06.020
of expenses, the whole
process was just brutal.

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.060
And they were just drowning
in sheets and paperwork

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.260
and emails.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:13.012
They had all kinds
of manual processes.

00:20:13.012 --> 00:20:15.470
They thought App Maker was the
perfect opportunity for them

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.530
to go off and
tackle that problem.

00:20:17.530 --> 00:20:20.410
And in about 30 hours
of Eng time, they

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:24.150
had their first version of
this training management tool

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:28.149
in place and being
used by internal users.

00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:30.440
I mean, obviously, they've
continued to invest in that,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:31.898
but in 30 hours,
they had something

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:34.300
that was already making
their world a lot better.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.620
Next slide, please.

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.600
Another company
called Quora, it's

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.350
struggled to manage
just scheduling

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:44.090
of various internal
perk activities,

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.770
whether it was
access to, I think

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.450
they have a massage program
like Google or something.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.450
Again, they had a
scheduling problem.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:52.830
They literally were
printing out spreadsheets

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.200
and having signup forms.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.120
And it's amazing.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:00.290
And it always strikes me
how, more often than not,

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:02.630
the competition for some
sort of automation solution

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:05.347
is paper, for
better or for worse.

00:21:05.347 --> 00:21:07.430
And so they were able to
build out an application,

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:09.740
replace a lot of these
spreadsheets and paper things

00:21:09.740 --> 00:21:11.950
with a simple application
that allow them to manage--

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.866
in a distributed way
across the organization--

00:21:13.866 --> 00:21:15.490
access to these resources.

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.720
Next slide, please.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.640
I'll also talk about
the State of Wyoming.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.350
The State of Wyoming was
a very interesting case.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:22.900
They've been early
partners with us.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:24.410
They understood the
potential of App Maker

00:21:24.410 --> 00:21:26.560
and participated in some
of our early workshops.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.440
And they were able to imagine
all kinds of applications.

00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.880
The first one they
built actually

00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.412
started with their own
internal security people.

00:21:34.412 --> 00:21:36.620
These security people were
responsible for monitoring

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.990
various types of events
from users and systems

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:42.581
across all of their IT
systems and were struggling

00:21:42.581 --> 00:21:44.330
to just keep all this
information together

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:45.996
and to figure out how
to act, or to even

00:21:45.996 --> 00:21:48.700
see connections between
various security events.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.410
And so they were able to build
an application very quickly

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.380
and connect that with the
existing G Suite Administrative

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.430
Security Events
with other systems

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.250
to bring a global
picture, and then

00:21:58.250 --> 00:22:00.550
add their own layer of
policy and interpretation

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:03.377
on top of that to create
a more secure system.

00:22:03.377 --> 00:22:04.835
Now, what was
powerful for them was

00:22:04.835 --> 00:22:08.170
that the people
defining the need here

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:09.661
were not the IT developers.

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.160
These were the
people actually doing

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.710
the job of managing security.

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:15.240
They knew what they needed,
but they were not developers.

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.000
And this picture-- a little
bit staged, I'll admit that--

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.900
but ultimately, it's
exactly what happened.

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:23.000
The security office people
sat down with the engineer

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.960
and said, I want it
to look like this.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.640
I want this information here.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.710
And so instead of having to
write a spec or a document

00:22:29.710 --> 00:22:32.020
that is not what their
normal day job is,

00:22:32.020 --> 00:22:33.770
they just knew it
when they saw it.

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.050
And the engineer was build
it, react very quickly.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.841
It was a very powerful
experience for them.

00:22:37.841 --> 00:22:40.400
It really changed how they think
about building applications.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:44.120
I'll let Geva talk about
now where we are today.

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:46.950
GEVA RECHAV: Where are we
with App Maker right now?

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:51.890
We started out about a year
ago with a few large customers

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:55.420
that were building applications
with very close guidance

00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.970
of our engineering team.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.370
And they built some
of the applications

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:02.150
that we told you about.

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.950
Last November, we announced
our Early Adopter program.

00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:10.640
This made App Maker available to
every G Suite Business customer

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.040
that applied to our program.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:16.430
And this can be done online.

00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.860
What we are planning
for later this year

00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:22.110
is to launch this as a
general availability.

00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:24.810
And this will mean that
every G Suite Business

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:29.911
customer will have this product
as part of their G Suite core

00:23:29.911 --> 00:23:30.410
services.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.070
The way to get into our Early
Adopter program is to go

00:23:39.070 --> 00:23:42.200
to gsuite.google.com/appmaker.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.610
And your admin needs
to put in their details

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.135
there and ask to get
into the program.

00:23:48.135 --> 00:23:50.510
And in a few days, you'll be
able to use the product just

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:52.810
like I showed you here
and in the same way

00:23:52.810 --> 00:23:55.150
that every customer will
be able to use it shortly.

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:01.670
Now I'd like to tell you what
are some good ways for you

00:24:01.670 --> 00:24:04.480
to start using the product
and build your own App Maker

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.285
applications in your company.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:13.070
We look at the world
of business custom apps

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:16.610
as split between different
major categories.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.160
One popular use
case is data entry.

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.510
A lot of companies
are collecting data

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:26.510
from different sources and
want to aggregate and display

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.850
those in a manageable way.

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.050
One example is inspections
that a lot of companies

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.850
have to do for health and safety
in their different branches,

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.830
or just to check on inventory
and different other things

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.010
in chains of stores.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:45.260
The second category that
we know about is reporting.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.520
There are a lot of
applications that actually

00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.080
want to show decision
makers what's going on

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.960
and what data is
available for them

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.730
to consider what
they need to do based

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:58.390
on different sources
from various databases

00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.910
and areas in the company.

00:25:00.910 --> 00:25:05.610
So a very urging
example for this

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:10.100
is the register that the
EU has actually chartered

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.280
for all companies in the EU.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.120
They need an Information
Asset Register.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:17.290
And each company needs
to have available all

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:20.410
their intellectual
property assets monitored

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:23.180
by who has access to what.

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.270
Another application
that we see here

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:29.060
is dashboards for the
performance of different lines

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.250
of business in the company.

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.950
And many companies have
custom requirements

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:34.510
for how they want
to see this, or how

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.390
different roles in the
company, what views

00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:41.990
do they need to
have for this data.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.260
The third area that is
very popular is workflow.

00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:49.370
By workflow we mean some
kind of multistage process

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:53.210
that a few people or a few
parts of your organizations

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:54.350
are involved in.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:57.580
And it's usually serial and
based on the previous stages,

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:00.450
like this is what
you do going forward.

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:02.690
And there are lots and
lots of examples here.

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:07.870
One is how to actually create a
price quotation for a customer.

00:26:07.870 --> 00:26:11.080
Another one that we see
here often is a help desk.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:16.120
Many customers implement a help
desk using different G Suite

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.740
products, like forms,
sheets, and sites,

00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:22.140
whereas, if you use App
Maker and build your own app,

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.290
you can have your
own dedicated UI

00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:26.430
and implement very
custom things that

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:30.515
are unique to the way you
handle tickets in your company.

00:26:34.279 --> 00:26:36.070
Another thing that we
want to help you with

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:39.840
is to really identify
in your company what

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.640
are the signals for areas where
you should build an App Maker

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.800
app, or if you build an app
you would really benefit from.

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.052
And these indicators are--

00:26:53.052 --> 00:26:56.982
they have different forms in
different parts of the company.

00:26:56.982 --> 00:26:58.440
One thing that we
see a lot of time

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.380
is the spreadsheet from hell.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.940
This is the very
large spreadsheet,

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:03.510
or a lot of spreadsheets.

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:06.090
And many of you know
these in your companies.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:10.389
And they usually have lots of
columns, many lines of updates.

00:27:10.389 --> 00:27:11.930
There are usually
more than a handful

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.570
of people that are
taking care of those.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:17.780
And what this usually means
is that there is an underlying

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.430
workflow in this spreadsheet.

00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:25.710
And App Maker can
help build a UI that's

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:30.160
custom to different roles that
are managing this workflow

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.890
and also provide different
views to managers,

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.560
or people who need to
take a look at the data

00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:39.200
during the workflow and
see how things are going.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:42.510
Another advantage doing this
with a dedicated and custom

00:27:42.510 --> 00:27:47.160
built UI is that you have
less errors in data entries

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.507
that working with
a sheet is always

00:27:49.507 --> 00:27:50.590
something that can happen.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.400
Another signal for a
candidate App Maker app

00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.870
is bulk operations.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:02.480
And the examples that
I want to outline here

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.060
are G Suite product
Bulk Operations.

00:28:05.060 --> 00:28:08.440
A lot of companies
send out bulk emails

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:12.370
based on specific events
that have occurred.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:17.110
In some companies, people have
recurring meetings or events

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:20.280
that they want to invite
a single person to.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.260
Also, there is the issue of
employees leaving the company

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:25.810
or starting working
at the company.

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:28.530
They need to be added
to a lot of meetings.

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.730
And doing this is usually
a long manual process.

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:37.210
If you could build a small
Suite app that you could just

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:40.840
tick which meetings you want
this person to be added to,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:44.350
click a button, and have
this done on your behalf

00:28:44.350 --> 00:28:45.010
very easily.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.370
The third area that
I want to point out

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:54.200
is existing extensive
scripting in the company.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.580
So many of you are probably
using Apps Script or BigQuery.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.270
And that means that
you have already

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:04.190
been thinking about
implementing custom business

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:05.980
processes in your companies.

00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:08.080
And App Maker could
help you build these

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.910
faster and in more
productive ways

00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:17.650
to create possibly nicer
UIs and spend your time

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:20.792
as engineers or business
analysts doing the core parts

00:29:20.792 --> 00:29:21.500
of your business.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.930
MICHAEL WINSER: So what's next?

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:28.710
We've had a great
progress so far,

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:30.350
but we're looking ahead to
the next things of what we

00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:31.540
we're going to do
with App Maker.

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:32.998
The key thing is
we want this to be

00:29:32.998 --> 00:29:34.330
an increasingly open platform.

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:36.120
We want people contributing
to it and so forth.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.578
But we're going to
really bootstrap

00:29:37.578 --> 00:29:40.377
that starting specifically
with sources to data.

00:29:40.377 --> 00:29:41.835
We recognize that
applications want

00:29:41.835 --> 00:29:43.910
to take advantage
of data bound access

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:45.820
to various underlying
business data.

00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:47.410
And it's not just
about a data that's

00:29:47.410 --> 00:29:49.010
stored in a spreadsheet
or piece of database,

00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.009
but also existing systems
that you have that you

00:29:51.009 --> 00:29:51.987
want to bind data into.

00:29:51.987 --> 00:29:54.320
It's already possible to go
off and build read-only data

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:55.715
sources within your application.

00:29:55.715 --> 00:29:57.260
But we're going to
extend that to go

00:29:57.260 --> 00:29:59.290
to more different
types of SAS products,

00:29:59.290 --> 00:30:01.740
more database sources
directly to make it easier

00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:03.406
and easier for you
to build applications

00:30:03.406 --> 00:30:05.740
that are integrated with
the data of your business.

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.510
We'll add more
samples and modules.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:10.135
We have a growing library
of ready-to-use applications

00:30:10.135 --> 00:30:12.260
where you don't even have
to go off and write code.

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:13.420
It's just an application
where you can just

00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.550
customize the user
experience a little bit

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:18.915
and launch it inside
your business.

00:30:18.915 --> 00:30:21.040
We are also actively starting
to create a community

00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:22.040
around the development
environment

00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:24.060
so that everybody who is
an App Maker developer

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:25.555
can lean on each
other and benefit

00:30:25.555 --> 00:30:27.180
from each other's
learnings and lessons

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.400
across the organization.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.920
Every App Maker application
can be distributed internally

00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.136
using G Suite Marketplace.

00:30:34.136 --> 00:30:35.510
So when you build
an application,

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.560
you need to deploy it
to your organization,

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.850
you can take of all the
OAuth grants and management

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:41.950
at the administrative level.

00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.230
So if you want to learn
more, go to these links,

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.680
developers.google.com/appmaker.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.985
And then there's a long
link towards the code labs.

00:30:48.985 --> 00:30:50.860
If you work your way
through those code labs,

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:52.760
you will be a proficient
App Maker developer.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.580
They have been in
development internally

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.570
for a very long time.

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:56.382
They're quite rich.

00:30:56.382 --> 00:30:57.840
And they cover
everything you could

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:59.230
need to know about App Maker.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.840
And it is remarkably easy
to get productive with that.

00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:02.340
Next slide.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.770
If you're not in the App Maker
EAP right now, please do apply.

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.262
As Geva said, it needs to--

00:31:10.262 --> 00:31:11.970
application needs to
come from the domain

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.077
administrator of your G
Suite for Business domain.

00:31:14.077 --> 00:31:16.660
But once you've done that, we'll
quickly turn it around to you

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.896
and get you going
inside App Maker.

00:31:18.896 --> 00:31:20.590
Next slide.

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:22.750
So I'd like to bring
it all together.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:24.760
I hope you enjoyed
our talk today.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.789
We've been working on
this for a very long time.

00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:28.330
Geva and I here are
just up on stage,

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:32.360
but really, there's an army of
engineers, and support people,

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:36.152
and sales people, and just
every part of the organization

00:31:36.152 --> 00:31:38.110
has been working for a
long time to build this.

00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:40.870
This project has been under
development for, I guess,

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:42.337
4 or 5 years now.

00:31:42.337 --> 00:31:43.170
Something like that.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:45.391
It feels like that, anyway.

00:31:45.391 --> 00:31:47.140
Just telling you what
we already told you.

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.560
This is a low code
application development tool.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.400
You can bring it to bear
on solutions you would not

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.400
have otherwise dared to touch.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.850
