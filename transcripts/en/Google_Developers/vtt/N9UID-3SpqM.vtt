DANIEL SIEBERG: Hi there, I'm
Daniel Sieberg as we continue

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.620
our coverage here on I/O Live.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.860
You know, the attendees at
Google I/O got a chance to

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.830
check out the new
Nexus 7 tablet.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.480
So we're here in Androidville
and we rounded up some of them

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.380
to see what they think.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.395
MALE SPEAKER 1: The specs were
amazing and for the price, I

00:00:17.395 --> 00:00:18.130
mean, it was incredible.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.860
MALE SPEAKER 2: This
is very, very fast.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.060
So I like it.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.890
MALE SPEAKER 3: It's a perfect
size and my hands aren't

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.130
really that big and it
really fits great.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.090
And I've enjoyed using
it so far.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.990
MALE SPEAKER 4: Battery life
is absolutely insane.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.900
I've used it, all last night and
all this morning and all

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.680
of today and I'm only
at like 75%.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's really cute
and it is compact also.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.110
Not too heavy, also.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.710
So I can just put it in my
handbag and then take it

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.635
anywhere I want.

00:00:46.635 --> 00:00:48.890
MALE SPEAKER 5: It feels kind
of like a phone from its

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:50.630
weight, but it's a tablet.

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.820
So it's really nice.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.310
MALE SPEAKER 1: You know, for me
I'm definitely be carrying

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.010
it around in my backpack
as a student.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.150
You know, just throw in there.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:57.100
It doesn't add any weight.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.770
MALE SPEAKER 3: You know, I
could see myself using this on

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.620
planes, on the train,
all the places I go.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.379
FEMALE SPEAKER: I have a
four-year-old and so once I

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.980
was using it and done browsing,
checking my emails

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.350
and so on, then I
gave it to her.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.090
She downloaded a coloring
app and then she started

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.590
playing with it.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.630
So we use it for all
kinds of things.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.460
MALE SPEAKER 2: I'm going
to use it for my school.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.670
I mean, I read a lot of books
and I read a lot.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.910
I'm also studying computer
engineering, so maybe I'm

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.860
going to write some application
for this.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.730
MALE SPEAKER 3: You know using
these in meetings, taking them

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.190
to conference rooms
is something that

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.140
I'm going to leverage.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.600
MALE SPEAKER 4: I've been
playing games on it, I've been

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.560
reading books, I've been
listening to music.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.280
And it was all just there.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.920
MALE SPEAKER 1: You can use
it all day, you know watch

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.840
videos, play games,
read, whatever.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.750
And then not worry about
charging it.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.190
MALE SPEAKER 5: I like that you
have the full Google play

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.235
experience now in your hand
on such a good device.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.290
DANIEL SIEBERG: Super
cool stuff.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.510
I think I'm going to take this
one and check it out myself.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.710
Stay tuned for more here
on Google I/O Live.
