BARBARA CORCORAN: Very,
very nice to be here.

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:08.330
I probably met maybe 60 of
you in that hallway, there.

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.530
[LAUGHS] So I already feel
like family, or at least you

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.110
made me feel very comfortable.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.560
That and the free
food out there.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.280
Because I had those
chips with vinegar.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.330
I love the whole place.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.432
I might apply for a
job here, in fact.

00:00:21.432 --> 00:00:23.890
And I bet it would be a lot
less work than the stupid thing

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:24.490
I'm doing now.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.070
You know?

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.680
So I've been asked
to speak to you,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.850
and we discussed what
would be a good topic.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.740
I always like a topic
that people relate to.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.930
And I'm assuming that we have
a crowd of "Shark Tank" fans,

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.170
based on what I heard.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.042
[CHEERING]

00:00:39.042 --> 00:00:41.180
Well, I want to
thank you for my job,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.470
because if we didn't have
good seasons by this point,

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.000
we were going to be axed
in season one and two.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.620
And so, particularly for the
people who were watching early,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.910
you saved our ass.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.620
Or I'd be out thinking,
OK, now what do I do?

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.451
[LAUGHS] So it all worked
out very nicely, as you know.

00:00:56.451 --> 00:00:57.950
I'm going to talk
to you about three

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.607
things, three sections to it.

00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:00.940
Only a little bit of everything.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.390
You're going to like
one of them, right?

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.306
I'm going to tell you
my rags to riches story,

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:07.610
because the people organizing
the event wanted me to spend 5,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.140
10 minutes on that.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.220
Then I'm going to talk about the
entrepreneurs I'm working with.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.780
And I've even met a couple
of people already today

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.394
who know some of
my entrepreneurs,

00:01:16.394 --> 00:01:17.310
are friends with them.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.149
So that was kind of nice.

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.940
And so I won't say
anything bad about them,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.310
even though I was going to
dish them like crazy. [LAUGHS]

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.120
And then I'm going to follow
it up with a little dessert.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.724
Behind the scenes
photos I dragged up

00:01:28.724 --> 00:01:30.640
from behind the scenes
of "Shark Tank," so you

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.186
know what really goes on.

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:34.560
And I call that section of
it, what are the sharks really

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.670
like? [LAUGHS] Versus the
personas we try to put forth

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.090
there, or what
we're being coached

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.570
to be on the show, versus
what we actually are.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.200
OK?

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.700
All right.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.241
So I'll start with
the rags to riches

00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:46.330
story, as it pertains
to what I wound up

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.110
doing for my life work,
which was being a real estate

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.880
broker here in New York City.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.240
And I really had very,
very good luck as a child.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.140
Two enormously lucky breaks.

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.697
I had two good parents.

00:01:57.697 --> 00:02:00.030
And anybody who's got one
good parent, as you get older,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.180
they get better and better.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.840
In fact, I don't even know
if my mother and father were

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.730
as good as I'm going
to tell you they were.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.840
But as I get older,
as we all do,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.360
you start to appreciate any
advantage you had as a child.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.660
So I had a mom.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.530
And I'll show you the picture
of our family minus one child.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.370
We had 10 kids.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.125
We had six girls, four boys.

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:20.500
We lived in a little town
which I'm sure you've heard of,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.112
Edgewater, New Jersey.

00:02:22.112 --> 00:02:23.070
Right across the river.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.800
When we were there, every
man in town except my father

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.390
was employed by one of
three factories there.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.070
I actually thought our
family was like the Kennedys,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.110
because my father put
a suit on every day

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.310
to go to work in
Trenton, New Jersey.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.890
And somehow, because
every other man

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.540
was in a factory
uniform except my dad,

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.070
I really-- I was like a snob.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.500
And my dad actually was a
printing press foreman--

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.420
when printing was a big deal,
before that disappeared--

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.120
for many various factories
all through our childhood

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.760
in Trenton, New
Jersey, typically.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.470
Anyway, my mother
was the powerhouse

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.920
in my family, not my dad.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.570
My mom was a
phenomenal motivator.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.470
She is probably the
most organized person

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.140
I've ever met in
my life, and I've

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.310
met so many organized people.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.100
My mom would decide on
the birth of each child

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.030
exactly what she thought
that child's gift was.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.840
So she'd announce it the
day she brought the baby

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.820
home from Holy Name Hospital.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.820
We were devout
Catholics in our family,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.380
and that's why I haven't
been to church since.

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:25.880
She overdid that one.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.910
OK?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.040
But I remember distinctly when
she brought my brother Tommy

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.300
home, and Tommy
is the middle row.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.570
Would it be to your left?

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.070
OK.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.450
With the longish hair.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.660
And she had Tommy as
an infant in her arms,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.960
and I can remember it
like it was yesterday.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.450
And she said, look at
your brother Thomas.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.330
He's going to be a
magnificent dancer.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:48.390
And we were like, oh.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.110
I remember me thinking,
oh, a dancer in the family.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.610
Cool.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.230
We don't have one of those yet.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.410
And what did my mom
base that prediction on?

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.060
She saw that Tommy had fat,
juicy legs kicking like hell,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.310
and that was her prediction.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.580
So what happened to my brother
Thomas, who now we call T?

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.240
T grew up to be a ballet dancer
for Alvin Ailey Dance Theater.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.787
And he used to say when
he came into the house,

00:04:12.787 --> 00:04:15.120
after he was long out of the
house and doing the ballet,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.760
he used to say, the truth is,
I can't really dance, but mom

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.519
somehow convinced me I could.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.020
For me, she said I had
a wonderful imagination.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.770
And that was my function
in the household,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.440
just like Tommy's
function was to dance.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.150
So my function was to
entertain the other kids.

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.320
So if it was a rainy
day, I was the person

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.330
assigned to bring the
kids down in the basement

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.044
and putting on a Broadway show.

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.960
If it was a sunny day,
my mother would make up

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.150
some kind of shit, throw
it at me as an idea.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.930
Like, why don't you
go in the backyard

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.970
to open a rock
store, Barbara Ann?

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.207
And I'd go, a rock store?

00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:47.040
What's a rock store?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.770
She'd go, oh, with
your imagination,

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.910
you'll figure it out.

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.670
And you know what?

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.220
I found I could sell rocks,
as long as you staple them

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.866
in white paper and
staple the corners,

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:57.500
so nobody could see which
rock they were getting.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.420
People pay for that.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.620
The kids in the neighborhood.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.140
And so our family went.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.200
It was like growing
up in a small town.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.080
We had six girls in the girls'
room, four boys in the boys'

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.330
room, and my mother and
father produced all those kids

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.340
from the living room couch.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.200
My mother's other great gift was
she was a phenomenal organizer.

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.470
We had the messiest
house, as you can imagine,

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:18.420
with that many kids.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.832
We had the biggest family.

00:05:19.832 --> 00:05:22.040
But we also the cleanest
house when my mother cracked

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.380
her mental whip on us.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:24.330
All right?

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.910
And the key to her
organizational skill,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.240
which I later learned in
building a big brokerage

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.330
business, was she
created a system.

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.940
That's a list.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.380
A system for anything she
had to do more than twice.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.350
So for example, we had two
sock drawers in the kitchen,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.800
in our little kitchen.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.420
And she converted
them to-- pardon me.

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:44.730
Bread drawers built in.

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.200
That was common then.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.981
And she converted them
to two sock drawers.

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:51.480
All the boys' socks were in the
upper drawer, all navy blue,

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.164
all one size.

00:05:52.164 --> 00:05:53.830
All the girls' were
white, all one size.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.038
So when you get 10 kids out
to school in the morning,

00:05:56.038 --> 00:05:58.334
all you have to do is
grab any socks you wanted

00:05:58.334 --> 00:06:00.750
and go out the door, as long
as you remember which drawer.

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.708
And the only kid in my
family that got mixed up

00:06:02.708 --> 00:06:04.495
was, of course,
my brother Tommy.

00:06:04.495 --> 00:06:05.870
He went out with
the white socks.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:06.750
No, Tommy!

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.130
Come back!

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:10.650
So that's how our family went.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.480
Hugely organized.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.730
My mother totally
ironclad control

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.550
of every one of her kids,
and you didn't dare not

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.040
walk the straight and narrow.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.200
My father's job was to be
my mother's eleventh child.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.574
And he was totally
in charge of, other

00:06:26.574 --> 00:06:28.865
than working during the day
as a printing press foreman

00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:30.910
and washing trucks
for UPS at night,

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.670
on weekends he did not work.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.460
And on weekends, his job was
to play with his children.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.500
And we couldn't have
gotten a better playmate.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.150
My dad had probably the
mental maturity level,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.330
when he was out in the yard,
of maybe an eight-year-old.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.600
And he did dangerous things
with us all the time.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.840
And what do you like more
as a kid than something

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.900
you shouldn't be doing?

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.150
And even we knew we shouldn't
be doing it, but he didn't.

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:54.940
So for example, if
it was a snowy day,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:56.630
and we got to stay
home from school,

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.170
and he couldn't get up that
Oxen Hill out of Edgewater.

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.130
What would he do?

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:02.145
He would take all of
his kids and as many

00:07:02.145 --> 00:07:04.270
as he could fit in the
whole neighborhood, put them

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.660
on the long wooden ladder
that ran down our side yard,

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.794
and he'd shove us down the hill.

00:07:09.794 --> 00:07:11.210
He'd hop on the
last row, and we'd

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.090
go over that retaining wall
and into oncoming traffic.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:17.940
When every other kid in town
got to go to the "automatic car

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.150
wash" in the town above our
house, all the kids raving.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.070
It's automatic.

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.740
It washes.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.460
It's automatic.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.870
They had nothing on my dad.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.340
We went up and the
little subtle difference

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:30.750
that made all the difference
was right before we went in,

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.245
we were wondering, why do
we have to wear pajamas?

00:07:32.245 --> 00:07:33.761
He made us wear our pajamas.

00:07:33.761 --> 00:07:36.010
Right as we went through the
car wash, he said, quick!

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.490
Roll down the windows!

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:40.600
So he had this
bizarre sense of fun.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.400
And ironically, when
we all get together

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.580
for weddings, christenings,
funerals, whatever,

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:48.950
today, what do we talk about?

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:51.620
The 12 loads of wash my
mother hung on the line

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:52.860
every other day?

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.190
The three meals she put
on the table every day

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.330
so we could all eat?

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:57.190
The clean house?

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.810
No, we don't even
mention my mother.

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:00.510
All we do is sit
around and say, hey,

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:03.080
remember the time
dad was at the lake,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.340
and they had the hailstorm,
and they told us to keep

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.700
under the water and stay dry.

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:08.700
Ah, yeah, yeah.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.940
Wasn't that fun?

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.280
My mother gets no credit.

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.000
And you know what I've learned?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.541
I've learned that
kids don't remember

00:08:13.541 --> 00:08:14.960
the extravagant vacations.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.730
That all becomes
a blur later on.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:19.860
What children really treasure
most is something silly.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.850
And so I had that
wonderful role model

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.010
in my dad of being ridiculous.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.030
And I used that too
to build my business.

00:08:26.030 --> 00:08:27.900
So between my mother's
ability to pick out

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.800
the talent in someone
and create motivation

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.330
to make them be their
best-- what a gift that is,

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.059
to breathe in and out
with a woman who did that

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:40.190
as a matter of course-- and her
ability to organize any mess,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.710
and my dad's ability to let
it all go, who gives a damn,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:47.350
and have a good time, I had
a lot of different models

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.540
to choose from.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.460
And so I was really
perfectly poised

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:53.180
to be an entrepreneur,
if you think about it.

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.305
I have nine siblings,
as I mentioned.

00:08:55.305 --> 00:08:58.540
Out of all my siblings, only
one is not self-employed.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.850
Everybody went into
business for themselves.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:05.330
I credit my father entirely with
that decision, because he hated

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:07.560
every boss he ever worked for.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.050
If he came home from work
at 5 or 4 o'clock instead

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:12.620
of 6 o'clock, the usual time
when we had to be in our seat

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.740
at the table-- my mother's
order-- when he came home

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.860
early, we left
everything we were doing.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.255
And you drop everything.

00:09:19.255 --> 00:09:20.687
The hockey sticks, everything.

00:09:20.687 --> 00:09:22.270
You ran in and sat
in your spot early,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.560
because you knew my father
had an adventure to tell.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.290
And he'd saunter in,
like John Wayne himself.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.090
Sit down, and say to
us, guess what, kids?

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:35.330
And we'd all scream,
you were fired!

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:36.870
And then he'd go
on and say, yeah,

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.160
I told Mr. Stein to go
shove it up his butt.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.630
But he used worse
language than that.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.540
And he said, I quit.

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:46.450
I'm not listening to his son.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:47.950
And of course, my
mother didn't know

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.200
how she was going
to feed the kids,

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.735
but my father must
have interviewed well,

00:09:50.735 --> 00:09:52.901
because within two weeks,
he always had another job.

00:09:52.901 --> 00:09:54.580
So there were gaps, OK?

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:55.840
Onward to being older.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.320
The lucky break
as a young woman.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.200
I was 21 years old, being a
waitress at the Fort Lee Diner,

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.230
right above my house.

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:04.480
We thought it was a rich town.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.194
Basically, it wasn't.

00:10:05.194 --> 00:10:06.000
It was middle class.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.916
But it looked rich from
where we were sitting.

00:10:07.916 --> 00:10:11.630
And I was at a counter when
Ramone Simone looked in.

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:12.880
And of course, this isn't him.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.296
And I don't have
a picture of him.

00:10:14.296 --> 00:10:16.750
But he was as drop dead
gorgeous as Johnny-- is it Depp?

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:17.664
Or Dett?

00:10:17.664 --> 00:10:18.580
Depp?

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.200
OK.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.267
Anyway, he had these aviator
navy blue sunglasses on.

00:10:22.267 --> 00:10:23.350
You couldn't see his eyes.

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.520
He had jet black, slick hair.

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.000
He had dark olive skin,
and he had a real suit on.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.440
Other than my father, I had
never seen a man in a suit.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.080
But this was an expensive suit.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.350
I could smell it.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.460
I could feel it.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.820
Not that I touched it.

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:37.770
But you just know.

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:38.470
You know?

00:10:38.470 --> 00:10:40.300
One look at him, I
knew I'd be losing

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:43.350
my virginity within the week.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.200
[LAUGHS] And it was-- and
ironically, it wasn't like

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.510
I was saving it for anybody.

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.790
It's just nobody
ever asked for it.

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:54.020
I was competing with a blonde
bombshell at the next counter.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.970
Her name was Gloria,
and she had a gimmick

00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:59.290
that was my first real
live marketing gimmick.

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:02.220
And her gimmick was she
would balance two coffee

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:05.450
cups on each hand, and she
had bosoms like a shoe box

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.110
before I think they even
had that surgery, actually.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.590
And she would balance
two more on each breast,

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:13.040
and she would hip her way
through the double doors.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.160
And I'm telling you, the
men at the Fort Lee Diner

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.834
waited in line on the
concrete steps for an hour

00:11:17.834 --> 00:11:19.500
to sit at her counter,
while I'm washing

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.160
mine for the third time.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.090
Unfair competition.

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:27.880
But lucky for me, only the
night before-- how timing makes

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.127
a difference in life-- the night
before, I was with my mother,

00:11:31.127 --> 00:11:32.335
and she was hanging the wash.

00:11:32.335 --> 00:11:35.730
And as she's trying to dish out
that wash as fast as she could,

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.670
I'm standing there
whining and complaining.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.730
Mom, it's not fair.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:40.070
Nick really should make people.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:41.000
You know, one for
me, one for her.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.950
She's getting so many
tips, and na-na-na-na.

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.533
And my mother didn't
like complainers.

00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:46.940
And she said, why don't you
just maybe braid your hair,

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:49.560
put nice red ribbons to match
your little turtleneck that you

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.780
wear, because we
had red turtlenecks

00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:52.530
and black pinafores,
that was the costume.

00:11:52.530 --> 00:11:55.070
And she said, just stay
as sweet as you are.

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:57.940
And I told her that was a
stupid idea, because I was 21.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.026
Mothers are stupid.

00:11:59.026 --> 00:12:00.650
But of course, when
I got to the diner,

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.880
I did that with the rubber
bands, the red ribbons.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:04.630
And I'm telling you,
I found that men

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:06.220
like two kinds of women.

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.770
The hot tamale like
this lady, or they

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.210
like the great white virgin.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.931
Either are very, very innocent.

00:12:12.931 --> 00:12:13.430
OK?

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:15.845
And that-- I should have one
with braids and everything.

00:12:15.845 --> 00:12:18.750
Ramone Simone said a smart
girl like me should really

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:20.277
be living in the big city.

00:12:20.277 --> 00:12:21.360
I'd grown up in Edgewater.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.574
I'd never set foot
in New York city.

00:12:23.574 --> 00:12:24.740
It was a different universe.

00:12:24.740 --> 00:12:25.781
It was a mental universe.

00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:27.230
We called it "the city."

00:12:27.230 --> 00:12:28.610
No one ever went there.

00:12:28.610 --> 00:12:32.290
And so Ray moved me into
the Barbazon Hotel for Women

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.060
on Lexington
Avenue, which is now

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.950
a-- I think it's an
exercise place of some kind.

00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:39.150
But anyway, it only allowed
women to stay there.

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:40.210
Most of them spinsters.

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:41.600
No men were allowed.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.750
And he paid for a week.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:46.910
Well, now my mother definitely
had me pegged as a prostitute.

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:49.220
She forbid me to
go, but I was 21.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.660
I told her, I'm going anyway.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:53.100
And off I huffed and was
banned from the house

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.890
till I dropped that terrible
guy named Ramone Simone.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:59.303
After a week, Ramon Simone gave
me $1,000-- pardon me, $100.

00:12:59.303 --> 00:13:00.500
$1,000?

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.960
$100 to buy myself
a "New York" outfit.

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.170
Sounds like prostitution,
but I was so naive, you know?

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.880
And I bought myself
a lavender one.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:11.830
Stretch top, stretch pants
with buttons and a square.

00:13:11.830 --> 00:13:13.390
Really cool.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.129
Lavender boots.

00:13:14.129 --> 00:13:16.170
The whole-- no, I didn't
have enough for a purse.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:18.000
And I walked down
Lexington Avenue,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.165
and I knew I would never
ever leave New York.

00:13:20.165 --> 00:13:22.040
It was that moment, a
week after I was there.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.900
And I was like, this is for me.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:24.960
I'm Georgy Girl.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.840
I'm cool.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.920
You know, that kind of thing.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.690
And I never left New York.

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:32.180
I got a receptionist job
for the Giffuni Brothers

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:34.100
and answered the phone
50 million times a day.

00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:34.670
Good morning, the
Giffuni Brothers.

00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:35.550
Good morning, Giffuni Brothers.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.250
Good morning.
[LAUGHS] All right?

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:39.850
I did that for a year, and
then Ramone Simone said,

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:42.120
you'd be great as a
real estate broker.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.390
He said, you've got
such a good personality.

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.662
I'm going to give you $1,000.

00:13:45.662 --> 00:13:47.120
Let's start a real
estate business.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.786
I wish I could take
credit for the idea.

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:49.980
Said, oh, that was my dream.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:50.800
It wasn't.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.330
My attitude on that one was,
hey, I've had 22 jobs so far.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:54.470
Why not try another one?

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:55.020
That was it.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:55.520
Bang.

00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520
Give it a whirl.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.460
And so we started the
Corcoran Simone Company.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.020
With an accent on the Simone,
because that was his last name,

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.420
and it was very fancy.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.400
And after all, he
explained to me,

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:10.060
his name was Ramone Simone,
pronounced it perfectly.

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:11.690
And he was from
the Basque country,

00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:14.570
which I had to look up, before
the advent of the internet.

00:14:14.570 --> 00:14:17.970
You had to actually go to a
book and look at Basque country.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.700
And I found out they were
warriors of some kind in Spain.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:21.770
Boy, was that a turn-on.

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:23.568
That finished up my
virginity right away.

00:14:23.568 --> 00:14:24.692
Just that one little thing.

00:14:24.692 --> 00:14:26.401
You know?

00:14:26.401 --> 00:14:26.900
OK.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:27.660
So where was I?

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:29.160
All right.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.190
We started the Corcoran
Simone Company, which

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.650
was a rental company, in
subleased space on 61st

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:35.920
Street off Madison Avenue,
owned by an accountant.

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.539
Cheap bastard.

00:14:36.539 --> 00:14:37.830
He raised our rent every month.

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:38.530
But who cares?

00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:40.130
He gave us a break, initially.

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:40.960
OK.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.220
Anyway, that was the
beginning of the company.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:48.030
We had 14 lovely rental
agents within seven years.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.460
I felt on top of the world.

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.200
I was actually
taking a salary check

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.200
for the first time
on the sixth year.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.764
Whatever it was, it seemed
like a lot at the time.

00:14:55.764 --> 00:14:58.180
And I was thinking, life doesn't
get any better than this.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.139
I moved in with Ramone Simone.

00:15:00.139 --> 00:15:02.680
After I moved in with him, he
told me he had three daughters.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:03.596
They moved in with us.

00:15:03.596 --> 00:15:04.220
No problem.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.080
I'm good with kids.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.490
Right?

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.290
Well, surprise!

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.120
I also found out
from his mother Vicky

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.095
that his name was not Ramone
Simone, it was Ray Simon.

00:15:12.095 --> 00:15:15.045
He added the E's.

00:15:15.045 --> 00:15:17.350
And he was from 155th Street.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:19.380
So I'm like, well,
there's marketing, also.

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:21.430
OK.

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:22.960
We built that little sales team.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.710
There's a picture
of the original team

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.850
with their old fashioned
haircuts and stuff.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.470
On our first little
retreat to brainstorm.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.900
And then almost seven
years to the itch,

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:35.260
Ramone mentioned one night,
when I was dumping the pasta

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:36.736
into the sink, he
said, you know,

00:15:36.736 --> 00:15:38.500
we have something
serious to discuss.

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.089
Oh yes, Ray?

00:15:39.089 --> 00:15:40.630
I looked up through
the fog, thinking

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.600
how pretty I must look.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.960
I was 29.

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.610
And he said, I'm going
to marry your secretary.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:47.770
Tina, that bitch?

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.355
I didn't really say that,
but in my head I said it.

00:15:51.355 --> 00:15:52.230
You know what I mean?

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.115
I thought I was in
somebody else's bad dream,

00:15:54.115 --> 00:15:56.740
like slow motion, when you're in
a car crash, from what I hear.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:57.600
I'm like, what?

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.990
Huh?

00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.841
Tina?

00:15:59.841 --> 00:16:00.340
No.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.650
He goes, yeah.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:02.330
Don't get upset.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.630
We're madly in love.

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.910
We're going to get married.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.826
He said, and really take
your time moving out.

00:16:06.826 --> 00:16:09.460
I was out of there in about
a minute with my toothbrush.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:11.774
Moved on to my best
friend, really,

00:16:11.774 --> 00:16:14.440
my only friend, because I worked
so hard, I didn't have friends.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.830
Kathy Gilson, on
East 79th Street.

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.870
Had a studio.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.230
I just went right to her
house, and she let me in

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.730
and I started
living off her couch

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:24.380
until I got my feet under me.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.120
Now, what happened
after that I'm

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.950
ashamed of, because I was a
pretty happy go lucky person,

00:16:28.950 --> 00:16:30.710
thinking relatively secure.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:32.530
But somehow, when
that happened, I

00:16:32.530 --> 00:16:35.300
had-- I felt like my whole
insides were pulled out.

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:37.110
What a waste of energy.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:38.940
After all, Ray had
found me in Edgewater.

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:40.170
After all, he believed in me.

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.000
He was my mentor.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000
He was my boyfriend.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.880
He gave me a family.

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:46.670
I was very, very-- I'm very
fond of his three daughters.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.939
We worked together.

00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:50.480
I mean, it was my whole world,
really, if you think about it.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.450
But I made the
mistaken conclusion

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.460
that I was strong because
of him and nothing good

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.081
would have ever
happened without him.

00:16:59.081 --> 00:16:59.580
All right?

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:01.871
Because that's where I was
at that juncture in my life.

00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:07.750
I also had the ridiculous idea
that at 29 I was old. [LAUGHS]

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:10.390
I'm like, holy shit,
nobody's going to marry me.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:15.056
I'm 29 already. [LAUGHS]
When most women, especially

00:17:15.056 --> 00:17:16.430
in Edgewater, all
my sisters were

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.970
married at their 18th birthday
or within months of it.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.660
Every girl in Edgewater was
married on their 18th birthday.

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.450
So already my parents were
sweating it out on me.

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.000
I was the haggard old babe.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.609
You know?

00:17:26.609 --> 00:17:28.440
And I fell for it myself.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:29.260
OK?

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.600
But of course it
took me about a year

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.304
going in and seeing
Ray and Tina.

00:17:34.304 --> 00:17:35.970
I couldn't fire her,
he said, because he

00:17:35.970 --> 00:17:38.702
was a 51% shareholder,
which was true.

00:17:38.702 --> 00:17:40.660
And I didn't want to go
in and see them happy--

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:41.740
and they were married
in three months.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:43.550
So it was really true love, and
they have three kids together.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:45.030
It was really meant to be.

00:17:45.030 --> 00:17:46.660
And things will
happen like that.

00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.470
But for me, I was too naive
or too stupid to see it

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:51.290
for what it was.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.040
Just meant to be.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.370
That's the way life is, right?

00:17:53.370 --> 00:17:53.870
OK.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.260
So it took me a year to
get my feet under me.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:57.950
I pretended for a year.

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.525
But when I finally, one
day, somehow got brittle,

00:18:00.525 --> 00:18:02.150
I don't know what
clicked, I can't even

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:03.220
tell you what it was.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.762
But I marched in on
a Friday morning.

00:18:04.762 --> 00:18:07.303
And I said, you know, Ramone,
this is what we're going to do.

00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:08.927
We're going to
divide this business.

00:18:08.927 --> 00:18:11.010
That's-- oh that-- wait,
I'm not that bad looking.

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.450
Can I go back?

00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:13.010
29.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:15.040
My face was still full.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.580
I had no facial hair then.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:19.630
Here we go.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.610
So I went in and I said, we're
going to chop up this business

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:23.790
just like a football draw.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.890
This is my daughter Kate.

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:26.056
But that's when she was six.

00:18:26.056 --> 00:18:27.070
She's already nine.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.402
Anyway, but it's
such a cute picture,

00:18:29.402 --> 00:18:30.360
and I want to show off.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:30.960
OK.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.520
I said, we're going to chop
up this business, Ray, today,

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.510
like a football draw.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.176
We're going to take
the accounts that we

00:18:36.176 --> 00:18:39.420
have between receivables
and what we actually

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.490
had on the account.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.582
We had a little bit
short of $70,000.

00:18:42.582 --> 00:18:44.410
I said, we're going
to chop it up.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:47.350
35 for you, 35 for me,
of the cash portion

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:48.796
and the receivables.

00:18:48.796 --> 00:18:50.170
You get to pick
the first person.

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:53.145
We had 14 people.

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:53.770
Did we have 14?

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:54.040
Yeah.

00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:54.539
14 people.

00:18:54.539 --> 00:18:55.560
We have 14 people.

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.140
You get to pick
the first person.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:18:58.015
I'll pick the second.

00:18:58.015 --> 00:18:59.590
You go first, and
then you can decide

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.270
if you want to stay here or go
and whether you want the phone

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.770
number.

00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:04.076
We had a great phone number.

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:05.700
I didn't want to lose
the phone number.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.500
But you decide.

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.000
OK?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.637
You decide.

00:19:07.637 --> 00:19:08.720
But we're ending it today.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.900
He couldn't believe it.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.210
But within a minute, he picked
Norma Hersch, the top producer.

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:14.450
60% of my income.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.750
I picked Esther Kaplan.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:17.360
Like a camel produces.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.881
Steady as she goes.

00:19:19.881 --> 00:19:20.380
All right.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.360
And chop, chop,
chop, chop, chop,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:24.116
I collected my seven
people together.

00:19:24.116 --> 00:19:25.740
I put them in the
corner of the office.

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:26.210
I said, guess what?

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:26.740
Good news.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.574
Monday we're moving.

00:19:27.574 --> 00:19:30.073
I'll call you over the weekend
and give you the new address.

00:19:30.073 --> 00:19:31.020
What?

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:31.530
Yeah.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:32.710
We're moving on Monday.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:35.450
I didn't tell them the others
weren't moving with us.

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.852
And I said, come back for
work on Monday morning,

00:19:37.852 --> 00:19:39.810
but I'll give you the
address over the weekend.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:42.970
I went to my existing landlord
on Third Avenue and 58th

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.920
Street, and I got
the exact same office

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.520
two floors higher than Ray.

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.947
Eight, nine, three
floors higher.

00:19:48.947 --> 00:19:50.030
He was on eight, I got 11.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:53.210
And I got it for 20% cheaper.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.486
Now, that to me sounded
like God's will,

00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:56.860
that I was getting
a lucky break.

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:57.440
But guess what?

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.130
It really wasn't.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.796
What it meant was the
real estate market

00:19:59.796 --> 00:20:02.602
was about to crash, because the
commercial sector of the market

00:20:02.602 --> 00:20:04.060
always goes before
the residential.

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.400
But I didn't know that then.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.650
And I should have had,
be careful, be careful,

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.330
be careful.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:09.550
But I didn't hear that.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.500
In those days, you could take
a cab down to 42nd Street,

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.550
you could buy all your
desks right on the street,

00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.180
and the guys would physically
run them up to your office

00:20:17.180 --> 00:20:18.280
and put them together.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.020
You could order the telephone.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.300
Ma Bell was the
big deal in town.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.967
You could order a
telephone on a Friday,

00:20:23.967 --> 00:20:25.549
have it installed
on Saturday morning.

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:26.360
That's what I did.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.210
And Monday morning came.

00:20:28.210 --> 00:20:29.730
We had desks,
chairs, and a phone.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.040
And what do you need in
the real estate business?

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:31.630
Just people.

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.731
And they moved into
that, and they sat down,

00:20:33.731 --> 00:20:34.730
and we were in business.

00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:35.389
Bang.

00:20:35.389 --> 00:20:37.430
I decided to call the
company the Corcoran Group,

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:38.660
because I figured if I
was going to make it,

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:40.740
I was going to need
the help of a group.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.270
And that was the beginning
of the Corcoran Group.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:47.060
When I left the door that day,
when we ended that business,

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.635
because Ray rightfully, I think
now, in hindsight, was angry.

00:20:50.635 --> 00:20:52.650
It was like he had
gotten hit broadside.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:53.630
OK?

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:55.502
But Ray gave me the
gift of a lifetime.

00:20:55.502 --> 00:20:57.460
He said to me, you know
Barbara, you will never

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:59.630
succeed without me.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:00.380
And you know what?

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:02.463
If he had said, you know,
Barbara, you're amazing.

00:21:02.463 --> 00:21:03.470
I'm sure you'll do fine.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:06.310
I don't believe I would stayed
in business in the tough times.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.780
It was my sheer ego
of that insult that

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:12.375
burned so deep in my soul that
when all the chips were down,

00:21:12.375 --> 00:21:14.750
I thought I had tried everything
in the world, everything

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:17.030
I could possibly think to stay
in business highly leveraged,

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.890
because real estate was up
and down and up and down.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:20.130
I was always leveraged,
because I was always

00:21:20.130 --> 00:21:21.920
greedy about where
I wanted to go.

00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:23.390
But I would think
of those words.

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:25.720
And son of a gun, I
would think, bing!

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.410
One new thing.

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:28.920
And that one new
thing was always

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.910
the thing that got me through.

00:21:30.910 --> 00:21:32.680
So he really gave me a gift.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.200
Thank you.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.630
And of course, he was wrong.

00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:35.440
Ha, ha!

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.940
Because I sold my business,
maybe 22 years later,

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:39.220
for $66 million.

00:21:39.220 --> 00:21:40.570
Now for the next part.

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:41.328
OK.

00:21:41.328 --> 00:21:41.828
All right.

00:21:45.652 --> 00:21:49.970
Thank you very much.

00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:51.510
Well, this one
isn't on my slide,

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.870
so we'll see where we're going.

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:54.330
OK.

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:55.087
Now I'm a Shark.

00:21:55.087 --> 00:21:56.170
I can read the damn thing.

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:56.670
There we go.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.450
Now I'm a Shark. [CHUCKLES] And
that's the "Shark Tank" set.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.380
I got the Shark Tank gig as a
result of handling rejection

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.170
as I do so well, very well.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.026
Yet again.

00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:08.400
Everything good
in my life always

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:10.289
happened on the
heels of rejection.

00:22:10.289 --> 00:22:12.080
And so when I was hired
to do "Shark Tank,"

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.996
I signed the contract
without even reading it,

00:22:13.996 --> 00:22:15.420
sent it back to Mark Burnett.

00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.777
Mark Burnett, a famous producer.

00:22:17.777 --> 00:22:18.735
I'm going to Hollywood.

00:22:18.735 --> 00:22:20.975
I'm going to see the
Hollywood on the hill sign.

00:22:20.975 --> 00:22:23.350
I'm like-- I bought three new
outfits to sign autographs.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:24.420
I'm going to be famous.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.075
Oh my God.

00:22:25.075 --> 00:22:25.700
Oh my God.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:26.930
I was so excited.

00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:30.010
And then only four days before
I was supposed to fly out to LA,

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.424
I got the dreaded phone call.

00:22:31.424 --> 00:22:32.840
I'm sorry, we hired
somebody else.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.410
We changed our mind.

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:36.860
And that's when I
wrote the email,

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.100
thank God, standing
up for myself,

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:41.660
with the help of everyone in
my office, who's actually here

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.000
and let me not forget to
introduce them somewhere

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.820
in the dark in a minute.

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.880
I wrote the email to
Mark Burnett, telling him

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:49.740
I consider his
rejection a lucky charm.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.750
Cited all the negative
things I had in my life

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:54.166
and how they turned around to
be the best possible things,

00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:56.230
and ended the email
as saying, I suggest

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.260
you invite both
girls out to compete

00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:02.430
for the lone female seat, and
I'll pay for my own plane fare,

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.070
and I'll be on that plane.

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:05.790
And when he read
that, his comment

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.600
to his secretary of the
secretary of the secretary that

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:10.890
was standing there, she
told it-- Sharice, I think,

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:11.600
was her name.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.400
She said, all he said
was, God, she's a shark.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.090
And invited me out, thank God.

00:23:17.090 --> 00:23:19.310
If not for that email, I
would not have gotten that.

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.940
I would not have met any of
the entrepreneurs that I adore

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:27.192
like my own children, when
they're making money. [LAUGHS]

00:23:27.192 --> 00:23:29.400
And even the bad ones, when
they're not making money,

00:23:29.400 --> 00:23:31.600
I kind of like them too.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.700
But I thought it might
be very interesting

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.030
for you to hear
what I believe makes

00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.970
for a successful entrepreneur.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:42.450
There's my original group
from season one and two.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.220
Maybe you recognize
some of those people.

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.928
My favorites, of
course, are the two guys

00:23:45.928 --> 00:23:49.830
at the top, especially
the one on your left.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:52.290
Sabin, he's so goddamn
sexy, I can't even talk

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.480
to him without breathing heavy.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:54.980
OK.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.950
All right. [LAUGHS]

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:59.537
Number one trait, probably
in descending order,

00:23:59.537 --> 00:24:01.120
or at least the first
few are the key.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.890
Persistence.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.930
The inability to quit.

00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:08.480
Every one of my entrepreneurs
that are hugely successful

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.500
have that in spades.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.750
I don't know where you get it.

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:11.430
Are you born with it?

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:12.210
Do you develop it?

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:14.570
Do you do it from the
school of hard knocks?

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:16.026
I don't know how you get it.

00:24:16.026 --> 00:24:17.900
But I know one thing
for sure as an investor.

00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:20.140
If you don't have it,
you're not going to succeed.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:21.640
You could have everything else.

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.445
But if you don't have that low
IQ, that when someone slams you

00:24:25.445 --> 00:24:28.350
on the head, you go down and
then you bounce up and go,

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:29.160
I'm an ass.

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:29.700
I'm dumb.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.260
I'm back up.

00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:31.410
Hit me again.

00:24:31.410 --> 00:24:33.930
It's like a weird thing.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:37.360
That kind of a
thing that goes on,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:41.060
the ability to handle
a hard hit, is key.

00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.950
And I have been
able to separate,

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.900
early on now, my
investments very quickly

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.602
on one little
thing that happens.

00:24:47.602 --> 00:24:49.310
And the minute I see
it happen, I'm like,

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:50.930
oh God, I'm going
to lose my money.

00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:52.807
And it's called feeling
sorry for yourself.

00:24:52.807 --> 00:24:54.640
When I'm talking to one
of my entrepreneurs,

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.060
let's say we did
the due diligence,

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.680
we signed up the deal,
I'm working with them now

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.096
for two to three months, and
something really bad happens,

00:25:00.096 --> 00:25:01.100
a disappointment.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.552
If they start doing an oh,
poor me, oh God, oh my God,

00:25:04.552 --> 00:25:05.260
that wasn't fair.

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.390
You know, she blah, blah, blah.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.316
The minute I hear
that talk, I know

00:25:09.316 --> 00:25:10.440
I'm going to lose my money.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.324
Because the difference between
the really great entrepreneurs

00:25:13.324 --> 00:25:14.740
and everyone else
is how long they

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.630
take to feel sorry
for themselves.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:17.830
I really believe that.

00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:20.602
And so if you're the type that
just boom, and like, oh shit.

00:25:20.602 --> 00:25:21.810
That shouldn't have happened.

00:25:21.810 --> 00:25:21.890
Ah, whatever.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:24.600
And keep working, you're going
to do well as an entrepreneur.

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.510
Persistence.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:28.410
To tell you her story,
by way of illustration,

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.652
Daisy was selling
200 cakes, I believe.

00:25:30.652 --> 00:25:33.110
I might be off in my numbers,
because I always mix them up.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.568
So round them out
in your own head.

00:25:34.568 --> 00:25:36.319
200 cakes on "Shark
Tank," before she

00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:37.360
appeared on "Shark Tank."

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.380
Boom!

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:40.470
Every guy in America
fell in love with her.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.650
She was the girl next door.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:43.190
Every guy ordered a cake.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.755
But her website crashed.

00:25:44.755 --> 00:25:45.930
She was out of business.

00:25:45.930 --> 00:25:47.000
She was out of business.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.130
But what did Daisy do?

00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:50.635
She was smart enough to
pick up the phone and said,

00:25:50.635 --> 00:25:51.250
(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Here's what I'm doing.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:53.380
I got one phone-- she
doesn't mind me imitating.

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.046
(SOUTHERN ACCENT)
Here's what I'm doing.

00:25:55.046 --> 00:25:56.310
I've got one phone line here.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.960
Now, I'm going to forward
that phone line-- and this was

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.060
a message when she knew
I wouldn't pick her.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:03.101
(SOUTHERN ACCENT) I'm
going to forward that phone

00:26:03.101 --> 00:26:04.830
line to your phone
line in New York,

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.788
and you get a bunch of
girls that sound like me

00:26:06.788 --> 00:26:09.810
and start taking cake orders.

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:11.410
And that's exactly what we did.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.510
Three good actresses
that sounded-- hello,

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:14.960
is this Daisy Cakes?

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.810
(SOUTHERN ACCENT) It sure is.

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:18.490
What did she do?

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:18.990
OK.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:19.730
She's amazing.

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:21.650
She's done over a million
dollars in sales in cakes.

00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:22.150
OK?

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.560
If I had to say one trait
that I've seen in this lady

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:28.040
over and over again, is she
knows how to get hit hard,

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.822
make a lot of bad
business judgments.

00:26:29.822 --> 00:26:31.280
But I don't really
care about them,

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.071
because I know she's
going to come back up.

00:26:33.071 --> 00:26:34.490
Persistence, OK?

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.500
Cousins Maine Lobster,
I already cited for you.

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:38.239
My handsome hunk on the right.

00:26:38.239 --> 00:26:40.030
When I come back, I'm
going to pray to God,

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:44.170
let me be born as Sabin's wife.

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.386
And if he's not
available, I'll take Jim.

00:26:47.386 --> 00:26:49.660
[LAUGHS] OK.

00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.830
Cousins Maine Lobster.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:51.906
When they were on
"Shark Tank," they

00:26:51.906 --> 00:26:53.190
were in business three months.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:54.350
They are great traders.

00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:55.340
They are street smart.

00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.370
Again, common to all
my great entrepreneurs.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:26:59.690
But I'll give you a
story to illustrate it.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.950
They were selling lobsters
out of a food truck.

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:02.450
Bang!

00:27:02.450 --> 00:27:04.040
They were in the food truck.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.280
They had three months of sales.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.900
They were so well
prepared, that they

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:10.100
had listened to four
seasons of "Shark Tank,"

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.860
had written down every question
any entrepreneur had ever

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.620
been asked, and they
came up with two answers

00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:16.660
if they got asked it.

00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:17.720
They were practiced.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.135
They were so smooth
on the set, I

00:27:19.135 --> 00:27:20.926
thought they were in
business for 10 years.

00:27:20.926 --> 00:27:23.420
Not a single shark said-- they
said, our monthly sales are.

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.049
They never said, how long
have you been in business?

00:27:26.049 --> 00:27:26.840
They never said it.

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:27.540
No one asked.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:29.470
They were that
savvy on their feet.

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:32.630
I was the lucky shark that won
that competition to get them.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:36.190
They grew their one food
truck to 10 food trucks.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:37.520
They just opened a restaurant.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.680
They're making money
hand over fist already.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.640
They also opened an online
Cousins Maine Lobster Direct.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.830
Lobsters right to your door.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.621
That kind of thing.

00:27:44.621 --> 00:27:45.520
Anywhere.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.100
A very important
part of "Shark Tank"

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.960
to illustrate them in action
is something we call updates.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.132
When you have a
successful entrepreneur,

00:27:53.132 --> 00:27:55.340
the show likes to come back
and do an update on them.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:56.290
Hey, what's happening?

00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:59.200
And the viewers at home really
like that part of the show.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:01.380
When I pitched "Shark
Tank," oh, listen.

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.750
They're getting an award from
the governor's office in Maine

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:07.000
for creating 50 new
jobs in the state.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.830
It's the worst economy
of all the states.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.180
It's the worst job market.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:11.020
They are?

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.595
They are.

00:28:11.595 --> 00:28:12.470
You want to shoot it?

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.970
Yeah.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:13.690
We love it.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.273
And then I call the
governor's office.

00:28:15.273 --> 00:28:17.980
Hey, "Shark Tank"
wants to shoot.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.550
They want you to give them
an award for the 50 new jobs.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:22.301
[LAUGHS]

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:25.570
OK.

00:28:25.570 --> 00:28:28.040
But here's what went awry.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.740
OK?

00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:31.619
A day before, they
said, we're not only

00:28:31.619 --> 00:28:33.160
going to shoot them
on the top, we're

00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:35.090
going to come and shoot
their-- with the governor.

00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:36.298
We're going to do a two-part.

00:28:36.298 --> 00:28:38.130
The first two-part
update they ever did.

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:39.510
Who ever heard of two parts?

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:40.930
Where did the two
parts come from?

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:43.055
The second part is we're
going to go to the factory

00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:44.230
and shoot the 50 people.

00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.550
Hi Cousins, how many friends
do you have in Maine? [LAUGHS]

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:52.040
And how quickly can you
get chef hats with Cousins

00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.630
in bright red, printed, so
your brand is branded on TV?

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:56.180
I don't know.

00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.420
We'll do our best.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.290
They had 50 custom made
chef hats within 24 hours.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:05.550
50 employees of sorts in
their factory, smiling.

00:29:05.550 --> 00:29:08.910
But when the executive-- when
the field producer walked

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:10.570
in-- little titan of
a guy-- walked in,

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:13.450
he saw all these happy
workers with big hats

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:16.470
on, which I [BLOWS] blew
garbage bags individually

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:17.420
to puff them up.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:18.400
They're all standing.

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.630
Here's the workers.

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.580
And when he walked
in, he goes, great.

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:23.830
But the chef hats have to go.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.060
They're just too much.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.790
And Sabin, my lover boy here,
coolly turns around and says,

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:31.910
you know, he said,
unfortunately, we never

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.285
let our chefs work without them.

00:29:33.285 --> 00:29:34.118
It's company policy.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.220
And the guys rolled right over.

00:29:39.220 --> 00:29:41.070
Oh, OK.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:44.090
What was most important in this
update is every shot of them

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:45.290
had the brand in it.

00:29:45.290 --> 00:29:48.489
And what do you think happened
to their brand new website that

00:29:48.489 --> 00:29:49.030
had no sales?

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.600
It exploded with business.

00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.770
Fast on your feet.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:53.686
Smart on your feet.

00:29:53.686 --> 00:29:56.060
Not the kind of stuff you get
when you pay all that money

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:56.840
for Harvard MBA.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:58.030
Street smarts.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:58.614
Street smarts.

00:29:58.614 --> 00:30:00.571
How do you get out of
the-- how do you finagle,

00:30:00.571 --> 00:30:01.750
and how do you do it fast?

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.480
Key quality in an entrepreneur.

00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.550
Next, Tom + Chee.

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:07.560
When I met Tom +
Chee, they had just

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.270
come out of selling their
grilled cheese on doughnuts

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.960
out of a tent in Cincinnati.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.254
What was so interesting
about them, however,

00:30:15.254 --> 00:30:16.670
they weren't talking
about a tent.

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:18.128
They were talking
about a franchise

00:30:18.128 --> 00:30:21.120
with hundreds of franchises
selling cheese on doughnuts.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:21.870
OK.

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:23.770
All right.

00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:24.896
What do you think happened?

00:30:24.896 --> 00:30:27.103
They told me about they're
going to have an amusement

00:30:27.103 --> 00:30:27.720
park one day.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:29.139
A Tom + Chee amusement park.

00:30:29.139 --> 00:30:29.680
I'm like, OK.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.440
They're definitely on
dope, these people.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.730
But I don't think so anymore.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.438
I can't wait to go to
the amusement park.

00:30:36.438 --> 00:30:38.440
They have 171 franchises
across America.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.720
Exactly what they
envisioned, they got.

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:42.529
Exactly the picture
in great detail.

00:30:42.529 --> 00:30:43.820
Where they were going to do it.

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:44.930
How they were going to
go to the other side

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:46.890
of the river in Cincinnati,
which is another state.

00:30:46.890 --> 00:30:48.080
I forget which one it is.

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.350
How they were going
to come across back.

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:50.016
Buh-buh-buh-buh.

00:30:50.016 --> 00:30:51.592
I'm like, OK.

00:30:51.592 --> 00:30:52.300
Well, guess what?

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:53.310
I should have believed them.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.810
OK?

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.910
They have big pictures
in their heads.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:59.174
And every entrepreneur might
not have a business plan

00:30:59.174 --> 00:30:59.840
with everything.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:01.350
In fact, none of them really do.

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.850
I think they're
grossly overrated.

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.141
But they sure have a movie
in their head of who they're

00:31:05.141 --> 00:31:06.449
going to be when they grow up.

00:31:06.449 --> 00:31:08.740
And when they can't express
that movie on "Shark Tank,"

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:10.567
I'm always out.

00:31:10.567 --> 00:31:13.150
If they don't see it, how am I
going to see it and believe it?

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.030
And they're not
going to get there.

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:16.830
Visual, big picture.

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.425
I don't know if
Fleetwood deserves

00:31:18.425 --> 00:31:22.730
to be here, because he's
still not making me any money.

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.380
But he is a big
visionary thinker,

00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:27.520
and he's always pissing away
my money on these ideas.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.370
But I have to say, I've
got to stay with him here.

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:33.300
Because I'm in a contract
with him, mostly.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:35.629
And I also love him in his
own bad child kind of way.

00:31:35.629 --> 00:31:36.170
But whatever.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:36.910
Let me move on.

00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:37.410
OK.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.020
Next. [LAUGHS] I'm so--
I have so hard a time

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.070
being a phony baloney.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.320
OK.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:42.880
What does this say?

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.540
Sales ability.

00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.600
Yes, definitely.

00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:46.370
Tom + Chee, Harlem, New York.

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:47.165
They were originally
in Brooklyn,

00:31:47.165 --> 00:31:48.248
moved to Harlem, New York.

00:31:48.248 --> 00:31:49.560
Under the train tracks.

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.360
Interesting view
of their business.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.750
You go there, you can't hear
each other. [TRAIN NOISES]

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:59.150
But they have the happiest
bakery doing pipcorn.

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:00.230
What's pipcorn?

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:01.870
Small kernels of popcorn.

00:32:01.870 --> 00:32:03.370
It doesn't upset
your stomach if you

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.510
have any kind of food allergies,
lactose, blah, blah, blah.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:06.260
All that stuff.

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:08.790
And it doesn't get caught in
your teeth, and it's delicious.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:11.950
They discovered pipcorn because
Jim had a stomach problem.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:13.320
Brother and sister team.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.319
Jen is probably the
most charismatic person

00:32:16.319 --> 00:32:17.360
I've ever met in my life.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.170
She walks into Whole Foods, and
everybody's crawling up to her,

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:21.330
dying to touch her.

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:22.500
She's got charisma.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.112
She sells that popcorn
to anybody and everybody,

00:32:26.112 --> 00:32:27.570
and they keep coming
back for more.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:28.830
What does her great brother do?

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:29.621
He's a finance guy.

00:32:29.621 --> 00:32:30.730
Ne-ne-ne, ne-ne-ne.

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:33.210
Anal, anal, anal, anal, anal.

00:32:33.210 --> 00:32:34.617
Couldn't be better partners.

00:32:34.617 --> 00:32:35.450
And what does he do?

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:39.720
He even goes out marries a
financial investment banker,

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:41.790
another whiz, bringing
her into the business.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.900
What does Jen do?

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.000
She hires her best friend
to run the factory.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.330
What does that lady do?

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:50.590
She knows how to make those
popcorn poppers so happy.

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:51.510
Amazing.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:54.250
But she's selling every
minute of the day, no matter

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.160
who she-- it's natural to her.

00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.420
Phenomenal sales ability.

00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.230
Charisma.

00:32:58.230 --> 00:32:58.730
Another one.

00:32:58.730 --> 00:32:59.540
Hold Your Haunches.

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:00.040
Same thing.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.800
These girls tell you you should
buy their pants for fat girls'

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.555
asses, and I'm telling you,
you're going to buy two pairs.

00:33:05.555 --> 00:33:07.930
Because they just-- (SOUTHERN
ACCENT) Hold Your Haunches!

00:33:07.930 --> 00:33:10.120
You've got to have
Hold Your Haunches!

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:10.620
OK?

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:11.584
You've got to buy in.

00:33:11.584 --> 00:33:13.500
No wonder they have a
million dollars of sales

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.760
by year two in "Shark Tank."

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.150
One of the best success stories.

00:33:16.150 --> 00:33:16.900
Next.

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:17.790
Risk Tolerant.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:18.750
Great trait.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:19.330
OK?

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.980
This guy, I bought into
him because he looks just

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.680
like a pig.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:24.050
Do you know how--
no, in a good way.

00:33:24.050 --> 00:33:25.120
All right?

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:26.475
Pork barrel barbecue sauce.

00:33:26.475 --> 00:33:27.100
Think about it.

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:28.740
Anybody old enough in
this room to remember

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.990
that guy who used
to sell chickens

00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:31.114
that looked like a chicken?

00:33:31.114 --> 00:33:33.844
Frank Purdue looked
exactly like a chicken.

00:33:33.844 --> 00:33:36.010
I saw this guy, I'm like,
he's the new Frank Purdue,

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:36.960
but he's a pig.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.930
OK.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.060
What's great about-- no.

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.400
And he doesn't even mind it.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.811
He thinks he knows what it is.

00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:42.310
OK?

00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.745
And he's married.

00:33:42.745 --> 00:33:44.430
He's more secure
now, with two kids.

00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:45.070
All right.

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.310
But when he was single,
even then, he accepted it.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:49.560
What's great about them
is they are risk tolerant.

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.120
When I say risk tolerant,
I'll tell you this.

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.040
They, when their
business was young,

00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.350
and they had to buy shelves,
and shelves in the stores,

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.950
there's no way to
get those shelves

00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:59.210
unless you're paying for them.

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.960
They had a vision
of a giant business.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:04.030
They went out and they
raised like $800,000, maybe

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:04.690
I did less.

00:34:04.690 --> 00:34:06.235
Maybe it was one-- two.

00:34:06.235 --> 00:34:10.300
They made like $800,000,
and they could barely

00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.820
stay in business.

00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:13.980
And they blew it all
on more shelf space.

00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.129
They go for broke.

00:34:15.129 --> 00:34:16.644
They are not the
least bit bothered.

00:34:16.644 --> 00:34:17.560
And they're attorneys.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.969
They were Washington,
DC attorneys,

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:20.760
when they decided to
go into this business.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.929
Quite an unusual thing.

00:34:21.929 --> 00:34:22.909
Competitive.

00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:25.116
If I tell Jim from
Cousins Maine Lobster,

00:34:25.116 --> 00:34:26.699
I don't have his
picture here, but you

00:34:26.699 --> 00:34:28.320
know I talked about him before.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.409
If I tell him one little
thing about the guy

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.139
he used to compete
with on the hockey

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:36.615
team-- Jim was a
semi-professional hockey player

00:34:36.615 --> 00:34:38.865
and had some injury or
something in the minor leagues,

00:34:38.865 --> 00:34:40.199
if I'm telling that right.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.590
But anyway, his arch
enemy on the other team

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:43.540
was a guy named Luke.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.310
What do you think happened?

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:45.990
Luke's from Maine,
Jim's from Maine.

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:47.690
Luke went into the
lobster business.

00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:50.219
All I have to do to
double sales is say, hey,

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:53.060
did you hear Luke opened
another restaurant?

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:54.570
Talk about competitive spirit.

00:34:54.570 --> 00:34:55.949
He's ready to kill.

00:34:55.949 --> 00:34:57.250
He doesn't stop working.

00:34:57.250 --> 00:35:00.490
He hates the idea that somebody
might beat him at a game.

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:03.400
It's his DNA, and his partner,
Sabin, is the same way.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.530
All I have to do is
tell Grace and Lace,

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.980
who makes beautiful lacy
socks and shawls, and my most

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:12.659
successful business by far,
in terms of making money.

00:35:12.659 --> 00:35:14.450
And what do I have to
do to get them going?

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:15.220
Hardly anything.

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:18.250
All I have to do is say, God,
got a big check from Cousins

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.366
today.

00:35:19.366 --> 00:35:22.940
Do you know, I'll get a check
from her within the week?

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:23.860
A bigger check.

00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:25.230
They're winning.

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:26.380
We're more successful.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:26.600
Why?

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.090
I didn't say compete was my--
that's the way they're wired.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:29.750
Competitive.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:31.208
You get an entrepreneur
who doesn't

00:35:31.208 --> 00:35:33.310
feel the heat of
competition, he's not

00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:35.280
going to be good on his feet.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.280
She's not going to come to the
fore when she really needs it.

00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.770
That competitive
spirit drives you

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:41.240
through all the
things that don't

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.107
make any commonsense in life.

00:35:43.107 --> 00:35:43.940
That's what it does.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:44.290
OK?

00:35:44.290 --> 00:35:46.355
There are my entrepreneurs
in my house in Utah,

00:35:46.355 --> 00:35:47.480
that we just did an update.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.540
I don't know if you saw.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.310
Let me tell you, the
great thing that I

00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:51.950
find about working
with these people

00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:54.610
is it's a repeat of what I
did at the Corcoran Group.

00:35:54.610 --> 00:35:55.810
I hired people.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:57.060
I developed talent.

00:35:57.060 --> 00:35:58.480
I love my people to death.

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.710
I spoil them rotten.

00:35:59.710 --> 00:36:01.900
I try to make them
the best they can be,

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.940
and I enjoy every
single second of it.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.810
My greatest satisfaction working
with these entrepreneurs,

00:36:08.810 --> 00:36:09.853
the good ones.

00:36:09.853 --> 00:36:12.570
[LAUGHS] Not the bad ones that
take your money in the night.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.510
OK?

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.720
The good ones, is they're my
sales people all over again.

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.440
They are phenomenally
successful.

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.110
Now, what are the
sharks really like,

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:22.810
with three minutes
and 44 seconds left?

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:24.406
I could tell I'm
talking too much.

00:36:24.406 --> 00:36:25.530
I'll give you the low down.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:26.660
OK?

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:28.340
What's Kevin O'Leary like?

00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:28.930
OK.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:30.330
Everybody thinks
he's a mean guy.

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:31.640
He's the pushover of the show.

00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.300
In real life, he's a pushover.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.960
When his wife
walks onto the set,

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:38.110
you could visibly see
him shaking on his knees.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.540
I'm not making that up.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:40.500
OK?

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:43.300
He fancies himself a
very big connoisseur,

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.750
and doesn't have
the common sense

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:50.390
to know the label O'Leary Wines
is not a good fit for wine.

00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.890
All right.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:51.540
Whatever.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.450
OK?

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.420
Kevin's game for
anything on the show.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.570
He'll pose.

00:36:55.570 --> 00:36:57.320
He'll do anything.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.172
We have more weird
pictures of Kevin.

00:36:59.172 --> 00:37:00.505
But he's an absolute sweetheart.

00:37:04.609 --> 00:37:06.900
I'm only going to tell you
the first half of the story.

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:09.220
You can use your
imagination on the second.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:12.290
Kevin is never ready to leave
the set at the end of a long 10

00:37:12.290 --> 00:37:12.790
hour day.

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:14.080
And it's a long day, trust me.

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.820
It's like being in a army pit
all day with a bunch of people.

00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:21.660
So to get him to change and
come, I ripped his pants down.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:24.810
I saw what was behind and
used imagination on the front.

00:37:24.810 --> 00:37:27.580
It wasn't much.

00:37:27.580 --> 00:37:29.550
What's Robert
Herjavec really like?

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.435
He definitely is gay
and should come out.

00:37:33.435 --> 00:37:36.290
[LAUGHS]

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:37.545
I constantly tell him.

00:37:37.545 --> 00:37:39.810
But what's great
about Robert is he's

00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:42.050
a show and a half
within the show.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:43.530
We all go out there.

00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:44.390
Bring two dresses.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:45.510
You have to wear
the same clothes.

00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:46.687
Bring two identical dresses.

00:37:46.687 --> 00:37:48.270
I fell for that the
first three years,

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:49.490
until I realized I
was paying for them.

00:37:49.490 --> 00:37:51.420
No, I'm bringing one dress,
and let's hope it lasts.

00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:52.050
OK?

00:37:52.050 --> 00:37:56.382
Robert brings racks of 50
suits, 50 shirts, 50 cuff links,

00:37:56.382 --> 00:37:57.340
different colored ties.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:59.000
And then you've got to
do the Robert ritual

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.166
on the first day of filming.

00:38:00.166 --> 00:38:02.130
Do you like this tie?

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:02.710
The shirt?

00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:04.168
What do you think
about this shirt?

00:38:04.168 --> 00:38:06.752
This-- just put on the
fucking shirt, Robert!

00:38:06.752 --> 00:38:09.220
[LAUGHS] Robert,
please come out.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:12.280
You'd be such a happy man.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.369
He's always kissing men.

00:38:13.369 --> 00:38:14.660
I've never seen him kiss women.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:22.210
I put that in simply
because I look young.

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:25.920
I put that in because I thought
I looked better than Lori.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.420
Oh, yeah.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.740
What's Lori like?

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:31.140
Lori is all about hair.

00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.380
It's unfair.

00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:36.120
I get one minute on my hair,
and Lori gets two hours.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.980
Lori is about her hair.

00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:39.620
All the time, her hair.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.030
Her hair.

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.860
Let it go, Lori.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.310
But to Lori's
great credit, she's

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:47.090
the best merchandiser
on the whole set.

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:48.920
She gets a product
that she likes,

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:50.430
she's going to slam it home.

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:51.556
She's a gorilla.

00:38:51.556 --> 00:38:52.930
I can't compete
with her in that.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.471
None of the men can
compete with her.

00:38:54.471 --> 00:38:55.620
She's phenomenal.

00:38:55.620 --> 00:38:57.550
And she has our single
best success to date,

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.230
in terms of quick money.

00:38:59.230 --> 00:39:00.980
I'll win on the long-term
money, but she's

00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:02.210
winning on the quick money.

00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:03.070
Scrub daddy.

00:39:03.070 --> 00:39:03.570
Damon.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:04.850
Damon's hysterical.

00:39:04.850 --> 00:39:07.036
It's a shame they edit all
of Damon's comments out,

00:39:07.036 --> 00:39:08.660
because it would be
a much better show.

00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:09.245
He's filthy.

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.729
But he comes across rather
staid on the show, I think.

00:39:15.729 --> 00:39:17.020
And I'm like, that's not Damon.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.394
They edit all the
good stuff out.

00:39:18.394 --> 00:39:19.760
He is a chick magnet.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:21.500
You walk into any
place with Damon,

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:23.690
500 women are surrounding him.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:25.460
I almost get stampeded.

00:39:25.460 --> 00:39:27.060
There's something about him.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.160
I think it's the way
he uses his hands.

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.160
Because I get turned
on by that a lot.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.720
He's such a smoochy.

00:39:33.720 --> 00:39:36.600
I airbrushed my face, there.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.940
What's Mark Cuban like?

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.090
He's filthy rich.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:40.500
That's what's wrong with him.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:42.291
I've learned that
there's a huge difference

00:39:42.291 --> 00:39:44.130
between a millionaire
and a billionaire.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:44.630
OK?

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:46.560
He basically does it for sport.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.370
Mark, I'll be in
the makeup chair.

00:39:48.370 --> 00:39:50.480
The next morning, Mark,
I can't believe you

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.580
plunked down a million
dollars on that guy

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:54.577
and gave him a $400,000 salary.

00:39:54.577 --> 00:39:56.910
He says, you know, I've got
to keep the guys busy, Barb.

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:04.130
He gets grumpy.

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:05.630
You've got to
loosen this guy up.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.130
OK?

00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:09.130
But he's the smartest shark, in
my opinion, across many levels.

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.310
I think he's got such a
wide range of smartness

00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:12.445
in so many areas.

00:40:12.445 --> 00:40:14.820
And when he's wrong, he's
smart enough never to admit it.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:17.990
I've lost my most money
with Mark. [LAUGHS]

00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.560
OK.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.900
Behind the scenes
at "Shark Tank."

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:20.650
I'll just click through them.

00:40:20.650 --> 00:40:22.160
We get famous people on the set.

00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:22.810
It's a blast.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.050
They make us wear
all kinds of crap.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.550
OK.

00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:26.185
Oh, this is automatic.

00:40:26.185 --> 00:40:27.130
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:28.110
OK.

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:29.790
You go stir crazy on the set.

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:31.103
One pitch looks like another.

00:40:31.103 --> 00:40:31.602
OK?

00:40:31.602 --> 00:40:33.410
All right.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:34.960
They got props galore.

00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:35.780
OK.

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:36.400
On and on.

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.090
They married Kevin
and I twice now.

00:40:38.090 --> 00:40:39.640
It's ridiculous.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.020
Kevin loves stuff on his face.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.320
Anything, he'll wear it.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:43.990
There's Damon.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.820
I think that's a repeat.

00:40:44.820 --> 00:40:45.380
Right?

00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:45.580
OK.

00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:46.480
Dusting his head.

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:49.220
How many times a day does his
hair get dusted with powder?

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:50.150
Mr. Wonderful?

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:50.970
500.

00:40:50.970 --> 00:40:52.150
OK.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:53.440
People love to imitate him.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.110
Damon, that was an outfit,
they said to David,

00:40:55.110 --> 00:40:56.010
you can't wear that.

00:40:56.010 --> 00:40:56.150
Oh, no.

00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:57.090
You can't wear that.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:57.880
He goes, too what?

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.300
Too way out on his clothes.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.210
OK?

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:00.710
All right.

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:01.930
Side benefits.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.280
You get preferential treatment.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.480
Now I get the best tables.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.950
My assistant Gail calls.

00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:08.210
We always get a table,
even if they're full.

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:10.194
Guys I, gave my doll
to this rock star.

00:41:10.194 --> 00:41:11.360
I still don't know his name.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.235
And he took her home.

00:41:12.235 --> 00:41:13.530
He's been sleeping with her.

00:41:13.530 --> 00:41:15.220
That gives me a thrill.

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.470
That's the executive producer.

00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.110
That's his child that
was born in year one.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:18.910
He's now a six-year-old.

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:20.970
That guy with the fur is
the most important guy,

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:22.800
because he's in
charge of lighting.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.260
I'm either going to look
good or bad, based on him.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.190
These are updates.

00:41:26.190 --> 00:41:27.690
They are thrilling,
to do updates.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:31.540
They are even more exciting to
do the opening shots, the power

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:32.720
shots, with The Jets.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.770
It's like, wow, I'm
somebody cool, man.

00:41:34.770 --> 00:41:35.790
I'm cool.

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:38.680
Red carpets, people
flashing at you.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.230
Oh yeah, I'm cool.

00:41:40.230 --> 00:41:40.730
I'm cool.

00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.230
And all that kind of stuff.

00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:45.250
Shooting the updates with the
entrepreneurs is fabulous.

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:46.430
That's at my beach house.

00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:49.734
We did an update there
before we did the ski one.

00:41:49.734 --> 00:41:50.900
Shooting and running around.

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.370
There is my youngest
entrepreneur.

00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:54.470
He was only eight, now he's 12.

00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:56.600
I send my doll around--
you saw that doll--

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:57.620
when I can't show up.

00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.390
That's my pig guy.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:41:59.160
Now he's married.

00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.520
That's a big pig.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.770
Pig, pig, pig, pig.

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:03.390
OK, it gets even-- those guys!

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:06.120
A double kiss!

00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.400
Daisy Cakes.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.940
Grace and Lace, Grace
and Lace, Grace and Lace.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:12.720
Opening orphanages in India,
two of them in their first year,

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:14.094
they were making
that much money.

00:42:14.094 --> 00:42:15.510
And there's my team.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:17.800
And in answer to
the final question,

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:18.920
do we like each other?

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:19.550
Yes.

00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:21.780
When you have to spend that
much time with somebody,

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:23.670
you're going to wind up
either hating or liking them,

00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:25.910
and we really like each
other and respect each other.

00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:26.770
And that's it.

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.570
And I went over 40 seconds.

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:29.538
Thank you.

00:42:29.538 --> 00:42:30.974
Thank you.

00:42:30.974 --> 00:42:31.474
Good.

00:42:36.314 --> 00:42:38.734
Thank you very much.

00:42:38.734 --> 00:42:43.764
The good news is we only
have to take 40 seconds

00:42:43.764 --> 00:42:44.930
off the question and answer.

00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:46.460
So what questions do you have?

00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.940
Anything?

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.230
And the bravest person always
raises their hand first.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.910
This guy?

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:51.830
Oh, you're popping up.

00:42:51.830 --> 00:42:54.350
Is that how you dress
for work, by the way?

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:55.230
AUDIENCE: Huh?

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.650
BARBARA CORCORAN: No,
I'm-- no, I don't mind.

00:42:56.650 --> 00:42:57.810
I'm just curious, really.

00:42:57.810 --> 00:42:58.910
Is that the work thing?

00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.160
AUDIENCE: I think this is
even below Google standards,

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.360
but uh-- [LAUGHS]

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.000
BARBARA CORCORAN: I
would agree with that,

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.208
and I don't even know Google.

00:43:04.208 --> 00:43:06.825
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS] I just
want to say-- so first of all,

00:43:06.825 --> 00:43:07.659
that was phenomenal.

00:43:07.659 --> 00:43:09.491
That was an amazing
presentation, especially

00:43:09.491 --> 00:43:10.210
the entrance.

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:12.669
I think that was like the best
entrance that anyone's made.

00:43:12.669 --> 00:43:14.251
BARBARA CORCORAN:
Are you a schmoozer?

00:43:14.251 --> 00:43:15.470
AUDIENCE: No, it was good.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:16.290
I intended it like it is.

00:43:16.290 --> 00:43:16.900
BARBARA CORCORAN:
Oh, yes you are.

00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:17.475
AUDIENCE: I'm telling you.

00:43:17.475 --> 00:43:19.600
If it sucked, if it
sucked, I would tell you.

00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:19.720
BARBARA CORCORAN: Yeah?

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.200
You know what?

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.616
I predict you're going to be
the head of this organization

00:43:22.616 --> 00:43:25.250
by kissing ass.

00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:27.320
AUDIENCE: Maybe
if I dress better.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.050
But I was wondering,
I see the show.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:30.670
I've seen it.

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:31.980
My parents love it.

00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:33.940
I notice a lot of
stuff gets edited out.

00:43:33.940 --> 00:43:34.720
BARBARA CORCORAN:
Your parents love it?

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.452
Did I hear that?

00:43:35.452 --> 00:43:36.600
AUDIENCE: They're--

00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:37.070
BARBARA CORCORAN: Thank you.

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:38.861
AUDIENCE: They're so
excited that I'm here.

00:43:38.861 --> 00:43:40.894
It's kind of funny.

00:43:40.894 --> 00:43:42.286
[LAUGHS]

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.530
I noticed that a lot of
stuff gets edited out,

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:48.120
or like there are
a lot of jumps.

00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.050
And I'm wondering,
what gets edited out?

00:43:51.050 --> 00:43:52.832
Do they actually tell you more?

00:43:52.832 --> 00:43:54.540
I mean, they must tell
you more than what

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:55.844
they show the viewers.

00:43:55.844 --> 00:43:57.260
You don't just
make a decision off

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.522
of, oh, hey, three minutes of--

00:43:59.522 --> 00:44:00.730
BARBARA CORCORAN: Yes and no.

00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:01.230
All right?

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.170
The reality is is
a typical pitch

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:05.270
is 45 minutes to
an hour and a half.

00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:08.030
When you're seeing it at
home, it's six minutes.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.950
A good editor tries to
eliminate those jumps.

00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:12.950
Very, very hard to do.

00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:14.590
We know nothing about
the entrepreneur

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:18.260
when they walk through that fake
tunnel with the fake sharks.

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.040
We know nothing.

00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.540
All right?

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:21.460
And we are expected
to make a deal

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.230
on the set with very
little knowledge

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:25.150
other than what they represent.

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:27.570
But what the
entrepreneur is also

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:29.830
made to do prior to
appearing on "Shark Tank"

00:44:29.830 --> 00:44:32.180
is to sign extensive
documents saying

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:35.800
that they know it's not a real
deal if we choose not to close.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.312
Roughly, I'd say 65%
of the deals close.

00:44:38.312 --> 00:44:40.562
I really don't know that as
a fact, but my sense of it

00:44:40.562 --> 00:44:41.882
is close, I'm sure.

00:44:41.882 --> 00:44:43.090
And I know that's true of me.

00:44:43.090 --> 00:44:45.760
I close about 60% of what
you'll see me-- I'm in.

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.697
You know?

00:44:46.697 --> 00:44:48.905
Because things go awry when
you do the due diligence.

00:44:48.905 --> 00:44:51.380
Some of the people lie,
but they're under pressure.

00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.191
It's TV.

00:44:52.191 --> 00:44:54.190
It's not like-- these
aren't professional actors

00:44:54.190 --> 00:44:55.070
and actresses.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:59.110
And the patent that they
definitely have really

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:00.770
is owned by the brother-in-law.

00:45:00.770 --> 00:45:02.510
Things go a little
loosey goosey.

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:03.270
OK?

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:05.850
And so they edit a lot out.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.430
But also, and on to that,
it's owned by Disney World.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.105
Disney is the parent company,
and they want it clean.

00:45:12.105 --> 00:45:13.480
And what's your
name, because you

00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.020
should be ashamed of yourself.

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.790
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS] I don't
know if I should say.

00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:18.600
I'm Nader.

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:19.220
BARBARA CORCORAN:
What's your name?

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.280
AUDIENCE: N-A-D-E-R.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.180
BARBARA CORCORAN: And
what's your last name?

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:21.971
I want to remember.

00:45:21.971 --> 00:45:23.805
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS] It's
Al-Naji, hyphenated.

00:45:23.805 --> 00:45:24.679
BARBARA CORCORAN: Ah.

00:45:24.679 --> 00:45:25.500
OK Al.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:28.710
Watch yourself.

00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:31.170
OK.

00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:31.950
Who else?

00:45:31.950 --> 00:45:33.732
It's hard to see with
the lights, so wave

00:45:33.732 --> 00:45:34.523
if you've got-- oh.

00:45:34.523 --> 00:45:35.772
Oh, you're doing a line thing.

00:45:35.772 --> 00:45:37.790
Organized.

00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:38.550
OK.

00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.014
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name
is Kate Kurvitsky.

00:45:41.014 --> 00:45:41.930
It's nice to meet you.

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:43.330
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:45:43.330 --> 00:45:45.080
So my question is less
about "Shark Tank,"

00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.477
while I do love the show.

00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:48.810
But my boyfriend is trying
to break into the real estate

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:51.140
industry in New York, and
he's finding it a little bit

00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:51.890
challenging.

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:53.050
So I just wanted
to know what advice

00:45:53.050 --> 00:45:54.735
you would have for somebody
who's trying to start off.

00:45:54.735 --> 00:45:55.010
BARBARA CORCORAN: Yeah.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.890
Well, the first
thing you should do

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:57.860
is go and work for
a top salesperson.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:58.749
Best way to go in it.

00:45:58.749 --> 00:46:00.165
The easiest job
to get in New York

00:46:00.165 --> 00:46:01.581
if you want to go
into real estate

00:46:01.581 --> 00:46:03.180
is to go to a rental company.

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:05.700
It's like the bottom
feeders, right there.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.322
It's terrible.

00:46:06.322 --> 00:46:07.780
But you know what's
great about it?

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:10.510
And I ran a rental company
for seven years before I--

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.622
eight years, before I went
into sales, thank God.

00:46:12.622 --> 00:46:14.080
And you know what's
great about it?

00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.290
You get a hundred times at bat.

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.284
In other words, you
answer 50 calls.

00:46:18.284 --> 00:46:19.450
Is that apartment available?

00:46:19.450 --> 00:46:20.500
Is that apartment available?

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:21.750
Different when you're selling.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:22.790
It's a slow motion.

00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:24.270
So you get a lot of practice in.

00:46:24.270 --> 00:46:26.420
If you could work
as a free slave,

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.960
even, for a licensed
top sales person,

00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.816
just sitting next to them and
being their slave or servant,

00:46:32.816 --> 00:46:34.190
you're going to
learn everything.

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:35.910
You can't learn in a
real estate school.

00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:37.743
You've got to be on the
street and learn it.

00:46:37.743 --> 00:46:39.790
And so that's the
most important thing.

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:42.130
And if you need an introduction,
just give me the card.

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:43.900
I'll pretend I know
your boyfriend.

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:45.995
Is he anything like you?

00:46:45.995 --> 00:46:46.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.100
I'm a little--

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:47.390
BARBARA CORCORAN: You sure?

00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:49.572
Because obviously--
wait, what did you say?

00:46:49.572 --> 00:46:52.113
AUDIENCE: I said, I'm a little
better, but he's pretty great.

00:46:52.113 --> 00:46:54.575
He's got charisma. [LAUGHS]

00:46:54.575 --> 00:46:56.200
BARBARA CORCORAN:
Well, I'll definitely

00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:58.195
introduce some of my
recommendation to you.

00:46:58.195 --> 00:47:02.935
If you're feeling that way right
now, do not marry this man.

00:47:02.935 --> 00:47:04.899
AUDIENCE: We won't
tell him that.

00:47:04.899 --> 00:47:05.881
Thank you.

00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:07.354
BARBARA CORCORAN: OK.

00:47:07.354 --> 00:47:09.880
All right. [LAUGHING] Yes.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:10.380
Hello.

00:47:10.380 --> 00:47:10.655
I'm sorry.

00:47:10.655 --> 00:47:11.430
I didn't see that mike.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:12.350
AUDIENCE: Hi, how are you?

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:12.700
Thank you so much--

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.180
BARBARA CORCORAN: The
lady in the pretty dress.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.180
I met you earlier.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:14.310
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:15.050
Thank you.

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:16.820
You inspire me.

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.530
So my question is
when you-- also

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.400
having to do with your career--
when you started real estate,

00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.280
I mean, the sales
aspect was always

00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:26.920
sexy and fun and interesting,
but it was really

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:30.300
dominated by men who were
power brokers in suits.

00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:33.160
And if I understand
correctly, and it

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:38.290
wasn't an industry that was
for sparkling, bubbly women who

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.815
have big personalities.

00:47:39.815 --> 00:47:42.480
So I'm an attorney,
which is not known

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.552
for having big
personalities or engaging--

00:47:44.552 --> 00:47:46.010
BARBARA CORCORAN:
Only the ones who

00:47:46.010 --> 00:47:47.389
made the wrong career decision.

00:47:47.389 --> 00:47:48.055
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:47:48.055 --> 00:47:48.495
Well, no.

00:47:48.495 --> 00:47:49.980
I mean, there are
some good-- there--

00:47:49.980 --> 00:47:51.305
I'm not vouching for attorneys.

00:47:51.305 --> 00:47:52.830
I hate them, honestly.

00:47:52.830 --> 00:47:56.500
But how do you balance being
taken-- in the beginning,

00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:01.160
we're balancing being able to be
in front of titans of industry

00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.530
and being taken seriously
in front of them,

00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:05.110
but also being
true to who you are

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:06.950
and letting people
see your personality.

00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:07.970
BARBARA CORCORAN: You
know, the one great thing

00:48:07.970 --> 00:48:09.940
about getting older,
other than you fall apart,

00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:12.619
which is really
sickening and horrific.

00:48:12.619 --> 00:48:13.160
It really is.

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.659
You find something new every
day you don't like, physically,

00:48:15.659 --> 00:48:18.880
about yourself, especially if
you tend to be self-critical,

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:22.200
and 99% of women out
there are, and 99% of men

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.950
don't even have that
gene from what I see.

00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:24.780
OK?

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.130
But here we go.

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:31.140
I think it is essential
to almost be ignorant.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.710
You know what I mean?

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.820
I never felt like a
woman in a man's field.

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.460
And by the way, when I
started, all the companies

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:38.522
were owned by men.

00:48:38.522 --> 00:48:40.980
They weren't owned by women,
but they were worked by women.

00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:43.070
The bosses were men,
the women showed

00:48:43.070 --> 00:48:46.700
the apartments, and the
general cut of a woman who

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:49.590
showed the "apartments for
sale" on Park and Fifth,

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:51.840
remember it was a
limited high end market.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:52.770
That was it.

00:48:52.770 --> 00:48:55.570
You didn't have Third,
Second, Tribeca, The Village.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:56.880
You didn't have that.

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:59.870
That was a vibrant sale market.

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:02.510
You had narrow corridors
on the east and west side,

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:03.740
and they were society women.

00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.880
If you knew the right
people, you could sell them.

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:09.380
That wasn't me, and it was
a huge disadvantage to me.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.410
That was the disadvantage,
my upbringing

00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:14.010
and my lack of
connections, more than

00:49:14.010 --> 00:49:16.140
I was a female, they
were men, da-da-da.

00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:19.390
But it was a huge advantage
to me to start hiring women.

00:49:19.390 --> 00:49:22.140
I had, probably, in
my firm, my guess

00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:25.690
is 75 women, before any man
ever wanted to work for me.

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:28.240
I interviewed men, but they'd
walk in, see a pool of women,

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:31.746
and they were in and
out, until Ralph Kruger

00:49:31.746 --> 00:49:33.370
showed up and said,
I have a pushy wife

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:34.380
and two pushy daughters.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:35.840
I love it here.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.080
And so I sat him
right in the front,

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.650
so a man could walk
in and see a man.

00:49:40.650 --> 00:49:41.590
That kind of thing.

00:49:41.590 --> 00:49:46.710
But I think it's very important
to almost be dumb and to-- oh,

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:48.430
I forgot where I was going.

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:50.900
The upside, when you're
getting much older,

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.850
and I've gotten stronger and
stronger in this way as I--

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:55.050
by the year, by the minute.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.330
And I wish I knew it earlier.

00:49:57.330 --> 00:49:58.760
Is to be yourself.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:01.035
Because people--
even if you're weird.

00:50:01.035 --> 00:50:04.740
A weirdo is often the most
loved person in a team.

00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.050
I think if you could
be yourself in all

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:10.900
that it is, what typically
happens is people like you,

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:14.050
because they can sense
[SNIFFS] it's the real deal.

00:50:14.050 --> 00:50:16.595
It's the airs, the phoniness,
the trying to impress,

00:50:16.595 --> 00:50:18.650
the insecurity, all
the stuff that we all

00:50:18.650 --> 00:50:21.840
strive so hard for when we're
young that gets in the way.

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:23.770
There was actually
a two year period

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.590
where I had my hair
poofed up and didn't

00:50:25.590 --> 00:50:28.655
wash all week to try to fit
in with the society ladies.

00:50:28.655 --> 00:50:30.325
But my scalp itched like crazy.

00:50:30.325 --> 00:50:31.700
I had to get rid
of that haircut.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:34.110
You know, a poof
thing once a week.

00:50:34.110 --> 00:50:35.364
Hello.

00:50:35.364 --> 00:50:36.322
AUDIENCE: The bouffant.

00:50:36.322 --> 00:50:37.220
BARBARA CORCORAN: All right?

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:37.719
Yeah.

00:50:37.719 --> 00:50:39.950
And the only time my
business ever fell behind

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:42.710
was when I was so busy
watching my competition.

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:43.770
I analyzed everything.

00:50:43.770 --> 00:50:46.200
I had the listings on
a chart by category,

00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:48.260
by size, who had what,
who was my [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:48.890
Da-da-da.

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:51.070
I was a genius at my field.

00:50:51.070 --> 00:50:52.885
It was the only year
in my whole career

00:50:52.885 --> 00:50:54.530
I never pushed the
business ahead.

00:50:54.530 --> 00:50:57.379
I was so busy watching the
next guy, I wasn't watching me.

00:50:57.379 --> 00:50:58.920
So being yourself,
I would say, would

00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.086
be the most important thing.

00:51:00.086 --> 00:51:01.960
And forget about the
female/male thing.

00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.020
I'm not saying
it's not important

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:03.860
in certain industries.

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:05.630
Certainly if you're an
attorney, investment banker.

00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:06.530
It's such a man's world.

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:08.196
There's a lot of man's
worlds out there.

00:51:08.196 --> 00:51:11.100
But entrepreneurship is
a level playing field.

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:12.119
There's no rules.

00:51:12.119 --> 00:51:13.160
And you know what I find?

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.820
And sorry men, to say this,
but I find women can work

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:19.460
in a real-- we're-- never mind.

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.012
They work harder.

00:51:21.012 --> 00:51:22.350
They work harder.

00:51:22.350 --> 00:51:23.480
They just work harder.

00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.276
You know?

00:51:24.276 --> 00:51:26.400
And maybe that's driven a
little bit by insecurity.

00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.660
But for whatever it's
worth, that's my two cents.

00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:29.300
Your question.

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:29.970
Sorry I was so long-winded.

00:51:29.970 --> 00:51:30.410
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:31.190
BARBARA CORCORAN:
Good question, though.

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.610
Yeah.

00:51:31.610 --> 00:51:32.526
AUDIENCE: Hi, Barbara.

00:51:32.526 --> 00:51:35.140
My name is Francine, and I
finally had a big family.

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.090
We have five kids,
and you have 10.

00:51:37.090 --> 00:51:37.590
Which is--

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:37.656
BARBARA CORCORAN: Yeah.

00:51:37.656 --> 00:51:38.100
I didn't have them.

00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:38.940
My mother had them.

00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:39.595
AUDIENCE: Yeah, your
mother had them.

00:51:39.595 --> 00:51:39.920
BARBARA CORCORAN: OK.

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:40.731
I have two.

00:51:40.731 --> 00:51:41.230
Yeah.

00:51:41.230 --> 00:51:41.670
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:51:41.670 --> 00:51:43.250
Thank you for being
your authentic self.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.499
I think your story was really
motivating and inspiring

00:51:45.499 --> 00:51:46.600
for all of us.

00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:49.830
So my question for you is you
speak to so many businesses.

00:51:49.830 --> 00:51:52.010
Once you do you
bring them on, what

00:51:52.010 --> 00:51:53.940
are the top questions
these businesses ask

00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.530
to be fast growth,
high profit business,

00:51:56.530 --> 00:51:57.697
and how do you address them?

00:51:57.697 --> 00:51:59.363
BARBARA CORCORAN:
What are the questions

00:51:59.363 --> 00:52:00.570
the small businesses ask me?

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:02.980
You mean my entrepreneurs
that I am in partnership with?

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:03.805
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:03.805 --> 00:52:05.430
BARBARA CORCORAN:
You know, it's funny.

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:08.294
Everybody has different
questions, OK?

00:52:08.294 --> 00:52:09.710
I never really
thought about that.

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:10.376
It's a good one.

00:52:10.376 --> 00:52:11.290
Are there categories?

00:52:11.290 --> 00:52:13.498
Because I think of them as
all individual businesses.

00:52:13.498 --> 00:52:14.190
You know what?

00:52:14.190 --> 00:52:16.020
I don't think I'm aware
of what questions,

00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:18.760
because I have my own agenda.

00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.650
My agenda, when I'm
getting together

00:52:20.650 --> 00:52:22.799
on Skype calls,
emails, whatever,

00:52:22.799 --> 00:52:24.340
is how do I push
this business ahead?

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.170
How do I grow it?

00:52:25.170 --> 00:52:26.600
Because the one thing
I know how to do--

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:28.641
I'm not sure I'm good at
anything other than it--

00:52:28.641 --> 00:52:30.770
I know how to take something
small and make it big.

00:52:30.770 --> 00:52:31.269
All right?

00:52:31.269 --> 00:52:32.230
So I'm thinking angles.

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.020
How do we multiply that?

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:33.650
How do we multiply?

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:34.950
Like my mother did the socks.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:36.220
Same kind of thing.

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.340
I'm not de-de-de-de-de.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.730
My brain's going like that.

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:40.770
So the advice that I'm
almost always doing

00:52:40.770 --> 00:52:41.709
is the pushing them.

00:52:41.709 --> 00:52:42.250
Pushing them.

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:42.840
Pushing them.

00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:42.990
Here.

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:43.490
Try it.

00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:44.130
Try it.

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:45.250
And you know what
I've also learned?

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.125
I've learned with all
the good entrepreneurs,

00:52:47.125 --> 00:52:49.700
the really successful ones,
when they ask me for advice,

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.200
oh, we have this
situation, Barbara.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.241
I'd like you ba-ba-ba-ba.

00:52:52.241 --> 00:52:54.990
And I go and give them my
best advice, all valid.

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:56.390
You know what they do?

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:58.860
They do as they please.

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:03.330
My best entrepreneurs listen to
my advice and then don't do it.

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:04.820
And that's an entrepreneur.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:08.070
It's an independent streak, for
the same reason my dad should

00:53:08.070 --> 00:53:09.490
have been an entrepreneur.

00:53:09.490 --> 00:53:11.540
They don't want anybody
telling them what to do,

00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.810
even though they ask.

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:13.310
All right?

00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:15.976
So it's not exactly your answer,
because I'm not sure I have it,

00:53:15.976 --> 00:53:17.310
but that's the best I could do.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:17.976
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:53:17.976 --> 00:53:18.980
BARBARA CORCORAN: OK.

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:19.856
Pleasure.

00:53:19.856 --> 00:53:21.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
is Michael.

00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:22.250
BARBARA CORCORAN: You're
a cool guy with the hands

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:23.750
in your pocket, Michael.

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.660
AUDIENCE: I have a client
meeting after this.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:25.770
BARBARA CORCORAN: Yeah.

00:53:25.770 --> 00:53:28.061
You ought to lend your jacket
to the guy in the shorts.

00:53:30.002 --> 00:53:31.710
AUDIENCE: Just the
jacket, not the pants.

00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:32.584
BARBARA CORCORAN: OK.

00:53:32.584 --> 00:53:34.650
You should give me
your pants, Michael.

00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:36.960
AUDIENCE: If you'd like.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.925
BARBARA CORCORAN:
Don't tease me.

00:53:38.925 --> 00:53:40.350
AUDIENCE: I'm game.

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:41.300
Long time--

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:45.970
BARBARA CORCORAN: [LAUGHS] Don't
disappoint me if we go there.

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:48.485
[LAUGHS] We could
do this all day.

00:53:48.485 --> 00:53:49.250
Go ahead, what's--

00:53:49.250 --> 00:53:50.010
AUDIENCE: We could
do this all day.

00:53:50.010 --> 00:53:51.630
Longtime viewer,
first time caller.

00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:52.570
Big fan of the show.

00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:53.390
BARBARA CORCORAN:
Well, slow down for me.

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:54.170
Say that again?

00:53:54.170 --> 00:53:55.253
AUDIENCE: Longtime viewer.

00:53:55.253 --> 00:53:56.260
First time caller.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:53:57.550
BARBARA CORCORAN: Uh-huh.

00:53:57.550 --> 00:53:59.350
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:53:59.350 --> 00:54:01.150
And in the vein of
being a longtime viewer,

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:03.749
I'm curious why you think
the show is such a success?

00:54:03.749 --> 00:54:05.290
BARBARA CORCORAN:
It had to catch on.

00:54:05.290 --> 00:54:05.710
AUDIENCE: What's that?

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:06.620
BARBARA CORCORAN:
It had to catch on.

00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:08.453
The first couple of
seasons, they constantly

00:54:08.453 --> 00:54:10.540
moved our time slot and
our day of the week.

00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.632
Murder for a show.

00:54:11.632 --> 00:54:13.840
People just find you, oh,
that was a fun show, honey.

00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:15.370
You want to watch it again?

00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:16.600
They don't promote it.

00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:18.580
They were doing no
promotions of the show.

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:21.080
The next week, it landed on a
different day, different time

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:21.600
slot.

00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:22.610
Then they moved it again.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:24.984
Just as we started getting
traction, they kept moving it,

00:54:24.984 --> 00:54:27.030
because we weren't
a successful show.

00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:29.892
And what happens is you've got
to have a trial by fire when

00:54:29.892 --> 00:54:31.100
you're not a successful show.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:32.210
Very few of them survive.

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.593
Very few.

00:54:32.593 --> 00:54:34.176
I think it's like
1% of all shows that

00:54:34.176 --> 00:54:35.370
open ever stay on air.

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:36.360
OK?

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:38.056
And so we were
tenuous those years,

00:54:38.056 --> 00:54:39.430
and that was the
biggest problem.

00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:40.655
And then we got loyal followers.

00:54:40.655 --> 00:54:43.040
You know when I knew the show
was going to be successful?

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:44.160
I remember the day.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:46.300
Some babe, this
lady, weird lady,

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:50.565
followed me into a restroom
at the shuttle building

00:54:50.565 --> 00:54:52.440
near Kennedy airport,
wherever that thing is.

00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:52.960
By LaGuardia.

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.400
You know that shuttle,
Delta shuttle.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:55.524
Couldn't remember the name.

00:54:55.524 --> 00:54:57.315
Followed me and hustled me in.

00:54:57.315 --> 00:54:58.282
In the john.

00:54:58.282 --> 00:54:59.990
I mean, one thing to
walk me to the sink,

00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:02.050
but walking me in the
john is weird, you know?

00:55:02.050 --> 00:55:03.694
And she's like, I
love "Shark Tank!"

00:55:03.694 --> 00:55:04.530
I love "Shark Tank!"

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:07.910
I love "Shark Tank!"

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.080
Now, you're more my type.

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.919
You're a hunk. [LAUGHS]

00:55:11.919 --> 00:55:14.210
AUDIENCE: Well, you're not
going to like me after this.

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.701
BARBARA CORCORAN: OK.

00:55:15.701 --> 00:55:17.700
AUDIENCE: I just want to
preface this by saying,

00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:19.580
you did say you would
answer any question.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:20.200
So--

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:20.790
BARBARA CORCORAN: Oh.

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:21.540
AUDIENCE: One of--

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.331
BARBARA CORCORAN: Your
eyes are twittering.

00:55:23.331 --> 00:55:24.040
You're nervous.

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:24.320
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:24.870
I'm nervous.

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:25.995
BARBARA CORCORAN: Go ahead.

00:55:25.995 --> 00:55:28.500
AUDIENCE: You scare
me a little bit.

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:30.750
So one of my favorite
anecdotes of yours

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:32.340
is your letter to Mark Burnett.

00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:34.510
And I am amazed at
how you handled it.

00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:36.060
I loved reading the text of it.

00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.400
What I'd like to know
is who is the younger

00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.390
blonde you were competing with
for that spot on "Shark Tank"?

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:44.452
BARBARA CORCORAN: Oh,
I can't tell you that.

00:55:44.452 --> 00:55:46.160
AUDIENCE: You said
you'd answer anything.

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:46.950
BARBARA CORCORAN:
I would answer it.

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:49.045
But you know why I
couldn't-- and now I lied.

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:49.920
And I didn't mean to.

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.270
Because I will answer anything.

00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:53.330
But you know why I
can't answer that?

00:55:53.330 --> 00:55:55.910
Because she was
the scorned lover.

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:58.470
And it would feel-- if
it came back to her,

00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:59.589
it wouldn't be right.

00:55:59.589 --> 00:56:02.130
AUDIENCE: So my working theory
that it was Lori, not correct?

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:02.460
BARBARA CORCORAN: No.

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:03.530
Not [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:05.545
But kind of a Lori lookalike.

00:56:05.545 --> 00:56:07.017
Kind of a Lori lookalike, yeah.

00:56:07.017 --> 00:56:07.850
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:56:07.850 --> 00:56:08.290
Thank you.

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:10.540
BARBARA CORCORAN: I'm sorry
I wasn't good for my word,

00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.100
but it would be
too mean -spirited.

00:56:12.100 --> 00:56:13.210
AUDIENCE: No, I'm
just joshing you.

00:56:13.210 --> 00:56:13.810
But thank you very much.

00:56:13.810 --> 00:56:15.226
BARBARA CORCORAN:
But she not only

00:56:15.226 --> 00:56:17.672
had long blond hair, just
like Tina, my old secretary,

00:56:17.672 --> 00:56:18.630
who stole my boyfriend.

00:56:18.630 --> 00:56:19.375
Ironic.

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:19.875
OK?

00:56:19.875 --> 00:56:23.190
She also had huge
you know whats.

00:56:23.190 --> 00:56:25.770
And all I had to do is
do one click online,

00:56:25.770 --> 00:56:27.180
and I got why I was rejected.

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.610
Well, I-- that's
not really fair.

00:56:31.610 --> 00:56:32.970
But I assumed I knew.

00:56:32.970 --> 00:56:34.760
You know what I mean?

00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:37.570
And I knew I had tremendous
liabilities to overcome there.

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:41.660
AUDIENCE: So what if any sharks
do you prefer working with?

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:44.309
BARBARA CORCORAN: I like
working with Mark Cuban.

00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.850
You know why?

00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:47.120
He's got a great
team around him.

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.650
He's quick to decide.

00:56:48.650 --> 00:56:49.980
Bam, bam, thank you ma'am.

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:52.670
He doesn't take a lot of
time on a due diligence.

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:54.340
And he gets down to business.

00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:57.030
And also, he's extremely bright.

00:56:57.030 --> 00:56:57.880
Extremely bright.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.940
In many, many ways he's bright.

00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:00.700
OK?

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:03.190
And something about having
a billionaire, whether it's

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:05.440
right or wrong, put their
money in the business you're

00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:07.580
putting your
millionaire money in

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:11.210
makes you feel like
you are smarter.

00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.860
OK?

00:57:11.860 --> 00:57:12.470
Yeah.

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.970
So--

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:15.190
AUDIENCE: Is there anybody that
you don't like working with?

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:16.148
BARBARA CORCORAN: Yeah.

00:57:16.148 --> 00:57:17.814
Who is this woman?

00:57:17.814 --> 00:57:18.987
OK.

00:57:18.987 --> 00:57:19.570
You know what?

00:57:19.570 --> 00:57:22.200
I've done deals with all
of the entrepreneurs.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:25.330
And I actually like
doing deals myself.

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:26.400
Think about it.

00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:29.330
When you do a deal
with another shark,

00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:31.500
you've got to agree on
terms of the contract.

00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.156
You've got to compare
due diligence.

00:57:33.156 --> 00:57:34.780
You've got emails
going back and forth.

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:36.790
It's hugely inefficient.

00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:39.770
I like to decide, get
it done, and move on.

00:57:39.770 --> 00:57:42.290
Because the only thing we
really have in life is our time.

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:43.610
So anything that's
inefficient, I'm

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:45.080
more of a chip off
of my mother's block.

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.265
Anything that's inefficient,
I don't want to mess with.

00:57:47.265 --> 00:57:49.030
I mean, it's just
na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

00:57:49.030 --> 00:57:50.750
Just move on.

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:52.112
So really, by myself.

00:57:52.112 --> 00:57:53.570
And I've done deals
with everybody,

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:56.188
but I never mind doing
a deal with Mark.

00:57:56.188 --> 00:57:57.124
Yeah.

00:57:57.124 --> 00:57:58.060
OK?

00:57:58.060 --> 00:58:03.862
Although Mark did tell me not to
invest in this phenomenal deal,

00:58:03.862 --> 00:58:05.445
because he knew all
about franchising.

00:58:05.445 --> 00:58:06.640
He really did.

00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:09.440
I didn't invest in it,
who will remain nameless.

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.510
And they were one of the biggest
hits on "Shark Tank," [LAUGHS]

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:15.950
proving that just because
somebody has more money,

00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:17.562
they're not smarter than you.

00:58:17.562 --> 00:58:19.970
[LAUGHS] Yeah.

00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:21.870
Yes.

00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:25.272
Wow, you're like a--
kind of a cowboy type.

00:58:25.272 --> 00:58:27.744
AUDIENCE: Oh. [LAUGHS]
So I have two questions.

00:58:27.744 --> 00:58:28.660
BARBARA CORCORAN: Yes.

00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:30.534
AUDIENCE: I'll start
with one, and maybe I'll

00:58:30.534 --> 00:58:31.570
go to the other one.

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:32.070
So the--

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:33.570
BARBARA CORCORAN:
Oh, what the hell.

00:58:33.570 --> 00:58:34.130
Go for two.

00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:36.770
AUDIENCE: All right. [LAUGHS]
So the first question I had

00:58:36.770 --> 00:58:38.610
has to do with
"Shark Tank" itself.

00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:40.810
So when you're
paying entrepreneurs,

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:43.170
how much does the
actual idea matter?

00:58:43.170 --> 00:58:45.100
Do you care more about
the actual person?

00:58:45.100 --> 00:58:46.230
BARBARA CORCORAN: It
depends what you're after.

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:47.910
For me, it's all
about the people.

00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:51.480
I mean, the idea's got
to have a couple of legs.

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.360
Important to me.

00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.730
It's got to make common
sense, and I've got to picture

00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:57.165
a lot of people buying it.

00:58:57.165 --> 00:58:59.290
If I can't picture a lot
of people buying a nuance.

00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:02.480
A lot of that stuff for
TV is nuance products,

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.360
because it's curious.

00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.985
Oh, I would have
never thought of that.

00:59:04.985 --> 00:59:07.390
It's good for TV, but it's
not good for my pocketbook.

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:09.572
So if I see something
that makes common sense,

00:59:09.572 --> 00:59:10.780
it doesn't have to be unique.

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.330
I mean, pork barrel
barbecue sauce,

00:59:12.330 --> 00:59:15.176
how many sauces are out there?

00:59:15.176 --> 00:59:16.300
I've never even checked it.

00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:17.990
I wouldn't want to, because
I'd feel like a fool putting

00:59:17.990 --> 00:59:18.641
money in it.

00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:19.140
OK?

00:59:19.140 --> 00:59:20.264
But I had something unique.

00:59:20.264 --> 00:59:22.000
I had the guy that
looked the part.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
OK?

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.290
And they were great hustlers.

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:26.920
They're great hustlers.

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:27.760
Smart guys.

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:28.810
Great hustlers.

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:31.360
So for me, I always pick
out the entrepreneurs.

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.260
And the times I
haven't, the times I've

00:59:33.260 --> 00:59:34.740
been swayed to
pick the business,

00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:38.461
because it seems amazing,
I've lost money every time.

00:59:38.461 --> 00:59:40.960
It's always when I just-- and
you know what I do in my head,

00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.920
when I'm sitting there,
when I'm equivocating,

00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.170
which isn't that much like me.

00:59:44.170 --> 00:59:47.235
I'm usually in or out within--
before they open their mouth,

00:59:47.235 --> 00:59:49.735
based on what they look like
and how they act under pressure

00:59:49.735 --> 00:59:51.200
with the camera zooming in.

00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:53.110
How they hold eye con--
I'm already deciding.

00:59:53.110 --> 00:59:54.476
At least I know when I'm out.

00:59:54.476 --> 00:59:55.310
OK?

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:59.784
But I have to say that I
don't know what I was saying.

00:59:59.784 --> 01:00:00.950
What's your second question?

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:02.300
I lost my train of thought.

01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.500
AUDIENCE: My second
question had more

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.083
to do with you were
talking about what

01:00:05.083 --> 01:00:06.230
makes a great entrepreneur.

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.770
So I'm wondering--

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.420
BARBARA CORCORAN: Oh,
always pick-- my conclusion

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:10.586
there is I always pick the
person over the business.

01:00:10.586 --> 01:00:12.540
But your second
question is that?

01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.470
AUDIENCE: Well, my
question is, what do you

01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:18.060
do when you are your
own worst enemy?

01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:19.161
Like when you doubt?

01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:21.035
BARBARA CORCORAN: I have
good advice on that.

01:00:21.035 --> 01:00:21.570
OK?

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:24.089
Because that is the real
enemy in building any business

01:00:24.089 --> 01:00:25.630
or building any
success for yourself.

01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:27.844
I really believe
you are the enemy.

01:00:27.844 --> 01:00:30.010
And you could look and blame
this and this and this,

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:33.742
but how does a guy like
Branson do what he did?

01:00:33.742 --> 01:00:35.700
I mean, how does he do
it and nobody else built

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.560
this giant airline?

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:38.160
How do people do it?

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.100
You know what I think?

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:41.320
I think the battle is
won inside your own head.

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.220
Won or lost inside
your own head.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:47.140
For me, I had a huge
advantage, because I came

01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.380
into the adult world pissed.

01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:49.880
OK?

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:50.830
Not over my parents.

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:52.090
I spoke in glowing terms.

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:53.390
I was happy with them.

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:55.340
But I was such a horrific
student in school

01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:56.550
that the kids made fun of me.

01:00:56.550 --> 01:00:57.216
I couldn't read.

01:00:57.216 --> 01:00:58.899
My idea of hell
on earth was being

01:00:58.899 --> 01:01:00.440
made to read out
loud and have to go,

01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:03.860
[BABBLING NOISES] and
everybody laughing.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:06.242
So when I got out of that
goddamn schoolhouse--

01:01:06.242 --> 01:01:08.420
it was like a
jailhouse for me-- I

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:11.546
came out with vengeance and a
need to prove I wasn't stupid.

01:01:11.546 --> 01:01:14.045
Do you know how that's gotten
me through the thick and thin?

01:01:14.045 --> 01:01:16.380
The insecurity of thinking,
maybe I am stupid.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.200
I still feel that
way on a bad day.

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.650
But as a result of that,
I share this with you,

01:01:20.650 --> 01:01:22.400
if it's helpful to anybody here.

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.510
I learned to develop
a tape of my own,

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.190
because my old tape was this.

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:28.950
I would go into a situation,
not raise my hand.

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:31.414
I mean, me speaking up, even
on "Shark Tank," very hard

01:01:31.414 --> 01:01:31.955
for me to do.

01:01:31.955 --> 01:01:32.730
To be heard.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:34.563
You notice I don't talk
as much, because I'm

01:01:34.563 --> 01:01:37.740
like-- if they showed all the
tapes for an hour and a half,

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:39.040
you'd see me saying, ah!

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:39.630
Mm.

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:40.710
Ah!

01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:42.400
[LAUGHS] All right?

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.820
But what I learned
to do for myself

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.236
is to-- when I start
doing the oh my God,

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:48.360
I shouldn't have come here.

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:49.402
Gosh, they don't like me.

01:01:49.402 --> 01:01:49.901
Oh my God.

01:01:49.901 --> 01:01:51.210
What do I-- all this self talk.

01:01:51.210 --> 01:01:52.670
We all do it, whatever
your thing is.

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:54.003
And it's usually from childhood.

01:01:54.003 --> 01:01:56.542
Some bullshit that went on
there that formed you, right?

01:01:56.542 --> 01:01:58.500
When I start doing that,
now I have a new tape.

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.750
And it's not that new, I've
been doing it now for 30 years.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:01.666
And it goes like this.

01:02:01.666 --> 01:02:04.330
I sit there and I go, hey.

01:02:04.330 --> 01:02:05.020
Wait a minute.

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:09.340
I have just as much right
to be here as that asshole.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:10.579
And then I psych myself up.

01:02:10.579 --> 01:02:11.620
I get really loud inside.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.330
So I say, you know what?

01:02:13.330 --> 01:02:15.616
This don't-- nobody who
says you can't get your hand

01:02:15.616 --> 01:02:16.870
on the money like
everybody else.

01:02:16.870 --> 01:02:18.810
If I have anything in life
that you really want or desire,

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:19.500
go as far as you want.

01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:21.330
I get myself really
steamed up, and then

01:02:21.330 --> 01:02:25.628
I always land in the same
place, which is, well, fuck you.

01:02:25.628 --> 01:02:26.930
And then I raise my hand.

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:27.582
Hey!

01:02:27.582 --> 01:02:29.540
[LAUGHS] OK?

01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:34.150
But that self battle within it
is so important within myself,

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.336
because when I feel like
that Alice in Wonderland

01:02:36.336 --> 01:02:37.460
going down the rabbit hole.

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:40.427
Oh no, whatever
that famous line is.

01:02:40.427 --> 01:02:42.510
Is that I'm shrinking, or
was that "Wizard of Oz,"

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.152
or melting, or whatever
the hell it is.

01:02:44.152 --> 01:02:45.860
But you know, that
feeling of going down.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.196
Ooh, shrinking.

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:48.570
You know, the
minute that starts,

01:02:48.570 --> 01:02:51.190
I'm very good at bringing
that other person

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:52.930
right to the front.

01:02:52.930 --> 01:02:54.824
And I'm going to
prove that I'm smart.

01:02:54.824 --> 01:02:56.240
All the time I've
got to prove it.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.260
It doesn't mean I don't
feel that I'm not sometimes,

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:00.620
but I've really kicked in.

01:03:00.620 --> 01:03:02.710
I'm pretty fast
forward on that now.

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:03.375
That's it.

01:03:03.375 --> 01:03:04.590
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:05.650
BARBARA CORCORAN: And you
know the one little thing

01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:06.740
for the women in the room?

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.670
Sometimes when I'm
in a situation,

01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:12.071
I just say to myself,
what would a man do?

01:03:12.071 --> 01:03:12.820
And you know what?

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:17.030
Men are much more apt to
speak up, demand more, ask

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:19.680
for the bigger raise, blah,
blah, blah, than a woman would.

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:20.510
They really are.

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:22.090
I know, because I've
hired thousands of people,

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.170
fired thousands of people.

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:24.300
I've worked with
thousands of people.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:24.800
I'm old.

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.960
I know this stuff.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:26.620
OK?

01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:28.787
And I will often say to
myself, what would a man do?

01:03:28.787 --> 01:03:30.161
And I'll say,
wait, I'm not going

01:03:30.161 --> 01:03:32.400
to understand the other side
better than I understand

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.620
my side, which is like me.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:34.340
Empathy.

01:03:34.340 --> 01:03:35.129
I understand.

01:03:35.129 --> 01:03:35.670
I understand.

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:36.210
No.

01:03:36.210 --> 01:03:37.600
I got to take care
of me here, too.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.100
Hey.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:39.652
Let me tell you what I want.

01:03:39.652 --> 01:03:40.610
That's what a man says.

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:42.366
Hey, let me tell
you what I want.

01:03:42.366 --> 01:03:43.990
With a woman, it's
like, you know what?

01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:46.200
I was thinking that.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.042
Like, yeah, yeah.

01:03:47.042 --> 01:03:47.833
A little different.

01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:48.332
Yeah.

01:03:48.332 --> 01:03:49.380
Different style.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.580
As long as you get there.

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:52.130
Yes sir, with the
plaid shirt on.

01:03:52.130 --> 01:03:56.076
That is madras, and that was
all the rage when I was 17.

01:03:56.076 --> 01:03:56.952
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

01:03:56.952 --> 01:03:58.780
I did not take a time
machine to come here.

01:03:58.780 --> 01:03:59.384
Hello.

01:03:59.384 --> 01:04:01.300
BARBARA CORCORAN: Does
that bleed, by the way?

01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.076
That madras?

01:04:03.076 --> 01:04:05.200
AUDIENCE: You mean-- I
don't sleep with this, but--

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:05.750
BARBARA CORCORAN: No, no.

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:06.890
We used to wash our madras.

01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:07.940
It would bleed,
and that was cool.

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:08.452
Got it.

01:04:08.452 --> 01:04:09.660
AUDIENCE: This doesn't bleed.

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:10.430
I don't think so.

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.780
Anyway--

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:12.080
BARBARA CORCORAN: You
would know it by now.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.163
AUDIENCE: I guess I would.

01:04:13.163 --> 01:04:16.870
[LAUGHS] My question is more
along the lines of persistence.

01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:21.600
So what's your take on if you're
fighting a battle right now

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.450
and it kind of looks like
you're going to lose,

01:04:24.450 --> 01:04:28.130
but you still have the
impetus to persist.

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.064
What advice do you
have on [INAUDIBLE].

01:04:30.064 --> 01:04:32.730
BARBARA CORCORAN: Well, that's a
hard one, because it depends so

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:35.120
much on your own good judgment.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:35.900
OK?

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:39.589
Most often, it's far better
to play your hand out,

01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:42.130
because you don't want to leave
without the end to the story,

01:04:42.130 --> 01:04:42.615
in my book.

01:04:42.615 --> 01:04:44.370
In other words, you want to
play it out and see if you could

01:04:44.370 --> 01:04:46.260
bring it to the finish line.

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:48.020
That being said,
sometimes you're

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:50.500
hitting your head
against the wall.

01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:52.167
Against a wall that
doesn't believe you,

01:04:52.167 --> 01:04:54.208
is never going to believe
you, and is never going

01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:55.830
to buy in in the first place.

01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:58.940
And then I change the wall,
and I use the same persistence

01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.740
to hit against a different wall.

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:03.150
Very often, a situation
where you're an employee.

01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:06.690
I could have been amazing
as a sales clerk at my job

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:09.190
at Schweitzers department store,
selling those granny gowns.

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:10.220
Oh, you're amazing, Barb.

01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:11.530
You can sell those granny gowns.

01:05:11.530 --> 01:05:13.940
But I was never going to run
Schweitzers department store,

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:14.981
no matter how good I was.

01:05:14.981 --> 01:05:15.986
You know what I mean?

01:05:15.986 --> 01:05:17.360
It was all about
the Schweitzers.

01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.960
[LAUGHS] So I think you
have to push and push

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.650
until your dignity is
whole and you think,

01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:25.960
well, nobody could have
done it any harder.

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:28.730
But I think you also have to
know when you don't have a shot

01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:33.800
and move on and spend your God
given talents on somebody where

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:35.880
it fits or something
where it fits.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.773
Because you can get
stuck without moving on

01:05:37.773 --> 01:05:39.726
if you're too much that way.

01:05:39.726 --> 01:05:43.170
Let me ask you.

01:05:43.170 --> 01:05:45.150
Thank you.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:48.450
Let's have a show of
hands on how many people

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:51.230
love this guy's hair?

01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:54.590
Well, it is nice.

01:05:54.590 --> 01:05:57.260
OK.

01:05:57.260 --> 01:05:59.670
Give us shampoo.

01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:01.470
Thank you.

01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:02.370
Thank you very much.

01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:04.220
Thank you.
