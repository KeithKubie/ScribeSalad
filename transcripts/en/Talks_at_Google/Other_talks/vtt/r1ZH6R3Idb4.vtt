00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.118
SPEAKER: Please welcome to
the stage, Baba Brinkman.

00:00:04.118 --> 00:00:07.046
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.486 --> 00:00:12.902
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.840
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
Straight out of Canada,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.800
not straight out of Compton.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.940
I started rapping, but
not for lack of options.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.450
I was raised by some
real environmentalists.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.000
I lived in the bush and planted
trees with the family biz.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.170
And I ain't talking
about Flatbush.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.480
I'm talking Bush camps in
the Canadian backwoods.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.150
I was born in a
forest in a log cabin,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.840
and still I ended up rapping.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.420
How the hell did that happen?

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.070
Well, the first rap I wrote
was about planting trees,

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.990
and how I did it so
quick that nobody

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.920
could plant as fast as me.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.940
So make sure you live
the lifestyle you're

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.790
repping, because a rhyme is
nothing without fact checking.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.060
Every year of my life
was a new chapter

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.480
on my path to become the
first peer-reviewed rapper.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.850
In college I studied the rhymes
of dead authors-- Shelley,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.630
Byron, Blake, Pope,
Herik, Skelton, Chaucer.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.460
Eliot's "Love Song of
J. Alfred Prufrock,"

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.550
but I was more into the
thug songs of Tupac,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.350
another young rapper
descended from Europeans.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.280
But at 19, you shouldn't
stop you from MC-ing,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.270
like when I say
hip, you say hop.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.250
Hip--

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.230
AUDIENCE: Hop.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.720
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) Yeah, hip--

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.210
AUDIENCE: Hop.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.710
BABA BRINKMAN: Yeah,
when I say hip,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.277
everyone actually says hop.

00:01:29.277 --> 00:01:29.776
Hip--

00:01:29.776 --> 00:01:30.239
AUDIENCE: Hop.

00:01:30.239 --> 00:01:30.702
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING) Hip--

00:01:30.702 --> 00:01:31.165
AUDIENCE: Hop.

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:31.628
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING) Hip--

00:01:31.628 --> 00:01:32.560
AUDIENCE: Hop.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.200
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) Tree hugging

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.530
Canadian, we don't know
what to make of him.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.630
People heard me rapping,
always thought I was an alien.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.960
I had a passion to grab a
mic and control it, ya'll.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.360
I wasn't trying to play
a role, Rachel Dolezal.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.340
I tried gangster rap, but
my heart just wasn't in it.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.420
So I wrote a bunch of rhymes
on some stuff that's academic.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.120
And then I got recruited
by a couple of researchers

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.510
to synthesize their work into
a bunch of my sweet verses.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.530
That's when I really started
to find my groove and chase it.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.020
Pioneering hip hop
science communications.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.530
Aesop, the living legend,
listened to my music and said,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.330
that's the kind of
rap white people

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.660
should be doing-- science rap.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.510
The final frontier,
uncharted territory

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.230
for those who find
themselves here,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.180
because the public is
skeptical of science findings.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.380
And they're equally skeptical
of the fact that I'm rhyming.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.320
In both cases, evidence
is insufficient.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.320
You gotta hit people
emotionally to get them with it.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.090
If reality contradicts
a person's worldview,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.130
it takes persistence for
the message to get through.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.482
Like when I say
confirmation, you say bias.

00:02:35.482 --> 00:02:36.065
Confirmation--

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:36.540
AUDIENCE: Bias.

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.015
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) Confirmation--

00:02:37.015 --> 00:02:37.490
AUDIENCE: Bias.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.965
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) Confirmation--

00:02:37.965 --> 00:02:38.440
AUDIENCE: Bias.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.915
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) Confirmation--

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:39.944
AUDIENCE: Bias.

00:02:39.944 --> 00:02:42.360
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING) Yeah,
that's the sound of hip hop

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.140
for me, ya'll.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.100
But climate change?

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.310
Oh, no topic is more divisive,
except for a Canadian science

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.870
rapper's existence.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.520
So let's begin with an open
mind to both the science

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.600
and to me being dope
with rhyme-- dope enough

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.770
to get you open
off it, dope enough

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.530
to get invited to perform at
the Climate Conference in Paris

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.290
for all the national delegates.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.480
I was there to rap about climate
and capture its relevance,

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.150
because people
find it difficult.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.820
It's so political,
fiscal, and geophysical.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.250
Agreement is pivotal.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.210
John Kerry's in a meeting,
negotiating a treaty.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.430
I'm there like, damn, they must
be desperate if they need me.

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.920
One month after, a major
attack by ISIS, and all they're

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.220
talking about is
the climate crisis.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.220
And how do we get the word out?

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.370
Throw a concert and stick to the
facts, no fossil fuel sponsors.

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.490
I got this.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.870
I'm the man for the job.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.150
And if you want to come along,
then people put your hands up.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.930
The world is full
of the problems that

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.230
are not easy to solve, and this
is how I get people involved.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.064
BABA BRINKMAN: I mean
it is optional really.

00:03:45.064 --> 00:03:46.854
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
But yeah, see it's

00:03:46.854 --> 00:03:49.244
not easy to solve, but this
is how I get people involved.

00:03:49.244 --> 00:03:50.910
BABA BRINKMAN: OK,
here's an easier one.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:51.750
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
If you're with it,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.410
nod your head to the beat.

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:54.960
Climate change is real.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.460
Nod affirmatively.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.140
See, I got you into it.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.480
You participated.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.530
Now whatever I say
next, you're implicated.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.940
So let's see what climate
change communication would

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.440
sound like if rappers were
in charge of the sound bites.

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.940
A'ight.

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:20.279
BABA BRINKMAN: Let's
take it back to Paris.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:24.055
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) Yo, Paris.

00:04:24.055 --> 00:04:26.920
You want a new
definition of hardcore?

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.850
Check out the international
climate report.

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.720
They say the world is getting
warmer, unequivocally.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.770
And the oceans have
increased 30% in acidity.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.290
And 90% of the warming trend
is oceanic and concentrated

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.400
in the Arctic.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.010
Nobody panic, but the level
of greenhouse gases in the air

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.720
is higher now than it's
been in millions of years.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.600
We added more than a trillion
tons of CO2 to the atmosphere,

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.620
and it's going to be centuries
before some of the gases clear.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.190
I'm dropping science,
unvarnished, unbiased,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.970
but I don't blame you if
your instinct is to deny it,

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:01.830
because we evolve to
prioritize immediate threats.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.150
If it bleeds, it leads.

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:04.600
That's what the media says.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:07.870
So let the gangster-esque
rap music paint a picture,

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.540
and I'll hit you with some
evidence-based predictions.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.520
Get ready for wars, famines,
droughts, floods, hurricanes,

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.840
heat waves, murders, thugs,
chaos, refugees, stress,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.610
disease, extinction,
disaster, IPCC.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.560
Hollywood summer blockbusters
can't touch this.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.270
I get my thrills from the
latest reports published

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.410
by the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, formed

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.950
in 1988 to get the
science straight.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.660
Now they dropped the
fifth assessment,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.840
and the data's up to date.

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.040
So allow me to summarize--
bad things on the way.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.840
Higher emission, sea level
rise, dire predictions,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.720
on target for disaster,
movie style predicaments.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.470
In Copenhagen we set a
limit of two degrees,

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.910
but that's still enough
to disintegrate major ice

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:54.490
sheets over the course of
centuries or maybe decades.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.240
Yeah, some of the details
are still up for debate.

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.980
They fluctuate between certain
disaster and likely disaster,

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.320
slow and steady or
higher and faster.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.560
Consensus, it's the
lowest common denominator,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.120
which means it's probably going
to be way worse than the wars,

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.010
famines, droughts,
floods, hurricanes,

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.290
heat waves, murders, thugs,
chaos, refugees, stress,

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.140
disease, extinction,
disaster, IPCC.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.470
So be afraid.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.540
Be very afraid, but we're not
despite what the scenarios say.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.210
And the effect of
talking about it

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.880
is visible yawning and
occasionally changing

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.760
our behavior microscopically.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.750
And even those who
get it tend to get it

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.390
logically but not viscerally,
so we're navigating myopically.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.020
The threat is existential.

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:41.240
It's not environmental.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.480
And your individual
response is inconsequential.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.950
Only coordination
of our whole species

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.950
is going to keep coastal
cities from sinking

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.230
below the deep seas.

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:53.220
And when was the last time a
solution included all of us?

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.150
Geophysics is at the
mercy of geopolitics.

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.110
Climate change communicators
keep it positive.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.810
People need to feel like
they still have options.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.370
And we do have options.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.110
Either we find a
solution or we stick

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.050
with the business as
usual level pollution

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:10.740
and get used to the wars,
famines, droughts, floods,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:15.780
hurricanes, heat waves, murders,
drugs, chaos, refugees, stress,

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.810
disease, extinction,
disasters, IPCC.

00:07:21.388 --> 00:07:24.776
[APPLAUSE]

00:07:28.402 --> 00:07:30.610
BABA BRINKMAN: Welcome to
the History Channel, ladies

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.300
and gentleman.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.040
I'll be your host,
Baba Brinkman.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.460
And this afternoon's
special will

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.310
be on this theory of
climate science discoveries.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:38.685
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) So let's

00:07:38.685 --> 00:07:41.940
take it back 200 years
to the 1800s up in here,

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:46.900
when we only had 290 CO2 parts
per million in the atmosphere.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.590
We had one billion
homosapiens on the planet,

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:51.010
trying to get their groove on.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.010
And soon lots of
them would thanks

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.800
to Industrial Revolution.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.990
Back when the steam engine
had just been invented,

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.100
and nothing was electric except
the spirit of the times--

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:02.780
progress.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.230
And driven by the
scientific method,

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.260
Joseph Fourier was a
Frenchman, a physicist,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:09.330
and a mathematician.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.620
He discovered the fact
that the atmosphere

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.290
acts like a blanket
for heat retention.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.860
The greenhouse effect
first described in 1824.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.780
Visible light from the sun
meets little resistance inbound,

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.212
because the size of the
wavelengths is hella tight.

00:08:23.212 --> 00:08:24.670
But then when it
hits the Earth, it

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:27.610
emits infrared radiation
with longer waves

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.375
and that you're
trapped and bounce back

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:32.520
when they try to escape on
their way back up into space.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.980
And climate deniers today,
from Ted Cruz to Rand Paul

00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:39.490
to Bobby Jindal, might say,
bounce back off of what?

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:41.690
Introducing John Tyndall.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:44.390
In the 1860s
Tyndall investigated

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:47.760
methane and CO2 and water vapor
to see whether any of them

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.540
block infrared radiation,
and they all do.

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:52.820
But methane and water
vapor don't stick around

00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.360
in the atmosphere for long.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.890
It took a Swedish genius
to identify carbon dioxide

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.070
as a regulator,
Svante Arrhenius.

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:02.530
1896 Svante did the math.

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:04.350
If you cut the CO2
levels in half,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:05.760
you'll end up with
a four to five

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.610
degree temperature drop
all across the map.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.980
But if you double it, he
calculated a temperature

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.310
escalation of five
or six degrees,

00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.670
because water vapor increases
with heat radiation.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:17.960
And that feeds back
to increase the heat.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.390
Of course in 1896, CO2
emissions were pretty moderate,

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:24.440
so they thought it would
take a couple thousand

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.560
years to double the
concentration when

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.470
they thought of it.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:29.160
But you've got to
give it to Svante.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.410
He predicted five
or six degrees,

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.100
and that's within the
warming range predicted today

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.040
by the IPCC.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:40.600
Now in 1927, Arrhenius died a
celebrated Swedish civilian.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.530
And three years later the
population of planet Earth

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.210
exceeded 2 billion.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:49.800
In 1938, a British engineer
by the name of Guy Calendar

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.200
discovered a rise
in carbon dioxide

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.440
and also measured a
rise in temperature.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:58.130
In 1958, Roger Revelle
demonstrated that the oceans

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.470
couldn't take care of it.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.360
He said, humans are
now carrying out

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.530
a massive geophysical
experiment.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.390
In 1960, Charles Keeling
did some measurements

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.300
on Mauna Loa of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.560
And every year the
level appeared to go up.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.620
It was rising at a steady rate,
the same rate as emissions

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.570
from us burning oil and coal.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:22.000
Also in 1960, the population
hit 3 billion souls.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.810
Now it's 56 years later.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.655
More than 7 billion of
us are in the same boat,

00:10:26.655 --> 00:10:28.882
all hooked on fossil
fuels like a drug.

00:10:28.882 --> 00:10:30.090
And how are we going to quit?

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:31.420
Just say no.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.170
There's no easy answers.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:35.490
There's just the truth
and its inconvenience,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:37.720
but don't tell me the
science is recent.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.380
The easy answer is [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.400
Look, we've been up on this.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.790
The effect can be
traced back centuries.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:47.030
The question is, how do
we restrict that effect

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.740
to two or less degrees?

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.460
We set a carbon budget.

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.230
We set a cap.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:54.340
And we stay within
the limit, or else we

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:57.620
can expect a catastrophic
greenhouse effect.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:58.998
And that's physics.

00:10:58.998 --> 00:11:02.414
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:08.219 --> 00:11:09.260
BABA BRINKMAN: All right.

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.210
We can't make this
too abstract, so I'm

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.870
going to have to implicate
myself in the climate equation

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.490
as well.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.740
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING) Look.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.140
Forgive me for producing
some emissions of pollution,

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:20.020
but this rhythm and
the music is my living.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.630
When I do it, I get paid.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:24.200
Yeah, it's been a decade
since I've had a day job,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.760
and I did it my way
like Frank Sinatra,

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.190
just kicking up a racket.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:30.622
I could be at a university
teaching classes,

00:11:30.622 --> 00:11:32.080
but this is more
fun than teaching.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:33.290
Look at the people I've reached.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:34.030
I've been around the world.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.580
I fly to Europe for the
weekend, do a gig in California

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:37.980
before I fly to New Zealand.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:39.940
Encyclopedic, Rolling
Stone, pinch me.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.524
I'm dreaming.

00:11:40.524 --> 00:11:41.690
And you can check my status.

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:45.232
Got a US visa, O-1 artist of
extraordinary achievement.

00:11:45.232 --> 00:11:46.440
This is all I've ever wanted.

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.770
People, I'm living the life.

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:51.550
In the past five years,
150 flights, 15 countries,

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.330
40 states and provinces,
and as for carbon emissions,

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:55.880
I'm off the charts with it.

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.070
Fossil fuel is how I got
here, both to entertain you

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:00.092
and in my career.

00:12:00.092 --> 00:12:02.550
If you're earning something,
then you're burning something.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:05.520
Prosperity is driven
by internal combustion.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:08.090
So where my fossil
fuel ballers at?

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:10.193
If you're burning
something, holla back.

00:12:10.193 --> 00:12:13.120
Yeah, where my fossil
fuel ballers at?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:15.030
If you're burning
something, holla back.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.980
BABA BRINKMAN: What?

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.110
Nobody's going to holler
back in this whole room?

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:19.540
This is a Western democracy.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.650
Your carbon footprints
are massive.

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:23.225
If ballers exists, they're you.

00:12:23.225 --> 00:12:24.040
Let's confess.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.624
I'll go first.

00:12:24.624 --> 00:12:26.040
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) I've been

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.780
burning the hydrocarbons at both
ends, burning to make money,

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.020
and burning to spend.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:31.480
And no one tells
me how to dispose

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.570
of my own property,
a globe trotting solo

00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:35.110
artist with total autonomy.

00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:36.030
This is what I am.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.430
Fossil fuel is a part of me.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:40.220
It powers 80% of
the global economy.

00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:42.190
In other words, if
you have some money,

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:43.770
it's got oil stains on it.

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:44.950
Your hands are bloody.

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:47.380
And if you don't believe
me, go ahead and do a study.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.270
Pimping ain't easy.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:49.850
You better ask somebody.

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:51.090
Cooking with gas is pimping.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:52.470
Driving a car is pimping.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:54.060
Energy consumption is pimping.

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.430
Look at how we're living.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:57.370
Gangsta compared to
horse and buggy days.

00:12:57.370 --> 00:13:00.140
Cranking up the air
conditioner on muggy days.

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:02.180
Not freezing to
death in the winter.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.050
If energy consumption
is a sin, I'm a sinner.

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:05.980
Life is good.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.550
It's better than it used to be.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.790
Let the good times roll.

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.280
Fossil fuels are cheap.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.120
That's how we stay hella major.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.810
Prosperity is the
bomb, player hater.

00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:17.430
So where my fossil
fuel ballers at?

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:19.340
If you're burning
something, holla back.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:19.920
Come on.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.300
If you're burning
something, holla back.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.820
Yeah, if you're burning
something, holla back.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:27.420
Where my fossil fuel ballers at?

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.085
If you're burning
something, holla back.

00:13:30.085 --> 00:13:31.210
BABA BRINKMAN: That's good.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:32.459
It's good to be honest, right?

00:13:32.459 --> 00:13:33.725
It feels good to be honest.

00:13:33.725 --> 00:13:34.225
Wait.

00:13:34.225 --> 00:13:36.100
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
Turn off the lights.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:36.960
Conserve power.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.270
Everything goes dark.

00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:39.510
It's Earth hour.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.740
We're taking action
on climate change.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.520
All together now back
to the Stone Age.

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.740
In the meantime,
I'll be up in Vegas

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.140
illuminated, laughing
at you player haters.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.110
Face it.

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.680
Balling is part of our nature.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.560
Embrace it.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.280
You love energy wasting.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:56.970
Would you rather be living
large and comfortably,

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.090
or in a shack burning
dung for heat?

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.525
Some people don't have
a choice, but you do.

00:14:01.525 --> 00:14:04.040
So don't hit me with
any hypocritical voodoo

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.470
about trying to reduce
my footprint voluntarily.

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:07.780
I'm trying to make ends.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.360
I can't let them barely meet.

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.760
I'm always trying to get
more gigs and fly more.

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.220
I got a wife and a
daughter to provide for.

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.280
And maybe one day
solar will supply us.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.260
I hope so.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.840
It's better for global climate.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.370
Just don't make me choose
between solar and diapers,

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:23.920
and don't make me switch
off my amplifiers.

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.750
So where my fossil
fuel ballers at?

00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:28.434
If you're burning
something, holla back.

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:29.190
Come on.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.010
Where my fossil fuel ballers at?

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:31.510
Be honest.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:34.070
If you're burning
something, holla back.

00:14:34.070 --> 00:14:35.950
Where my fossil fuel ballers at?

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:36.710
Get loud.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.566
If you're burning
something, holla back.

00:14:38.566 --> 00:14:40.970
We got Mother
Nature on her back,

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:42.230
but it's a one time thing.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:44.434
Never call her back.

00:14:44.434 --> 00:14:45.418
Holler.

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:48.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:58.500
BABA BRINKMAN: Anyone hollering
back at that filth should

00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.318
be deeply ashamed of themself.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.100
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING) La
de da de, we likes to party.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.000
Fossil fuel ballers
ain't bothering nobody.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.760
So what you talking about,
toes getting stepped on?

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.540
The top baller of
all time is Exxon.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.330
CO2 from their
products-- add it up.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.900
Exxon pollutes more than Canada.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:22.210
So don't be surprised.

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:24.590
They write checks
to climate skeptics.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:25.770
That just makes sense.

00:15:25.770 --> 00:15:28.670
I mean, I guess we're all a
little bit skeptical, right?

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.460
Otherwise, how would we
get well rested at night?

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.960
But it might surprise you
that Exxon knew what they told

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.080
the public was just not true.

00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.250
Internal memos going
back to the 70s show

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.540
they studied the
question scientifically

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.150
and recognized the
consensus on the topic

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:48.060
that rising emissions
would be catastrophic.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.500
They must have thought their
pipelines would puncture,

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.540
because they re-engineered
their own infrastructure.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.410
The offshore rigs for sea
level rise, they raise them up

00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:00.580
while still telling lies
about how oh, the science is

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:04.380
inconclusive to justify moving
to low carbon solutions.

00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.770
We can delay action on
climate change for decades.

00:16:07.770 --> 00:16:09.860
Who says there's
no time to waste?

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.690
Cha-ching.

00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:13.630
Now several Attorneys
General are investigating

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.570
Exxon for being criminal.

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:16.860
And that's not political.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.040
That's greed and fraud.

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.870
It kind of makes me
wish I believed in God,

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:22.790
because then I'd believe
in a hell for them

00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:26.370
to go to and choke on fumes
and reap what they sowed you.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.730
Now I'm feeling radical.

00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:29.920
I'm aligning with
activists, left wingers,

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:32.550
like His Holiness, Pope Francis.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:34.880
I never thought I'd
get into religion,

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:37.790
but this pope has
animal magnetism.

00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:42.100
And that behavior is crazy
despicable, so Francis,

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.550
hit them with a papal
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:47.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:50.510
[APPLAUSE]

00:16:56.390 --> 00:16:59.615
[CHANTING LATIN]

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:06.924
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) Et cetera.

00:17:06.924 --> 00:17:12.949
[CHANTING LATIN]

00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:14.990
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
Praise God, the Creator.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.720
[INAUDIBLE] these
techno capitalists

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.260
don't want to mess with me.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.160
They just picked an epic
rap battle of history.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.829
They're trying to defend carbon.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:25.310
I'm the Holy Sea.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.810
I'm the pope.

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:28.569
This world is a
paradise, and we're

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:31.550
degrading it with our dominant
technocratic paradigm.

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.330
It's time for an
ecological conversion.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:37.530
I'm as sure of that as I'm sure
the Lord was born of a virgin.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:38.940
This Earth is our home.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:40.330
There's nowhere else to go.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.370
We're worshiping a false
god, unlimited growth.

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.390
We're poisoning the oceans
and the air with carbon.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.090
We're making a golden calf
out of the free market.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:50.780
But we're part of this world.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.270
We're created out of its dust.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:55.380
If we don't put limits on our
appetites, they diminish us.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.420
The root cause of global
warming and inequality

00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:01.760
is rampant consumerism,
spiritual poverty.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.170
I'm the first pope
with a sense of rhythm.

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:07.250
At the heart of my faith
is environmentalism.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.290
As a Christian, I can say that
today's market fundamentalism

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.330
is worse than any fundamentalism
found in religion.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.940
But radical change is coming.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.490
Stop ignoring the problem.

00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:19.330
The most prosperous are
destroying the global commons.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.420
While the most vulnerable
watches, the sea level rises.

00:18:22.420 --> 00:18:25.540
That's a sure path to mutual
destruction and violence.

00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.010
Anything less than a
total shift in mentality

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.540
is nothing less than selling our
collective soul for a salary.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.050
Worshiping gold is a fallacy.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:34.460
Stop asking for more.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:37.330
Stop feeding your appetites
off of the backs of the poor.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:39.300
It's a moral
imperative to step back

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.530
from self-destruction and reform
the whole system of production

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:43.470
and consumption.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.120
Rich countries owe poor
countries in ecological debt.

00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.430
They block international action
out of national interest.

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:52.220
Selfish individual
consumers driven by greed.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.240
Selfish companies fight to
protect their subsidies.

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:58.530
Selfish countries obsessed
with economic development.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.430
Whatever we do next,
history will remember it.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:04.140
And don't trust market
solutions like cap and trade.

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.920
That's a trick to
keep polluting.

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.650
Even if you have
to pay, and those

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.340
who say we need population
control are dodgy.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.270
We could feed 10 billion
easily with greater equality.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.020
It's not about
government policy.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:16.760
It's about changing
consciousness.

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:19.630
No technocratic fix for
sustained obnoxiousness.

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.080
These aren't just my views.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.580
They're also Jesus'.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.850
We need to protect nature,
ya'll, and also fetuses.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:28.710
I had to slip that in in case
you forgot I was Catholic.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:31.550
But mostly, we're protecting
the poor from the affluent

00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:34.250
and protecting this
earth, our common home,

00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:37.410
from the tyranny of
unlimited economic growth.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:40.520
So point to the sky where
the carbon is accumulating,

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.560
and point to the ground where
the carbon needs to stay.

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.930
And point to the left
where our political future

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.909
lies, and point to the right,
which is resistant to change.

00:19:48.909 --> 00:19:49.700
Come on, everybody.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.000
Point to the sky where the
carbon is accumulating.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:52.500
Good.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.500
Now point to the ground where
the carbon needs to stay.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.260
Now point to the left-- no, your
left-- where our future lies.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.920
Yeah, and point to the right,
which is resistant to change.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.075
Good.

00:20:01.075 --> 00:20:01.640
Now faster.

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.520
Point to the sky, and
point to the ground.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:06.910
And point to the left,
and point to the right.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:07.690
Faster again.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:08.410
Point to the sky.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.076
Point to the ground, point to
the left, point to the right.

00:20:11.076 --> 00:20:13.793
[CHANTING LATIN]

00:20:18.484 --> 00:20:22.876

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:31.280
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING) Only
God can judge me, only God.

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:33.270
Only God can judge me now.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.836
OK, so that one was a
little bit blasphemous,

00:20:35.836 --> 00:20:39.390
but only God can
judge my sacreligion.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:42.660
That's why I don't pay it
no mind, because blasphemy

00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:46.920
is a victimless crime unlike
desecration of the planet.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.940
So I bet Francis
will understand it.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.610
Our Father who art
in the Vatican,

00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:55.130
teach me to be a green advocate.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:58.090
Must we abandon
capitalism and replace it

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:00.030
with some other
financial system?

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:03.550
That seems extreme, but I look
to your guidance on climate.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:05.680
Show me the
spiritual side of it.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.080
Transformational
change of heart.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.670
Your local community,
that's the place to start.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.120
So change your light bulbs.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.520
Put up solar panels.

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:14.700
Recycle more.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:16.460
Be nice to animals.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.340
Ride your bike.

00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:18.800
Plant trees every day.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.340
Stop driving solo
in the carpool lane.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:23.030
OK, I did all of that.

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:24.160
That was easy.

00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.010
Am I done?

00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:26.333
Can I keep watching TV?

00:21:26.333 --> 00:21:27.100
What?

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:27.930
It's not enough?

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.120
Emissions are going up?

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.330
And the whole economy is
driven by burning stuff?

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.426
I mean, are we going
to make people own it,

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:37.320
or just wait for some kind
of come to Jesus moment?

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.840
The challenge is to
break habits of waste

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.470
and maximize freedom
in matters of taste.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.790
So let's do what it takes.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.090
Let's replace capitalism with
a more compassionate system

00:21:47.090 --> 00:21:50.070
or just a more compassionate
version of capitalism.

00:21:50.070 --> 00:21:50.570
Look.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:53.470
As long as my job doesn't
have to stop-- people,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.780
I got a crowd to rock.

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.900
Responsibilities, you can't
yank the plug on the vibe.

00:21:57.900 --> 00:21:58.820
You feeling me?

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:01.140
But the bottom line is
when it comes to rhyming,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.390
I would not stop this
show to save the climate.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.450
I'm rocking till
they make me stop.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.621
Climate change or
not, I make it hot.

00:22:09.621 --> 00:22:12.507
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:18.244 --> 00:22:20.410
BABA BRINKMAN: I'd just
like to assure everyone here

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:23.870
that I would stop the show to
save the planet if I thought

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:24.820
it would really help.

00:22:29.067 --> 00:22:31.150
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
Scientists are telling us

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.180
that we're standing
on a precipice,

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:35.430
and we have to convert
the global economy

00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:36.760
and make it emissionless.

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.260
And those emissions are
caused by every single one

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.200
of our jobs.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.380
Every one of us contributing
carbon emissions to the smog.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.530
For instance, if I
write a rhyme trying

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:48.640
to describe climate change,
and it's hot so it catches on,

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:51.510
someone's going to fly me
someplace to perform it.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.430
And the appeal of
that is enormous.

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:55.480
It's not an option
for me to turn down

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.622
work for global warming,
because I make it hot.

00:22:58.622 --> 00:23:01.040
Yeah, people say
my rhymes are dope.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.080
I twist words until
they're unrecognizable.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.460
I make it hot.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.580
I make it heezy for sheezy.

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.030
So hot even climate change
skeptics will believe me.

00:23:11.030 --> 00:23:13.120
I make it hot, like
the temperature

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.910
it needs to be before the Tea
Party will believe the IPCC.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.080
I make it hot.

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.280
I liquefy the
Greenland Ice Sheets,

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.290
seven meters of sea level rise.

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:24.590
That'll do nicely.

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:26.840
And yeah, humans are adaptable.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.980
And we can toughen
up, but that response

00:23:28.980 --> 00:23:31.710
ignores people who feel like
it's already tough enough.

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.710
Make a list of countries that
nobody visits as a tourist.

00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:36.330
They have low carbon emissions.

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.350
The richest inflicted
this on the poorest.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:41.620
We did it by heating our
houses and feeding our spouses

00:23:41.620 --> 00:23:43.490
and flying and driving
places and having

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.300
no patience for power outages.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.380
The Pope calls it
anthroprocentric.

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.910
He calls it obnoxious,
but I got work to do.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:53.083
And work takes energy to
accomplish, and I make it hot.

00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:55.500
Yeah, I turn up the
heat on the crowd.

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.620
You make it hot, too, though, so
don't try to be weaseling out.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:02.110
I make it hot like
the African sun,

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:05.460
like the paleo scene,
eocene, thermal maximum.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.250
I make it hot.

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.200
Feel that bass when it vibrates.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:12.680
Hot like the permafrost
releasing methyl hydrates.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:16.040
I make it hot like a
planet with low albedo,

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.570
like me rocking a trench coat
on a beach instead of a Speedo.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:22.970
Hot with no apologies, but
still I'm feeling a lot of grief

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:26.450
for the impact my lifestyle
has on the planet's ecology.

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:29.610
My carbon footprint is
bigger than cryptozoologies.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.290
I'm talking Loch Ness
Monster, so I'm not

00:24:32.290 --> 00:24:35.420
at peace, because the aggregate
effect of every decision I'm

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.590
making is tragic.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.980
But I can't just quit.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.980
They say that we're
carbon emission addicts.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:41.130
But that's just glib.

00:24:41.130 --> 00:24:43.410
You want me to live
in poverty abject?

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:46.780
And if I did, what happens to
greenhouse gases on average?

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:50.260
If I quit and you don't, it's
still hell in a hand basket.

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:52.640
A traffic jam with
no plan of action,

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.280
fantastic, this is
a classic arms race

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:56.260
that we're trapped in.

00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:57.130
It's ominous.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.610
Self-interested party stuck
in a tragedy of the comments.

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:03.990
The problem is caused by our
collective emissions of carbon,

00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:06.660
but the person who emits
is not the person emissions

00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:07.360
are harming.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.120
So that's a failure
of the market.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.610
Like everyone is incentivized
to pollute as much

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:14.230
as they can get away with,
and catch a free ride.

00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:17.460
So it's no surprise to
see emissions on the rise

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.940
when the cost of burning
fossil fuel is externalized.

00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:22.700
It's effectively subsidized.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.380
It's paid for by the victims
of the eventual climate impacts

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.780
caused by our emissions.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.650
And Bill McKibben
and the guardian

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:32.390
have been targeting investments
like dirty energy is

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:35.660
the new tobacco, so keep your
distance from anybody making

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.850
a profit off of fossil fuels.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:39.720
Cool, I'm down with the boycott.

00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.860
I'm just boycotting myself,
too, because I make it hot.

00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:44.960
Yeah, I cause a heat wave.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.470
How about nine degrees
hotter than the hottest ones

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:48.310
these days?

00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:51.840
I make it hot like
climate refugees.

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:55.620
Picture a hot 100 million
displaced Bangladeshis.

00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.790
I make it hot.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.970
I spit flames, rap metaphors.

00:25:58.970 --> 00:26:01.705
A five alarm blaze killing
the last Redwood forest.

00:26:01.705 --> 00:26:03.630
I make it hot.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:07.070
How about I make it six
degrees, causing the extinction

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:08.880
of 40% of species?

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.180
Hot.

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:12.680
So what are we left with?

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.010
A speeding train with no brakes,
some kind of a death wish,

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.930
a scientific
consensus that we're

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.360
standing on a precipice
and a population

00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:22.870
with no idea of how to
reduce their emissions.

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.210
Some people do offset
their footprint voluntarily

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.880
with the milk of human
altruism-- hope, faith,

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.430
and charity, but that's
not going to cut it.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:33.170
It's not counterproductive,
but we've

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:35.010
got a global carbon budget.

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.550
And it's globally busted.

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.210
And there are
hundreds of gigatons

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:39.890
that you would have to offset.

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.900
You might as well
donate your piggy banks

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:43.080
to the national debt.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.680
I ain't got no spare change to
donate to carbon offsetting.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.720
I don't even want to
calculate my footprint.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:49.910
I find it upsetting.

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:52.000
It's like the medieval
Catholic Church back

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.540
when it was indulgence selling.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.500
If you get a Big
Mac and a Diet Coke,

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.170
your belly's still swelling.

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.960
But here's what I'm willing.

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.370
I'm willing to pay a
tax, like a fee that's

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.920
calculated against
my carbon impacts

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.280
and globally harmonized to
switch incentives around

00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.790
and make sure most of
that carbon stays safely

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:10.810
under the ground.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:14.150
But I'm not going to pay it,
not unless you all pay it, too.

00:27:14.150 --> 00:27:15.700
That way I can be
sure that you'll

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.440
do what you say you'll do.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.290
How about everyone
has to pay it?

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.880
No free riders allowed.

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:24.360
No international pact with
the US or China left out.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.310
You can invest it
in green R&amp;D, or you

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:27.991
can dividend it back to me.

00:27:27.991 --> 00:27:30.240
But either way, I won't be
happy until the day they're

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.356
carbon taxing me,
'cause then I can

00:27:32.356 --> 00:27:34.840
make it hot without
ever feeling a chill.

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.020
I'm just sick of this
guilt trip killing my high

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:39.700
when I'm feeling a
thr So I make it hot.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:41.530
I get your emotions aroused.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.430
If we can't make
those hot, we're not

00:27:43.430 --> 00:27:44.980
going to keep the oceans down.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:46.560
So let's make it hot.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.010
People, let's turn up
the heat on polluters

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:51.750
trying to catch a ride on
all the rest of us for free.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:55.050
I make it hot on the mic
and in my social life

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:59.758
when I agitate for my friends
to agitate for a carbon price.

00:27:59.758 --> 00:28:01.674
BABA BRINKMAN: And that's
how you make it hot.

00:28:01.674 --> 00:28:07.836
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:07.836 --> 00:28:09.790
BABA BRINKMAN: All right.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:12.880
Welcome to Talks at Google,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.100
This afternoon's seminar
will be on the future

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:19.570
of global capitalism and how
you, like me and my hedge fund

00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:22.000
managers, can profit from it.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.634
Now before we begin the
seminar, the meat of it,

00:28:24.634 --> 00:28:26.550
I'd just like to see
who's in the house today.

00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.600
So raise your hand if
you consider yourself

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.760
to be a pro-market person.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.250
Do we have any
pro-market people?

00:28:32.250 --> 00:28:32.830
Look at that.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:33.484
More than half.

00:28:33.484 --> 00:28:34.150
All right, cool.

00:28:34.150 --> 00:28:36.816
Put your hand up if you think we
should have an ambitious target

00:28:36.816 --> 00:28:38.390
to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.339
Where my ambition
target people at?

00:28:40.339 --> 00:28:40.880
Look at that.

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.381
Everybody.

00:28:41.381 --> 00:28:41.880
All right.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.260
Now put your hand
up if you think

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:44.677
carbon pricing of
some sort is how

00:28:44.677 --> 00:28:47.176
we should get there-- carbon
taxes, cap and trade, whatever?

00:28:47.176 --> 00:28:47.986
All right.

00:28:47.986 --> 00:28:49.060
Just a little over half.

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:49.560
Cool.

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.920
I just want to tell you about
the concept of a bubble.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.760
We may have something
called a carbon bubble, so

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.630
let me tell you
about this bubble

00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:58.672
and how the bubble works.

00:28:58.672 --> 00:29:00.463
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
The bubble's value

00:29:00.463 --> 00:29:02.670
is based on our perception
of what it's worth,

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.910
but if that consensus changes,
that bubble's going to burst.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:09.410
So we should try to
get ahead of the curve.

00:29:09.410 --> 00:29:14.410
Back before the crash of 2008,
a few people saw that bubble

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.830
and knew how it would break.

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:19.160
That was debt obligations
on top of debt obligations,

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:22.370
collateralized and traded,
bloated and overinflated.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:26.100
Bad debt was being sold
as AAA rated asset.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.810
Hindenburg, don't be
surprised when it crashes.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.450
Well, now we've got another
bubble on our hands.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:35.760
And it's a hell of a lot worse
than sub-prime mortgage scams.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.450
This is a carbon bubble,
a whole economic engine

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:42.480
on the collision course to
bankrupt the climate system.

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:46.120
Risky business, but who's
going to give us a bailout?

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.780
This global civilization is
a bit too big to fail now.

00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:52.440
The carbon economy
is an insolvent bank,

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.570
so the government's got
to be part of the fix.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:55.810
Ask Dodd-Frank.

00:29:55.810 --> 00:29:57.510
I'm not a businessman.

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:59.430
I'm a business, man.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:02.492
I need a carbon price to
handle my business, damn.

00:30:02.492 --> 00:30:04.200
BABA BRINKMAN: So
again, put your hand up

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.681
if you're pro-market.

00:30:05.681 --> 00:30:06.680
Just taking a poll here.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.072
Put your hand up if you
want an ambitious target.

00:30:09.072 --> 00:30:10.280
That's pretty much everybody.

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:12.730
Put your hand up if you
want a price on carbon.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:13.230
All right.

00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:15.690
Let's try to move the
needle in the room a bit.

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:17.148
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) A business

00:30:17.148 --> 00:30:19.230
doesn't have to close
down to reduce emissions.

00:30:19.230 --> 00:30:22.010
It just needs a level playing
field with its competition.

00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:24.700
An economic growth can continue.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:25.960
We don't have to stop it.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.220
It might slow down a bit, but
alternatives are catastrophic.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:32.610
So far the most popular is
this cap and trade system.

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:35.970
That's a decreasing total limit
on greenhouse gas emissions,

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:38.960
but with tradable permits
auctioned off or given away.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.740
So companies who innovate
to reduce emissions

00:30:41.740 --> 00:30:44.910
get paid, which is great,
unless it's only big business

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:46.020
capped in charge.

00:30:46.020 --> 00:30:47.320
That doesn't go far enough.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.170
What about tailpipes on cars?

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:52.470
That's why some countries go
with a carbon tax instead--

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:56.150
a flat rate at the source
where that fuel gets extracted.

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:59.400
And that's when clean energy
gets a lot more competitive.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.800
And revenues get dividended
back to regular citizens.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.080
And some of it gets invested
in the next round of inventions

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.670
to revolutionize
the energy system.

00:31:08.670 --> 00:31:09.910
Picture it.

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:12.060
So get your hands up
if you're pro-market.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:15.690
Get your hands up if you
want an ambitious target.

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.800
Get your hands up-- bounce
them just like that.

00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:19.680
--if you want a price on carbon.

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:22.750
Yeah, let's get
the party started.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:25.030
Ignoring climate change
is like investing

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.770
in derivatives in 2007.

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:29.480
It's not recommended.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.490
The future is a shared resource.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:32.920
Don't bet against it.

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:35.890
Bet on scientific literacy
winning elections.

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:39.480
We're trying to get to net
zero emissions by 2050.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.370
Anything less is just
unacceptably risky.

00:31:42.370 --> 00:31:44.370
But with the right
market incentives,

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:45.740
we'll find the way forward.

00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:49.110
Carbon pricing can even pay to
protect surviving rain forests,

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.700
because if you
plant a new forest,

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.640
or close a coal
burning plant, that's

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.600
atmospherically equivalent
in its carbon content.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:58.990
And deforestation is 17%
of emissions released.

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.800
So that carbon
price has to capture

00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.690
what's sequestered in trees.

00:32:02.690 --> 00:32:06.160
The price can be cap and
trade, or tax, or a hybrid.

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.820
One or the other or
both, so long as we

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.400
stabilize the climate.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.340
And opportunity knocks for
the future masters of business

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.990
who embrace the
evolution of capitalism.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:16.050
What?

00:32:16.050 --> 00:32:18.630
So people, get your hands
up if you're pro-market.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:22.540
Get your hands up if you
want an ambitious target.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.800
Get your hands up if you
want a price on carbon.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.105
Let's get this green
capitalism party started.

00:32:29.105 --> 00:32:30.480
BABA BRINKMAN:
Well, I'm not sure

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.010
how far I managed to move
the needle this afternoon,

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:36.682
but I do appreciate you
attending my seminar.

00:32:36.682 --> 00:32:42.204
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:42.204 --> 00:32:46.869
Let's just calm it down a
bit in here-- a little crazy.

00:32:46.869 --> 00:32:49.160
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING) If
you invest in fossil fuels,

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:50.500
I feel bad for you, son.

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.350
I got 99 problems,
but that ain't one.

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:54.190
Hit me.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:56.290
Slap me, and wake me up.

00:32:56.290 --> 00:32:59.370
And some of the stuff is so
crazy I couldn't make it up.

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.445
So let's just all take
a second and contemplate

00:33:01.445 --> 00:33:05.080
it-- a fossil fuel company
that's publicly traded.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.990
What's a firm in the business
of fossil fuel really worth?

00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:10.780
Its book value is based
on their proven reserves.

00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.580
It's not the fuel they sell
to us and we burn right now.

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:16.700
It's the coal, gas, and oil
that's still underground.

00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.560
Now technically, it's
worthless until it oxidizes.

00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.650
But as soon as they find it,
it goes in their stock prices.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:25.310
The top 200 companies
digging it and drilling it

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:28.720
are collectively worth
more than $7 trillion.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:30.960
Did they forget the IPCC?

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.210
I thought we had an
agreement to keep this heat

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.250
increase below two degrees.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:40.230
If so, we only get to release
around 560 gigatons by 2050.

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.851
Any disregard for that
budget is highly destructive.

00:33:43.851 --> 00:33:45.600
Those are the facts
that we're stuck with.

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:48.170
The percentage of the budget
covered in proven reserves

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:51.460
determines how much we can burn
and what to keep in the earth.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.250
So what's down there now
waiting to come to market?

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:57.200
Around 2,700 gigatons of carbon.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.910
That's five times as much
as we can safely burn,

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:02.900
so investments manager
should be a bit concerned

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.710
that fossil fuel stock
prices are inflated.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.610
Get your pensions out
before the industry craters.

00:34:08.610 --> 00:34:11.350
Investing in fossil
fuels got to be a bad bet

00:34:11.350 --> 00:34:14.510
if 80% of their stock
is a stranded asset,

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:16.540
like a warehouse
full of Kodak film

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:18.770
when digital crashed
the market, causing

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:20.340
a total loss of principal.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:21.790
What a lack of principles.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:24.110
What's on their
books can't be cashed

00:34:24.110 --> 00:34:26.199
in unless the
whole planet cooks.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:29.290
I used to put my faith in
spiritual transformation.

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.870
Now I'll put my
faith in legislation

00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:34.510
to end this whole
fossil fuel charity bid

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:40.700
and make sure clean energy gets
up to parity with the grid.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:46.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.820
BABA BRINKMAN: People, we're at
Google, so envision the future.

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:55.860
In it, you'll see me rocking
solar panels on my Tesla.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.510
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
Solar panels on my Tesla.

00:34:58.510 --> 00:35:01.500
I'm rocking solar
panels on my Tesla.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.590
Green tech Renaissance
better catch up.

00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:07.180
Petroleum is oh, so prosaic.

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.900
I'm a player when it
comes to photovoltaic.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.440
So three cheers
for the engineers.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.420
80% price drop in
the past five years.

00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.910
I've been to Germany.

00:35:18.910 --> 00:35:21.530
It's kind of gray, but
half of their total power

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.110
is solar on sunny days, OK.

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:27.100
It's cheaper than
coal now in 20 states.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.000
Haters hate, but they
can't stop the wave.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.010
Hey.

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:33.520
And the next phase
of battery techs

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.680
got that solar flowing day
and night, and that'll be it.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:39.160
We got a gravity
battery underground

00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.530
charging up with the solar
water pump right now.

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.570
Every car, every house,
every business, every year.

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:46.890
Make the switch in ignition.

00:35:46.890 --> 00:35:49.310
Switches will disappear.

00:35:49.310 --> 00:35:52.490
I'm rocking solar
panels on my Tesla.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:53.200
You say it.

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.900
I'm rocking solar
panels on my Tesla.

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:57.560
Use a gas guzzler?

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.390
That's messed up.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:02.390
I'm rocking solar
panels on y Tesla.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:05.100
Did I mention solar
panels on my Tesla?

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:05.754
Your turn.

00:36:05.754 --> 00:36:08.390
AUDIENCE: I'm rocking
solar panels on my Tesla.

00:36:08.390 --> 00:36:10.390
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
You've got coal dust up

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:11.896
in your left lung.

00:36:11.896 --> 00:36:13.960
I'm rocking solar panels on my--

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:14.795
AUDIENCE: Tesla.

00:36:14.795 --> 00:36:17.170
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING) I'm
a fan of how the wind feels.

00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:21.590
Windmills power whole cities
when you put them up in fields.

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.320
That's the new.

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.380
Fossil fuel is the old way.

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.590
Don't hate on wind
farms, Don Quixote.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:29.290
What about nuclear?

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.780
That's what they asking me.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.200
Hell of a lot better for
the planet than gasoline.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:37.310
Some new investments made
can make it extra safe.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:40.630
I'm thinking Bill Gates
probably should investigate.

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.380
Apollo moon shot,
scalable renewables.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.880
We can't expect Elon
Musk to do on his own.

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.690
Cellulolytic, biofuel,
and carbon capture,

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:53.170
lifting CO2 out of thin
air just like the Rapture.

00:36:53.170 --> 00:36:56.930
Gadgets to manufacture
and toys to play with that

00:36:56.930 --> 00:36:59.660
make it pay when
pollution poisons evaded.

00:36:59.660 --> 00:37:02.460
So come fly with
me on solar Cessnas

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:06.680
into a future of
affordable Tesla.

00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.970
I'm rocking solar panels
on my Tesla hypothetically.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:12.590
Here's a confession.

00:37:12.590 --> 00:37:15.840
I drive a Honda
Civic, not a Tesla.

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.590
But if it wasn't
so expensive, I'd

00:37:17.590 --> 00:37:21.850
get one and rock solar
panels on my Tesla.

00:37:21.850 --> 00:37:22.560
Your turn.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.190
Rocking solar
panels on my Tesla.

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:28.300
That's the future, ya'll,
solar panels on a Tesla.

00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:29.102
Last chance.

00:37:29.102 --> 00:37:32.000
I'm rocking solar
panels on my Tesla.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.558
You got it.

00:37:33.558 --> 00:37:38.139
[APPLAUSE]

00:37:38.139 --> 00:37:39.180
BABA BRINKMAN: All right.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.100
That one had kind of a
tricky new school rhythm.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:44.030
This one's got more of
an old school rhythm.

00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:46.630
If you know the words, say
the words along with me.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:47.690
Everyone knows the words.

00:37:49.812 --> 00:37:51.770
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
You can get with this,

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.140
or you can get with that.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.760
You could get with this,
or you could get with that.

00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:58.140
You could get with this,
or you could get with that.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.080
But you should get with this,
because this is where it's at.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:01.740
Yeah.

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.920
So get with this,
or get with that.

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.070
Let's see if we can
get with the math.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.840
So what's your greenhouse
gas reduction target?

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.230
How about 20 tons of carbon.

00:38:11.230 --> 00:38:14.830
That's what the average American
emits every single year.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:16.270
Well, that's easy to fix.

00:38:16.270 --> 00:38:20.030
The global average is only four
tons, and billions of people

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:21.850
are still trying
to get more stuff.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.000
Just like your stuff,
and who are you to say,

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.900
or who am I to say that
they should have to wait?

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:28.600
So this is
everybody's party now,

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.120
and that's a shame, because
then it's nobody's party.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.140
It's the same.

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:35.680
I want to do the right thing
right now, but then again,

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.270
I like my lifestyle.

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:40.890
And it can't be right for me to
give it up unilaterally while

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:42.470
y'all just live it up.

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:44.750
Frustration, first
inclination is

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:47.330
to put faith in
innovation to save us,

00:38:47.330 --> 00:38:50.140
instead of trying to
rein in misbehavior.

00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.800
But that's a risky wager.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.130
Tell me, Google, how long
will it take innovation

00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:59.880
to reverse one basic equation,
one perverse incentive where

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.760
dirty is cheap, and
clean is expensive.

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:05.330
Remember, this is
a physical system.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.970
It doesn't give a damn about
your relative emissions,

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:09.830
or whether emissions
come from decadent

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:12.760
living or visiting
relatives at Christmas.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.000
This is everything.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.460
It's everything we manufacture--
concrete, steel, glass,

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.470
and plastic.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:20.760
Whether or not you change
your little habits,

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.350
absolute emissions,
that's all that matters.

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.130
So you get with that--
business as usual.

00:39:26.130 --> 00:39:28.520
Everybody wiggling through
their own loophole.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.130
Or you can get with this--
an arms control agreement,

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:36.620
and if that's what you want,
then act like you mean it.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:39.120
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.750
BABA BRINKMAN: So we're going
to get into the Q&amp;A portion

00:39:45.750 --> 00:39:47.440
of the afternoon in a moment.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.300
So if you have a question
or comment about anything

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:53.580
I've been speaking on, I invite
you to step to the microphone.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.150
And I really actually need
you to step to the microphone,

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:59.980
because I'm going to be relying
on your input to construct

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.030
the rest of the show.

00:40:01.030 --> 00:40:02.380
The show's not over.

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:05.320
Every night I do this off
Broadway and have this Q&amp;A.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:07.680
And then I integrate people's
suggestions and ideas

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:10.080
into the show
improvisationally so

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.000
that it can become a complete
guide to the climate,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.090
as far as you know, rather
than merely a partial guide.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:20.230
So I need you now to
complete me by suggesting

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:22.800
things that I addressed
insufficiently,

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.310
or that I left out, or
things that you think

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:28.280
are crucial to a discussion
of climate change

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.750
and how to solve it.

00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.070
So all right.

00:40:32.070 --> 00:40:33.270
Number one, yeah?

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:35.353
AUDIENCE: Well, you said,
I think, in the last one

00:40:35.353 --> 00:40:38.360
that nuclear is promising,
but very recent events

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.070
might be proving you wrong,
because PG&amp;E just closed down

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:43.630
their nuclear plant right in
California, because they're

00:40:43.630 --> 00:40:46.120
seeing that solar might
actually be cheaper.

00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.245
BABA BRINKMAN: Yes, and
that's absolutely the case.

00:40:48.245 --> 00:40:49.970
Solar is cheaper than nuclear.

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:52.114
There's pretty much
no unsubsidized

00:40:52.114 --> 00:40:53.780
nuclear in the world
right now, and this

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.190
is old generation stuff.

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:58.030
The nuclear we're using
today is 50 or 60 years old,

00:40:58.030 --> 00:41:00.130
which is why I referenced
Bill Gates, because he

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.440
has put together a private
investment group that

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.680
is exploring innovations around
next generation nuclear, which

00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:08.360
I feel optimistic about.

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.680
But when people ask me, what
should we do with nuclear?

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.320
My answer is usually,
I don't think

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.510
we should spend any
government money on building

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:16.980
new 1950s nuclear plants.

00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:19.110
Whether we should spend
government money on R&amp;D,

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.170
developing the fast breeder
reactors in the next gen,

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:23.720
I think probably
not, because I think

00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.770
government subsidies
could be better spent

00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:28.510
on existing renewables that
can more effectively pick up

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:29.180
the slack.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.882
But if private investors want
to take a bet on developing

00:41:32.882 --> 00:41:34.840
something that will become
commercially viable,

00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:36.340
I think that's a
really great thing.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.290
And I applaud that
initiative, but I'm not

00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:42.640
for government
sponsored nuclear.

00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:43.800
It's a nuanced position.

00:41:47.010 --> 00:41:48.450
Other comments?

00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:50.700
I actually need the
input, otherwise

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.177
I'm going to have to freestyle
about nothing after this.

00:41:53.177 --> 00:41:55.010
But make sure your
comments are substantive.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.426
Don't just tell me words that
are difficult to rhyme with.

00:41:57.426 --> 00:42:00.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:01.719
Yeah?

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:03.510
AUDIENCE: So Brett
Victor is a technologist

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:05.310
who worked with Al
Gore on his book.

00:42:05.310 --> 00:42:08.090
And he has a really nice
bit about climate change

00:42:08.090 --> 00:42:09.020
on his site.

00:42:09.020 --> 00:42:11.120
And one of the things he
says is that batteries

00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:16.910
aren't enough right now to power
the grid with just renewables.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:18.160
Can you address that a little?

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:18.993
BABA BRINKMAN: Sure.

00:42:18.993 --> 00:42:20.740
So most of the
battery technology

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.660
that's being used for
storing solo is lithium ion.

00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.410
That's what the new
Tesla wall battery is.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.210
And you can do a
house with that,

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:31.200
but I don't think you
can really do a city.

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.930
The thing that I
mentioned is the concept

00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:34.275
of a gravity battery.

00:42:34.275 --> 00:42:36.900
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING) There's
a gravity battery underground.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:38.060
BABA BRINKMAN: Maybe
not even underground,

00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:39.434
because one thing
that you can do

00:42:39.434 --> 00:42:42.390
is you can take solar, which
is only a daytime power source,

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:45.220
and use it to run pumps
to send water uphill.

00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.720
And then that can create
hydro potential, which you

00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:49.050
can release whenever you want.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.820
So using the force of gravity
is a potential bridge solution.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.830
I'm optimistic that within a
few years, or maybe decades,

00:42:56.830 --> 00:42:59.500
there will be storage
technologies that don't require

00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.432
these big geological solutions.

00:43:01.432 --> 00:43:02.890
One of the gravity
battery concepts

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:04.910
is you actually just drill
a cylinder underground.

00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:06.660
Drilling technologies,
they are existing.

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.870
You can just have a
huge slab of granite

00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:12.280
that's floating in water, and it
just gets pumped up to the top

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:12.920
by solar.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.080
And then it gets drawn
down to take power,

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:17.840
and that would be a feasible
way to store power as well.

00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:21.400
But storage is an issue and
one of the reasons why people

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.630
are hesitant to give up on
fossil fuels and nuclear,

00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:25.690
because they work
around the clock.

00:43:25.690 --> 00:43:27.670
And wind and solar only
work at certain times,

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:31.270
but that's a crucial
piece of the puzzle, which

00:43:31.270 --> 00:43:33.755
I'd love to see Google
help to solve as well.

00:43:33.755 --> 00:43:34.463
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:37.407 --> 00:43:38.240
BABA BRINKMAN: Yeah?

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.720
AUDIENCE: I wanted to raise
climate change adaptability,

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:45.730
because keeping carbon
emissions under 2% is nice,

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.760
but a lot of countries
around the world,

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.240
such as Bangladesh
which you referenced,

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.710
have been physically losing
land for almost a decade if not

00:43:55.710 --> 00:43:56.560
more.

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.640
And all these communities are
doing some pretty impressive,

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:03.960
remarkable stuff to live with
climate change and adapt to it.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.900
I think that's a very
powerful message that

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:07.300
can be incorporated more.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:09.150
BABA BRINKMAN: Yeah, thank you.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.460
I was on the fence about how
much to emphasize that when

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.020
I was creating the
show, because I

00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.530
think there is a sort
of inspirational triumph

00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:18.862
over adversity side to telling
that part of the story.

00:44:18.862 --> 00:44:19.570
And you're right.

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:21.330
It's totally necessary.

00:44:21.330 --> 00:44:24.720
Several South Pacific Islands
just went underwater completely

00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:27.010
for the first time, due to
climate change recently.

00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:30.530
However, the deniers
and the contrarians

00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:32.860
tend to overemphasize
adaptation,

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:35.641
because that's the sort of
libertarian, don't worry.

00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:37.890
We don't have to do anything
about reducing emissions.

00:44:37.890 --> 00:44:39.470
We can just invent
our way out of it,

00:44:39.470 --> 00:44:41.570
because we're such good
engineers and builders.

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.410
And so I think there's a
real danger in over reliance

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:46.530
and over celebration
of adaptation.

00:44:46.530 --> 00:44:50.840
I think it should be adaptation
where currently necessary.

00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:55.720
But the reductive
ad extremio of that

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:58.270
is that we just don't have
to stop burning stuff.

00:44:58.270 --> 00:45:01.240
And that actually
takes us beyond what

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.090
I think we can
technologically adapt to.

00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:05.090
We can adapt to
inches, maybe feet,

00:45:05.090 --> 00:45:07.480
but can we adapt to
meters of sea level rise?

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:11.790
That's something we've
never really tried before.

00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:14.424
That's why I didn't focus on
that too much in the show,

00:45:14.424 --> 00:45:15.590
but I think it is important.

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:18.250
It's just one of those ones that
needs a pretty solid footnote

00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:19.895
when you talk about it.

00:45:19.895 --> 00:45:20.770
AUDIENCE: Fair point.

00:45:20.770 --> 00:45:21.260
Thanks.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:22.176
BABA BRINKMAN: Thanks.

00:45:22.176 --> 00:45:22.750
Yeah?

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:24.340
AUDIENCE: There
was a day recently

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:28.450
where Germany had to
actually credit users,

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:31.410
because their natural resources
produce so much energy

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:32.879
that they just get overwhelmed.

00:45:32.879 --> 00:45:34.420
And people were
actually getting paid

00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.935
to use the energy
in the country.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.570
How would you change what
we're doing in the US

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:44.049
to start implementing
a policies--

00:45:44.049 --> 00:45:45.590
I know this is a
very vague question.

00:45:45.590 --> 00:45:47.820
But obviously America would
need to start somewhere.

00:45:47.820 --> 00:45:49.450
Where would you start?

00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:52.220
BABA BRINKMAN: Well, I think
there's a Stanford analysis.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.680
I think it may be called
the Solutions Project, which

00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:58.520
was a sort of
state by state plan

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.580
for transitioning to
all renewable energy

00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:05.920
over the next few decades.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.250
And that's available
to us as a plan.

00:46:09.250 --> 00:46:11.695
Part of the reason I
focus on taxes and pricing

00:46:11.695 --> 00:46:14.150
and regulation and policy
so much in this show

00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:17.166
is because I think that's really
the key in the lock right now.

00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:18.540
I think people
are actually going

00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:22.370
to be more effective trying to
influence governments to change

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:24.920
their laws-- municipal,
state, or federal level--

00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:26.380
or trying to
influence businesses.

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.200
I think we are in a LEED's gold
standard building right now.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.270
Google made the decision to
make this a very low emissions

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:35.320
building, but Google
can afford it.

00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:37.540
And that is one of
the key messages

00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:40.270
is we have a general
problem of dirty is cheap,

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:41.470
and clean is expensive.

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:44.470
And not every company
is ready to jeopardize

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.700
their competitiveness
by doing that spend.

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.470
So I think the number
one thing that's

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:51.780
needed the most in the US is
a carbon pricing system, which

00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:54.390
will then just change that
incentive structure so

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:57.801
that suddenly you don't have
to be poor by being virtuous.

00:46:57.801 --> 00:46:59.800
You can actually do what's
right for your wallet

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:01.180
and the environment
at same time,

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:03.960
but that requires government
intervention at this point,

00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:06.532
because innovation hasn't solved
that problem on its own yet.

00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:08.490
I think there's a good
argument to make that it

00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:10.170
will if you just let it happen.

00:47:10.170 --> 00:47:11.950
Give us two or three decades.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:15.040
I bet all renewables will be
cheaper than all fossil fuels.

00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.700
The problem is we're already
over 400 parts per million

00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:19.630
of CO2 in the
atmosphere, and that's

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.770
already creating a
creeping warming that's

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.400
going to melt a
lot of the sea ice

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.790
unless we reverse it and
stop it as soon as possible.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:29.790
So when people ask
me, what should we do?

00:47:29.790 --> 00:47:35.880
Especially in the United
States, I say, buy clean,

00:47:35.880 --> 00:47:38.170
green products.

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.072
That's a good thing to do,
I guess, but on its own

00:47:41.072 --> 00:47:42.530
it's not going to
be nearly enough.

00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:45.110
Individual consumer choices
will make up such a small part

00:47:45.110 --> 00:47:47.370
of the pie compared
to energy generation

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:50.370
and concrete manufacturing and
all the other big stuff that

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:55.020
really has to be done at the
legislative level, in my view.

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:58.650
Not every environmentalist likes
to hear that, but a lot of them

00:47:58.650 --> 00:47:59.150
do.

00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.420
All right.

00:47:59.420 --> 00:47:59.950
So this is great.

00:47:59.950 --> 00:48:01.490
This is the kind
of conversation I

00:48:01.490 --> 00:48:04.190
wanted to start
the show to have,

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:06.960
so I guess the only way
to logistically integrate

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.320
it now is with a freestyle.

00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:09.736
You guys want to
hear a freestyle?

00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:10.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:12.780
BABA BRINKMAN: Here we go.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:13.370
BABA BRINKMAN:
(RAPPING) In a moment

00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:14.760
I'm going to
attempt to integrate

00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.260
every single one
of your questions

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:18.070
into a freestyle rhyme.

00:48:18.070 --> 00:48:19.690
But before I start
freestyling, I

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:21.930
have this little written
intro to preface it,

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:23.935
because a freestyle is not free.

00:48:23.935 --> 00:48:26.200
A freestyle's regulated.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.470
It's the rhyme and rhythm that
makes it lyrically innovative.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:30.740
And freedom ain't free.

00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:33.210
You want to hear a freestyle
that's really free.

00:48:33.210 --> 00:48:36.470
Freestyle, it needs
some infrastructure.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.450
So I want to voluntarily
really restrain it,

00:48:38.450 --> 00:48:39.780
so you get something from it.

00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.374
Here's a freestyle
that is literally free.

00:48:42.374 --> 00:48:46.102
[GIBBERISH]

00:48:46.102 --> 00:48:49.430
Yeah, I improvised every
syllable in that sequence,

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:52.550
but was the lack of
semantic content a weakness?

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:53.090
OK.

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.670
Here's a freestyle that's
slightly less free.

00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:59.370
Intelligible words-- bird, bee,
watermelon seed, tree, sweet.

00:48:59.370 --> 00:49:02.180
Those words came straight
off of the top of my dome,

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.400
but in retrospect, they
didn't have a point or a flow.

00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.700
So I suppose when I
freestyle, it really

00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.600
needs to have
parameters, so you can

00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.530
tell the difference between
professionals and amateurs.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:15.420
It's got to work rhythmically,
and sonically, and logically.

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:18.320
It's better off with better
laws, kind of like market

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.800
economies, because
freedom ain't free.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.240
Freedom involves tradeoffs.

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.860
We don't want our bankers to
be free like Bernie Madoff.

00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:27.230
Freedom ain't free.

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:29.110
Freedom for Cecil
the lion means you

00:49:29.110 --> 00:49:32.440
got to take away the freedom
of dentists to buy him, people.

00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:33.800
Freedom ain't free.

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.670
You say you want a free market.

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:39.530
I want a market free from people
dumping their garbage on me.

00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:40.840
Freedom ain't free.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.820
Now don't freak out, but
the whole rest of this flow

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:45.150
is about to be freestyle.

00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:48.600
I'm at Google, so I guess
what I should do is geek out.

00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.720
Yeah, that's right.

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.044
I'm a rap artist at
home always chilling.

00:49:52.044 --> 00:49:53.710
I never been somewhere
that made me want

00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:55.470
to work in an office building.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:56.400
But now I do.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:57.210
Yeah, that's right.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:58.926
I'm spitting a
freestyle up in here.

00:49:58.926 --> 00:50:00.300
I'm hoping I can
give a shout out

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.150
to all of the
software engineers.

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:05.570
Maybe software engineers could
see the problem and solve them.

00:50:05.570 --> 00:50:07.520
They might even help us
deal with the next gen

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.550
nuclear problem.

00:50:08.550 --> 00:50:10.760
That would be
pretty dope indeed.

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:12.480
That way we can
reciprocate, and that way

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:14.021
we wouldn't have to
wait for freaking

00:50:14.021 --> 00:50:15.390
Microsoft and Bill Gates.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:16.510
You guys can solve it.

00:50:16.510 --> 00:50:17.330
Come on, quick.

00:50:17.330 --> 00:50:18.324
You better analyze it.

00:50:18.324 --> 00:50:19.990
I love this company,
because it's always

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:22.650
coming up with massive
new surprises indeed.

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:23.460
Yeah, that's right.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.940
I'm always just saying, yes.

00:50:24.940 --> 00:50:27.000
And I got to give a shout
out to my homebody who

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.860
gave a shout out to Bangladesh.

00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:31.090
Bangladesh, man, they
got some serious sea

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:32.400
level rise problems.

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:35.340
I think in this country,
we've got a lot more options.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.380
That's why, indeed, I'm just
always flipping these trees,

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.930
but that is a good case for us
having moral responsibilities

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:43.900
for the people who
didn't cause the problem

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:45.820
but suffering the consequences.

00:50:45.820 --> 00:50:48.720
That's why the climate deniers
are full of a lot of denseness.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.430
Yeah, indeed, I'm
flipping the free,

00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.150
but even if I make a little
mistake over the rhythm,

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:56.110
that's mutation and evolution
introducing randomness

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:57.229
into the system.

00:50:57.229 --> 00:50:58.020
Yeah, that's right.

00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.820
Freestyle, you
know I'm a monster.

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:01.880
Check out the
simultaneous transcription

00:51:01.880 --> 00:51:03.340
up on the teleprompter.

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.040
That's right.

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:04.610
That's right.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:06.740
It's crazy for her
when I bust a free.

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.440
There is no translator
on Earth that

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.730
could ever freaking keep up with
me, as I keep on spitting this.

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.260
Yeah, I'm analyzing it.

00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.180
Freestyling it.

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:14.980
Yeah, that's right.

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.540
My freestyle's
full of surprises.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.420
But my freestyle ain't
free not even to me,

00:51:19.420 --> 00:51:22.760
because I am restraining
what I say simultaneously.

00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.720
And people, freedom ain't free.

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:26.230
Freedom involves sacrifice.

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:29.470
If pollution causes harm,
pollution should have a price.

00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:31.110
People, freedom ain't free.

00:51:31.110 --> 00:51:32.910
On its own, freedom is chaos.

00:51:32.910 --> 00:51:36.780
I want freedom like Picasso,
not like a baby with crayons.

00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:37.820
Freedom ain't free.

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:39.780
Yeah, I hope you
like my freestyle,

00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:42.770
even though you know
it's not entirely free.

00:51:42.770 --> 00:51:43.290
Peace out.

00:51:43.290 --> 00:51:46.449
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:46.449 --> 00:51:47.490
BABA BRINKMAN: Thank you.

00:51:51.990 --> 00:51:53.600
All right.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.060
Here comes the grand finale.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:55.560
Look.

00:51:55.560 --> 00:51:59.100
Somebody told me that
climate is changing.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:03.802
And all we can do is chill
out and watch as it warms.

00:52:03.802 --> 00:52:05.510
BABA BRINKMAN: (RAPPING)
Somebody told me

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.810
that we can reverse it
by changing the stuff

00:52:07.810 --> 00:52:10.900
we buy in stores, but
the stakes are enormous,

00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.200
talking forest fires and storms.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.970
So I'm thinking that
we can make changes

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.950
by changing the climate of
the norms, of what's cool

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:19.390
and what's taboo.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:21.339
We have been in
this place before.

00:52:21.339 --> 00:52:23.130
It's kind of like
segregation in the South,

00:52:23.130 --> 00:52:25.230
before MLK kicked in the door.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:27.360
It's kind of like
apartheid in South Africa

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.292
before Nelson
Mandela walked free.

00:52:29.292 --> 00:52:30.750
It's kind of like
gay people trying

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.500
to get married in the
States before 2015.

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:37.660
Those laws all needed changing,
and so do the laws we have now.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.890
Only this time, the laws
are passing oppression

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.780
down to your grandchild.

00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:44.550
Now it's someone in a coastal
city and a developing nation

00:52:44.550 --> 00:52:47.640
being treated unequal, because
one meter of sea level rise

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:50.330
displaces 100 million people.

00:52:50.330 --> 00:52:52.050
But the climate is changing.

00:52:52.050 --> 00:52:54.570
It doesn't feel the same
as it did five years ago.

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:56.410
People are starting
to open their ears.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:57.340
They're ready to hear.

00:52:57.340 --> 00:52:58.330
So here we go.

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:01.000
We know there's a limit to the
emissions our atmosphere can

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.020
safely carry.

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:03.160
So go tell people.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.530
That's the carbon budget.

00:53:04.530 --> 00:53:06.550
Anything above it
has to stay buried.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:08.840
And that's going to take a
little bit of everything,

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:10.830
a little bit of
civil disobedience,

00:53:10.830 --> 00:53:13.100
a little bit of
disruptive technology,

00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:15.930
a little bit of digital media,
a hell of a lot of protecting

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:18.960
forests, and restoring
one's law to the ground,

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.040
and a total moratorium on
coal fired power plants.

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.080
Shut them down.

00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:25.640
And the fracking of
natural gas is just as bad

00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:27.020
when you factor production.

00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.730
Every ounce you burn is
an act of destruction,

00:53:29.730 --> 00:53:32.875
an act of injustice that
we are responsible for.

00:53:32.875 --> 00:53:35.230
But what can individuals do?

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:38.800
Well, the climate is sensitive
to forcings and socially so

00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.600
are you.

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.530
That's the climate of norms.

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:42.240
Look at us.

00:53:42.240 --> 00:53:43.374
We're social animals.

00:53:43.374 --> 00:53:44.790
Whether or not
your neighbors have

00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:47.355
them is the best predictor of
you putting up solar panels.

00:53:47.355 --> 00:53:49.730
You're not going to stop
people from competing,

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:51.470
or trying to keep
up with the Joneses.

00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:53.660
But you might harness
those competitions

00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.960
for clean energy explosions.

00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.650
So we can get that
technology ready,

00:53:58.650 --> 00:54:00.820
which the whole planet
is going to need, and be

00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:06.341
able to afford when we get these
carbon pricing systems indeed.

00:54:06.341 --> 00:54:08.340
That's going to take a
little bit of everything,

00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:11.410
but we're going to have
to get there if we try.

00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:13.780
When it comes to solving
this, the limit is the sky.

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.230
We've got to make this
change rapidly as possible.

00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:18.600
How about without
crashing the economy

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:20.500
or shutting out
lights at a hospital?

00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:22.460
This is like a civil
rights battle--

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:24.095
a righteous cause
for a generation.

00:54:24.095 --> 00:54:26.700
You got to change laws
when they're unjust.

00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:28.750
You can't just say,
please don't be racist.

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:31.790
And you can't just tell
people to voluntarily embrace

00:54:31.790 --> 00:54:32.680
decarbonization.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:34.980
That's been tried for decades.

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:36.910
Emissions are still escalating.

00:54:36.910 --> 00:54:40.000
I found out about this situation
because my reading habits

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.130
are voracious.

00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:43.000
I thought I could
help get the word out

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.280
thanks to my unique vocation.

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:47.640
I started rapping as
a teenager thinking I

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:48.980
might change the world.

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:51.460
I ended up rapping
for about a decade,

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:53.410
pretty much just chasing girls.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:55.360
But if I change
one mind tonight,

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.390
or I move one person to
action, by my standards

00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:03.252
that would be like the
definition of gangster rapping.

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:07.090
BABA BRINKMAN: Thank you.

00:55:07.090 --> 00:55:11.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:13.880
So that is my
complete-- well, this

00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.480
is a shortened
version of the show.

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:19.100
The show is running off-Broadway
until the end of July at least.

00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:21.060
I'm working on recording
an album version.

00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.810
We'll be doing a
tour in the fall.

00:55:22.810 --> 00:55:25.960
And please spread
the word about what

00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.460
I'm doing-- science
communication via rap--

00:55:28.460 --> 00:55:30.930
but more importantly, spread
the word about climate change

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:33.880
being a crucial thing that
we need to take seriously.

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.880
Have it be a mainstream
political issue,

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:39.450
make it a voting deal
breaker, and just let's

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:41.310
not sweep this under
the rug anymore.

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:42.492
That'll make me happy.

00:55:42.492 --> 00:55:43.200
Thanks, everyone.

00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:44.750
[APPLAUSE]
