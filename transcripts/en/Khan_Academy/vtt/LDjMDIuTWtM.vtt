00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.078
- [Voiceover] We're
asked to graph the circle

00:00:02.078 --> 00:00:05.375
which is centered at 3, -2

00:00:05.375 --> 00:00:08.382
and has a radius of 5 units.

00:00:08.382 --> 00:00:10.646
I got this exercise
off of the Khan Academy

00:00:10.646 --> 00:00:13.978
graph a circle according
to its features exercise.

00:00:13.978 --> 00:00:15.696
It's a pretty neat little widget here,

00:00:15.696 --> 00:00:17.396
because what I can do is I can

00:00:17.396 --> 00:00:19.202
take this dot

00:00:19.202 --> 00:00:20.119
and I can move it around

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.674
to redefine the center of the circle

00:00:21.674 --> 00:00:24.101
so it's centered at 3, -2.

00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:25.714
So, X is 3

00:00:25.714 --> 00:00:29.116
and Y is -2, so that's its center.

00:00:29.116 --> 00:00:30.822
It has to have a radius of 5.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:31.600
The way it's drawn right now

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.842
it has a radius of 1.

00:00:32.842 --> 00:00:34.154
The distance between the center

00:00:34.154 --> 00:00:36.139
and the actual circle,

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:37.904
the points that define the circle,

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:39.401
right now it's 1.

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:41.398
I need to make this radius equal to 5.

00:00:41.398 --> 00:00:42.954
If I take that,

00:00:42.954 --> 00:00:47.621
so now the radius is equal to 2, 3, 4

00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:49.374
and 5.

00:00:49.374 --> 00:00:50.093
There you go.

00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:51.811
Centered at 3, -2,

00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:53.402
radius of 5.

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:55.735
Notice you go from the
center to the actual circle

00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:59.439
it's 5 no matter where you go.

00:00:59.439 --> 00:01:01.934
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:02.314 --> 00:01:05.417
Graph the circle which
is centered at -4, 1

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:09.120
and which has the point 0, 4 on it.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.595
Once again, let's drag the center,

00:01:10.595 --> 00:01:11.988
so it's going to be -4,

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.416
X is -4.

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:15.494
Y is 1, so that's the center.

00:01:15.494 --> 00:01:18.976
It has the point 0, 4 on it.

00:01:18.976 --> 00:01:21.391
X is 0, Y is 4.

00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:22.993
I have to drag,

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:25.060
I have to increase the
radius of the circle.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.953
Let's see,

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:26.789
whoops,

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.018
nope, I want to make sure
I don't change the center.

00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:30.655
I want to increase the
radius of the circle

00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:35.577
until it includes this
point right over here, 0,4.

00:01:35.577 --> 00:01:37.795
I'm not there quite yet,

00:01:37.795 --> 00:01:38.909
there you go.

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.032
I'm now including the point 0, 4.

00:01:42.032 --> 00:01:43.855
If we're curious what the radius is,

00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:45.898
we could just go along the X axis.

00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:49.949
X = -4 is the X coordinate for the center

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:51.958
and we see that this point ...

00:01:51.958 --> 00:01:56.958
This is -4,1 and we see that
1,1 is actually on the circle.

00:01:57.553 --> 00:02:00.432
The distance here is you go 4

00:02:00.432 --> 00:02:01.535
then another 1, it's 5.

00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:03.996
This has a radius of 5.

00:02:03.996 --> 00:02:06.991
But either way, we did
what they asked us to do.
