00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.010
This programming assignment was a way for you to practice creating scatter

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.560
plots, and to make sure that you knew how to work with our

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.890
new data frame. We'll use our GG plot function to get our

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:11.640
histogram, and we'll pass it the two variables that we had in our

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.160
data frame, age and friend count mean. And for the data variable,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.330
I want to pass it PF.FC by age, instead of PF, since this

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.180
was the new data frame we're working with. Writing this code I

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.290
see that I get an error, and that's because I forgot my geom.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.800
I needed to add geom point. So adding that as

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.920
another layer, I can run my code and get the result.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.510
Now we can do slightly better than this plot. Let's

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.520
connect our dots in order of age by using geom line

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.240
instead of geom point. This plot immediately makes clear the

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.495
patterns we mentioned before, as well as the oddness at age

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:47.000
69. We see that through the older ages, our estimates

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.320
are highly variable for friend count mean. They're jumping up and

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.400
down, sort of all over the place. And

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.390
for our young users, they still have high friend

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.670
counts, and for the ages between 30 and 60,

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.993
the mean count is hovering just about over 100.
