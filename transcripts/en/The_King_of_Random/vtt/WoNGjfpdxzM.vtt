In today's video,
we're going to see

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.859
what happens if we take
two popular fast food meals,

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:05.859
and pull all of the
moisture out of them.

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:07.000
What's going to be left?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.460
[Music]

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.000
Guys, we have
a new freeze dryer,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.100
and you have seen this do
at least one really

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.800
weird thing with it so far.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.760
We have freeze-dried steak.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.400
But we want to take it
to the next level.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.715
That was just one thing.

00:00:24.715 --> 00:00:27.068
So now, we're going
to try an entire meal

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:29.718
from two different places
and see what happens.

00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:31.012
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:33.597
We'll get a meal from Wendy's,
including a Frosty,

00:00:33.597 --> 00:00:35.204
and a meal from Panda Express.

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:37.400
We'll throw them both
in the freeze dryer,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.500
and let it run for about
48 hours to really remove

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.200
every drop of moisture.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.900
We've all had fast food,
and we know what they're like,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.100
but we are curious to see
what's going to happen

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.982
if we extract all
of the moisture

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.190
from an entire meal.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.866
And not just like a burger,

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:54.729
we're talking the burger,
the fries, the shake,

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:56.364
and the drinks on the side.

00:00:56.364 --> 00:00:58.400
Like what are those going to do?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.500
The orange chicken,
the chow mein,

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.300
the fried rice, let's do it.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.800
All of it.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.870
We want to try it.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.655
So we've got our freeze dryer,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.500
so next step,
we need some food.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:16.360
[Music]

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.080
All right.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.560
Let's go with a junior
bacon cheeseburger,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.720
a medium french fries,
and a small chocolate Frosty.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.911
Get it in the first order?

00:01:26.911 --> 00:01:28.500
Yeah, that's all one order.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.320
[Music]

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.260
We've got fried rice,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.960
Chow Mein noodles,
orange chicken,

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960
beef and broccoli,

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.876
and with that,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.900
we've got a cup of Pepsi
with some ice still in it.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.740
We've got a Wendy's Frosty,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.400
a junior bacon cheeseburger,
bacon is somewhere on there.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.300
There you go.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.640
That's got lettuce,

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.960
and tomato,
and mayo as well,

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.900
and we've got some french fries.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:10.700
[Music]

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.200
Alright.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.100
Now it freezes.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.400
So is this what we're going to do
for just like the next 48 hours?

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.280
Yeah.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.500
It's been two days
of freeze-drying.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.700
So I think our food is about as
dried out as it's going to get.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.752
Now, I want to see
what happened to it.

00:02:26.752 --> 00:02:29.400
We can see that something
has definetely happened.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.019
We had a Frosty in there,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.360
and now we have an explosion of
Frosty foam all over everything.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.080
And some soda,
a little bit of soda in there.

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:40.000
Soda, I think has also escaped
the confines of its container.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.790
We got a side-by-side
meal here...

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.553
To compare the before and after.

00:02:43.553 --> 00:02:45.259
Yeah, exactly the same meals.

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.400
Got a laptop with the footage
uploaded from our GoPros.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.900
It goes pretty fast.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.430
That--

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.090
Whoa ! Nothing,
nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.970
&gt;&gt; Boom.
&gt;&gt; Gone.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.720
Wait, wait, wait.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.740
What's the other one look like?

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.040
Nothing.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.288
You can kind of see
a little bit of change.

00:03:00.288 --> 00:03:02.797
The letuce, and then
just a lot the Frosty

00:03:02.797 --> 00:03:04.326
and a little bit of soda.

00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:05.000
She's gone.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.400
I kind of watched the--

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.200
Oh, okay.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.700
There it is.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.380
Right there.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.120
Wow.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.100
Holy cow, that
escaped its container.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.780
Oh and look at the mayo
on the burger.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.820
Scrub forward just a little bit.

00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:19.350
There you go.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.900
The mayos inflating
the same way as the frosty.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.200
You can see our soda is starting
to bubble up as well,

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.900
not as much as our Frosty,
not even close.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.614
That is just everywhere,

00:03:28.614 --> 00:03:30.900
and it does look
like it also got

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.900
on our Panda Express
food at the back.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.200
So we may have to dig

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.640
through some Frosty to find
the Panda Express food.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.800
:Let's open it up.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.300
No, it really is all over.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.540
Oh, and it's cold.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.500
Let's try and see
if there's any smell.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.120
Ice melting off the sides.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.448
So it's more snow everywhere.

00:03:51.448 --> 00:03:53.050
Is there supposed
to be snow everywhere?

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.100
That's pretty normal.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.396
Okay.

00:03:54.396 --> 00:03:57.278
In fact, I think there used
to be more ice there,

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:59.234
and then some
of it sublimates off

00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:00.057
as it vacuums.

00:04:00.057 --> 00:04:01.960
You know what we have to do now.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.220
It's too cold.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.620
It's actually good.

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.160
Kind of is.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.440
Like, I like fries crispy.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.860
I usually ask them
to be cooked extra crispy.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.800
This is more extra crispy.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.900
This is crunchy.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.760
Hopefully, I don't--

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.640
Cold.

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.720
Oh no, our poor Panda.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.580
That was in the frosty
to start with.

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.420
The soda is pretty
much just done for.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.100
That I like.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.100
That's really good.

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:33.500
Dehydrated soda starts
out as a crunchy candy,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.900
and then it goes gumming,
kind of like a now and later,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:36.800
and it's so good.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.100
And we put soda in
our regular dehydrator before.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.300
This is a fancier process.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.940
Similar result.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.800
Not quite the same.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.680
All right, Frosty.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.220
[Music]

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.160
It's pretty good.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.460
If you've ever had
astronaut ice cream,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.600
it's very similar to that.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.800
I'm just wearing Frosty.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.680
This is so light and puffy.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.920
Like this thing weighs less
than a marshmallow.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:04.635
Yeah, we should
definitely taste...

00:05:04.635 --> 00:05:07.400
We should taste
the individual ingredients here.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.340
[Music]

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.700
That still tastes
just like lettuce,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.240
just--

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.600
Just crunchier?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.300
It's paper lettuce,

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.150
but the fact that it still
tastes like lettuce is bizarre.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.500
We need to try some of this.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.640
[Music]

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.180
This is freeze
dried beef and broccoli.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.500
Well, just the beef part.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.740
Regular.

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.500
So this is bought
about 20 minutes ago.

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:37.940
[Music]

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.880
Yeah, it's still really good.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.900
When we freeze dried the steak,
those were very very thick,

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.000
and we didn't really
seasom them that much,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.294
so it wasn't a lot of flavor.

00:05:46.294 --> 00:05:46.919
Almost none.

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:47.700
Now, of course,

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.800
fast food is known for just
having a ton of chemicals in it.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.100
This stuff, even
though it's been freeze-dried,

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.620
is still delicious.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.600
[Music]

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.160
How is it?

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.578
Good.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.600
Still tastes good.

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.160
[Music]

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.860
I would eat these as chips.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.200
Just make straight
vegetable chips.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.540
&gt;&gt; I'm gonna cut our cheeseburger,
&gt;&gt; Oh, no.

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.600
our a junior bacon
cheeseburger in half.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.520
All right, here we can see
bread, burger, bacon,

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.760
cheese, lettuce, tomato,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.516
and I think there's
some mayo on top of that,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.700
or there was.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.600
Well, this has cheese as

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.641
much as fast food burgers
have cheese on them.

00:06:28.641 --> 00:06:30.140
Completely freeze dried.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.600
I'm going to try dipping it
in cool water,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.000
and see if it comes back to life at all.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.920
Let that absorb for a bit.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:38.320
Here's a comparison
of our not freeze-dried.

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:40.810
So you can see most
of the same pieces,

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.949
the cheese is definitely
a different texture.

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:43.349
Oh, yeah.

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:44.524
If I wasn't touching this,

00:06:44.524 --> 00:06:46.200
if I didn't know
that it was crunchy,

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.400
this actually looks
more appetizing to me.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.640
That just looks slimy.

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:52.720
This looks fluffier.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.840
Would you like a cup of water?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.400
There's some Pepsi behind you.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.800
How's that working out?

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.200
I'm gonna see what happens

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.200
if we put a freeze
dried french fry

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.680
into some hot water.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.260
[Music]

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.875
I don't know

00:07:13.875 --> 00:07:17.600
how long french fries
should take to rehydrate.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:23.020
[Music]

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.650
The inside is more of the normal
French-fried texture now.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.153
The outside,

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.500
I don't think has quite
finished absorbing the water.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.600
The outside of a french fry is
gonna have a lot of oil in it.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.320
So it may be repelling
the water a little bit.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:36.880
Still crunchy.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.000
So, so far I would say
that other than the Frosty,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:43.200
Panda is holding
up better, I think.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.890
Looks like that so far.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.680
Okay.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.380
Let's add some chicken.

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.360
[Music]

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:51.500
Should we had some broccoli?

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.320
[Music]

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.400
Delicious.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.694
Let's see what that looks
like in ten minutes.

00:07:56.694 --> 00:07:59.900
The freeze dried noodles have
a very styrofoam like texture.

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.900
It has a crunch,
and then like a--

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:08.000
Freeze dried reconstituted chow
mein ramen with orange chicken,

00:08:08.002 --> 00:08:09.694
and broccoli and beef.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.700
[Music]

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.200
Okay.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.000
So we had to switch
out the water,

00:08:18.015 --> 00:08:19.300
because it got
a little bit cold.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.691
And I think all of the flavor
ended up in the water just

00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:23.300
like it would have
like a Ramen broth.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.400
That was a problem

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.180
that we had when we
freeze-dried our steak again.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.260
We lost all the flavor when we
tried to reconstitute it so...

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:32.280
Yeah.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.800
Basically the same problem.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.040
[Music]

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.300
Starting pretty small.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.420
That is not much water,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:43.320
and it's just
sucking it down in.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.000
No mixing.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:44.500
No stirring.

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.040
Just dissolving it.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:09:00.220
[Music]

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:00.800
All right.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.920
Let's try this
rehydrated Frosty.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.200
Now, it's not going
to be frozen,

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.500
because we weren't mixing it
with frozen water.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.700
That's kind of hard to do.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.260
But let's give it a try.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.040
[Music]

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:16.040
It's not bad.

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.920
It's a chunkier
than I like my Frosties.

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.000
Little tiny bits of the frosty
definitely aren't mixed in.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So it tastes kind of

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.700
like you made it
from a powder mix,

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.850
which we basically did.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.280
Yeah.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.599
And just didn't mix
it quite enough.

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:29.900
I'm going to blend up
a Wendy's meal into dust.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.900
Margarita.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:41.440
[Music]

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:42.300
Soup.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:57.520
[Music]

00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.700
That is part of a junior
bacon cheeseburger,

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.340
and several french fries.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:03.380
Hmm, might as well.

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.830
Spoonful of cheeseburger
and french fry powder.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:12.460
[Music]

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.260
Yeah, I'm sticking to my panda.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.700
That's really weird
because nobody's ever thought,

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.000
what does the powdered
cheese burger look like?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.399
But that's probably
what you would guess.

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.600
While I'm eating it,

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.752
it doesn't really feel
like I'm eating cheeseburger,

00:10:24.752 --> 00:10:27.200
and maybe that's just because
the texture is two different,

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.150
that I don't really

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.800
notice the flavors are similar
or something like that.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.177
But I got to say,

00:10:32.177 --> 00:10:34.900
what's a little strange is
after I'm done eating,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.900
I'm just like...

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.400
That, you see the cheeseburger?

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:42.100
Like it feels like I ate
a cheeseburger afterward.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.900
So it does have all

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.840
the same flavors and components
in there, of course.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:48.500
The experience is very different
as you're doing it.

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:50.980
So weirdly enough,

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:53.000
I would say
that out of everything,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.440
the thing that reconstitutes
best is the broccoli.

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.300
This actually turned
out pretty good.

00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.700
Guys, that's not all,

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.184
we've always got more

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:07.060
what YouTube think you
should be watching next.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.160
Hit that bomb in the middle,

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.512
