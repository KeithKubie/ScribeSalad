00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.940
So get your name on the list. iPhone 10 giveaway, see you in April.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.120
Hey guys! I'm Nate. Welcome back to the workshop.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.600
Today we're going to do some fun experiments with fire

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.840
and specifically, we're gonna see if we can create a nice rainbow effect

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.540
using different types of chemicals mixed in with our flames.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.960
We got a couple of different sources of fuel and whole lot of different chemicals

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.620
that we can try mixing into our flames.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:34.360
Let's see which ones give us the best result!

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.600
We had two different versions of this HEET(TM)  product which is designed to help clean your engine.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.880
We've got some 91% isopropyl alcohol and some 70% isopropyl alcohol

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.640
and we'll see what color each of these burns on its own and what we want to try use as our fuel source.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.980
These little pieces of aluminium were just some tea light candles that I popped the candle out of.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.280
Let's see what color each of these burn...

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:18.500
Well we have a very bright yellowish-orange color . We have a sightly more subdued yellowish-orange color.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.540
A very pale yellow-orange color.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.780
And one that in this amount of light, you can barely see but it mostly looks blue.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.320
It's almost invisible. Let's try turning off the lights and see how things look.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.420
Our blue flame is a little bit more visible. It's still pretty clear.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.480
There's not a lot showing up in there, but it's not bad.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.060
I think that the yellow HEET(TM)  gave us the best result for something that we'll be able to use to change the color,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.160
because it had very little bright colour of it's own.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.980
So let's run our chemical experiments using this.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.780
Let's try going in order, the first color we want to try and get is a nice red.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.480
I've heard that the best thing for that is to get some lithium out of a lithium battery and then dissolve that in this liquid.

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:05.640
The lithium in our battery should create a compound which will burn with a bright red, almost magenta color

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.600
Ooh, certainly reacts quickly

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.340
Alright, that seems mostly reacted. Let's see what happens if we ignite this. (May be dangerous)

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.640
Will we get a red flame like we are theoretically supposed to?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.320
Woah!

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:22.580
Yeah we do!

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.780
That's a pretty good red right there, like that is a red,

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.640
almost,

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.040
almost a magenta colored flame.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.600
I am liking that.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.100
Cool, cool cool cool.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.260
We've got red, lets put that out.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.040
Set that aside and let's see if we can get an orange.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.460
Now for orange, my research has said that calcium chloride can give you a good orange colored flame.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.600
And an easy source of calcium chloride is some types of sidewalk salt that's meant for melting ice and snow.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.500
And the stuff that I got is shaped into these little prills, these small little beads.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.660
I'm not sure if it being in the bead form is better or the powdered form is better,

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.960
so we'll try grinding it up into a powder and then we'll see if that gives us a better or worse affect

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.220
than the little beads.

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.400
Alright we'll do a side by side comparison. We'll add a little bit more methanol to the prills,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.200
and we'll also add some into the powder.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.000
That turned orange much faster,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.100
although this is a pretty good orange color as well.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.780
I dunno I think we're kinda getting more off of the powder.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.200
I think either one works really.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.360
You just need enough of the fuel to kind of cover the prills or the powder,

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.940
and then you get a good orange color.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.540
My research says that the best way to get a yellow flame is by burning something with sodium in it.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.120
Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, or sodium chloride -

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.920
table salt.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.380
We're gonna try both of these in the methanol, and we're gonna compare that

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.740
to the bright yellow we were getting as we burned red HEET.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.540
We'll see which one gives us the best yellow color.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.200
Here goes, lookin' for yellow flame.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.820
The red HEET(TM) immediately gives us yellow flame.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.340
Our table salt, or I guess this is sea salt.. but it’s the same stuff just in a slightly different shape.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.580
That's uhhh, kind of a yellow flame, a little bit more orange than this.

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.600
Our baking soda is taking longer to get going, but we’re now starting to get a visible flame on that.

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.720
Again, that’s kind of orange. In my opinion there’s a pretty clear winner here.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.560
The two different versions of the sodium are giving us a yellow-ish flame, and that’s pretty good.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:42.020
..and in fact, I actually kinda like the color of the baking soda the best, but there’s just so much good yellow coming off of the red HEET(TM) fuel.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.000
..and I think we might have to go with that one.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.460
Moving on to green, every resource I could find recommended the same thing... boric acid.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.040
...which is usually found as an ant and roach killing powder.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.200
Let’s just try putting that in, adding some methanol and see what color it burns.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.720
(Oooh!) That is immediately green!

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Like no warm-up time with a blue flame, or an orange flame.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
That went straight to green.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
No wonder everyone recommends this stuff.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It's pretty conclusive - that's green!

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Look like something straight out of Harry Potter.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Next up is blue, and as we saw, the methanol by itself actually burns a fairly blue color,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
but it's not very intense, so I'm wondering if there's anything we can add to try and

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.800
get that blue to show up a little bit more.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.000
Something online suggested that we can use the copper sulfate crystals in this root kill.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.300
and that that could bring out some of the color, so we're gonna try that.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.300
Saw a little flash of green as I lit the one with powder in it.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.300
Pretty much the same effect as the crystallized form.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.800
It looks mostly blue, with little bits of green here and there in it.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.960
Might have a little bit less...yellow streaking which is something we're also seeing in our crystallized one.

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:04.400
Alright, alright. That's, that's almost a turquoise color. So, we'll keep that in mind.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.520
The last color we want to make is violet.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.880
and from what I've seen, the best way to get that color is from burning potassium chloride

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:16.060
Potassium chloride is most easily found in sodium free salt substitute.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.860
Now although this does contain potassium chloride,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.760
it does have other chemicals in it as well, so it may not be a very pure source.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:30.140
That is already a pretty fine powder, so I really don't know how much this is gonna change.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.860
Only one way to know...

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.020
Ooh. That was a nice little burst of purple at first

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.960
It's like... purple mixed with orange, which isn't a color i think about mixing much

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.660
but, it's kinda what it looks like,

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.300
but I think there's more purple visible in it as well

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.200
Maybe a, not so much purple as lavender

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.560
Orange up top, lavender down at the bottom, maybe?

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.300
This little contraption that
