00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:03.503
(Forrest, voice-over]
I have been flying to
San Francisco monthly

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.705
to pick up my son Eric
for our weekends together.

00:00:05.738 --> 00:00:07.407
It seemed natural
that I would invite

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.510
my new lady-friend Shampoo
to join me on my next trip

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:15.048
and voila: membership
in the Mile High Club.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.219 align:end size:59% position:59%
I'm really excited
to meet your son.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:21.754 align:start size:16% position:84%
Yeah.

00:00:21.787 --> 00:00:23.823
- I really like kids.
- Mmm.

00:00:23.856 --> 00:00:25.925 align:start size:38% position:63%
Hey, look...

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:30.730 align:end position:100%
now that we are...
one mile up in the air,

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.566 align:end position:100%
do you want to, uh...
[clicks tongue]

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:35.768
- [laughs]
- What?

00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:38.905 align:end position:100%
[whispers] Let's go have sex
in the bathroom.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:40.740 size:78% position:39%
[whispers] I'm not gonna
have sex in the bathroom.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:42.575
- Why not?
- It's gross.

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:44.844
- What's gross about it?
- People are [bleep] in there.

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:46.612 align:end position:100%
Oh, come on.
This is a short flight,

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.848 align:end position:100%
I don't think anybody is
pooping on the way

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.983 align:start size:63% position:38%
up to San Francisco.

00:00:51.016 --> 00:00:53.853
- Come on.
- Is that why you invited me?

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.923
- No.
- Because I'm a stripper...

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:59.425 align:start position:0%
So I'd be up for that?
Right?

00:00:59.458 --> 00:01:02.829
- No.
- Gross.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.497 align:end position:100%
Everybody on this plane
likes to have sex.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.100 align:start position:0%
(Shampoo)
You know what?
If it was all about sex for me,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.903 align:start position:0%
I would have found somebody
a lot hotter!

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:18.244 align:end position:100%
That is one of
the rudest things

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.512 align:end position:100%
that anyone
has ever said to me.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.981 align:start position:0%
[scoffs]

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:23.316 align:start position:0%
[crying]
I thought you were different.

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.252 align:start position:0%
I thought maybe for once
I met a nice guy.

00:01:27.987 --> 00:01:30.090 align:end position:100%
I'm gonna give you
some space.

00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.494
(Forrest, voice-over)
Rather than turned
on by the idea of sex

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:36.429
in an airplane bathroom,
Shampoo--

00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:40.166
a professional clothes remover,
seemed stunned.

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:42.668
My trip to the Mile High Club
with her was,

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.938
as they say in the travel
business, cancelled.

00:01:45.971 --> 00:01:48.207
I would need to find someone
on this flight

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.276
more sexually adventurous
than a stripper.

00:01:52.077 --> 00:01:54.180
And just when
all seemed lost...

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.587
Uh, excuse me. Sorry.
Sorry to bother you.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.723
Can I switch seats with you
by any chance?

00:02:03.756 --> 00:02:05.558
(man) What?
- I'm in 23D.

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:07.360 align:end position:100%
Just right up there.
Thank you very--ah, thank you.

00:02:07.393 --> 00:02:08.728
- Yeah, that's great.
- Ass[bleep].

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.531
Thank you so much.
It is middle seat.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.633
(Forrest, voice-over)
After pouring out every ounce

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:16.269
of available charm
on to this woman Beth,

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.871
I was clearly,
incredibly enough,

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:21.374
being considered
for admission into the club.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:22.942
- Yes, exactly.
- [laughs]

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.710 align:start position:0%
You can go into space
without being an astronaut.

00:02:24.743 --> 00:02:26.379
(Captain)
We have begun
our initial descent

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.314
into San Francisco
International Airport.

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:30.049
Please return to your seats
and make sure

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:32.685
your seatbelts
are securely fastened.

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:34.787 align:start position:0%
Hey, Beth...

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.790 size:81% position:41%
This is gonna sound crazy.

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:40.626 align:start position:0%
[whispers] I wanna have
sex with you right now.

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.563 align:start size:25% position:75%
[laughs]

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.965
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

00:02:45.998 --> 00:02:47.700
Let's just follow
this moment.

00:02:47.733 --> 00:02:50.670 align:start position:0%
Did you feel it?

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:54.073
- Yeah, I did.
- I knew it.

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:56.309 align:start position:0%
Okay, so, will you
sneak to the bathroom

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.643 align:start position:0%
with me right now
and have sex?

00:02:57.676 --> 00:03:00.279
- So, we gonna [bleep]?
- Yeah.

00:03:00.312 --> 00:03:01.714
[pings]

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:03.149 align:end position:100%
It's just
the seatbelt light's on.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.252
- Yeah, so?
- When we get to the airport

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.588 align:end position:100%
take a cab
to the closest hotel.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.156 align:start position:0%
Listen, I can't wait
that long.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.158 align:end position:100%
Okay, we'll find a place
in the airport.

00:03:12.191 --> 00:03:13.893 align:start position:0%
No, I can't wait
that long, either.

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:15.962
- No, seriously...
- No, it's super dangerous.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:18.164 align:start position:0%
No, it's not
that dangerous.

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:19.899
(Forrest, voice-over)
Beth could obviously disregard

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:22.635
many of societies
guidelines for how to behave,

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:24.904
but not, for some reason,
the seatbelt sign.

00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:26.372 align:start position:0%
I don't wanna do it
in an airport bathroom.

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.507 align:start position:0%
I wanna do it
in an airplane bathroom.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.142
- Seriously.
- Yeah, but the seatbelt sign

00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:31.711
- is on--
- Who cares about the sign?

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.746
- Seriously?
- Let's go to a nice hotel.

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.881
No, thank you.

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:37.784
Oh, my God.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.486 align:start position:0%
Oh, hey, what about
another flight?

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.119 align:end position:100%
No, don't touch me!
Okay?
