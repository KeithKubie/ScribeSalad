00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.980
Now that we've talked a little bit more about changing coefficients and sine

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.748
issues of inequalities. Let's try a few problems. For each one of these

00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:11.814
solutions, I've already written the x for you. And in the orange box, I'd like

00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:15.910
you to fill in an inequality sign, so greater than, less than, greater than or

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.030
equal to, or less than or equal to. And in the teal box, I'd like you to fill in

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.103
the number that this is relating x to.
