00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:03.150
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
sure you're going

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.274
to have a great experience.

00:00:04.274 --> 00:00:06.560
Thanks for making it
all the way over here.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.450
There's not much
history to this talk.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.340
I just got extremely jealous of
Zack meeting Chris a while ago,

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.629
so I decided to reach out and
invited him over to Google.

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:16.129
He came.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.070
He brought his friend
Ben over, and they're

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.460
going to tell you more
about what they do today.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.066
CHRIS BURKARD: Just want to say
thanks so much for having us.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.440
It's such a cool
experience to be

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.922
able to share what
we love to do.

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:28.755
I'll give you a little
bit of the background

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:32.710
on kind of myself and Ben
and sort of what, I guess,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.480
culminated us being
able to be here.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.146
We're also really lucky to have
a lot of the editorial staff

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:40.770
from "Surfer Magazine,"
Brendan Thomas,

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.555
the editor, as well as Grant
Ellis, the photo editor,

00:00:43.555 --> 00:00:44.930
are going to be
joining us today.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.346
They're a little
stuck in traffic.

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:49.210
And we also have Josh
Mulcoy, who's featured here.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.530
This was the photo that was on
the cover of Surfer Magazine.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.326
And I would say that for myself,
like 10 years of surf travel

00:00:56.326 --> 00:00:57.950
to some of the coldest
places on earth,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.050
this is pretty much
the culmination of all

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.510
these experiences and
what's made it incredibly

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.020
special and amazing is kind
of this moment right here.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.660
So my name is Chris Burkard.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.310
I'm a senior staff photographer
for "Surfer Magazine."

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.820
I've shot for Surfer for
about six years on staff

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.370
and I've been lucky
enough to travel

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.530
for them all around the world.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.910
And a big part of what I
bring to the table for them

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.600
is really planning these larger
editorial style expeditions,

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.590
where it's not just
going to Mexico

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.796
for a swell or Tahiti
or something like that.

00:01:30.796 --> 00:01:32.420
It's more about
getting a group of guys

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.920
together and trying to go
seek out somewhere that's

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.300
way off the grid, like
way, way off the grid.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.780
And so these places, in our kind
of endless search for, I guess,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.730
perfect waves or the
ultimate experience,

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.540
you could say has brought us to,
I mean me and Ben specifically,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.670
to Iceland, Norway,
and Kamchatka,

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.594
Russia and South New Zealand
and Alaska and the Alutions

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:57.760
and Aleutians and pretty
much everywhere in between.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.750
So I think for us,
when it comes to kind

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.110
of planning and executing
these experiences,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.030
the coolest thing is
Google Earth actually

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.889
plays a huge role.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:15.770
This place then we went to
the Aleutian Island chain,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.270
it's basically one of the
most remote places on Earth.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.020
It's like this island
chain that stretches

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.050
from Russia to Alaska.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.127
And we'll kind of get
into that in a second,

00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:25.960
and talk about some of
the details planning.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.626
But just to kind of
give the back story,

00:02:27.626 --> 00:02:29.310
it took about three
years to plan.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.573
Would you say that's right?

00:02:30.573 --> 00:02:32.250
BEN WEILAND: Yeah,
three to four years.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.249
CHRIS BURKARD: From like
basically the inception

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.980
of like, clicking on Google
Earth and zooming in as far as

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.470
you can to see some little
whitewashed triangle of wave,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:41.591
to actually being there.

00:02:41.591 --> 00:02:42.840
It was just this long process.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.400
And what we always find,
the hardest thing is access.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.400
Because a big part of
what we're trying to do is

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.360
go to places where
there's no access.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.950
There's six people living on
this island, all natives, one

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.540
white guy.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.470
And basically no cars,
no roads, nothing.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.787
You're basically on foot or on
horseback or on quad riding,

00:03:01.787 --> 00:03:03.620
trying to find out how
to get these beaches.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.560
So access plays a
huge part in that.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.400
Let me just take you through it.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.358
What was really cool was
that "Surfer Magazine"

00:03:10.358 --> 00:03:13.550
did a big pretty awesome
tour with this film.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.230
And for us, something that
me and Ben really like to do

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.250
is kind of make a
little more intimate

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.701
and create an experience
that's a little more

00:03:20.701 --> 00:03:21.450
behind the scenes.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.908
So that's why doing a slide
show has been super fun for us,

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:26.299
to come and talk about the
moments behind the film.

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.090
And I guess in a way
when you see the film,

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.290
it'll set you up for how rad
an experience it really is.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.800
So this photo here,
this is basically

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.830
the view from our lodge.

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.469
This is-- what's the
mountain right there?

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.260
BEN WEILAND: The
mountain's called Vsevidof

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:43.540
there on the left.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.915
CHRIS BURKARD: Yeah, and I
think that the little mountain

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.380
range is Recheshnoi, I think.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.360
And It was so funny, because,
you know, like anyone else,

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.850
we're researching these places
and trying to look into them,

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.126
like, all we would see
is just like grey photos.

00:03:56.126 --> 00:03:57.500
Like, sunny day
in the Aleutians,

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.708
there's just like foggy
skies, couldn't see anything.

00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:01.740
We had no idea there
was even a volcano here

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.570
in this place, let
alone visible, actually.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.360
So it was pretty ironic
to see this thing

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.672
from our view on some
of these clear mornings.

00:04:09.672 --> 00:04:11.130
One of the things
that was crazy is

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.400
we kept, when we
were researching,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.024
we kept getting coming across as
really ominous moniker, Cradle

00:04:15.024 --> 00:04:16.589
of Storms, Cradle of Storms.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.970
What is the Cradle
of Storms, right?

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.220
And what we realized is that,
basically, storms start here.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.880
This is where some
of the biggest

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.710
swells and storms in
the world that pound

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.976
Hawaii and pound
California, and they

00:04:29.976 --> 00:04:31.600
travel all way down
the coast and build

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.990
this long, long period.

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.830
And they just put perfect
surf in Santa Barbara.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.900
When they're here, it's like
the most horrendous, crazy thing

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.340
you've ever seen
your entire life.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.520
And you don't want to
be in the water at all.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.850
But there's these
glimpses, these moments,

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.390
where basically the
storm is passing

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.015
or right before it
comes, where it just

00:04:49.015 --> 00:04:51.210
creates this
momentary perfection.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.160
And usually that
kind of culminates

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.290
inside some little bay
or some little nook,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:58.330
where that swell can really
wrap inside of, and clean up,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.320
and gather itself and stuff.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.710
So that was really
cool to experience.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.070
So, a lot of you are probably
familiar with Dutch Harbor.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.800
It became pretty
well known, because

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.700
of the-- what's that show?

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.010
BEN WEILAND: "Deadliest Catch."

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:12.635
CHRIS BURKARD: Yeah, "Deadliest
Catch" and some of those other,

00:05:12.635 --> 00:05:16.070
I think, like, Alaska,
there's like an SOS show

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.550
about people saving,
getting saved in Alaska,

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:19.290
on helicopters.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.400
It's based there.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.560
So Dutch became really
well known because of that.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.750
And all the other islands are
all very uninhabited, very,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.000
very remote.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.670
Where we were is
right, right here,

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:35.140
basically, in this little
island called Unmak Island.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.340
I think at its peak,
it had about 60 people.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.004
Nowadays, it's like six people.

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:41.420
And so, I think they were a
little nervous because we were

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.670
like a group of six, so if
there was a political vote,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.820
we could have swayed the
majority in some way.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.680
It was definitely-- there
was some blank stares,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.460
and we'll get more into that.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.600
But what really
draws us, I guess,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.210
to these regions is
this, right here,

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.590
this big Aleutian
trench that you see.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.030
And that big trench is what
really creates this opportunity

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.630
for massive waves, massive
waves to smash this coastline

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:12.630
and create opportunities
for incredible surf.

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.850
But with that, also comes some
of the most active volcanoes

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.790
in the world.

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.600
And actually right
where we were staying

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.050
was Mount Cleveland, which is
there, not my photo, stolen

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.300
from Google Earth,
thank you, is one

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.050
of the most active
volcanoes in the world.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.230
So we would basically,
we'd wake up

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.521
in the morning, some of these
clear days, we'd look out

00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:33.320
and we'd see these clouds kind
of looming over this volcano,

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.230
and we'd go to ask
Scott, who is kind

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.350
of our pseudo-guide for a
day or two, what's going on?

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.780
He's like, this is-- that
thing's erupting all the time.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.650
I think it's actually the most
active volcano in the world.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.900
But if you see this little
stretch of land right here,

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.910
This is actually
where our island was.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.940
So it was super interesting
to wake up and see, and just

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.270
be in an area that's
so wild and so active.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.150
And because of this,
the Ring of Fire,

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:58.400
which basically stretches from
South America all the way up

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.900
and through Japan
and everywhere.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.870
It's one of the
places where you get

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.500
some of the best
surf in the world,

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.280
because of how those
tectonic plates,

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.360
and how all those big
steep drop-offs, you know,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.930
submarine canyons create
opportunities for swells

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:14.487
to really culminate
on the coast.

00:07:14.487 --> 00:07:15.945
Last year, just so
everybody knows,

00:07:15.945 --> 00:07:19.690
Kamchatka is this big
peninsula right here in Russia.

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.620
So two years ago,
in 2012, me and Ben

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.941
did a trip there where
we flew to Kamchatka,

00:07:23.941 --> 00:07:25.940
and basically drove around
in like a six wheeled

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.610
military vehicle and
explored for surf there.

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:30.150
So we know the region well.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.850
This volcanic soil, it's like
amazing for building sand bars

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.000
and creating opportunities
for really good waves.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.416
And I think that
we've always been

00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:40.030
drawn to these areas
for some reason.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.309
I don't know why
exactly, but we love it.

00:07:42.309 --> 00:07:44.100
I think it that, this
little elbow up here,

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.391
for some reason, just that
little elbow where those two

00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:49.160
plates meet, that's just
where all the activity really

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.404
happens.

00:07:50.404 --> 00:07:52.570
So, I'm going to turn it
over to Ben, who's actually

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:54.486
going to speak a little
bit about Google Earth

00:07:54.486 --> 00:07:56.050
and how much of a
role that's really

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:01.020
played for us and the
planning and, yeah--

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.619
BEN WEILAND: So Google Earth
is one of the big tools

00:08:04.619 --> 00:08:06.910
that we used when we were
planning the whole trip ahead

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.640
of time.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.670
It's just provides
a lot of inspiration

00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:14.010
because we spend
hours just zooming

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:16.560
in on all these areas thinking,
like, man, what's there like,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.752
it kind of makes your
imagination run wild.

00:08:18.752 --> 00:08:20.210
And you're like,
man, I wonder what

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.420
it would be like to actually
walk along those beaches

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.260
and check it out.

00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:28.560
So basically, there you can
see the Aleutian Arc and some

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.440
of the pinpoints that we put
down for places that we've

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.320
spotted and could
have potential waves.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:34.520
So--

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.811
CHRIS BURKARD: We don't know
if, when we're researching

00:08:36.811 --> 00:08:38.622
if it's just like a
pile of reef that's

00:08:38.622 --> 00:08:40.163
sticking like 80
feet above the water

00:08:40.163 --> 00:08:41.672
or if it's like a perfect wave.

00:08:41.672 --> 00:08:44.130
We're kind of trying to use
our experience from other trips

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:46.210
we've gone on and places
that we've photographed

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.239
and stuff we've seen from the
air to kind of culminate that.

00:08:49.239 --> 00:08:51.280
BEN WEILAND: Yeah, and so
here's a zoomed-in view

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.321
of the island we were on.

00:08:52.321 --> 00:08:54.770
And you can see kind of
the volcanic activity.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.970
You got the two volcanoes
there on the left

00:08:56.970 --> 00:08:59.170
and then a huge crater
on the right and that

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.876
kind of makes up the island.

00:09:00.876 --> 00:09:02.250
And then where we
were staying is

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.320
where all those
pins are located.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.500
And so that's all just
possible locations

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.390
that we mapped out beforehand,
kind of thinking that's

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:11.650
potential areas that
we want to go to.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.930
And like Chris said, one
of the biggest challenges

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.910
is just being able to
get down the coast.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:18.500
And on an island
has no roads, you're

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.150
just trying to figure out how
realistic is it to actually

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:22.742
be able to get
down to the beach.

00:09:22.742 --> 00:09:24.950
And one thing that was really
great about this island

00:09:24.950 --> 00:09:26.783
is that you have the
Bering Sea on the north

00:09:26.783 --> 00:09:28.870
and the North
Pacific on the south,

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.442
separated by three miles.

00:09:30.442 --> 00:09:32.400
So you have a lot of
options to be checking out

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.570
weather systems that are
coming in from both directions.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.760
And you can see there
Nikolski and the route

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.280
that we drove down every day
to the beach to check the surf,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.410
so that's basically
here 3 and 1/2 miles.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.910
So--

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.493
CHRIS BURKARD: I
think it was farther.

00:09:47.493 --> 00:09:49.740
I think it was quite a
bit farther than that.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.948
BEN WEILAND: So I don't know.

00:09:50.948 --> 00:09:53.630
It's like, it's really one thing
to be looking at this on a map,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.900
but then once you get
there, you realize how tough

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.620
it is to actually be able
to access these places.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.330
And here's an example,
on the way back we

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.540
stopped in Dutch Harbor
and one of the pilots

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.210
was flying a mail
route and he invited

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:08.981
us to come along and check
out some of the islands

00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:09.980
that he was flying over.

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.250
And so he actually flew
us around this island,

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:13.670
both sides of it.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.780
And we've got to check
out some of the breaks

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.630
and just realize, when you
see the breaks from the air

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:24.120
and see the cliffs and the ocean
just surging up against it,

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.050
you realize it's one
thing to see on a map,

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:27.591
but it's a completely
different thing

00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:29.330
to actually experience it.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.180
CHRIS BURKARD: You've
got a question?

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:31.880
On the map.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.464
Oh, so like, so good
left, good right.

00:10:33.464 --> 00:10:35.421
BEN WEILAND: That would
be like a left breaking

00:10:35.421 --> 00:10:37.140
wave or a right breaking wave.

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:40.085
So when you catch a wave, you'd
be either surfing to the left

00:10:40.085 --> 00:10:40.960
or the right and so--

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.668
CHRIS BURKARD: Like,
we might see a cove,

00:10:42.668 --> 00:10:44.510
and it might have like
a line of white wash

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:45.620
coming in on one side.

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.270
And we'd be like, OK,
that's a right hand, that's

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:48.394
a right handed wave, right?

00:10:48.394 --> 00:10:49.990
So it's good for us to know.

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:52.400
Like, a lot of times
we're planning like,

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.420
what type of waves we're
going to be looking at.

00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:56.539
It also really effects
who we bring with us.

00:10:56.539 --> 00:10:58.080
You know, like, if
it looks like it's

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.910
all beach breaks
and super mellow

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:02.336
than we might pick a crew
that is a little more

00:11:02.336 --> 00:11:02.960
versed in that.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.251
But if it's all like waves
that break a mile and a half

00:11:05.251 --> 00:11:07.810
out to sea and they're like
monstrous, maverick-style

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.160
waves, then we might pick
a little different people.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.700
BEN WEILAND: Yeah.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.860
CHRIS BURKARD: But one thing
I love is this right here,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.110
you can see all these
different potential spots.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:22.070
And this entire island
has surf, all across it.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:24.340
But the only places
that we ended up really

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:29.430
surfing the entire time was
here, here, and here and here.

00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:31.720
These four spots.

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.780
Never made it to this cove.

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:35.100
Never saw good waves over here.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.340
It was like 80 feet and
like, "Victory at Sea,"

00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.480
the scariest thing
I've ever seen.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.030
All these waves
were just too windy.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:45.712
It's incredible how little
we got to experience,

00:11:45.712 --> 00:11:47.420
because we've barely
scraped the surface.

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:49.850
And that's one of the
things that keeps us going,

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:52.060
keeps us ticking,
and keeps us excited.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:54.910
So I mean, and kind of
just the exciting thing

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.680
for being able to
know what's out there.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:58.820
I've been to a lot of
places on the earth that

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:02.140
are just by 1,000 years
too early in terms

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.870
of like being well
groomed for waves.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:07.250
Like Iceland, for example,
it's just, it's so raw.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:10.960
And the Aleutians, they've--
I feel like, all the setups,

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.350
all the reefs, everything is
like perfectly established

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.270
for good waves, which
is really interesting.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:18.770
So try to move forward
here, because I don't we

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.770
don't have tons of time.

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:22.997
But picking a crew is super
crucial to me and to Ben

00:12:22.997 --> 00:12:24.330
when we're going on these trips.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:25.550
And one of the things
that we always do

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.000
is we'll talk about in the film.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.140
And it kind of sounds a
little serious and ominous,

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.015
but in reality, when
you're driving in

00:12:31.015 --> 00:12:33.510
on a quad, every
day, 20, 30 miles,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.220
checking different spots.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:37.980
And you're at a beach
and on a location

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:39.700
where there's no
medic, there's nothing.

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.760
There's barely anybody
that speaks English.

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:45.790
And it's like-- nor anyone
that wants to speak to you,

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.550
you really have to be-- you put
your trust in these people's

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:49.050
hands.

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:54.310
So you're not just picking
folks who are kind of young kids

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:55.974
who you think are
going to be great

00:12:55.974 --> 00:12:57.640
and you're going to
get great photos of,

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.765
it's more about you're
picking people who you trust

00:12:59.765 --> 00:13:01.670
and who are your friends,
and who, you know,

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:05.250
if stuff hit the fan,
that you could trust them

00:13:05.250 --> 00:13:06.680
and that they could
get your back.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.050
So on of the people we
brought was Alex Gray.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:13.237
And he's a total
lunatic, amazing person.

00:13:13.237 --> 00:13:15.570
I'm glad he's not here because
we could poke fun at him.

00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:19.811
But he's definitely like
the hero of this film,

00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:21.310
just because of the
waves he surfed.

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.710
But he can surf anything
from two foot to 50 foot.

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.290
And the guy was
first in, last out,

00:13:27.290 --> 00:13:30.920
really awesome person
to have on board.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.180
And just a total character.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.850
And then, Josh Mulcoy, who we
are able to have here today.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.200
Josh is-- I've been able to
travel with him for years.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.620
He actually has probably spent
more time in cold regions

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.250
than anyone else on
the entire planet.

00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:45.208
He was like the first
person to surf in Alaska.

00:13:45.208 --> 00:13:47.100
He got the keys to
the city in Yakutat

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:50.220
for opening up surfing
to the entire state.

00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.690
So it's always cool
to travel with Josh

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:55.582
because of that knowledge
and that experience

00:13:55.582 --> 00:13:56.540
he brings to the table.

00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:01.040
He definitely knows how to
stay out in the cold and last.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.891
And he always picks
the right wave,

00:14:02.891 --> 00:14:04.890
as you can see from the
cover photo that he got.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.100
He knows how to wait it out.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.370
This was this little defunct
cabin we stayed for a day

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:14.520
while we waited out surf on
another part of the island.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.694
Pete Devries, this
guy is incredible too.

00:14:16.694 --> 00:14:19.110
He probably spends more time
in a wetsuit than anyone else

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.620
that I know.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.650
He lives Tofino, British
Columbia in Canada.

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:27.140
And he basically is like
one of the best surfers who

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:29.040
was born and bred in cold water.

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:33.830
And the guy loves-- not afraid
of going fast, that's for sure.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:38.480
So when you arrive
in these islands,

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:41.165
you know pretty immediately
that you're somewhere distant,

00:14:41.165 --> 00:14:42.290
you're somewhere different.

00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:45.350
We actually heard this
great piece of advice right

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:46.100
when we got there.

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:48.270
They said, there is an
absolutely gorgeous woman

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.440
behind every tree
on this island.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.770
And we never saw a single tree
the entire time we were there.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.510
So it was interesting
to be somewhere

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:57.200
that was like a proper tundra.

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.590
It's not just like, there's
some trees and it's like tundra.

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.580
This landscape is meant
to handle and work

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.830
with just the harshest
conditions you can throw at it.

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.246
BEN WEILAND: Because
you just have

00:15:08.246 --> 00:15:10.330
wind blowing horizontally
at 90 miles an hour.

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:11.940
CHRIS BURKARD: Yeah, rain
does not come this way.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.670
It comes like this.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:14.836
BEN WEILAND: Anything that
sticks up from the ground

00:15:14.836 --> 00:15:16.524
is going to be
flattened pretty soon.

00:15:16.524 --> 00:15:18.690
CHRIS BURKARD: Including
houses and everything else.

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:21.670
So when this plane landed, and
we're unloading our surfboards

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:25.360
and they're loading reindeer
sheds and boxes of meat

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:28.720
that hunters have come back
from the island with their kill,

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.330
it was definitely a
unique experience.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.100
They're looking at us.

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:31.900
We're looking at them.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:33.570
We didn't really know
what was happening.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:35.028
And pretty much,
they just told us,

00:15:35.028 --> 00:15:36.910
just take your surfboards
out, throw them

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:39.570
down the middle of the plane,
which if anybody's ever

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:41.102
traveled with surfboards,
it's like the last thing you

00:15:41.102 --> 00:15:41.230
want to do.

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:42.230
It's like fiberglass.

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:43.160
They're sensitive.

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.450
We're just shoving
them in the middle

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.074
and the whole plane's vibrating
and fiberglass is like flexing.

00:15:47.074 --> 00:15:49.880
And we're like, this is
super great for a fire hazard

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.630
if we have to exit the plane.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.460
But we got there in one piece.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.420
You don't take a flight
here on a regular basis.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.710
This a chartered, special
flight that they just

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:03.390
do every once in a while and
it's totally weather dependent.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.422
So you have no idea whether
you're going to stay

00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:07.880
and you're going to be able to
leave the day that you want,

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:08.620
or you're going
to be stuck there

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:10.110
for two weeks, which
totally happens.

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.550
In fact, while we
were there, they

00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:13.977
had one run, that they
flew all the way from Dutch

00:16:13.977 --> 00:16:15.560
over to this island,
and just couldn't

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.760
land because the
winds were too strong.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.350
But as soon as we
got in the air,

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:24.517
we realized how-- I was
actually scared at first.

00:16:24.517 --> 00:16:26.850
I was like, man, this is going
to be a barren wasteland.

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:28.266
This is going to be scary.

00:16:28.266 --> 00:16:29.640
But as soon as we
got in the air,

00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:31.530
we realized how beautiful
these islands were.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:36.740
It was incredible to see the
water table in such an amazing,

00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.250
one shot, just seeing it
from the snow, all the way

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:42.070
to these waterfalls
pouring into the ocean.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:46.260
And we realized really quickly
that same idea, of like,

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:48.580
wow, this is going to be
challenging, the access

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.576
and what we're going to
be able to-- how we're

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:52.200
going to be able to
get to these spots.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.180
Because we flew in on a day
when there was amazing waves.

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.450
It was actually
pumping, surf was just

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:58.842
pounding the coastline.

00:16:58.842 --> 00:16:59.800
It was a beautiful day.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.937
The sun was coming out.

00:17:00.937 --> 00:17:02.520
And we knew immediately,
we were like,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.680
wow, how are we
going to get there,

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.784
how are we going to
get from here to there.

00:17:06.784 --> 00:17:08.700
Are we going to be able
to get there on quads?

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.408
Are we going to have
to hike or whatever?

00:17:10.408 --> 00:17:13.682
So that's always kind of our
constant battle, I feel like.

00:17:13.682 --> 00:17:15.140
And we realized
really quickly that

00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.560
was going to be a huge one here.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.790
And as we're flying in,
we're passing volcanoes.

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.400
We're passing
these amazing bays.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.639
So, just for reference
too, over here

00:17:23.639 --> 00:17:25.180
is right where we
were staying and we

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.950
would ride our quads to here.

00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.330
And then this is the
bay that we surfed in.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.830
And we never even got to
surf in this bay or this bay.

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.455
And it's kind of--
I look at this photo

00:17:33.455 --> 00:17:34.538
and it hurts a little bit.

00:17:34.538 --> 00:17:38.210
Because as we flew in, right
over this mountaintop or ridge

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:41.090
line, was this
perfect left wave just

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:43.210
peeling down this
point break, as good

00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:44.754
as it gets anywhere
in the world.

00:17:44.754 --> 00:17:46.170
And we saw that
thing and our jaws

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:48.290
dropped and we saw another
reef over here and another wave

00:17:48.290 --> 00:17:48.460
here.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.810
And we were just like,
how do we get there.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:51.260
And we never even
got to go there.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.330
So it's just like, the untapped
potential is so amazing.

00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:57.402
And I think that's what inspired
us to go to these cold places

00:17:57.402 --> 00:17:59.860
because there's no Starbucks
coffee on the beach or parking

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.800
meters.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.640
So the Aleuts, the natives,
the natives are amazing.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.450
They have such a
great sense of humor.

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:10.750
This plane-- basically,
they pulled this plane

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:13.600
right up to where
the landing strip is.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.789
Because it had like,
basically crashed down

00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:17.580
the way, or at the end
of the landing strip

00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:18.930
and they just thought it
would be funny to bring it up.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:20.580
So it's the first thing you see.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:22.780
Another ominous
moniker for us as we're

00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:24.020
already going into this.

00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:27.540
And now, they just use
it for bullet practice.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:29.900
BEN WEILAND: Well, it's
crazy, that culture, I guess,

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.190
has been on the island
for over 8,000 years.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.310
So it was just crazy
to see that tradition,

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:38.300
like when they go
out and hunt, it's

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.241
like, they'll shoot
a seal or something

00:18:40.241 --> 00:18:42.240
and bring it back for the
whole-- all the elders

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.110
and divide it up with all
the people in the town.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.560
CHRIS BURKARD:
Yeah, I mean, they

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.810
would tell stories about
when they would cross the ice

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.887
bridge as kids and
stuff like that.

00:18:49.887 --> 00:18:51.220
AUDIENCE: Are they Inuit people?

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.030
CHRIS BURKARD: What's that?

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:52.890
AUDIENCE: Are the Inuit?

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:53.530
CHRIS BURKARD: They are Inuit.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:54.347
BEN WEILAND: Aleut.

00:18:54.347 --> 00:18:55.180
CHRIS BURKARD: Yeah.

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:56.513
FEMALE SPEAKER: So interrelated.

00:18:56.513 --> 00:18:58.535
CHRIS BURKARD: I
guess it's different.

00:18:58.535 --> 00:18:59.910
It was pretty
interesting though.

00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:02.097
It was definitely like,
they were closed off.

00:19:02.097 --> 00:19:04.430
And then they got kind of
excited on what we were doing.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.825
And they invited us over
for some festivities.

00:19:06.825 --> 00:19:09.740
And it got pretty fun.

00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.140
So one thing you
realize, we landed

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:14.209
and we just saw the
beauty of this place.

00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:16.000
And my first impression
was like, man, this

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.150
is like-- we're seeing
all these homes, right?

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:20.530
And we're not seeing any people.

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.540
And it's just like
satellite dishes and homes,

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:24.290
and all these like
barricades for weather.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.915
And it looked like
somewhere that you'd

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:28.060
get sent to have alien
testing done on yourself

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:30.420
or something like that, like
just kind of like something

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.220
a sci-fi novel.

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:34.430
And we just realized
everything was ravaged by wind.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.920
Storms moved so fast
through this region.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.730
In the film, when you
watch it, you'll see,

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.188
there would be sunny days where
it's offshore and beautiful

00:19:43.188 --> 00:19:44.680
and we had t-shirts on.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.440
And then literally 15 minutes
later, it would be hailing.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.940
And some of those sessions, it
looked like totally different

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.391
days within the same half hour.

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:54.390
And so the storms, they
would just move through.

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:57.550
And they would be so
ferocious and fast and quick,

00:19:57.550 --> 00:19:59.900
that it was really
an exercise in kind

00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:02.645
of like being prepared and
living simply and understanding

00:20:02.645 --> 00:20:04.020
that everything
you need is going

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.307
to be on this quad with you
for the day, everything.

00:20:07.307 --> 00:20:09.390
And it was-- because I
mean you're going to a ways

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:09.740
out there.

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.810
And we would get flat tires.

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:11.601
We would get stuck.

00:20:11.601 --> 00:20:14.600
We would fly over the
handlebars or almost get--

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.140
who knows what would happen.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.060
So this is the town.

00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:20.920
Like I said, it was
built to have 60 folks,

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.000
I think, at their
peak and now it's six.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.180
So you have nice options of
like some geometric domes,

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:29.040
or a Russian Orthodox
Church, or I don't even know,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.940
like barricaded fish homes.

00:20:30.940 --> 00:20:33.900
That's basically your
options for living there.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:36.870
But it was amazing
how they made it work.

00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:38.240
It was beautiful.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.860
And I think that, almost more
important that the weather,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:44.340
it was really beautiful to
see how the animals interacted

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:45.570
with this landscape.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:47.100
They completely own the place.

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.870
Like without a doubt, not
afraid of us, not at all.

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:55.200
Most of the animals are
brought there, horses, cows

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.464
and buffalo.

00:20:56.464 --> 00:20:57.380
BEN WEILAND: Reindeer.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.536
CHRIS BURKARD:
Reindeer, for military.

00:20:59.536 --> 00:21:01.910
Because, in World War II, this
was a big military outpost

00:21:01.910 --> 00:21:03.670
on the other side of the island.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.440
So they brought all of these
cows to feed the troops.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:07.670
Troops left, the cows didn't.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.390
The cows were completely feral.

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.127
And they basically
owned the place.

00:21:11.127 --> 00:21:11.960
I'm not even joking.

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.700
It's not like happy
cows from California.

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:18.280
These are like scary,
huge, massive cows.

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.290
Like we're taking a big
wide berth around them

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.720
because we don't want to
get anywhere near them.

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.440
Because the one thing
they told us, is like,

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.750
if anything is to charge you,
it's going to be the cows.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.916
And they would look at us
and just like vibe us out.

00:21:27.916 --> 00:21:29.980
Like, they didn't care
that we were there.

00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.630
And we're used to
going to places

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:33.710
that are like-- as
surfers, you go to places

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.640
where there's local breaks and
you're kind of are respectful,

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.630
but this was like the
animals' local break.

00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:39.510
They didn't want to see us.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.240
They didn't care
that we were there.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.630
They just completely
were so over us,

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:46.150
to the point where it was like
we knew that they were like,

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.330
just get out of
here, just beat it.

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:50.750
And every time
we'd go outside, we

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.670
would see another
element of that.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:56.940
It was really funny to
the witness actually.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.630
But like I said, the
reindeer, the way

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.434
that the animals interact with
the landscape is beautiful.

00:22:02.434 --> 00:22:04.350
These are sheds that
were pulled off the road.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.030
They weren't all kills.

00:22:06.030 --> 00:22:08.610
There's actually tons of them
that just die everywhere.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:10.645
So you pull them off so
you don't run over them

00:22:10.645 --> 00:22:12.940
with your quad and
impale yourself.

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.050
Which can be a bummer, so.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.250
So there's-- yeah, you'd
see just cow skulls.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.654
You'd be driving-- or
something that would-- I

00:22:19.654 --> 00:22:21.570
think at one point, we
saw like an animal that

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.430
was off the trail,
had just died.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:27.740
And then a day later,
it was just bones.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:29.650
But just the weather
and the animals

00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.540
just come and just
take everything.

00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:34.070
It was really interesting to
see that like circle of life

00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:36.000
becoming really, really small.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.360
So birds are a big reason
people go there as well.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.960
The bird life is
actually beautiful.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.626
I've never gotten
that close to an eagle

00:22:41.626 --> 00:22:44.430
and felt like it was going
to attack me at chest height.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.202
But they're amazing
all over the island.

00:22:47.202 --> 00:22:48.910
And one of the coolest
things that I saw.

00:22:48.910 --> 00:22:50.865
I included this photo
just because I loved it.

00:22:50.865 --> 00:22:52.490
We were checking
out-- you can't really

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:54.450
see because of how
bright the screen is,

00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.960
but there's this really
good right hander we surfed.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.710
And then in the
foreground, there's

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.334
this fox, just
mowing on seaweed.

00:23:00.334 --> 00:23:02.250
And I don't think he's
a vegetarian by choice,

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.500
but it was just really
interesting to see their habits

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.370
they've gained from
being in this climate.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.527
So this is Alex holding up
one of the sheds for scale.

00:23:11.527 --> 00:23:12.610
These things were massive.

00:23:12.610 --> 00:23:14.330
I think that they
would say, I guess,

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:19.850
42 point sheds they would have,
just crazy, crazy antlers.

00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:22.410
So Alex isn't here, so we can
pick on him, which is great.

00:23:22.410 --> 00:23:24.826
Because I think you'll get an
idea for how much of a freak

00:23:24.826 --> 00:23:25.960
he is in the movie.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.670
But as time went
on, he definitely

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:30.210
embraced the culture and
the landscape the most.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:32.520
I think it took its toll
on him a little bit,

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:35.710
to the point where, by the
end of the trip, it was like,

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:38.755
I think we all looked like
extras from a "Mad Max Beyond

00:23:38.755 --> 00:23:41.180
Thunderdome" film or something,
just like totally feral,

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.800
like blending it
with the landscape.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.980
I forgot to mention, but
the first day we got there,

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.230
all of our food was missing.

00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:50.440
BEN WEILAND: Oh, yeah.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:53.050
So we had to bring all of
our own food to the island.

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:55.290
And so, the day before we
left, out of Anchorage,

00:23:55.290 --> 00:23:58.550
Chris and I had to load up four
shopping carts full of food.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:01.220
And we were just trying to
jam to get it to the hanger.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.970
CHRIS BURKARD: Going
shopping for six guys

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:05.429
on a high protein diet for
two week was super fun.

00:24:05.429 --> 00:24:07.470
BEN WEILAND: And then when
we got to Dutch Harbor

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:10.606
on the plane, Chris
is like, oh my gosh,

00:24:10.606 --> 00:24:12.230
I feel like the plane
should be fuller.

00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:14.170
It's a small space
already and it

00:24:14.170 --> 00:24:16.090
seems like we have more
space than I expected.

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:19.740
It turns out they forgot to
load half the food on our plane.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.442
So we land there with like

00:24:21.442 --> 00:24:23.150
CHRIS BURKARD: --noodles
and like ketchup

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:25.810
and all the things you don't
want to eat for two weeks.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:27.475
So they gave us
seal and reindeer.

00:24:27.475 --> 00:24:29.350
And we ate that for the
first couple of days.

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.600
And I mean, I'm all
for trying anything,

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.370
but that stuff gets old fast.

00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:36.820
I mean, it's not
like good game meat

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:38.650
that gets mixed in
with some yummy fats.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:40.600
Here it's just
straight reindeer.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.390
is It was really intense.

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:45.310
But it was amazing.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:48.526
It was cool to have that
instant kind of infiltration

00:24:48.526 --> 00:24:49.150
of the culture.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:52.790
So we realized pretty quickly
that quad travel was probably

00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:54.340
our favorite way to explore.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.490
It was amazing to
see this landscape

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:57.882
on four wheels like this.

00:24:57.882 --> 00:24:59.590
And it was really such
a cool experience,

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:00.540
to be able to,
like I said before,

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.590
pare everything down
to just what you need.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.920
And you can see, we've got
our axe, we've got our rope,

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.739
we've got our pump.

00:25:07.739 --> 00:25:10.280
Because, at first, I think we
were kind of just excited like,

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.834
oh man, we're going
to be manly men.

00:25:11.834 --> 00:25:13.000
We're going to go out there.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.870
We're going to have everything
we need and look really cool.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:16.870
And we're going
to film all of it.

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:18.453
But then, all of a
sudden, we realized

00:25:18.453 --> 00:25:20.770
we need every single thing
we brought and then some.

00:25:20.770 --> 00:25:22.520
Everything came into play.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.820
And you can see how sunny it
is and how clean our clothes

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:29.250
are and this was like, the
first day, first afternoon.

00:25:29.250 --> 00:25:31.180
But this is our commute.

00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:32.790
Basically there's the town.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.360
There's the town.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.780
That's Mount
Cleveland right there.

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:37.620
You can kind of see.

00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.740
I don't know if you can--
you probably actually

00:25:38.740 --> 00:25:40.781
can't see it on this
screen, but you can on mine.

00:25:40.781 --> 00:25:43.050
But it's like this right
here, it's kind of blown out,

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:47.890
anyway that was the commute
through this amazing grassland,

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.100
wetland area.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.300
So this is Scott.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.230
Any person who's
living on an island

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.419
with six natives
who's a white dude

00:25:58.419 --> 00:25:59.960
is definitely running
from something.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.190
So I don't put it past him.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.930
He's an amazing
human being, but I'm

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.680
sure he's got some
kind of a sketchy past.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.290
But he was amazing.

00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:08.620
He guided us for the
first couple days.

00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:10.160
And one of the
craziest experiences

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.410
was, we got to the end
of this beach, right?

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:14.822
And it was just this, you
know, they cliffed out,

00:26:14.822 --> 00:26:17.030
and we're like, oh man, we
see a wave way over there.

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.875
And he's like, no sweat guys.

00:26:18.875 --> 00:26:19.750
Let's just follow me.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.450
I'll guide you through
the tide pools.

00:26:21.450 --> 00:26:24.550
And so we actually took the
quads into the tide pools.

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:27.110
And I'm not talking like
tide pools like fun,

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.860
there's drop offs of like
15 feet on both sides

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.544
and we're driving on this little
tiny canyon with our wheels

00:26:33.544 --> 00:26:34.960
like a foot and a
half underwater.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.860
And he's like, go right at
this rock and go left here.

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:37.830
And we're trying to remember it.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:39.490
And his dog's just
jumping around.

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:41.710
It was the sketchiest thing
I think we've ever done.

00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:42.880
And he's like, by the
way, just don't do it

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:45.254
at high tide or low tide,
because then you'll get caught.

00:26:45.254 --> 00:26:47.380
We're like , great, OK.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:48.720
It was touch and go.

00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.240
But Scott was amazing.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.260
One of his claims to fame
was like, what was it?

00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.751
Like he hadn't eaten meat in--

00:26:53.751 --> 00:26:56.000
BEN WEILAND: Oh, in like,
20 years-- store-bought meat

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:56.590
in 20 years.

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:59.180
Because he just kills everything
himself on the island.

00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.680
CHRIS BURKARD:
Anything, apparently.

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.360
So this is kind of
morning commute.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.580
I love this photo.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.460
You couldn't have even post
it if you tried, because these

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:10.000
are whale vertebrae and they're
just washed up on the shore.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.549
And they're like so
incredibly heavy.

00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:14.090
But it was just
amazing, like I said,

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.050
once again that circle of
life coming back to that,

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:18.386
and being able to see that
right in front of your eyes

00:27:18.386 --> 00:27:19.135
as it's occurring.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.400
BEN WEILAND: Front row parking.

00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.650
CHRIS BURKARD: I'm not sure
if you can see the volcano

00:27:25.650 --> 00:27:29.140
but that's Vsevidof.

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:33.242
And then that's
Recheshnoi right there.

00:27:33.242 --> 00:27:35.450
So this is kind of the daily
commute, the surf check.

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:37.330
We'd come up on
these tall bluffs.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:40.042
And we'd see over the
top of these hills

00:27:40.042 --> 00:27:41.500
and be able to
check out the waves.

00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.170
We'd be able to
see from here, this

00:27:43.170 --> 00:27:46.126
is actually the right hander
that Josh got the cover on,

00:27:46.126 --> 00:27:48.000
the one, the slide I
showed in the beginning.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.340
And then over here, we can
look over and see this left

00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:51.180
and then we could
see another wave.

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:52.950
So we have this
big expansive view,

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:55.080
be able to just pull
up on top, like king

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.329
of the mountain kind of thing.

00:27:56.329 --> 00:28:00.010
It was such an incredible
way to explore.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:01.450
But the rain did set in.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.717
So we keep talking
how beautiful it was.

00:28:03.717 --> 00:28:05.800
We have to remember, this
is the cradle of storms,

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.520
so it is definitely weather.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:11.634
My absolute favorite
part in this film,

00:28:11.634 --> 00:28:13.300
which I'm so stoked
for you guys to see.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:15.091
There's a scene and I
want you to remember.

00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:16.864
It's when we're sitting
inside the cabin.

00:28:16.864 --> 00:28:18.780
You can just see the
windows vibrating, right?

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.000
There like-- it's looks like
a horror film type of thing,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.810
where you don't even
know what's happening.

00:28:24.810 --> 00:28:27.050
But literally we're sitting
inside this warm cabin

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.750
and the windows are vibrating
like 12 inches back and forth.

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.334
It was crazy.

00:28:31.334 --> 00:28:33.000
You don't even want
to get next to them.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.291
You're hearing this noise them.

00:28:34.291 --> 00:28:37.320
And they're like double
paned glass windows

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:41.030
that are meant to basically take
80 to 100 mile an hour winds.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.087
It was just unreal.

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:43.420
And so we sat through the storm.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:45.461
And it was one of the
coolest things that we saw.

00:28:45.461 --> 00:28:47.060
But definitely this
track, it changed

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.120
from being this epic, flat,
dry track to this muddy,

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.310
just getting stuck
every ten feet

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.310
track that was kind of brutal.

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.635
This is Ben.

00:28:56.635 --> 00:28:58.760
He kind of got the worst
of it on a couple of goes.

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.580
I think one time we actually--
we did this half day

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.520
trip to go explore
these highlands.

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:05.680
And all of a sudden, like
we're like, OK, cool,

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:06.270
we're all taking off.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:06.600
Later.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.860
And I look back, and Ben's
not there, and I'm like,

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.590
oh I wonder, you had to
go get your back pack.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:11.620
BEN WEILAND: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:13.697
I left my backpack like
two miles off the trail.

00:29:13.697 --> 00:29:15.780
CHRIS BURKARD: It fell off
the quad from bouncing.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:17.070
So that's something that
would happen always.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.680
Like stuff would fly out.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.240
And then your quad didn't start
and you got kind of stuck.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:21.990
BEN WEILAND: Yeah.

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:25.246
So these guys just left me
because they just took off

00:29:25.246 --> 00:29:26.620
and I'm here like
trying to start

00:29:26.620 --> 00:29:28.370
my quad and nothing's happening.

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:30.490
I'm like oh my gosh.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:32.360
I'm going to have to
hike five miles in

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.560
and there's a hail storm coming.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:36.155
Finally it started up.

00:29:36.155 --> 00:29:37.530
CHRIS BURKARD: It
was interesting

00:29:37.530 --> 00:29:39.446
though because you'd
ride across these tracks,

00:29:39.446 --> 00:29:41.800
and one day it would just be
super mellow, no big deal.

00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:43.229
And all of a sudden
it would rain.

00:29:43.229 --> 00:29:45.770
All this water would collect
and it would form a small river.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:47.260
And you'd be riding along,
looking over at your friends

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:48.770
and smiling, and they'd
just endo, and almost

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.080
fly off the front of the thing.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.550
It was kind of a-- and
you've got to be on your toes

00:29:52.550 --> 00:29:53.591
constantly.

00:29:53.591 --> 00:29:54.840
And this is Ben, just kidding.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:57.710
Completely worked.

00:29:57.710 --> 00:30:00.140
So this is Pete, another
time we got really,

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.682
really stuck, not just
partially stuck, I mean,

00:30:02.682 --> 00:30:05.170
we're talking like,
you're going head first

00:30:05.170 --> 00:30:07.520
into little pile of mud.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:10.210
So we thought it would be smart,
given that Alex has the biggest

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.840
quad, we'd hook up the quads
and Alex would basically

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:14.250
pull him out.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.380
And so that's what we did.

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.462
Alex jumped on, revved
it up, starting to go,

00:30:18.462 --> 00:30:19.920
it started to pull
him out, I think

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.919
he looked back and stood
up, and all of a sudden

00:30:21.919 --> 00:30:24.030
his quad started to
tip back, and all

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.820
I remember seeing
is Alex scrambling,

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.720
jumping off the
quad, surfboards are

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:31.630
like crunched on the ground,
fiberglass is flexing.

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.690
All I imagined was
like him getting

00:30:33.690 --> 00:30:35.510
impaled by his fin or
something like that.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.360
And just like the
trip being over.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.680
But luckily that didn't happen.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.017
I love this photo too.

00:30:40.017 --> 00:30:42.350
I always look back at the
images think of the subtleties

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:43.391
because this one's great.

00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:44.760
He's got his full wetsuit on.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.940
And he didn't surf.

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:47.940
And that just shows how
bad the conditions were,

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:50.270
that we were like-- at
first we were like, great,

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.620
we're going to go down
to the beach, suit up,

00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:52.495
it's going to be rad.

00:30:52.495 --> 00:30:54.440
All of a sudden, after
four days of weather,

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.120
we're just like sitting
up at the cabin,

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.030
warm, suiting up
in full wet suits

00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.970
because we never knew
what's going to happen.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.860
Another thing, we had this
delusions of grandeur.

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.930
First day we were like,
ah, these little bridges

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:07.430
are so cool.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:08.096
Let's film them.

00:31:08.096 --> 00:31:11.124
These are rad, us going
over these little rivers.

00:31:11.124 --> 00:31:12.540
And all of a sudden
it would rain,

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.510
and these things were mossy.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.843
And you'd start to drive over
and your whole entire quad

00:31:15.843 --> 00:31:17.680
would start to
slide off sideways.

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.660
So you have to hit
them going faster,

00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:22.160
so you could kind
of plan your escape.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.694
And we would just
slip off and you

00:31:23.694 --> 00:31:24.860
could see the thing flexing.

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.260
It has like 85 boards on it.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.760
And this is one of
the things that I

00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.020
think made it hard to access
the other spots, right?

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:31.160
Was--

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.159
BEN WEILAND: The rivers.

00:31:32.159 --> 00:31:33.910
Yeah, I mean there's
Ike bays all over

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:34.951
that we wanted to get to.

00:31:34.951 --> 00:31:36.933
But there's just
rushing water and we

00:31:36.933 --> 00:31:39.330
would have had to build our
own bridge to get there.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:40.580
CHRIS BURKARD: We kind of
like brought the stuff,

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.079
but we're were just like-- we
would spend eight hours trying

00:31:43.079 --> 00:31:47.080
to build a bridge to a
wave that might not exist.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.680
That was definitely
tough, when you

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:52.080
knew there was such
good surf right there.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.600
So this kind of the aftermath.

00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:56.070
If you remember back to that
sunny, bright photo and he's

00:31:56.070 --> 00:31:57.610
smiling and all happy.

00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.202
And this is like
30 hours on a quad.

00:32:00.202 --> 00:32:02.410
Your arms at the end of the
night, we'd be like this.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:04.285
And you just couldn't
even move because you'd

00:32:04.285 --> 00:32:06.090
have so much vibration
going through you,

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.381
that you'd just be so famished.

00:32:07.381 --> 00:32:12.450
But mud head to toe, amazing
new Aleutian wax job right here.

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:16.080
It was intense,
to say the least.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:20.520
So we definitely realized,
exploring this island by quad

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.070
was amazing.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.820
The landscape, the
way it changed.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.994
I've never seen anything
quite like it actually.

00:32:24.994 --> 00:32:26.410
You'd come across
these bays where

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:28.118
there'd be just sand
dunes and these sand

00:32:28.118 --> 00:32:30.049
sculptures out of
nowhere and then cliffs

00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:31.590
that would drop off
for 100s of feet.

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:33.900
And then you come
into a little kind

00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:35.952
of, almost like a
volcanic valley,

00:32:35.952 --> 00:32:37.660
silt valley where it
would be black sand.

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.520
And they told us
stories of places

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:43.015
where there be like
beaches that would have

00:32:43.015 --> 00:32:44.390
thermal activity
under the beach.

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:47.917
And you could dig away the
sand and create your hot tub.

00:32:47.917 --> 00:32:49.000
We never got to that spot.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.510
So next time.

00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:53.410
But in terms of the
waves, the quads

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:55.400
were-- this was what
really made it amazing.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.380
Being able to just
show up to these spots

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:00.630
and to see this incredible
perfect setups that would just

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:04.070
reel across these reefs.

00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:06.655
As a photographer, being
able to zip around from spot

00:33:06.655 --> 00:33:08.680
to spot and be able
to kind of cruise

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:12.179
over and explore these different
waves, and just get from one

00:33:12.179 --> 00:33:13.470
mile to the beach to the other.

00:33:13.470 --> 00:33:15.200
It was incredible.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.060
This is probably one
of my favorite shots

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:19.340
from the trip too.

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:21.060
This is Josh about
to paddle out.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.620
I think this is Alex, getting
the first wave of the sunrise.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:25.430
We woke up super early
this day because we

00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:26.929
knew it was going
to be clear and we

00:33:26.929 --> 00:33:28.630
were so excited
to catch a glimpse

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.330
at clear skies in the Aleutians.

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.087
And it was frosty on the ground.

00:33:32.087 --> 00:33:33.420
And there's birds flying around.

00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:36.079
I don't know if you remember,
on my cover photo, one

00:33:36.079 --> 00:33:37.620
of the feedback,
some of the feedback

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:39.330
that Grant gave me
actually was like, yeah,

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:41.788
people keep asking me if we
Photoshopped this bird in there

00:33:41.788 --> 00:33:44.307
because it was like so
perfectly poised in the shot.

00:33:44.307 --> 00:33:46.140
And you look back through
some of the photos

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:49.420
and you see these little
birds flying around everywhere

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.320
in this landscape, that
just would, I think,

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.990
trump anything else
that's going on.

00:33:52.990 --> 00:33:55.050
And to us, I think,
that's what makes

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:57.960
these places so
exciting and amazing.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.200
So this is the same day
too, just like I said.

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.110
Same session.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:02.760
It had hailed.

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.430
It had rained.

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:04.870
The waves were still perfect.

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.300
And it just kind of
kept going forward.

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.420
So to we're wrapping
it up here, but I

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.682
couldn't leave without talking
about the surf a little bit.

00:34:12.682 --> 00:34:14.015
The waves there were incredible.

00:34:14.015 --> 00:34:17.219
I've never seen, I
think, anything like it

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:18.553
in terms of potential.

00:34:18.553 --> 00:34:20.219
This was the first
day this little right

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:21.460
hander that we surfed.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.659
And actually this
session, we got here--

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:25.620
BEN WEILAND: This
was the first day.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.316
We had no idea this
was going to happen.

00:34:27.316 --> 00:34:28.690
We kind of thought
the first day,

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:30.620
this was going to be
as good as it gets.

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.287
It was right before sunset.

00:34:33.287 --> 00:34:34.870
CHRIS BURKARD: Guys
were like cracking

00:34:34.870 --> 00:34:36.110
like celebratory beers.

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.631
And we're high-fiving and
we'd be like, we can go home.

00:34:38.631 --> 00:34:39.130
We did it.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.844
Like people are going
to be so excited.

00:34:40.844 --> 00:34:42.219
Because when you
travel this far,

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:44.400
and sometimes if you
just get mediocre surf,

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.642
let alone great
surf, you're excited.

00:34:46.642 --> 00:34:48.850
I mean, at least for us,
we're like, there's a story.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:49.770
There's something.

00:34:49.770 --> 00:34:53.010
So to get this wave that was
like an overhead barreling slab

00:34:53.010 --> 00:34:55.770
that would be notable anywhere
in the world was amazing.

00:34:55.770 --> 00:34:59.050
And it was in the middle
of the Aleutian Islands.

00:34:59.050 --> 00:34:59.800
It was incredible.

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.508
Me and Josh actually,
on the flight over,

00:35:01.508 --> 00:35:03.870
we're like, man, so many
trips, the first is the best.

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:04.620
Let's not blow it.

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:06.770
So we like literally,
just as soon as we landed,

00:35:06.770 --> 00:35:09.340
we were on quads, didn't even
unpack, just went to the beach.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.260
And we lucked out
and got this session.

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.920
The second day, we
showed up and we

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.670
saw this left a little
bit down the beach.

00:35:14.670 --> 00:35:16.280
And we were like, oh,
wow, look at this set up.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:16.950
This is perfect.

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:20.050
It was like ruler edge, which
means when the wave breaks

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:21.980
along a stretch of
reef that's so perfect,

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.890
it's like it was
drawn in with a ruler.

00:35:23.890 --> 00:35:26.270
There's not a droplet
of water out of place.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.420
And we were thinking, this
could be a really rippable wave.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.509
And all of a sudden, as
time went on, the next day,

00:35:32.509 --> 00:35:34.050
swell picked up,
the winds picked up,

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:37.550
it just became this
perfect barreling machine,

00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.230
like something out of
Indonesia, like some reef.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.942
I've never seen
anything quite like it.

00:35:42.942 --> 00:35:44.400
This is one of my
favorite moments.

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.382
We never even surf this wave.
it was just another unnamed kind

00:35:47.382 --> 00:35:48.465
of peek in the background.

00:35:48.465 --> 00:35:50.920
But you can see our set up here.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:54.090
Quads parked right in
front, these big headlands.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:57.210
And I mean, in
terms of what we're

00:35:57.210 --> 00:36:00.932
searching for, it doesn't get
any more perfect than that.

00:36:00.932 --> 00:36:01.640
I love this clip.

00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:03.270
I had to include in
there because Alex

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.990
actually holding a
GoPro in his mouth.

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:08.567
And I always kind of identify
like, oh, man, the waves

00:36:08.567 --> 00:36:10.150
are really good if
you're like filming

00:36:10.150 --> 00:36:11.815
GoPro barrels from the water.

00:36:11.815 --> 00:36:14.190
And I never would've thought
that if somebody said, yeah,

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.820
you're going to go to Alaska
and get perfect draining tubes

00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:19.700
and get these water clips
coming out of the wave.

00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:20.500
It was crazy.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.740
So I love this one because
he puts it in his mouth,

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:24.940
and just gets completely
tubed and comes out.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:27.239
And the wave's like
kind of perfect.

00:36:27.239 --> 00:36:29.280
But this wave is probably
the most special to me.

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.960
This photo, actually, I think,
resonates the whole experience.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.610
I love-- you couldn't fake
this moment or pose it.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:37.050
If you've ever
tried to, you know.

00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.850
This is Pete walking
out through the seaweed

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:43.577
on the rocks, bowling
ball size rocks or bigger.

00:36:43.577 --> 00:36:45.160
And as he's walking
out, he takes time

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.830
to look over and
see Alex getting

00:36:46.830 --> 00:36:48.380
the first wave of the set.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.950
And just like going off the
top, shredding this wave.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:53.630
And there's Josh paddling
right back out to another set.

00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:56.725
And there's an empty wave just
peeling off of the distance.

00:36:56.725 --> 00:36:58.600
And not to mention, you
know, a volcano here,

00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.290
which I don't know if you
guys to see the outline of it.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:01.706
It's too bad because
this photo is

00:37:01.706 --> 00:37:04.540
really beautiful with the
sky and this mountain range.

00:37:04.540 --> 00:37:07.930
It's just everything we search
for, everything that we give up

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:09.930
everything to go for and
drain our bank accounts

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.360
and everything.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.070
And so that kind of
led to this session,

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.080
which was so special to me,
being able to travel this far

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.940
and get a moment like
this and capture it.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:22.440
In a way it was like
almost like hard to shoot,

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.180
because you're just so
enraptured by the beauty

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.520
of what's around you.

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:28.211
And a lot of people
have asked, oh,

00:37:28.211 --> 00:37:29.960
is this three different
photos composited?

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.250
But it's actually not.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:36.632
So kind of the icing on the
cake, what was this wave about?

00:37:36.632 --> 00:37:38.590
BEN WEILAND: Yeah, so
this is, I think, halfway

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.720
through the trip, we were all
pretty much sick of the weather

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:42.650
and ready to head out.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:45.000
And you know like,
man, shall we just

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.062
scrap it and try to
get a flight back.

00:37:47.062 --> 00:37:48.520
And then we all
decided, we'll just

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.116
stay a little bit longer
and the very next day,

00:37:51.116 --> 00:37:52.990
we came to this other
bay that we hadn't even

00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:54.450
really looked at.

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.880
And at like 600
yards out to sea,

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.790
there's this boiling
wave that was

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:01.850
kind of just turning
on a reef out there.

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:04.850
And the guys say it and
just started flipping out

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.434
and wanted to give it a shot.

00:38:07.434 --> 00:38:09.350
And I mean, it was just
like the scariest wave

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:12.010
that I'd ever seen.

00:38:12.010 --> 00:38:15.410
CHRIS BURKARD: It's
cool because there's

00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:17.690
that element of bringing
people you trust, you know.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:21.950
It was kind of tough, because
we all want to surf this way.

00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:24.200
We all want to go out there
and I'll want to shoot it.

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.210
And Alex wants to surf it.

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:26.376
And the guys want to go out.

00:38:26.376 --> 00:38:28.340
But you also have to
weigh out the danger

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:30.950
versus the everything else.

00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:33.855
And so it's tough because Alex
put his wetsuit on and paddled

00:38:33.855 --> 00:38:36.480
out there, like two other days,
went out there and didn't surf.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.160
This was basically--
this is a cool photo

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:40.451
because it shows how-- it
was about a half mile up sea.

00:38:40.451 --> 00:38:42.994
You'd walk over this shallow,
shallow seaweed-covered reef.

00:38:42.994 --> 00:38:44.660
Then you'd have to
basically paddle over

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.310
like really shallow reef
for another quarter mile.

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.890
And then it would get to
basically a sidewalk of reef .

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:53.070
Like, you can see the
reflection pool here and just

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.260
how flat that is.

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:58.170
It's basically like a big
massive Aleutian swell

00:38:58.170 --> 00:39:00.020
that's pounding into
a sidewalk of reef

00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:01.100
and just unloading flat.

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:03.550
So if you're anywhere
in this zone,

00:39:03.550 --> 00:39:05.070
it's not where you want to be.

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:07.440
But when we go out
there and we take

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.650
those risks, and it's kind
of everybody's decision.

00:39:09.650 --> 00:39:11.230
And so it was definitely
one of those moments

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.770
where it was like,
if he gets hurt,

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:14.541
our trips, everybody's
trip's over.

00:39:14.541 --> 00:39:16.790
The last thing we want to
do is have to swim out there

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:18.370
and pull him out
of an orcas mouth

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:20.950
or like go out there and drag
his body in off of the reef.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:23.580
Because we're like two days
from a proper hospital,

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:26.090
like for real, like, even
if the chopper can land,

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:28.090
or if a plane can land.

00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:29.020
No medic, nothing.

00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:32.240
So there's an element to making
that group decision that I

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:34.110
think is important here.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:36.680
And it was awesome to
see this all unfold

00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.882
and to see it be so good.

00:39:37.882 --> 00:39:39.090
And this wave was incredible.

00:39:39.090 --> 00:39:41.670
We were up on these cliff that
were 200, 300 feet high so we

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.920
could get a perspective over
because the whitewash was

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:45.960
so big on the inside.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:46.940
And it was perfect.

00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.572
I mean, in terms of good
waves, this as good as it gets.

00:39:49.572 --> 00:39:51.530
And Alex kind of mentioned,
I think, he's like,

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:53.704
this is as good as back
door, which is basically

00:39:53.704 --> 00:39:55.120
the other side of
Pipeline Hawaii,

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:58.010
or like some other waves
in Australia he's surfed.

00:39:58.010 --> 00:40:01.305
It was so cool to see all
three of these guys trade

00:40:01.305 --> 00:40:05.250
off barrels, just back to back
in some of the harshest, most

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.200
remote areas on the planet.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:09.930
So this was like one of
the last days of the trip.

00:40:09.930 --> 00:40:12.376
And for us to get this
experience was amazing.

00:40:12.376 --> 00:40:13.750
There was actually
a period there

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:15.850
where Alex surfed by
himself like 45 minutes.

00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:17.490
And I don't think he fell once.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:19.420
But then when he did
fall, he felt pretty bad.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.954
So everybody gets
a beating once.

00:40:21.954 --> 00:40:22.620
It just happens.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:25.440
I think Pete had a broken
board, had to swim in.

00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:27.720
Alex got pretty worked.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:32.110
And, yeah, but it was worth it.

00:40:32.110 --> 00:40:36.370
I think, in summation, I think
with more than anything, me

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:38.740
and Ben, we know like
right off the bat,

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:41.430
that all we're really doing
is going out there and going

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:42.800
to these places and having fun.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:44.550
You know, we're
not curing the sick

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:46.610
or giving water to
people who need it.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.366
If anything, I think
what our goal always

00:40:48.366 --> 00:40:50.990
is, is just to basically inspire
folks to want to get out there

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:54.570
and to seek more and to
cultivate and appreciation

00:40:54.570 --> 00:40:55.570
for these wild places.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:56.860
Because I think that's
what we've done.

00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.276
And that's what
we've tried to do,

00:40:58.276 --> 00:41:01.650
is go to places that hopefully
we can share with folks

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:04.160
and bring back these stories
and experiences and films

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:04.830
to inspire them.

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:06.690
So the next time they're
booking that flight

00:41:06.690 --> 00:41:08.360
or they're going somewhere,
they're making that vacation,

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.484
to go a little farther, a
little more off the grid.

00:41:10.484 --> 00:41:14.190
And have an experience
that is lasting.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.710
And just push that scope so--

00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:20.300
And I think we're going to
start the film right now,

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.120
but just to introduce
the film, Ben

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:26.030
was the guy that really
is the cinematographer

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:27.590
behind this entire project.

00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:30.150
He is the guy who made
this thing happen.

00:41:30.150 --> 00:41:33.450
And I was lucky enough to help
direct and DP this project

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:35.666
and the guys at
"Surfer Magazine"

00:41:35.666 --> 00:41:37.040
made this thing
when what it was.

00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:40.000
And the filming and the editing
and the music and Bryce,

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.540
who's not able to be here, was
the editor on this project,

00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.970
did an amazing job.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.555
And this, I'll talk
about it after.

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.750
That's it.

00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:53.250
That's an interesting
one, actually.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:56.670
That's such a unique thing
to kind of-- everywhere

00:41:56.670 --> 00:42:00.160
you go, like if you go
to Iceland for example,

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.440
all the sand on the beaches
is like, volcanic soil.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.920
So it's like microscopic.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:08.120
And when the winds blow there,
which they do inevitably,

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.950
it goes places you
never even imagined.

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.030
So like you just can
have-- I've had lenses

00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.590
get completely destroyed.

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:16.710
So it's just so much of it's
just kind of being prepared.

00:42:16.710 --> 00:42:19.110
I think here, it was like
all about having dry bags.

00:42:19.110 --> 00:42:21.490
And kind of being prepared
to get wet, preemptively.

00:42:21.490 --> 00:42:24.300
So when that when it did--
And I usually have a lens

00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:25.250
glass all over me.

00:42:25.250 --> 00:42:28.510
I'll have like some Ziploc
bags and like rubber bands just

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:32.240
for those last minute
moments in your back pocket.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:32.990
That always helps.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.970
Then just having a good kit for
when you're back at the cabin,

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:37.555
to clean everything out.

00:42:37.555 --> 00:42:38.930
Actually there's
one thing that's

00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:40.900
kind of invaluable to me.

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:43.250
There's this product,
it's called a BC bag.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:47.054
And it's like a aluminum
looking like bag

00:42:47.054 --> 00:42:48.470
that has a bunch
of silica packets

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.303
in it that you could
put big electronics in.

00:42:50.303 --> 00:42:51.890
And you basically
like-- in the past,

00:42:51.890 --> 00:42:54.515
when I've gotten equipment wet,
phones, whatever, you put it

00:42:54.515 --> 00:42:55.890
like rice or
something like that.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.757
But that's really
not that great.

00:42:57.757 --> 00:43:00.340
So this thing, you put in there
and you put it somewhere warm.

00:43:00.340 --> 00:43:01.947
And it just absorbs
all the moisture.

00:43:01.947 --> 00:43:02.780
They're really good.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:04.655
I bring like three of
them and they're great.

00:43:04.655 --> 00:43:06.580
Because at some
point, something will

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:07.800
get soaked, no matter what.

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.930
So that's--

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:11.630
Do you have any other tactics?

00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:14.010
Just like blowing on stuff.

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:15.540
BEN WEILAND: No,
mean I just I built

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:18.220
like a little plastic
case for my camera

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.617
so that-- because you never know
if it's going to rain or hail

00:43:21.617 --> 00:43:22.700
or what's going to happen.

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.670
So you just have to
be prepared for it.

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:29.249
AUDIENCE: What's the next
destination you plan?

00:43:29.249 --> 00:43:30.790
CHRIS BURKARD: Ben
and I are actually

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:33.040
go to the Fair Islands
in October, which

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:36.650
is this small, really small
island, like super micro

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:38.410
in between Iceland and Scotland.

00:43:38.410 --> 00:43:41.335
And it's just-- has a
really unique history.

00:43:41.335 --> 00:43:43.710
It's like one of the only
islands in the world they still

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:45.060
whale really frequently.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:50.189
And the culture's like the
closest to basically to--

00:43:50.189 --> 00:43:51.230
BEN WEILAND: Like Nordic.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:52.500
CHRIS BURKARD: Yeah,
Nordic, Norway, and Iceland.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.710
Yeah, Norway,
because like Iceland

00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:55.170
is like the second closest,
but they're actually

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:56.490
the purest bloodlines.

00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:59.580
So it's like really unique,
really hard to access place,

00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:01.220
but just some really
cool potential.

00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:05.480
And a lot of awesome birds and
all that kind of cool stuff.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.980
I think for us,
we're always looking

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.010
for places that are more like
visually beautiful as well.

00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:12.770
So there's that, when people
see it and they engage with it,

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:13.270
you know.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:16.230
Because I mean, by no means
are these the best waves

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:17.710
on the planet at all.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:19.800
But we go there
for the experience,

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:22.330
which is just as important
or maybe more importantly.

00:44:22.330 --> 00:44:24.879
I think it's that
satisfaction from looking

00:44:24.879 --> 00:44:27.170
at something on Google or at
this little white triangle

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.450
or white speck of whatever.

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:31.970
And then going there and
seeing actually be real.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:35.870
It's so important to us.

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:36.560
Anything else?

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:37.330
Yeah, go ahead.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.163
AUDIENCE: First, thank
you for sharing this.

00:44:39.163 --> 00:44:39.800
It was special.

00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.140
CHRIS BURKARD: Thanks for
sitting through it all.

00:44:41.140 --> 00:44:42.780
Sorry, I was long winded.

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:46.100
AUDIENCE: I feel like
I went on a vacation.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.790
CHRIS BURKARD: And froze.

00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:51.010
AUDIENCE: So my question is, how
do you actually manage access

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:53.451
to the land that
you have to go over.

00:44:53.451 --> 00:44:55.950
BEN WEILAND: Yeah, so we signed
a permit while we were there

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:57.408
because the people
that live there,

00:44:57.408 --> 00:44:59.080
they own that entire island.

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:03.700
And so, just when we landed,
we had to fill out a permit,

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.780
and pay for that
for the land use.

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.047
So you have a certain period of
time that you can be there for.

00:45:09.047 --> 00:45:10.880
CHRIS BURKARD: Logistics
is just everything.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.880
And that's kind of what, I
mean, it sounds ridiculous,

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:14.296
like, three years
to go somewhere?

00:45:14.296 --> 00:45:17.940
Well, you only have two
months out of every year

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.480
that you would want to be there.

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:21.980
So we're always trying to make
it work within this two month

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:22.560
window.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:26.017
And then basically, it
just didn't work one time,

00:45:26.017 --> 00:45:27.100
didn't work the next time.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.500
We were just running into access
issues and things like that.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.250
And we finally kind
of made a breakthrough

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:33.320
and met a person who
was like, yeah, I

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:36.370
am a liaison for
the tribe and people

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:39.150
who want to come visit the
island, for hunters normally.

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:41.160
But he's like, yeah,
I can set you guys up.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:43.118
And so that was kind of
our key to get in there

00:45:43.118 --> 00:45:44.270
and make it happen.

00:45:44.270 --> 00:45:44.770
It was cool.

00:45:44.770 --> 00:45:46.610
They were really grateful,
happy to have us.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:49.280
And we always try to be
super low footprint, which

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.080
is like a really important too.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.962
Besides driving quads over their
native land, you know, so--

00:45:55.962 --> 00:45:57.610
Go ahead.

00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.900
AUDIENCE: So how cold
was the water on average

00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.890
and what kind of
suits are we talking?

00:46:01.890 --> 00:46:04.745
Like how thick of
suits do you use?

00:46:04.745 --> 00:46:06.120
CHRIS BURKARD:
What do you think?

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:09.164
BEN WEILAND: Like
low 40s, like 41, 42.

00:46:09.164 --> 00:46:10.580
CHRIS BURKARD:
Yeah, I think there

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.272
was some days-- it all really
depends on the wind too.

00:46:13.272 --> 00:46:14.980
Like the water could
be a certain degree,

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.940
but if you're like, maybe
it's like howling, like 30,

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.210
40 knots too, it can
like, plummet the temps

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:21.240
outside a lot.

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.422
So it feels a lot colder.

00:46:22.422 --> 00:46:23.880
I feel like some
days it would feel

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:26.980
like below-- like
high 30s, you know.

00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:29.412
But it depends on if the
sun was out or something.

00:46:29.412 --> 00:46:31.370
BEN WEILAND: And it snowed
while we were there.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:33.245
CHRIS BURKARD: And some
mornings, it was icy.

00:46:33.245 --> 00:46:34.790
That was kind of brutal.

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:36.820
Five mil wetsuits,
but more importantly

00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.140
than the suit is your
gloves and your booties.

00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.270
Seven mil.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:44.630
Because like the blood leaves
your extremities first.

00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:48.131
And that's really what
gets you really cold,

00:46:48.131 --> 00:46:49.880
is when your hands and
your feet get cold.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:51.588
So you're coming in,
you feel like you're

00:46:51.588 --> 00:46:52.630
walking on wooden pegs.

00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:54.570
You just have no sensation.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:57.529
It's kind of brutal.

00:46:57.529 --> 00:46:59.570
Getting warm before you
go in the water, I think,

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:00.870
is the most important thing.

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.320
We realized that pretty fast.

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.200
Go ahead.

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.260
AUDIENCE: Have you ever
or would you consider

00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.605
submitting your film to
the Banff Film Festival?

00:47:09.605 --> 00:47:10.980
BEN WEILAND: We
thought about it.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.600
CHRIS BURKARD: We think we
missed this year's entry.

00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:16.150
But I've actually--
we've submitted--

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:17.810
we've made another
film actually.

00:47:17.810 --> 00:47:18.760
We brought it here.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:19.510
It was filmed in Russia.

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:21.480
We made a film that trip
too and we submitted that

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.980
to a lot of mountain
film festivals.

00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:24.540
And it's always cool actually.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:29.159
I think me and Ben,
we really like,

00:47:29.159 --> 00:47:31.450
we really like those mountain
towns, those communities.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:33.990
I think we resonate with them
because we love cold places.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:36.531
And so we actually showed this
film in Boulder and in Denver,

00:47:36.531 --> 00:47:37.980
and two sold out places there.

00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:40.414
And they loved it, which
was so cool to see.

00:47:40.414 --> 00:47:42.080
They didn't quite
know like when to clap

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.538
when guys were
coming out of waves.

00:47:43.538 --> 00:47:45.320
But they still got
the overall psych.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:47.460
So it was really
cool to go there

00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:48.750
and to share it with them.

00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:50.400
But actually, we've
done, I've done,

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.520
some work with Banff
Mountain Film Fest and stuff

00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.440
and had a photo submission
from these trips.

00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.950
And there really
great people there.

00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:59.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah, last
year was, I think

00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:01.360
the winner was actually
a surfing movie.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:01.630
CHRIS BURKARD: It was.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:03.005
It was called
"North of the Sun."

00:48:03.005 --> 00:48:05.440
It's this amazing film
about these guys who

00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.990
went to Norway, this like remote
beach you have to hike into

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:10.300
and lived there
for like six months

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.245
and ate like-- I don't
even know what they ate,

00:48:13.245 --> 00:48:14.120
it was like terrible.

00:48:14.120 --> 00:48:14.703
It was gnarly.

00:48:14.703 --> 00:48:15.580
They built a shelter.

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.590
It was really cool.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.540
Was it was a really
inspiring film.

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.325
I'd recommend it
and check it out.

00:48:20.325 --> 00:48:24.332
BEN WEILAND: If you like
films about people suffering.

00:48:24.332 --> 00:48:25.790
AUDIENCE: Who
handles the logistics

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:27.689
for these kind of
trips that you guys do?

00:48:27.689 --> 00:48:29.105
CHRIS BURKARD: Me
and this guy do.

00:48:29.105 --> 00:48:31.300
It's usually like
emails and texts.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.410
And then like we have a
couple-- as we get closer,

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.600
we have a couple of powwows.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:39.160
For Russia, actually was funny,
because we have this footage.

00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:41.160
For the Russia film we
made, we had this footage

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:43.370
from before the trip where
Ben was over at the house

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:47.179
and I'm talking to Lana, who
is like our handler there.

00:48:47.179 --> 00:48:49.470
And she's like talking to us
about bears and bear traps

00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:50.970
and how we were
going to get around.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:52.720
And how we were going
to be protected.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.489
It's always like the
same kind of-- you're

00:48:54.489 --> 00:48:55.530
like talking to somebody.

00:48:55.530 --> 00:48:57.280
And it's like the
connection's really bad.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:59.840
You're getting like
bits of information.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.564
And you never really
know until you get there.

00:49:02.564 --> 00:49:04.230
There was definitely
some like shockers.

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:06.230
BEN WEILAND: You
never really know

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:08.790
who's going to be there on the
other end when you show up.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:10.831
CHRIS BURKARD: You're
hoping like when you arrive

00:49:10.831 --> 00:49:11.720
and the guys like--

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.970
BEN WEILAND: On this
trip, when we landed,

00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:15.150
everybody there was so nice.

00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:17.660
But then we heard like the
next island over, I guess,

00:49:17.660 --> 00:49:21.850
the people that lived there were
pretty hostile to outsiders.

00:49:21.850 --> 00:49:23.170
And we had no idea.

00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:24.740
We could have landed
on that island

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:29.445
with like ten hostile people
who don't want us there.

00:49:29.445 --> 00:49:31.150
We were just fortunate I guess.

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.450
CHRIS BURKARD: That
island's lame anyway.

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:36.697
Yeah.

00:49:36.697 --> 00:49:39.030
AUDIENCE: How much direction
do you do for the athletes?

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:41.564
Like how much of it is like
they go out and do their thing

00:49:41.564 --> 00:49:42.480
and you take pictures?

00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.557
How much is it that you like
have ideas for the shots

00:49:45.557 --> 00:49:46.140
that you want?

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:46.900
CHRIS BURKARD: I think
it's kind of a mixture.

00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:49.380
It's like, it's cool because
usually we align ourselves

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:52.490
with athletes or guys who, they
know what we're looking for.

00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:54.590
It's like we're going
to go surf this wave

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:56.350
with this volcano
in the background.

00:49:56.350 --> 00:49:57.072
We all get it.

00:49:57.072 --> 00:49:58.030
This thing's beautiful.

00:49:58.030 --> 00:49:58.980
Let's do this.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.980
But at the same time,
when they're in the water,

00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:01.870
they're just doing their thing.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:03.703
Like these guys are so
good at what they do,

00:50:03.703 --> 00:50:05.522
that we couldn't even
direct them we tried.

00:50:05.522 --> 00:50:07.730
Sometimes when, if we're
shooting in the water, which

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.130
this trip didn't really
allow, because I think

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:10.950
the landscapes were
so much better.

00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:12.130
But typically when we're
shooting in the water

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:13.480
we'll be working really closely.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:16.010
We'll be like trying to
get one particular shot

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:17.900
or line up in one area.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:20.710
But with this, any of
the direction that really

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.580
came was more like, let's do a
couple of passes with the quad

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:24.080
here.

00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:24.663
Let's do this.

00:50:24.663 --> 00:50:25.820
Let's set up this shot.

00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:29.010
It was all periphery
around the actual surfing.

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:30.570
I think for us,
we're just trying

00:50:30.570 --> 00:50:33.372
to kind of tell the
story around that.

00:50:33.372 --> 00:50:35.830
And sometimes that will take
a couple goes, but the surfing

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:38.771
element of it, it's just
like, whenever there's waves,

00:50:38.771 --> 00:50:39.270
we're on it.

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:41.061
Because you can go to
these places and surf

00:50:41.061 --> 00:50:42.980
like twice, maybe.

00:50:42.980 --> 00:50:43.710
So we were lucky.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.410
That was like I think
five sessions, six?

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.206
What, Josh, how many
sessions was the whole thing?

00:50:49.206 --> 00:50:50.330
AUDIENCE: It was about six.

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.790
CHRIS BURKARD: Yeah,
like six times.

00:50:51.790 --> 00:50:52.440
And I think like--

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:53.480
BEN WEILAND: Out of two weeks.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.063
CHRIS BURKARD: Yeah,
out of two weeks.

00:50:55.063 --> 00:50:56.802
Like long days.

00:50:56.802 --> 00:50:58.910
So it's kind of brutal.

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:02.622
AUDIENCE: How did you guys
start working together?

00:51:02.622 --> 00:51:04.080
CHRIS BURKARD: Ben
was stalking me.

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:09.050
And I just, you know, no-- I
was working for Surfer Magazine

00:51:09.050 --> 00:51:13.370
and Ben was living with one
of the art directors there.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:14.120
BEN WEILAND: Yeah.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:16.161
CHRIS BURKARD: Yeah and
he had reached out to me.

00:51:16.161 --> 00:51:20.310
Ben runs this really awesome
like super funny blog called

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:22.710
Arctic Surf, and it was all
about like Arctic surfing,

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:25.120
like most places you'd
never even be able to go to.

00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:27.740
And just kind of more
scientific perspective of it.

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.140
And so I had seen it and
he reached out to me.

00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:33.120
And we kind of had this similar
interest and got breakfast

00:51:33.120 --> 00:51:35.066
and became best
friends ever since.

00:51:35.066 --> 00:51:35.760
No, I'm--

00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.740
But we had similar
passions, wanted

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.032
to explore different
places and I

00:51:40.032 --> 00:51:41.990
think our first trip was
New Zealand, the South

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:43.490
Island of New Zealand
in the winter,

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:45.990
which was really cool together.

00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:47.740
Did you see it any
other different way?

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:51.300
BEN WEILAND: No, just
totally accurate.

00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:54.200
AUDIENCE: When you guys
find a new wave, how long do

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:57.200
you kind of scope it out, or
is it like once it comes in,

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.259
everybody's tubing out there?

00:51:59.259 --> 00:52:00.550
BEN WEILAND: That's a good one.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:04.052
CHRIS BURKARD: Just kind
of depends, I guess.

00:52:04.052 --> 00:52:05.510
It all the thing
if it's dangerous.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:07.551
It's definitely like we're
not rushing out there.

00:52:07.551 --> 00:52:10.240
We're like trying to get-- like
look at it from every angle.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:12.750
Go up high, go low,
figured it out.

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:13.250
You know?

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.540
I

00:52:13.540 --> 00:52:14.830
BEN WEILAND: Part of
it, like that last wave,

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:15.871
the really dangerous one?

00:52:15.871 --> 00:52:17.760
It's like, it wasn't
even a question.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.210
Like those guys
wanted to surf it

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.543
even though it was so dangerous.

00:52:20.543 --> 00:52:22.650
So they were just
trying to get out

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:25.031
there as fast as they could.

00:52:25.031 --> 00:52:26.530
CHRIS BURKARD: But
at the same time,

00:52:26.530 --> 00:52:28.070
Alex went out there
those two days.

00:52:28.070 --> 00:52:29.570
BEN WEILAND: Yeah,
and walked around

00:52:29.570 --> 00:52:32.120
on the reef when there wasn't
any waves the day before

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:33.490
and kind of looked at it.

00:52:33.490 --> 00:52:34.323
CHRIS BURKARD: Yeah.

00:52:34.323 --> 00:52:35.090
It's a hard thing.

00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:37.450
I think I almost
equate what we're

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:38.990
doing closer to mountaineering.

00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:40.980
Where it's like
these guys want, they

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.610
want to get a first ascent.

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:44.200
They want to climb that peak.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:46.907
And in a way, it's like, has
a similar like relevance,

00:52:46.907 --> 00:52:48.740
because it's like there's
danger and there's

00:52:48.740 --> 00:52:50.890
all these things
that equate to it.

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:54.070
But I think there's precautions
that you have to take.

00:52:54.070 --> 00:52:56.020
And you have to be
smart and evaluate.

00:52:56.020 --> 00:52:58.900
And you have to pick the right
board and the right fin set up.

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:00.546
And it's not so
much like it's super

00:53:00.546 --> 00:53:02.170
scientific but at
the same time there's

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.920
a good amount of preparation
that goes into it so you don't

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.340
just-- Like when he took off
on that first wave out there,

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:12.187
I was like shooting, but
I was holding my breath.

00:53:12.187 --> 00:53:13.770
I mean, if something
happened and he--

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:15.150
like Alex was the
only one out there.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:16.608
Everybody else, we
were all sitting

00:53:16.608 --> 00:53:19.850
inside waiting because we didn't
even think it was surfable.

00:53:19.850 --> 00:53:22.920
He could have gone head first
into some urchin or something.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:25.305
So we were lucky
that it didn't happen

00:53:25.305 --> 00:53:26.680
and the session
ended how it did.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.810
But it could have been
a film about-- The film

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:31.740
could have ended with us going
to the hospital just as easily.

00:53:34.440 --> 00:53:36.920
Luckily that didn't happen.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.350
Any other questions?

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:39.300
Yeah, shoot.

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:41.330
AUDIENCE: How much did
you guys get to surf?

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:43.690
CHRIS BURKARD: How much
did we-- Ben got to surf.

00:53:43.690 --> 00:53:46.099
I did not get to surf.

00:53:46.099 --> 00:53:47.390
That's always the toughest one.

00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:50.064
I think because we invest so--
For me, at least this time.

00:53:50.064 --> 00:53:51.730
For him, it's super
important because he

00:53:51.730 --> 00:53:52.890
writes all these stories.

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:54.900
So like the article
in "Surfer," he wrote.

00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:55.965
It's amazing.

00:53:55.965 --> 00:53:58.090
And that's actually why me
and Ben joined up first,

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:00.150
because he's a
writer by a trade.

00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:03.150
And cinematography kind
of came you second, right?

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:04.800
So, you've got to
get in the water

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.020
and it's important
for you to do that.

00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:06.390
BEN WEILAND: Yeah.

00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:08.639
But the same time, you're
thinking like, oh, man, this

00:54:08.639 --> 00:54:11.870
is like a rare opportunity
that the waves are so good.

00:54:11.870 --> 00:54:13.992
So it's like I need to
capture this as well.

00:54:13.992 --> 00:54:16.450
So as much as you want to be
out there and experiencing it,

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:18.730
it's like you also
have to capture it,

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:21.040
because that window is so short.

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.310
AUDIENCE: Like these
guys are the first three

00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:25.620
to ever surf certain
waves and then--

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:26.620
CHRIS BURKARD: For sure.

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:28.560
AUDIENCE: --you guys missed
out on it a little bit.

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.450
CHRIS BURKARD: I'm
like, I'm not even

00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:30.340
going to worry about
getting in the water.

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.798
Like I just don't
even tempt myself

00:54:31.798 --> 00:54:33.070
and don't bring that stuff.

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:35.180
And so usually if I am
going to get in the water,

00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.680
it's like I'd rather
save my wetsuit

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:39.500
to be warm for when I have
to go swim, rather than be

00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:43.079
cold and go and suffer
when I go back out.

00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:44.120
You have to weigh it out.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.970
Some days you're like, oh,
after they get in, I'll go out.

00:54:45.970 --> 00:54:47.094
And then it starts raining.

00:54:47.094 --> 00:54:48.930
And you're like, oh,
I'm going straight

00:54:48.930 --> 00:54:52.320
to like my bed or something
like that or find shelter.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:52.922
Cool, cool.

00:54:52.922 --> 00:54:53.880
Thank you guys so much.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.850
We really appreciate it.
