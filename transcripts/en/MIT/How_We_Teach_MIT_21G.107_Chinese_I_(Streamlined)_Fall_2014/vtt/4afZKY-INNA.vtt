00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.810
PROFESSOR: The textbook
itself is a good introduction

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.530
for literacy, OK.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.450
But I felt that the-- except for
the first month of this course,

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.205
they have to cram 250
characters-- it's hard.

00:00:19.205 --> 00:00:23.760
But after that, I think
the pace slowed down a lot,

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.830
and I think they
have huge potential,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.170
because the funny things--
teaching heritage learners

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.820
is to discover their potential.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.360
Because for regular students,
they only have this much.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.060
They cannot know beyond
what they don't know,

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.610
because they learn
everything from you.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.560
But for heritage learners,
it's very different.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.500
They have this
foundation-- this much.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.210
You don't know each person.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.690
So they might know the words.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.740
They just cannot simultaneously
or like naturally think

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.250
of, but they heard
this word before.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.260
So for that, it's
their potential.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.850
They have the potential.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.230
So once you discover
their potential,

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.220
they can go really fast.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.490
So what I'd like to
change is I'm going to,

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.690
in addition to this
textbook, because it's

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.600
important for the student
to have a foundation.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.030
Because if they have a
book, they feel much better.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.380
There's certain things
they can control.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.780
I don't want to give
them-- for a higher level,

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.480
we start giving them
individual articles.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.600
For the Streamlined III
or IV, they can handle it.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.460
But for the
beginner, they can't.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.620
They want to have a book.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.400
But in addition to
this book, I want

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.220
to add more text
relevant to the topics

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.810
to the books, which I
did actually last term.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.980
I added two actual
texts talking about how

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.650
to address people in Chinese.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.440
And these are considered
more like authentic material,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.480
and they learn a lot.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.280
And it echoes what they
know about Chinese.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.030
They don't talk about
in their textbook,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.660
because this is a newer text
just recently published.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.210
And I think I will do that more,
add that more into the course.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.080
It's two textbooks.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.620
It's called Modern
Readers, and each book

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.600
has different
levels of the text.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.820
So I use the text
according to their levels.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.770
So for the Chinese
107, Streamlined I,

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.850
I use the one talking
about addressing

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.880
people, which is their level.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.560
Because this is a dialogue.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.850
For the Streamlined II, I start
using social media-- talking

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.770
about personal page,
talking about-- basically

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.670
you want to go on a trip.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.140
You go online and find
people put the blog.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.530
You know, the Chinese, they
put blog and say what you

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.280
need to do before these things.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.850
It's authentic material.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.160
Yeah, so I like
to add those more,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.740
because it's relevant
to their life.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.830
And these old books are
good at learning characters,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.765
but not really--
like they said, well,

00:03:05.765 --> 00:03:10.600
it's good to learn Chinese
cultures, but it's so old.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.470
They always say, it's so old.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.600
I can't imagine those days.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.435
Why do we have to do this?

00:03:16.435 --> 00:03:18.870
I said I know, but
you know, the topic

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.890
is just-- it's out of date.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:27.487
But a good part is it's a
foundation for them to learn.

00:03:27.487 --> 00:03:28.820
Like sometimes I joke with them.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.950
I said, just learn
the characters.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.700
It's good for you.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.270
[LAUGHING]

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.890
So I think I would like to
not get rid of the textbook

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.050
completely, because I think
they will feel panicky,

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.307
because there's no textbook.

00:03:43.307 --> 00:03:45.140
They don't know what's
next they need to do.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.450
Is have a textbook that has
something they can always

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.360
refer to, and then
add more and add

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.660
more of these so-called
authentic material.
