00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.258
- [Instructor] Where we
left off in the last video,

00:00:02.258 --> 00:00:06.095
we saw Julius Caesar had
conquered Gaul as proconsul.

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:08.545
And, near the end of
his term as proconsul,

00:00:08.545 --> 00:00:11.088
the senators in Rome were afraid of him.

00:00:11.088 --> 00:00:14.335
He was this popular,
populist, charismatic figure,

00:00:14.335 --> 00:00:16.945
he had just had these
significant military victories

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:19.471
in Gaul, and they said, all right, Caesar,

00:00:19.471 --> 00:00:22.323
why don't you just leave your
position, leave your army,

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:23.764
and return to Rome?

00:00:23.764 --> 00:00:25.364
Well Caesar is sitting over here saying,

00:00:25.364 --> 00:00:26.983
well, that doesn't really
make a lot of sense.

00:00:26.983 --> 00:00:28.767
If I were just to return to Rome,

00:00:28.767 --> 00:00:30.245
they already are threatened by me,

00:00:30.245 --> 00:00:32.059
who knows what they're going to do to me?

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:34.892
So he decides to cross the Rubicon

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:37.069
and enter Rome.

00:00:38.264 --> 00:00:41.833
And so the Roman senators, they
say, okay, let's get Pompey,

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:44.286
the famous general, who used to be part of

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:46.856
Caesar's triumvirate
but had switched sides,

00:00:46.856 --> 00:00:48.885
to engage with Caesar.

00:00:48.885 --> 00:00:50.273
But Pompey says, you know what,

00:00:50.273 --> 00:00:53.964
I'm not so sure if Caesar
is beatable right now,

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:56.336
he wasn't aware that
Caesar only had one legion,

00:00:56.336 --> 00:00:58.992
maybe there was a trick up
Julius Caesar's sleeves.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:00.242
So Pompey takes

00:01:01.477 --> 00:01:05.074
his forces and retreats
across the Adriatic

00:01:05.074 --> 00:01:07.481
to regroup, with the intent of coming back

00:01:07.481 --> 00:01:09.202
and retaking Rome.

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:10.714
And so you can imagine,
a lot of the senators,

00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:12.850
especially the powerful
senators who were in opposition

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.344
to Julius Caesar, go along with Pompey.

00:01:16.344 --> 00:01:18.916
So Julius Caesar, even
though he's now in control

00:01:18.916 --> 00:01:21.698
of Rome, he knows that
this isn't the end of it,

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:24.324
that a civil war has begun,
that it's only a matter of time

00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:27.728
before Pompey's forces
and these senators return

00:01:27.728 --> 00:01:29.352
and retake Rome.

00:01:29.352 --> 00:01:31.775
So he decides to take the fight to them.

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:35.635
He puts his second in
command, Marcus Antonius,

00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:38.614
often known as Mark Antony,
who was one of his generals

00:01:38.614 --> 00:01:42.710
in the Gaelic Wars, he
puts him in charge of,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.498
he puts him in charge in Italy.

00:01:45.498 --> 00:01:49.812
And then Julius Caesar
leads several of his legions

00:01:49.812 --> 00:01:53.448
off across the Adriatic, and
it's a pretty interesting story

00:01:53.448 --> 00:01:54.330
in its own right.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.296
They cross during the
winter, which was a bit of a

00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:58.579
surprise attack, because no
one would've expected them

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.641
to cross the winter in the Adriatic,

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.318
and to break the blockade of Pompey,

00:02:03.318 --> 00:02:05.599
'cause Pompey controlled the navy.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.996
But he's able to engage
Pompey several times,

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:11.413
and then, finally, in 48 BCE,

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.672
he is able to decisively beat Pompey

00:02:15.672 --> 00:02:19.098
at the Battle of Pharsalus,
which is right over here

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:21.170
in central Greece.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.863
So his enemies, his opponents,
Julius Caesar's enemies

00:02:24.863 --> 00:02:27.885
are now defeated, and
Pompey is in retreat.

00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:30.635
He tries to escape to Alexandria.

00:02:31.537 --> 00:02:35.499
And this is where the story
gets even more interesting.

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.813
So this is a little bit of background.

00:02:37.813 --> 00:02:42.496
In 51 BCE, so right about
there on that timeline,

00:02:42.496 --> 00:02:45.663
and right about here on this timeline,

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:50.559
Ptolemy XII, who was the
pharaoh of Egypt, dies.

00:02:51.732 --> 00:02:52.565
Ptolemy,

00:02:53.463 --> 00:02:54.296
Ptolemy

00:02:55.418 --> 00:02:56.251
XII

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.338
passes away.

00:02:58.338 --> 00:03:00.607
And this is a little bit of background.

00:03:00.607 --> 00:03:03.197
It was called Ptolemaic
Egypt, and even this guy

00:03:03.197 --> 00:03:06.805
was called Ptolemy, because,
you might remember that

00:03:06.805 --> 00:03:09.213
Alexander the Great,
when he conquered Persia

00:03:09.213 --> 00:03:13.368
in the 330s BCE, he also conquered Egypt.

00:03:13.368 --> 00:03:17.123
And then, once Alexander the
Great passed, once he died,

00:03:17.123 --> 00:03:20.538
one of his generals, Ptolemy, Ptolemy I,

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:23.942
established a Ptolemaic Empire over Egypt,

00:03:23.942 --> 00:03:26.046
established Ptolemaic Egypt.

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:28.423
And so this is Ptolemaic
Egypt right over here,

00:03:28.423 --> 00:03:31.541
which was significantly less
powerful than the Roman Empire,

00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:34.016
and the historical accounts say
that they essentially bribed

00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:37.154
their way to maintain their
independence up to this point.

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:41.257
But Ptolemy XII, when he dies in 51 BCE,

00:03:41.257 --> 00:03:42.090
dies in 51

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:44.717
BCE,

00:03:44.717 --> 00:03:48.307
in his will he wants two
of his children to co-rule

00:03:48.307 --> 00:03:51.021
Ptolemaic Egypt, and they were young.

00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:55.188
One of them, Ptolemy,
creatively named Ptolemy XIII,

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.319
was 10 years old.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.761
And his daughter, the other
one that he wanted to co-rule,

00:04:01.761 --> 00:04:05.737
Cleopatra, was 18 years
old, and this is a picture

00:04:05.737 --> 00:04:08.483
of Cleopatra, and this
is now the Cleopatra.

00:04:08.483 --> 00:04:11.240
In popular culture, the movie Cleopatra,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.003
when people talk about
Cleopatra, this is the Cleopatra

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:15.415
they're talking about.

00:04:15.415 --> 00:04:18.110
But, you can imagine, this
co-rule thing doesn't really

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.923
work out that well, and
civil war has broken out

00:04:21.923 --> 00:04:25.440
in Ptolemaic Egypt, with the
supporters of Ptolemy XIII,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.806
you can imagine, this is only
a 10-year-old, young kid,

00:04:28.806 --> 00:04:31.466
it's really the adults that
are probably running the show,

00:04:31.466 --> 00:04:35.770
but the supporters of Ptolemy
XIII are the ones that seem

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.241
to have the upper hand

00:04:37.241 --> 00:04:40.491
at the time that Pompey is running away

00:04:41.413 --> 00:04:43.798
to Alexandria, which is the seat of power,

00:04:43.798 --> 00:04:45.724
a city established by Alexander the Great,

00:04:45.724 --> 00:04:49.604
and the seat of power in Ptolemaic Egypt.

00:04:49.604 --> 00:04:52.604
Now, the supporters of Ptolemy XIII,

00:04:53.507 --> 00:04:55.200
they say, okay, we don't wanna mess around

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.903
with Julius Caesar, who
seems to be quite powerful,

00:04:57.903 --> 00:04:59.266
with his legions.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:01.056
So why don't we do him a favor.

00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:03.810
When Pompey comes, why don't we kill him?

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:04.977
And so, in 49,

00:05:06.516 --> 00:05:09.391
or 48 BCE, this is after,

00:05:09.391 --> 00:05:13.850
remember, Pharsalus, Pharsalus
was in August of 48 BCE,

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.703
you have Pompey leaving,
and in 48 BCE, he is killed.

00:05:17.703 --> 00:05:20.029
So Pompey is now killed

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.862
in 48 BCE

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:25.165
by the supporters of Ptolemy XIII,

00:05:25.165 --> 00:05:28.603
thinking that this is
gonna curry favor with them

00:05:28.603 --> 00:05:29.941
with Julius Caesar.

00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:32.567
Well Julius Caesar really
does not like this.

00:05:32.567 --> 00:05:36.734
He likes to establish his
reputation as a magnanimous ruler,

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:39.741
someone who likes to forgive his enemies,

00:05:39.741 --> 00:05:43.142
someone who wants to
unify the people of Rome.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:45.581
And so he's in pursuit of Pompey.

00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:48.725
When he gets to Alexandria and
realizes that he was killed

00:05:48.725 --> 00:05:51.012
by Ptolemy XIII supporters,

00:05:51.012 --> 00:05:54.071
he decides to take the
other side and join forces

00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:56.133
with Cleopatra.

00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:59.631
And, not only is he able to
support her in a political,

00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:03.587
military sense, he helps
her defeat her enemies

00:06:03.587 --> 00:06:07.361
and become, and come onto the
throne, become the pharaoh

00:06:07.361 --> 00:06:08.795
of Ptolemaic Egypt.

00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:11.203
He also has an affair with Cleopatra.

00:06:11.203 --> 00:06:14.335
And, at the time, this is now 48 BCE,

00:06:14.335 --> 00:06:15.666
48

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:16.888
BCE,

00:06:16.888 --> 00:06:21.105
where you have, so let's
see, this is 50, 49, 48 BCE,

00:06:21.105 --> 00:06:22.902
which is roughly

00:06:22.902 --> 00:06:27.626
late 48 and early 47 BCE, when
Julius Caesar was actually

00:06:27.626 --> 00:06:28.926
in Alexandria,

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:29.989
they actually have an affair.

00:06:29.989 --> 00:06:32.717
And this is a Julius Caesar
who is in his early 50s,

00:06:32.717 --> 00:06:36.717
and this is a Cleopatra
who is in her early 20s.

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:41.510
And through that affair,
they have, by most accounts,

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.632
a child, Caesarion, later on.

00:06:44.632 --> 00:06:48.702
But this affair puts, or I guess
this support for Cleopatra,

00:06:48.702 --> 00:06:50.740
puts Cleopatra on the throne.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.070
And, even though Julius
Caesar does not take control

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.570
of Ptolemaic Egypt, it makes
Ptolemaic Egypt something of a

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:59.855
client state, something of a client state

00:06:59.855 --> 00:07:02.220
of the Roman Empire.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:05.416
And then Julius Caesar
returns back to Rome.

00:07:05.416 --> 00:07:08.127
He does several other things,
engaging in the east here,

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:10.914
but, eventually, he gets back to Rome.

00:07:10.914 --> 00:07:12.897
And, over several periods,

00:07:12.897 --> 00:07:15.900
he gets himself declared dictator.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.849
And dictator today has a
term of someone who kind of

00:07:18.849 --> 00:07:22.186
takes power, maybe
unlawfully, someone who just

00:07:22.186 --> 00:07:23.923
runs the show.

00:07:23.923 --> 00:07:25.927
Under Roman law, under the Roman Republic,

00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:28.435
there was actually a
position called dictator,

00:07:28.435 --> 00:07:30.607
that could be appointed
for these six-month terms,

00:07:30.607 --> 00:07:32.577
especially when they was
in times of emergency,

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.683
that they could do
whatever they needed to do.

00:07:34.683 --> 00:07:37.684
But now he got appointed
dictator multiple terms

00:07:37.684 --> 00:07:39.397
and for more than six months.

00:07:39.397 --> 00:07:43.640
And in 46, he gets elected
dictator for 10 years.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.057
So now 46 BCE is,

00:07:46.765 --> 00:07:49.575
let's see, this is 45, 46 BCE,

00:07:49.575 --> 00:07:51.963
he gets elected dictator
for a term of 10 years.

00:07:51.963 --> 00:07:53.546
And then in 44 BCE,

00:07:54.914 --> 00:07:55.747
he gets,

00:07:56.965 --> 00:08:00.607
he gets declared dictator for life.

00:08:00.607 --> 00:08:03.756
Now, this whole time, even
though he tried to be someone

00:08:03.756 --> 00:08:06.447
somewhat conciliatory against his enemies,

00:08:06.447 --> 00:08:08.788
his enemies were kind
of brooding and saying,

00:08:08.788 --> 00:08:11.473
what can we do to get back at this?

00:08:11.473 --> 00:08:13.927
And so, on March 15th,

00:08:13.927 --> 00:08:16.603
44 BCE, and this is one of the most

00:08:16.603 --> 00:08:19.166
famous dates in history,

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:21.287
his opponents in the senate,

00:08:21.287 --> 00:08:23.620
led by Marcus Junius Brutus,

00:08:25.135 --> 00:08:27.635
literally attack Julius Caesar

00:08:28.499 --> 00:08:32.397
in Rome, and this is an artist's
depiction of that attack,

00:08:32.397 --> 00:08:33.355
and they kill him.

00:08:33.355 --> 00:08:35.656
You might have heard of the Ides of March.

00:08:35.656 --> 00:08:38.369
Ides of March, that is
the date March 15th,

00:08:38.369 --> 00:08:40.606
and it's referring, when
people say it today,

00:08:40.606 --> 00:08:43.983
they're referring to that
event that happened on

00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:45.339
March 15th,

00:08:45.339 --> 00:08:46.172
44 BCE,

00:08:47.365 --> 00:08:48.973
where the dictator of Rome,

00:08:48.973 --> 00:08:51.614
and he was really emperor,
even though he wasn't declared

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.731
emperor yet, he had
absolute power over Rome,

00:08:54.731 --> 00:08:58.399
Julius Caesar was killed by his enemies,

00:08:58.399 --> 00:09:02.569
and that those enemies were
led by Marcus Junius Brutus.

00:09:02.569 --> 00:09:05.951
And, as you can imagine,
this then puts Rome

00:09:05.951 --> 00:09:08.587
into another phase, I guess you
could say, of the civil war.

00:09:08.587 --> 00:09:11.931
Or you could say into another civil war.

00:09:11.931 --> 00:09:16.004
Now, before we leave Julius
Caesar, it is worth saying

00:09:16.004 --> 00:09:17.035
some of the things he did.

00:09:17.035 --> 00:09:20.515
He did try to do some of
these populist reforms.

00:09:20.515 --> 00:09:25.457
He's also well known for
establishing the Julian calendar.

00:09:25.457 --> 00:09:27.062
Julian

00:09:27.062 --> 00:09:28.044
calendar.

00:09:28.044 --> 00:09:31.492
The Roman calendar before
the Julian calendar

00:09:31.492 --> 00:09:34.255
got pretty off on an annual basis,

00:09:34.255 --> 00:09:37.401
but the Julian calendar got
a lot closer to our current

00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:39.412
Gregorian calendar that we use today,

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.122
so the days didn't shift as much

00:09:41.122 --> 00:09:44.197
as Earth orbited around the Sun.

00:09:44.197 --> 00:09:45.474
So I'll leave you there,

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:47.930
and in the next few
videos we'll talk about

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.747
what happened after Julius Caesar,

00:09:49.747 --> 00:09:52.277
the civil war, I really
could say the civil wars,

00:09:52.277 --> 00:09:55.216
that broke out, and how
they really culminated with

00:09:55.216 --> 00:09:58.131
Rome officially going
from being a republic

00:09:58.131 --> 00:09:59.214
to an empire.
