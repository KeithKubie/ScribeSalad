A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY NOT
REMEMBER NEW YEAR'S EVE,

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:04.571
SINCE DISCOUNT CHAMPAGNE
AND 2016 RAGE DON'T MIX,

00:00:04.605 --> 00:00:05.739
BUT STUFF HAPPENED!

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.174
JENNY MCCARTHY WAS COLD!

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:11.778
PEOPLE IN TIMES SQUARE
DIDN'T PEE FOR, LIKE, 12 HOURS.

00:00:11.812 --> 00:00:14.581
AND MARIAH CAREY PERFORMED, OR,
RATHER, WANDERED AROUND ONSTAGE

00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:15.916
MUMBLING INSTEAD OF LIP-SYNCING

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.018
BECAUSE OF TECHNICAL ISSUES
AND SO FORTH.

00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.554
I'LL JUST GET
THROUGH THE MOMENT, OKAY?

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.589

-(APPLAUSE AND CHEERING)
-STILL THE BEST!

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.817
YES.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:53.053
AM I HIGH, OR WAS THAT FLAWLESS?

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:55.189

-(LAUGHTER)
-NO ONE HAS

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.399
EVER BEEN AS DEDICATED TO A JOB
AS THOSE BACKUP DANCERS.

"THIS IS WHY YOU WENT
TO JUILLIARD!"

00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:16.143
I THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE
JUST CUT AWAY

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:18.245
AND-AND LET
THIS LAWN MOWER FILL IN.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:23.350

-UH, AFTER MARIAH'S LIVE,

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.898
NATIONALLY TELEVISED DEBACLE,

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.133
ME WITHOUT THE DICK JOKES,
RYAN SEACREST,

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:43.570
HANDLED IT <i>FLAWLESSLY.</i>

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:48.141
NO MATTER WHAT MARIAH DOES,
THE CROWD ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:50.477
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG
WITH MS. CAREY,

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:53.981
AND THOSE HITS,
THOSE SONGS EVERYBODY KNOWS...

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:56.450
AND HOW ABOUT THOSE LYRICS
THAT EVERYONE KNOWS,

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:59.386
-EXCEPT FOR MARIAH CAREY.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:00.854

00:02:00.888 --> 00:02:02.823

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:05.792
THAT IS...

00:02:05.826 --> 00:02:09.730
THAT IS SOME NEXT-LEVEL, EXPERT-
LEVEL DAMAGE CONTROL ON THE FLY.

00:02:09.763 --> 00:02:12.332
SO, COMEDIANS,
HOW ELSE COULD RYAN SEACREST

00:02:12.366 --> 00:02:15.035
HAVE GIVEN HER PERFORMANCE
A POSITIVE SPIN?

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.504
-JONAH RAY.
-YOU GOTTA HAND IT TO MARIAH.

00:02:17.538 --> 00:02:20.374
SHE'S PROBABLY NOT A RACIST.

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:22.543
(LAUGHTER)

00:02:22.576 --> 00:02:23.977
POINTS.

00:02:24.011 --> 00:02:27.714
-DOUG. -SHE COULD SHOOT SOMEBODY
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET,

00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:29.816
AND EVERYONE
WOULD STILL VOTE FOR HER.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.819
-(LAUGHTER)
-YEAH. POINTS. LAURIE.

00:02:32.853 --> 00:02:34.955
