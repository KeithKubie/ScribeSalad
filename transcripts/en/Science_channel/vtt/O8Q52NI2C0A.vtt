00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:11.667
Narrator: TODAY'S POLES
ARE INCREDIBLY LIGHTWEIGHT,

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.434
YET STRONG ENOUGH
TO ABSORB THE VAULTER'S ENERGY,

00:00:14.434 --> 00:00:17.534
THEN THROW IT BACK
TO PROPEL HIM OVER THE BAR.

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:19.834
SOME POLES
ARE MADE OF CARBON FIBER,

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:24.701
OTHERS OUT OF THIS MATERIAL --
RESIN-IMPREGNATED FIBERGLASS.

00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:27.968
THE FIRST STEP
IS TO SPREAD OUT THE MATERIAL

00:00:27.968 --> 00:00:30.067
AND CUT OUT THE POLE PATTERN.

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:31.968
MEANWHILE, A SLITTER MACHINE

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:35.701
CUTS THE SAME MATERIAL
INTO STRIPS OF A SPECIFIC WIDTH.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.968
THEN IT WINDS EACH STRIP
INTO ITS OWN ROLL.

00:00:40.968 --> 00:00:45.434
THIS SPIRAL-WRAP MACHINE
AUTOMATICALLY UNRAVELS THE STRIP

00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:49.400
AND WRAPS IT AROUND A HOLLOW
STEEL TUBE CALLED A MANDREL.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.033
THIS FIRST LAYER OF FIBERGLASS
GIVES THE POLE ITS FLEXIBILITY.

00:00:55.033 --> 00:00:58.968
THEY WRAP A SECOND LAYER
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

00:00:58.968 --> 00:01:00.834
FOR THE NEXT LAYERS,

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:03.901
THEY REMOVE THE MANDREL
AND LAY IT ON A TABLE.

00:01:03.901 --> 00:01:05.567
NOW IT'S TIME

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:09.467
FOR THOSE FIBERGLASS PATTERNS
THEY CUT EARLIER.

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.501
THEY HEAT THE EDGE
OF THE FIRST ONE WITH AN IRON,

00:01:12.501 --> 00:01:16.534
MELTING THE RESIN IN
THE FIBERGLASS UNTIL IT'S TACKY.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.133
THEY STICK THIS EDGE
TO THE MANDREL,

00:01:19.133 --> 00:01:22.734
THEN SLIDE THE OTHER END
BETWEEN HEATED ROLLERS.

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:26.133
THE ROLLERS WRAP THE REST OF
THE MATERIAL AROUND THE MANDREL,

00:01:26.133 --> 00:01:29.801
THE HEAT ACTIVATING THE RESIN
IN THE PROCESS.

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:34.234
THE MANDREL AND
ITS MULTILAYER FIBERGLASS COAT

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:35.801
NOW GO INTO AN OVEN.

00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:37.901
THE HEAT, GENERATED BY STEAM,

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:41.334
STARTS AT
175 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT.

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:46.033
THIS LIQUEFIES THE RESIN SO THAT
IT RE-SATURATES THE FIBERGLASS.

00:01:46.033 --> 00:01:50.434
THEN THE TEMPERATURE GRADUALLY
RISES TO NEARLY 300 DEGREES,

00:01:50.434 --> 00:01:54.234
SOLIDIFYING THE RESIN AGAIN,
CURING IT.

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:57.133
AND WHEN IT FINISHES,
A POLE EXTRACTOR

00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:01.367
SLIDES THE MANDREL OUT
OF WHAT'S NOW A FIBERGLASS POLE.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:18.334
THE POLE
MOVES ONTO A FLEX MACHINE.

00:02:18.334 --> 00:02:20.734
IN PART, THIS IS A STRESS TEST.

00:02:20.734 --> 00:02:24.701
IF THERE'S ANY TYPE OF DEFECT,
THE POLE WILL CRACK OR BREAK.

00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:26.300
BUT THE FLEXOR

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.701
ALSO PERMANENTLY PUTS A SPECIFIC
DEGREE OF CURVE IN THE POLE,

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:32.767
WHICH HELPS THE ATHLETE
VAULT HIGHER.

00:02:34.434 --> 00:02:37.801
NOW THEY MAKE WHAT'S CALLED
THE SOFT-SIDE MARK.

00:02:37.801 --> 00:02:41.000
THIS HELPS THE POLE VAULTER
LOCATE THE BEND,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.267
IN ORDER TO KNOW
WHERE TO GRIP THE POLE.

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:52.767
NEXT, THEY APPLY
A MAXIMUM-WEIGHT LABEL,

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:56.200
INDICATING HOW HEAVY
THE VAULTER CAN BE.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.067
TO FINISH THE SURFACE NOW,

00:03:00.067 --> 00:03:02.033
THEY MOUNT THE POLE
ON A SPINDLE,

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:05.000
THEN RUN A POLISHING PAD
OVER IT.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.667
THEN, USING A SOLVENT,
THEY CLEAN OFF THE DEBRIS.

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:14.901
NOW THAT THE SURFACE
IS PRISTINE,

00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:17.434
THEY WRAP IT
IN THIN, LIGHTWEIGHT TAPE.

00:03:17.434 --> 00:03:21.534
DIFFERENT-COLORED TAPES
DESIGNATE DIFFERENT POLE STYLES.

00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:26.200
THEY CAP THE TOP OF THE POLE
WITH PLASTIC,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.601
THEN, AT THE BOTTOM,

00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.367
MALLET ON A MOLDED TIP
MADE OF HARD RUBBER.

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:36.734
THE FINISHING TOUCH
IS THE MANUFACTURER'S DECAL.

00:03:40.434 --> 00:03:45.067
VAULTING POLES COME IN VARIOUS
LENGTHS, BETWEEN 10 AND 16 FEET.

00:03:45.067 --> 00:03:47.634
A POLE DESIGNED
FOR A HEAVIER VAULTER

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:50.667
HAS TO BE STIFFER THAN ONE
DESIGNED FOR A LIGHTER VAULTER

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:53.133
BECAUSE THE POLE
HAS TO PROPEL MORE WEIGHT

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.133
WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF BENDING.
