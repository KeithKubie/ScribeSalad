00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.280
- [Narrator] Let's now expose ourselves

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.940
to another test of convergence,

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.230
and that's the Alternating Series Test.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.040
I'll explain the Alternating Series Test

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.220
and I'll apply it to an
actual series while I do it

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.450
to make the...

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.088
Explanation of the Alternating Series Test

00:00:18.088 --> 00:00:20.900
a little bit more concrete.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.730
Let's say that I have some
series, some infinite series.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.730
Let's say it goes from N equals
K to infinity of A sub N.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.010
Let's say I can write it as

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.580
or I can rewrite A sub N.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.260
So let's say A sub N, I can write.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.080
So A sub N is equal to
negative one to the N,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.770
times B sub N

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.770
or A sub N is equal to
negative one to the N plus one

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.185
times B sub N

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:57.210
where B sub N is greater
than or equal to zero

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.680
for all the Ns we care about.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.350
So for all of these integer
Ns greater than or equal to K.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.860
If all of these things, if
all of these things are true

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.160
and we know two more things,

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.160
and we know number one, the
limit as N approaches infinity

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.893
of B sub N is equal to zero.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.370
Number two, B sub N is
a decreasing sequence.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.410
Decreasing...

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.090
Decreasing sequence.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.090
Then that lets us know that
the original infinite series,

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.890
the original infinite series,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950
is going to converge.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.630
So this might seem a little
bit abstract right now.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.610
Let's actually show, let's
use this with an actual series

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.260
to make it a little bit more,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.454
a little bit more concrete.

00:01:53.454 --> 00:01:56.121
Let's say that I had the series,

00:01:57.167 --> 00:02:02.167
let's say I had the series
from N equals one to infinity

00:02:02.602 --> 00:02:05.269
of negative one to the N over N.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.751
We could write it out
just to make this series

00:02:10.751 --> 00:02:11.899
a little bit more concrete.

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:15.000
When N is equal to one, this
is gonna be negative one

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.150
to the one power.

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.680
Actually, let's just
make this a little bit,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.606
let's make this a little
bit more interesting.

00:02:20.606 --> 00:02:21.800
Let's make this negative
one to the N plus one.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.710
When N is equal to one,

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.910
this is gonna be negative
one squared over one

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.590
which is gonna be one.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.950
Then when N is two, it's
gonna be negative one

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.940
to the third power

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.630
which is gonna be negative one half.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.560
So it's minus one half

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.430
plus one third

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.150
minus one fourth

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.280
plus minus and it keeps going
on and on and on forever.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.980
Now, can we rewrite
this A sub N like this.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.813
Well sure.

00:02:48.813 --> 00:02:50.190
The negative one to the N plus one is

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.150
actually explicitly called out.

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.990
We can rewrite our A sub N,

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.540
so let me do that.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.529
So negative, so A sub N which
is equal to negative one

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:06.090
to the N plus one over N.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.170
This is clearly the same
thing as negative one

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.880
to the N plus one times one over N

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.580
which is, which we can then say

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.943
this thing right over
here could be our B sub N.

00:03:19.943 --> 00:03:23.650
This right over here is our B sub N.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.050
We can verify that our
B sub N is going to be

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.060
greater than or equal to zero
for all the Ns we care about.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.754
So our B sub N is equal to one over N.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.070
Clearly this is gonna be
greater than or equal to zero

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.470
for any, for any positive N.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.640
Now what's the limit?

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.021
As B sub N,

00:03:41.021 --> 00:03:45.000
What's the limit of B sub
N as N approaches infinity?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.300
The limit of, let me
just write one over N,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.480
one over N, as N approaches
infinity is going

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.440
to be equal to zero.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.920
So we satisfied the first constraint.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.336
Then this is clearly a decreasing sequence

00:03:58.336 --> 00:04:02.630
as N increases the denominators
are going to increase.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.720
With a larger denominator,

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.450
you're going to have a lower value.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.256
We can also say one
over N is a decreasing,

00:04:09.256 --> 00:04:13.130
decreasing sequence

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:15.460
for the Ns that we care about.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.460
So this satifies, this
is satisfied as well.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.650
Based on that, this thing is always,

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.510
this thing right over here is always

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.410
greater than or equal to zero.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.823
The limit, as one over
N or as our B sub N,

00:04:31.823 --> 00:04:34.680
as N approaches infinity,
is going to be zero.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.920
It's a decreasing sequence.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.950
Therefore we can say
that our originial series

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.870
actually converges.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.053
So N equals 1 to infinity of negative one

00:04:45.053 --> 00:04:47.540
to the N plus over N.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.100
And that's kind of interesting.

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.250
Because we've already seen

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.680
that if all of these were positive,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.220
if all of these terms were positive,

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.750
we just have the Harmonic Series,

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.860
and that one didn't converge.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.820
But this one did, putting these
negatives here do the trick.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.630
Actually we can prove this
one over here converges

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.460
using other techniques.

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.780
Maybe if we have time,

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.080
actually in particular
the limit comparison test.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.210
I'll just throw that out
there in case you are curious.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.170
So this is a pretty powerful tool.

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.010
It looks a little bit about
like that Divergence Test,

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.090
but remember the
Divergence Test is really,

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.010
is only useful if you want
to show something diverges.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.490
If the limit of, if
the limit of your terms

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.330
do not approach zero,

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.600
then you say okay, that
thing is going to diverge.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.433
This thing is useful

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.220
because you can actually
prove convergence.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.010
Once again, if something does not pass

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.010
the alternating series test,

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.860
that does not necessarily
mean that it diverges.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.470
It just means that you couldn't use

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.623
the Alternating Series Test
to prove that it converges.
