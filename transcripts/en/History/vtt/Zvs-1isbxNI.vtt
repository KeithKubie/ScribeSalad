WIL WILLIS: Up
first, the kill test.

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.880
Doug.
[music playing]

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.040
DOUG MARCAIDA: Blade smiths,
what kind of lethal damage

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.960
will a weapon like the
Russian pioneer sword do?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.540
Well, to find that out,
we will take your sword

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.960
and deliver slashes and
thrusts on this deer carcass.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.880
Mark, you're up first.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.120
You ready?
MARK: Yeah.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.880
DOUG MARCAIDA: Let's do this.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.790
MARK: I think my sword is
going to hold up to the deer.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.670
I'm not really
intimidated by it.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.080
It's not the first
deer I've seen hanging.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.040
[music playing]

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:43.000
[cutting sounds]

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.080
DOUG MARCAIDA: OK
Mark, let's talk

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.750
about your weapon right here.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.540
It's a little bit
on the heavier side.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:48.750
But you know what?

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.750
It felt very good
cutting each time.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.580
Cutting through the spine
and lacerating through.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.000
Overall your weapon will kill.
MARK: Thank you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.080
DOUG MARCAIDA: Good job.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.250
Nicholas, your turn.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.080
You ready?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.170
NICHOLAS: I'm ready.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.620
DOUG MARCAIDA: Let's do this.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.290
NICHOLAS: I'm nervous
going into this test.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.880
My stomach is
absolutely lurching.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.750
Plus Mark's blade performed
pretty well, so that's

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.040
certainly adding to my anxiety.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.040
[music playing]

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:32.540
[cutting sounds]

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.120
Oh, [bleep].

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.790
DOUG MARCAIDA: Well Nicholas,
that was a lot of fun.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.750
The handle is on
the smaller side.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.120
When he held onto it, you
could feel the ridges,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.670
so that's good.
You can tell where the edge is.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.170
Just a concern that
it might be an issue

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.830
when you're moving it around.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.290
Your tip penetrated easily
all the way through.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.330
The edges cut right
through the ribs,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.250
right through the spine, all the
way through this deer carcass.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.830
Overall your weapon will kill.
NICHOLAS: Thank you.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.750
J NEILSON: Smiths, welcome
to our strength test.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.960
Now I think pioneer,
I think horses.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.290
So I'm going to take your
Russian pioneer swords

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.960
and smash them into
these horse skulls.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.330
I'm not too concerned what
your swords do to the skulls,

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.830
I want to see what the skulls
are going to do to your swords.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.420
Mark, you're up first.
You ready?

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.290
MARK: Yeah.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.000
J NEILSON: Let's do it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.040
[music playing]

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:47.880
[skull breaking]

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.120
Well Mark, that first couple
swings it twisted a little bit.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.120
You did get some
chipping on the edge

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.000
here, right in that sweet spot.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.540
Otherwise, everything
is still tight.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.380
It felt good.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.540
Good job.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:03.880
MARK: Thank you.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.210
J NEILSON: Nicholas,
what are you thinking?

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.880
NICHOLAS: A little nervous.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.830
J NEILSON: That's all right,
we're going to do it anyways.

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:08.880
NICHOLAS: Oh, I know.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.920
I wouldn't expect anything less.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.540
J NEILSON: Cool.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.170
NICHOLAS: I'm especially
nervous about the strength test

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.080
because I had to
rush my heat treat.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.880
This is going to be a make or
break moment for this thing.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.880
[music playing]

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:39.210
[skull breaking]

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:43.000
J NEILSON: Nicholas, this
was difficult to control.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.380
It's very forward heavy.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.380
You've got chipping on the
edge here in a couple spots.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.290
The real killer for me though,
was the seam in your handle,

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.250
this right here is sharp.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.290
Most of your control is
in these three fingers

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.420
and these two are
getting cut into.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.250
So the handle is a problem.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.920
WIL WILLIS: Mark,
Nicholas, both of you

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.920
have done an incredible
amount of work

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.710
to get to where
you are right now.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:12.210
But in this competition
there can only

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.620
be one Forged in Fire champion.

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.580
[music playing]

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.710
Mark, congratulations.

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.460
You are our new Forged
in Fire champion.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.710
Nicholas, unfortunately your
weapon didn't make the cut.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.790
J NEILSON: Nicholas,
despite taking damage,

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.460
both your weapons
performed pretty equally.

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.330
But at the end of the day, we
all agreed that handle just

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:34.920
hurts to use.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.670
And that's why we're
sending you home.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.170
NICHOLAS: I understand.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:41.170
WIL WILLIS: Nicholas,
please surrender your blade.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.830
NICHOLAS: This is more or
less what I was expecting.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.790
Things were just so rushed
and chaotic at the end there,

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.170
you know, something had to give.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.330
And if it's a little
sharp spot on the handle

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.290
and that's made the
difference, I'm OK with that.

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:55.170
I still chopped a deer
in half, and I don't

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.670
think everybody can say that.
