with some restrictions and some
 

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:09.710
with some restrictions and some

is getting to a point where it's
 

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.340
is getting to a point where it's
completely chaotic and so they say is

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:13.350
completely chaotic and so they say is
 

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:15.560
completely chaotic and so they say is
that there are some constitutional

00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:03.930
bicycle way or both the second thing to
do is to charge for the cars coming

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:03.940

through the bridges which are free I
 

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:07.590
through the bridges which are free I
mean there are still many bridges I mean

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:07.600

it's very easy to do congestion charging

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:09.940
it's very easy to do congestion charging
 

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.340
it's very easy to do congestion charging
in Manhattan because you don't really

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:11.350
in Manhattan because you don't really
 

00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:13.560
in Manhattan because you don't really
have to do congestion charging you just

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:13.570
have to do congestion charging you just
 

00:26:13.570 --> 00:26:15.360
have to do congestion charging you just
have to charge for crossing the bridges

00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:15.370
have to charge for crossing the bridges
 

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.080
have to charge for crossing the bridges
so it's a little even contradictory to

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:19.090
so it's a little even contradictory to
 

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:21.630
so it's a little even contradictory to
have congestion charging when you allow

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:21.640
have congestion charging when you allow
 

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.300
have congestion charging when you allow
people to cross the bridges for free so

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:24.310
people to cross the bridges for free so
 

00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:30.090
people to cross the bridges for free so
I really believe that the first thing to

think we have to be even more radical

00:29:08.649 --> 00:29:08.659
think we have to be even more radical
 

00:29:08.659 --> 00:29:11.029

because we talked about the New Urbanism

00:29:11.029 --> 00:29:11.039
because we talked about the New Urbanism
 

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:14.269
because we talked about the New Urbanism
in the US which is like going back to

this quaint 1900 town now I think we can

00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399
this quaint 1900 town now I think we can
 

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:22.519
this quaint 1900 town now I think we can
do some much more radical things with

00:29:22.519 --> 00:29:22.529
do some much more radical things with
 

00:29:22.529 --> 00:29:27.950
do some much more radical things with
much bigger pedestrian spaces some more

00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960
much bigger pedestrian spaces some more
 

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.350
much bigger pedestrian spaces some more
creative and different conceptions of a

creative and different conceptions of a
 

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.200
creative and different conceptions of a
modern city giving much more importance

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:33.210
modern city giving much more importance
 

00:29:33.210 --> 00:29:35.299

to the bicycle I believe the bicycle and

now we have a new machine that are I

00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440
now we have a new machine that are I

completely change the way we live which

completely change the way we live which
is the electric bicycle because this

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:43.950
is the electric bicycle because this
 

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:46.999
is the electric bicycle because this
allows people to use bicycles over

00:29:46.999 --> 00:29:47.009
allows people to use bicycles over
 

00:29:47.009 --> 00:29:50.919
allows people to use bicycles over
longer distances or over hills or

longer distances or over hills or
elderly people bicycles I think we

00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399
elderly people bicycles I think we
 

00:29:56.399 --> 00:29:58.989
elderly people bicycles I think we
really have to in the future I think

00:29:58.989 --> 00:29:58.999
really have to in the future I think
 

00:29:58.999 --> 00:30:01.460

protected bicycle ways are going to be

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:01.470
protected bicycle ways are going to be
 

00:30:01.470 --> 00:30:06.409
protected bicycle ways are going to be
as obvious as sidewalks are today to

00:30:06.409 --> 00:30:06.419
as obvious as sidewalks are today to
 

00:30:06.419 --> 00:30:12.580
as obvious as sidewalks are today to
have a protected bicycle everywhere and

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:12.590
 
 

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:19.820
 
the United States will have to develop

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:19.830
the United States will have to develop
 

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.580
the United States will have to develop
in higher density environments and the

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:22.590
in higher density environments and the
 

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.580
in higher density environments and the
only way to do this is demolishing some

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:25.590
only way to do this is demolishing some
 

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:29.480
only way to do this is demolishing some
of these inner suburbs and making higher

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:29.490
of these inner suburbs and making higher
 

00:30:29.490 --> 00:30:32.029
of these inner suburbs and making higher
densities but this what I'm trying to

00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039
densities but this what I'm trying to
 

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:34.580
densities but this what I'm trying to
propose at these new developments can be

00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:34.590
propose at these new developments can be
 

00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:36.799
propose at these new developments can be
completely different not just the

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:36.809
completely different not just the
 

00:30:36.809 --> 00:30:38.989
completely different not just the
typical street and cycle but you could

00:30:38.989 --> 00:30:38.999
typical street and cycle but you could
 

00:30:38.999 --> 00:30:42.710
typical street and cycle but you could
have as we are talking about completely

00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720
have as we are talking about completely
 

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.710
