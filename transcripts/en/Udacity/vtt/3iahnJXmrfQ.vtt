00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.070
All right, so even though that
example that we just talked

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.100
about is something that
I drew up on the screen.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.380
I decided I would actually turn
that into a real example and

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.190
ran it in Burlap with the implementation
of MLIRL that's there.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.620
And this is the result.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.221
It's actually kind of neat.

00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:18.390
So, here's the trajectory and
the MDP that we ran in, and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.360
here's how MLIRL decided to actually
assign rewards to the different colors.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.080
So you can see that the cell
that's green is assigned very high

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.070
positive reward.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.460
So it is drawing the agent over to that
that is a positive place to be and

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.940
you can see that the blue squares
are actually fairly negative.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.740
The ones that correspond to
these blue puddles are given

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.550
a not insignificant negative reward so
they are actually avoided on purpose.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.548
One of the things that's interesting
is as we talked about there's no set of

00:00:47.548 --> 00:00:51.234
evidence in this trajectory that red
is good or bad and in fact it ends up

00:00:51.234 --> 00:00:55.123
getting pretty much the same reward
as the background, basically zero.

00:00:55.123 --> 00:00:59.105
One thing that's a little bit more
interesting is that it actually

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:03.150
concluded that this orange
strip is somewhat aversive.

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.765
It gave it a slightly stronger negative
reward to try to get it to avoid it and

00:01:07.765 --> 00:01:10.355
I guess that was because the
demonstrated path didn't have the agent

00:01:10.355 --> 00:01:12.645
spending multiple steps there and
it could have.

00:01:12.645 --> 00:01:13.737
&gt;&gt; Yeah
&gt;&gt; But it didn't so

00:01:13.737 --> 00:01:14.989
maybe it was a bad place.

00:01:14.989 --> 00:01:16.755
&gt;&gt; Right there's lots of
ways that it could have got.

00:01:16.755 --> 00:01:19.434
You could have come all the way over
to the origin going straight down.

00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:20.067
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And

00:01:20.067 --> 00:01:23.753
since it didn't it maybe try to
pick a path that minimized orange.

00:01:23.753 --> 00:01:25.492
&gt;&gt; Right and so
it just kind of went with that and

00:01:25.492 --> 00:01:27.130
gave it a slightly negative reward.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.970
If we gave it a bunch more examples and
we could see negative

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.340
whether that rather than orange really
was consistently a good thing or

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.330
a bad thing,it would get fixed
with more training data but

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.730
it's pretty neat how much you can pull
out of actually one single example.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.880
&gt;&gt; That actually that's
actually kind of cool and

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.740
I do like that gets slightly negative.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.840
It doesn't believe that you're
trying to avoid orange just that

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.820
maybe you are because if you
weren't trying to avoid orange.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.790
I guess if I thought about all the path
that could get me from where I started

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.220
to where in that up.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.786
There's a lot of them that involve
touching orange more than once and

00:02:02.786 --> 00:02:06.843
since you didn't pick that one maybe
you're trying to avoid touching more and

00:02:06.843 --> 00:02:10.591
more than once and since are all the
same thing that would be evidence that

00:02:10.591 --> 00:02:14.188
it's something to avoid although
it's only very slight evidence.

00:02:14.188 --> 00:02:16.788
So that turns it into slightly
negative that's kind of cool

00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:17.910
that's kind of amazing.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.610
&gt;&gt; Yeah I think so too I mean and

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.240
one of the things that I really
like about this is the notion that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.580
It's actually learning, not just from
the positive example of where it went,

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.050
but in a sense from all the different
paths that it didn't take.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.840
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Right and

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.310
so the fact that it didn't hit blue,
it used that as data.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.610
So it actually is combining this notion
of your planning in the full MBP.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.190
Well, we get to see one
trajectory through that, so

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.530
what is that telling us about
other parts of the MBP?

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.440
&gt;&gt; So
I guess the short version of this is

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.990
you can communicate a lot even
by communicating a little.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.103
And an even shorter version
of that is less is more.

00:02:54.103 --> 00:02:56.055
&gt;&gt; Well no I wouldn't say that at all.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:58.730
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] But you just did.

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:00.190
&gt;&gt; I did, but I did then I read it and

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.720
I realized that that's not what you
meant or that's not what I wanted you to

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.650
mean so yes that you can
communicate a lot with a little.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.490
Less is enough maybe.

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:09.410
&gt;&gt; I like that.

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.460
That's like eight is enough and eight
is less the nine so less is enough.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.560
I like that.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.760
&gt;&gt; And that pretty much sums up the the
three Cs that I wanted to talk about.
