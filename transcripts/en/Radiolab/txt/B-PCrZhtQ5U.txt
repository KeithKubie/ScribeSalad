Speaker 1:          00:00          What's up everybody. This is Jad radio lab surprise podcast here. Tomorrow is the big game. Go Eagles. And uh, whether you like football or not, I happen to be a fan. But whether you like it or not, it's one of the biggest sporting events in the world. And it's a game that in many ways has always been wrapped up in what America is and what it isn't. And so what we thought we'd do just as a corrective measure is bring back an episode that we put together a couple of years ago about the origins of that game. It's kind of an amazing story and look, Geek, we're all going to be sitting there watching Tom Brady probably, but hopefully not win another Superbowl. And we'll be watching timber buns do the halftime thing. And throughout it all, no one will be talking about the people without whom the game would be nothing. So this is an honor of them to story that we got two from journalist and author Sally Jenkins from her book, the Real All-americans.

Speaker 2:          00:57          I mean, football, football is as old as sort of the Celtic civilizations. I mean, you can trace a primal games of, you know, Danish invaders kicking skulls around the shores of England. I mean, that's not a football that's exactly different, but organized football is really a creation of, of the 1860s and seventies in this country. It's a post civil war creation comes along, uh, just really a couple of years after, you know, the last great conquering armies settle the West. Basically she says, you had these kids whose parents had fought in the civil war and then some of them had gone west to fight the, a Lakota, the Cheyenne, the Rapahoe, the Apaches, and now those wars are winding down, which oddly enough, created kind of an issue for young men at the time.

Speaker 3:          01:42          If you're a young student, say back east at a fancy school like Harvard, how are you going to prove your own toughness? I mean, your older brother, your, your father, he, they may be fought. Gettysburg, add a little big one. What the hell have you done? The American frontier experience was over. There was this feeling among a lot of intellectuals that, um, that um, American men were losing their masculinity. They were being feminized in a sense.

Speaker 1:          02:07          So according to historian David Adams, you just heard those kids were desperate for opportunities to man up.

Speaker 3:          02:14          There was this cult of metal

Speaker 4:          02:18          around this time,

Speaker 2:          02:19          David and see a bunch of violent sports take off. And in particular for our purposes, you see these kids at Harvard and Yale

Speaker 4:          02:28          getting together and knocking the snot out of each other in this game that's kind of like rugby, but just more violent.

Speaker 2:          02:39          The game used to be basically brutality. The origin of football was such a profoundly different game, right? A chuck Klosterman and before him historian Dr. Conrad Crane, you know, a first down instead of 10 yards was only five yards. You had three downs to get five yards and basically all the teams did okay.

Speaker 4:          02:58          Sort of slam each other

Speaker 3:          03:00          and try to move the ball incrementally. It was almost as if every play of the entire game was the goal line stand. You know, w the, the metaphor people always use when discussing football of course, is military. It's the idea of taking land and giving life. Well, the origin of football that was even amplified.

Speaker 2:          03:16          There were formations and strategies and that kind of thing. But it was pure like right out of Napoleon's military playbook. I mean, where you concentrate your force. Yeah. Shoulder my shoulder next to your shoulder, nick. The his shoulder. I think it's a lot like you bunch up all the, all your man and then pierce the other guy's army. Yeah. That was the basic idea. And so you just end up with piles of guys. Yeah. And inside those piles there's all kinds of things go on in those scrums. I mean there's kicking in bite and there's gouging. I'm languaging and crotch kicking and wow. Head wrenching. And I remember we were talking with Harvard boys doing this. I have to work to imagine that because I think of Harvard and Yale now and I think of like, I think neck geeks. Yeah. I don't think of him as big guys.

Speaker 2:          03:54          Well at the time they were the, the, I mean there are all these wonderful stories about these chops that they would eat for dinner. I mean, they were drinking milk by the gallon and the Ivs were the great power of the time physically as well as intellectually. But then along comes this school, this tiny little school, uh, founded in 1879 in the middle of nowhere that if you're a football fan or just a fan of American history, kind of changed everything where it was Carlo Carlisle was in Pennsylvania, right. Very close to Gettysburg. Let's go there. Let's, so, so, so tell me about a car. What is the, when did it formed and what was it there? The Carlisle Indian school is formed by a former of, well actually he was an active military officer at the time named Richard Henry Pratt. The guy shock of white hair, large nose crowd, had stripped gallantly, quite gallantly in the civil war. And then he had actually served out West in Oklahoma territory. Uh, he had fought, uh, American Indians himself. And it was after winning a lot of those fights, too many of those fights. Really? No, we're talking a 1870s now that Pratt had a change of heart and he, he suddenly became concerned about the very people he had just been fighting.

Speaker 3:          05:03          The fact of the matter is that Indians were in very, very desperate situation. The bison were almost extinct. They were being pushed onto reservations and population at fallen to two. It's almost all time low.

Speaker 5:          05:19          Uh,

Speaker 3:          05:20          Pratt, um, and a lot of other policymakers came to the conclusion that something had to happen fast or Indians would literally become extinct.

Speaker 2:          05:29          They would in fact become the vanishing race.

Speaker 2:          05:34          And so Pratt, um, he comes to Washington with an idea. His idea was to start a boarding school specifically for American Indian children. That was kind of a radical experiment. Children would be taken removed for several years at a time. They would be stripped of their, uh, what was called their savage heritage and they would be civilized, I. E they would be white enticed. It was forcible. A Pratt had a, a slogan, kill the Indian, save the man. That's Barbara Landis Carlisle Indian school biographer. We went up to Carlisle to talk with her and her colleague Cara Curtis, and they told us that prep basically made that pitch, kill the Indian, save the man, not just to Congress, but directly to American Indian families all over the country. I want your son. Is that, how does that work? I want your children because white people are gonna keep coming and coming. They want to settle in your lands. They want to take your lands and you need to learn how to deal with these people. So we need to teach your children how to speak English. We need to teach them how to communicate with the white man so that when the white man comes and tries to get you to sign away the black hills, you won't fall for it again. And it was a convincing argument.

Speaker 6:          06:43          Well, do you know back in those days or you're talking about survival over here? Would you mind introducing yourself? Okay. My name is Joe American horse. I'm 79 years old and I'm a grandson of chief American heart.

Speaker 1:          06:56          Joe Lives near the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. He's Lakota and he told us the story about his grandfather who was a famous Lakota chief in the 1890s. His grandpa led a delegation of American Indians too,

Speaker 6:          07:08          Washington. Well, he went to Washington d C and he was down there, but he's a lot of people downer just as his grandpa had this moment where he was just stunned by how many white people there were. His face was, they're like ants and pretty soon they're going to come to the area. So he had the idea of uh, trying to send his kids to school so they can, uh, inner mingle or you know, intercepted, whatever. Basically Joe says his grandpa just had this realization, we can't, we can't go back. We've got to go forward.

Speaker 1:          07:40          And it seemed to him Carlisle was the way forward.

Speaker 2:          07:46          So where are we going now? Is Our photo archive

Speaker 1:          07:49          the kids who are admitted, here's how it would work. They would come in and they'd immediately have their picture taken on arrival. Then they'd be given an extreme makeover, which would also be photographed.

Speaker 2:          08:00          Really? Wow.

Speaker 3:          08:03          This is Tom tour, Leno. Wow. This is, this is Tom Turley as he, as he comes in, Barbara showed us a picture of a Navajo kid looking maybe 18 years old, does 1882 this is when he arrived. So you, he's got kind of dark skin, high cheek bones in long hair. Yeah. Earrings. He's wearing elaborate necklace. It looks like it might be made of bone and he's wrapped in a blanket and then, and then now here he is in a suit with clean cut hair. And the second picture, his hair is very short. Not long, no blanket swearing. A three piece suit sitting there with a cro and a spread collar and a part at here. Wow. It's like in a snapshot. You have Tom Indian, Tom White Man.

Speaker 6:          08:45          Well, and Sophie, Joe American Horse said his family saw that transformation firsthand and Sophie was there and Kyle for five years. And when she came back, she looks like a wild woman. You know, she had a real tiny waist and a vomit and everything and uh, she can't speak Lakota.

Speaker 2:          09:04          She forgot. [inaudible] it. Just think about this for a second. Just think about this. When we spoke with one guy, a professor, Eric Anderson, who teaches at Haskell, he's also part Pottawatomie. Just imagine the parents, he says, wow. The first time they see their kids, parents

Speaker 3:          09:19          seeing their students marched around in essentially the uniforms of what had not very long before for many of the tribes been the uniform of the enemy

Speaker 2:          09:33          at the very least. I think that would be startling ninny case. According to Sally Jenkins, after the kids were re cropped and redressed, Brett would run them through a bunch of drills and in Carlisle was a a little military academy and the Indian kids were so unhealthy at first. They had been put on an unfamiliar Diet. They had been sleeping indoors for the first time in their lives and a lot of them were getting sick. I mean we know that in the 39 year history of the school, at least 200 kids died of disease or poor health or even homesickness. And so Pratt was constantly trying to get the kids outside and at a certain point he had hired some teachers and Sally thinks that one of those hires, probably one of the first dormitory masters, this guy who had formerly taught at an Ivy League school, he showed the Carlisle Indian kids. Yeah, this game that the kids at Harvard were playing. Maybe he thought it would toughen him up. Who knows? But suddenly

Speaker 7:          10:30          they were playing football. Now keep in mind, this is, you know, at a point back in 1882 where football is barely a thing, not so many schools had teams. There wasn't such a thing as a head coach back then. They were volunteer coaches who tended to be students or ex students with the Carlisle kids self organize level. The field start to play. They even start to scrimmage some kids across town and at one of those games, according to Barbara, Stacy Matlack, who is a Pawnee student at Carlyle, later became a plenty chief. He broke his leg

Speaker 3:          11:01          playing football and precedent. That's it. No more football because in his mind

Speaker 2:          11:06          he was trying to civilize these kids and football was doing the opposite.

Speaker 8:          11:11          Uh,

Speaker 3:          11:11          but a short time later, since David Adams, approximately three dozen Carlisle boys came in to Pretz office and they said, we want to play football.

Speaker 2:          11:20          Do we know what they said? Exactly.

Speaker 3:          11:22          We don't have, we don't have the exact words, but Pratt says at one point, he says, while they stood around my desk and I'm quoting him while they stood around my desk, they're black eyes intensely watching me. Um, he says, the orator gave practically all the arguments in favor of are contending and outside football. And ended up requesting the removal of the embargo.

Speaker 2:          11:46          His memoir, Pratt was sort of bowled over by the eloquence and passion of the appeal. So we said, okay, you can play if you do these two things. One, he says, never slung people who are looking on, we'll say there, that's the Indian of it. Just see them. They are savages and you can't get it out of there. Okay. And the other one was you have to beat the best teams in America. And at that early point in American football, far and away, the most powerful team was Yale, which brings us to October 24th, 1896.

Speaker 4:          12:18          It's

Speaker 1:          12:20          a raw fall day in New York. I played in New York. Yes. At, uh, the old polo grounds barely. There was a [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          12:27          4,000 people in the stands, including a handful of newspaper men, New York newspaper men, newly Jimmy was a big story. How did they publicize it? What did they say? Well, the newspapers became incredibly intrigued

Speaker 3:          12:37          on one side were the undergraduate showed an old and great university

Speaker 9:          12:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          12:44          hey, represent basically the perfection of modern athletics or intellectually the culture and refinement of the best modern American life. On the other side, let's me aborigine the real showing of the forest and playing the red skin of history. Story of war developed over me, or as the case may be by education.

Speaker 1:          13:07          And if you read the newspaper stories, they're written as they're written in this kind of blood curdling shot through with Indian cliches. You know, the red skins here come the red skins, right? Right. According to David Adams. In one paper it was a reference to yodeling. The writer said that then the fans were yodeling in that Indian fashion. I mean try to put yourself in the shoes of a New Yorker. In the early 1880s your contact with an American Indian was in a wild west show. It was theater and here comes a football game and all of that.

Speaker 4:          13:36          These American Indian kids run onto the field and there's literally an instance in one of the [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          13:41          first games with someone in the audience says, well, they look just like our boys because of course that's what Brad wanted. Now one thing that was immediately [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          13:50          clear to everyone in attendance when they saw the Carlisle players was that they were physically outmatched.

Speaker 3:          13:55          Yeah. Around average weight is 164 fingers, Shaklee 20 pounds by two to one man

Speaker 1:          14:01          and going in is that there'll be an absolute smear job or at the very least the odds are heavily against him. But

Speaker 4:          14:08          three minutes into the game, in the midst of a big pile up [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          14:16          a Yalie fumbles the ball. It comes squirting out.

Speaker 1:          14:21          Carlisle guy picks it up. Yep.

Speaker 4:          14:24          And runs the entire length of the field. 63 yards scores a touchdown.

Speaker 2:          14:33          Now nobody had scored on Yale in seven games. They were furious. So what they do is they use their bulk

Speaker 4:          14:41          to slowly push the pile down the field twice to take leave.

Speaker 9:          14:49          Yeah. And

Speaker 4:          14:50          with three minutes left,

Speaker 2:          14:53          yeah. Let's up. 12 to six Carlisle has the ball, Carlisle running back charges. The pile in

Speaker 4:          14:59          [inaudible] gets clobbered,

Speaker 2:          15:01          falls backwards. And just as he's about to hit the earth, he laterals the ball

Speaker 4:          15:06          to a teammate who grabs it, runs around the scrum. The entire length of the field score

Speaker 5:          15:14          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          15:15          Carlisle scores a touchdown that would have tied the game,

Speaker 5:          15:19          what

Speaker 2:          15:22          it's called back by a referee who was a Yale man. Why the call was that the referee claim that a whistle had blown the play dead. And what was the crowd's reaction? Well, they were, they were furious. Yes.

Speaker 4:          15:38          Bullying and, and hooting. Everyone knew it was a terrible miscarriage of justice. And some of the Carlisle players said, oh, we're gonna Walk Outta here. We are leaving this game. But according to David at the last moment, Pratt runs down from the stands, comes onto the fields, is wait a second, wait a second. Wait, don't forget. Rule number one,

Speaker 10:         15:56          be a gentleman. Pratt did not want this game to end because of their tempers, even though they'd been wronged by a by that call. So the Carlisle boys finished the game and when they walk off the field

Speaker 5:          16:20          [inaudible],

Speaker 4:          16:20          they get a standing ovation. Carlyle wins, incredible respect and renown in the aftermath of the game. In fact, one of the newspaper men after another Carlisle Yale game or something

Speaker 2:          16:29          similar happened, wrote something to the effect of Carlisle could beat 11 year men, but they couldn't beat 11 Yale men and a Yale referee.

Speaker 4:          16:38          Yes.

Speaker 11:         16:41          After the Yale game of 1896 pret is committed. Pratt believes that it's the greatest thing that can happen to his school. It is an instant way to do what he's been struggling to do for 15 years at the Carlisle school, which is to prove the value of these American Indian kids against their white peers, to prove the value or to civilize them well, both to civilize them, but also to prove that given education and equal opportunity, they were the [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          17:11          Cool. Have there. Hmm. That's interesting. Their white peers, I mean he was for all of his forcible assimilation methods, which were, you know, to remain extremely cruel and destructive. He truly believed in the concept of, of racial equality. The complicatedness of Pratt and of the whole Carlisle idea kept smacking us in the face as we were putting this show together. I mean, on the one hand, they were clearly students who felt that Carlisle was prison and in fact Barbara Landis, when she took us on a tour of the grounds of the former Carlisle Indian school, she said that kids would even set fire to the buildings. It's a, yeah, some did down, which is kind of typical on Indian campuses, a lot of fires and burning buildings. Why I, it's a form of resistance. On the other hand,

Speaker 5:          18:01          no, you please.

Speaker 1:          18:02          When we started looking around for original archival recordings of some of the earliest Carlisle players, pretty much the only recording we could find

Speaker 5:          18:09          has this tape. We would like for it to be too much of your making is possible

Speaker 1:          18:14          was this oral history with a guy named [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          18:16          Your name, your full name is Andrew, actually nine

Speaker 1:          18:20          Albert x and Diane. The interview was done in the early seventies when he was 88 he entered the school

Speaker 5:          18:25          just before 1899 you were 50 years old. That's fair.

Speaker 1:          18:32          Can't really play you too much of this cause the audio quality is really bad. But in the interview, [inaudible],

Speaker 5:          18:36          r, h Prac, Pra, d, g

Speaker 1:          18:39          and x and Diane talks about them with a great deal of affection and gratitude.

Speaker 5:          18:44          We call him the diff father of [inaudible] education.

Speaker 1:          18:47          We call him the father of Indian education. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          18:49          Oh, he lies. I had one wonderful man.

Speaker 2:          18:53          So he's a tough figure. Pratt, and he's got a very mixed legacy. I mean, I like to say Pratt was his country.

Speaker 2:          19:01          Whenever you think of him, he was his country. So. Okay, so 1896, he gets the bug like he sees peak football's good PR. Yes. What happens next? Well, he, he hires, uh, he begins looking around for coaches, full time coaches to come in and coach the team. Uh, and he winds up, um, with a, a Cornell Grad, uh, named Pop Warner Glen Pop Warner. Pop Warner is an interesting guy is this pops right here just to give you visual. Yep. Woo. Look at his farm. And Carrie showed us pictures. It looks kind of like a Mike Ditka. If Mike Ditka had Einstein's hair up, pops a little bit of a, of an outlier. Uh, he's, he's got these Texas roots. He's a bit of a rogue can be kind of vulgar. I like to party a little bit. He liked to gamble really well and that is exactly what he does in spectacular fashion.

Speaker 2:          19:57          When he gets to Carlyle because pop Warner looks at, at his squad and he realizes that, sure, they're fast, they got heart, but they're underweight and they're small waist wall. You know, while they might occasionally forced a tie with it with a Yale if they, you know, have killed themselves physically, they weren't going to beat the Ivy Leagues on any kind of consistent basis without, without doing something different. And there was a very fine line between innovation and cheating and pop Warner starts IX exploiting that line. Absolutely. Uh, as hard as he can. And he comes up with, uh, the trick play for example, 1903 pop Warner devices, the hidden ball trick. But what is that? The hidden ball trick is I'm the quarterback takes the ball and actually behind this

Speaker 11:         20:48          huge pile of men tucks it under another guy sweater while the big pile of men is struggling in the mud in the center of the field, not knowing quite where the football is, but believing it's somewhere in the middle of the pile. Here's this kid who squirts around the end with the football hidden under his Jersey and he's 30 yards downfield before anybody realizes it. And how does he keep the ball from falling out of his jersey? I think they actually sewed the Jersey so that the ball would stay in there without falling out. So they made a cheating pocket, made a cheating pocket. Was that legal? But they got it. Did they get a religion?

Speaker 2:          21:21          Was it legal? You ask pop Warner would have said there was nothing in the rule book against it.

Speaker 11:         21:28          Another thing he does, which actually works brilliantly is he sows footballs onto the front of their jerseys, which are really bulky sweaters at the time. He sows leather football shaped patches onto the front of their jerseys in order to try to disguise who's got the ball. Really, I guess Harvard and the Harvard coach goes insane. [inaudible] sent me pregnant. This is the kind of thing,

Speaker 3:          21:56          but Harvard did not take this line down. Harvard retaliates by painting the football's the same color as their jersey. It's Maroon everywhere. So when they held the ball against their chest, the ball basically, well you can't see it.

Speaker 2:          22:12          I mean they all broke the rules. American football is essentially a rule breaking experience as opposed to British football, which didn't have referees. At least initially a British football ran on the honor system, but with American football, the rest were there practically from the beginning. And she says it was largely a response to the brutality of the game, but also to the kind of rule bending that you saw from pop Warner and the Carlisle Indians. Every time pop Warner came up with an innovation, the next year there was a rule against it. So immediately the Ivy League would get together and pass a rule and say, okay, no more of that. And that's how the rule book really burdens in an American football. And it's thanks to pop Warners slights of hand and pop Warner's greatest slight of hand and maybe the Carlisle Indians most soaring moment. And I mean that literally happened at a moment when the game almost disappeared. That's coming up.

Speaker 12:         23:11          start of message. Yes, this is David. Adam, this is Conrad Crane. Can I get an email message asking me to read credit texts? Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation, enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org. Okay. There it is. If you can use that, they care. And this message,

Speaker 3:          23:39          Hey, uh, Simon Adler here. Uh, I'm one of the producers here at Radiolab and I wanted to take a quick to tell you about something

Speaker 13:         23:46          that, uh, that I think is pretty interesting that, that we make here, uh, besides the show. So we have a newsletter, which I know everyone does, but hear me out. Unlike a lot of other newsletters out there, uh, we don't waste your time by just blabbing about what our next release will be or begging you for money. Uh, actually we, we do a a little bit of that. Uh, but what we also do is each time a new episode drops, we send you a list of staff picks, essentially a collection of things to folks here who make this show have come across recently and are excited about, uh, they range from books and music to TV shows, youtube clips, art exhibits, blogs. It's sort of a repository for this stuff that's got us interested. But for whatever reason, uh, we're not sure how to turn into a radio story. So if that sounds interesting to you at all, I hope you'll sign up for our newsletter. It's free and you can sign up in about just 30 seconds at radio lab.org/newsletter or even easier to just text r l news as in Radiolab news to seven zero one zero one that's RL news to seven zero one zero one and thanks.

Speaker 1:          25:06          Hey, I'm Jen Abu Moron. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. And getting back to our story on the Carlisle Indian school and the birth of the monitor game of football, one of the most important moments in this story, a happens at a time when football was right on the edge of disappearing.

Speaker 1:          25:25          Talking about 1905 this was the most violent year in football to this point, 19 people died on the football team. One nine one death is alon 19 that's crazy. Yeah. Cause what would happen is that Carla would try and do these things to sort of open up the game. The ivies would consistently respond by making the game more about brute force, more about violence. So you had all these desks and suddenly all the major programs were spooked. You know, Columbia polls, their PR or their football team. Harvard even thinks about doing it. And so, and this is kind of odd into the fray steps, the president of the United States of America, Teddy Roosevelt, in order to get him, because he was a fan, according to Conrad Crane, he liked football. He liked the, the manly aspects of it, the tough aspects of it. But nobody liked people dying. And then there was his kid, his, his son was playing and, and getting beat up pretty badly as well. Broke his nose, slid his eyebrow and one game he got knocked out cold. So after the violence of oh five the president calls the presidents of all these colleges and so on and to Washington and according to David Adams, he basically tells them that the rules had to be rewritten. It had to become a little bit more safe at least, or it would be banned

Speaker 1:          26:38          out of that. We see a couple of rule changes. First, the schools decide in order to loosen up the, so to speak, they're going to tinker with the down yardage ratio. Instead of going from three downs to gain five yards, it becomes three downs to gain 10 yards. The three downs, you get tenure to four downs to get 10 years before we'd come a couple of years later. Oh. But the second rule change, which is maybe the most important for our story is for the first time they legalize the ability to move the ball through the free floating air. It surrounds us all. Okay, so where do we go watch the next day? So if I could, if I could place you in a moment, unless there's a moment before this you'd like to hit. Uh, I believe November 23rd, 1907, yes. Big Moment. Okay. Can you set the scene? Well, the scene from the standpoint of broader American history, things have gone airborne. You mean Wilbur and Orville, right. I'm talking about not just them, but I'm talking about hot air balloons.

Speaker 5:          27:42          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          27:42          there are aeronautical experiments happening really all over the world. In France, everyone is experimenting with flying machines. Things are going up in the air, but not so fast with football because when the rural committee had made that rule about Ford passing, they had also hedged a little bit saying if you throw a forward pass and you receiver doesn't catch it, you are penalized 15 yards, which back in the day was a monster amount, so nobody threw the ball. It was too risky. But story goes. As soon as that rule got passed, pop Warner goes back to his garage. It's always a garage of quest with a ball and he starts to experiment in any certain thing like, okay, what would be the most efficient way to toss this thing? People have to understand that the footballs in those days are not the footballs we have today with the Nice, you know, whatever that old blades spheroid or whatever they call it with the Nice points and things. These are rugby balls, sort of imagine a deflated basketball. They're thicker in the middle, they're not as well shaped. They're really tough to get your hand on to throw. Right. And in 1906 there's a tiny bit of tape in Albert x and Diane's oral history where he talks about this in 1906 he says, pop called all the players together. He tells them

Speaker 5:          28:49          high rollers, if you were to have to learn [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          28:55          he says, I think you're going to have to learn to spiral. The ball

Speaker 5:          28:58          does far as the ball

Speaker 1:          28:59          because if you throw the ball in a spiral, it gets 10 times less air drag than if you throw it end over end. Plus it's easier to catch. Yeah. They start experimenting with it a little bit. And in 1906 but they come out in 1907 as a throwing offense, which gets us to that game.

Speaker 4:          29:14          November 23rd, 1907 Carlisle place, the University of Chicago, last game of the season, we're in Chicago and the Chicago team is arguably the best in the nation, the best. I don't think it's even arguable what Carlisle is good at this point though. Yeah. But Chicago is like stag field and there are 27,000 people in the stance. Well, what happened was, uh, the Chicago players had decided to try to defeat Carlisle's innovative, folded passing by just knocking the crap out of their receivers every time they came off the line of scrimmage. And so Carlisle's greatest receiver, Albert x and Diane, our guy had been stymied the entire game because the minute the ball was snapped, Chicago players would hit him and try to throw him down or knock him out of bounds.

Speaker 2:          30:01          So pop Warner said to x and Diane, here's what we're gonna do. Next time they hit you out of bounds, sneak around the bench and get back on the field by some accounts. This was x and Diane's idea. But whoever thought of it on the

Speaker 4:          30:15          Albert x died as expected. Ends up out of bounds. [inaudible] but he keeps running. He runs around the back of the bench, runs around the spectators, maybe around the band and comes back on the field right at that moment,

Speaker 2:          30:30          Hauser the quarterback of Carlyle

Speaker 4:          30:35          lets loose a vicious spiral. Can I have you read recently? Sure. Hold on. This is cell, his description of that moment from her book, the real all American.

Speaker 11:         30:44          Yes. For a moment. It was a frozen scene and a stage drama. The ball hung in the air. A tantalizing possibility could x and Diane reach it. Would he catch it or drop it? Defender's wheeled and stared down. Field spectators watching from the stands found that the breath had died in their collective throats. The spiraling ball seemed to defy physics. What made it stay up? When would it come down? In that long moment, 27,000 spectators mashed together on benches and crammed on platforms may have felt their loyalty to the home team evaporate in the grip of a powerful new emotion. They may have noticed something they never had before that a ball traveling through space traces a profoundly elegant path. They may have realized something else that it was beautiful.

Speaker 2:          31:42          The ball struck it's human target x and don caught the pass all alone and trotted over the Chicago gold line.

Speaker 4:          31:53          The stadium exploded in sound and motion. It was the game breaker. The rest was just anticlimax. The final score was 18 to four for Carla, but the very next year the Ivy League passes a rule that you can't leave the field and then come back onto [inaudible]. Okay. Yes. That's where that rule comes from. I get to say that that description of the ball [inaudible] in

Speaker 2:          32:25          the air is, is timeless in a way. That's exactly why football is still beautiful at times. That's, that's, that's when Carlisle in 1907 is when American football becomes the sport that you watch today.

Speaker 1:          32:42          That's exactly our style. Oh Wow. This is this the field field. This is the fee. Can we get out?

Speaker 5:          32:48          Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          32:58          after we'd spent an entire day looking at pictures of, you know, Albert x and dine and Pratt and pop Warner and Dulles, Lone Wolf and Tom Leno and all these Carlisle players. Barbara and Cara took us to the field where they practiced and so this is the Carlisle Indian school football field covered in snow, like 10 degrees out here. Really, really bright sun going off this now and it's just empty.

Speaker 1:          33:31          And we just kind of walked around and tried to imagine all this stuff. We'd just seen in photos. He was a little bit like walking among ghosts. Yeah. That's the sound of the flag blowing in the background. I remember standing on that field and I'm having this thought that I couldn't quite articulate.

Speaker 5:          34:02          Okay.

Speaker 1:          34:02          But later, Eric Anderson, that professor from Haskell is a member of the Pottawatomie nation. He sort of put his finger on it and he essentially said that like, there's a lot of room on a football field. I mean there's room for anger and war in violence, but there's also room for pride and a kind of coming together. That's not a Pratt coming together where one side gets erased, but it is a coming together. Yeah. I mean there is a middle ground. Clearly it's more than a game. The stakes are higher than that. You know, will we as Indian people be accepted on our own terms and also in our ability to meet you halfway or will we be accepted through this as the vehicle? It's clearly more than a game, a lot of people to thank for this episode. Uh, we had original music, uh, made for us for that episode from Morgan O'kane. You can hear him right here playing the Banjo. That's Morgan O k a n e music.com. Check them out. Also, we had original from Austin

Speaker 2:          35:38          musician, shaky graves and the uh, Albert Oxendine tape that we played is from the research division of the Oklahoma historical society. Thanks also to the Cumberland County historical society in the U S Army Heritage and education center where you can go and see tons of photos from both archives or you can come to us on our website radio lab.org. We have a ton of old archival football picks, a ton of those before and after pictures from the amazing, really amazing. And we also have a link to Sally Jenkins Book, which is highly recommend the real all-americans that's on our site, radiolab.org. Thanks also to Reggie Kathy and to Scott Graham to know Robin's to Michael Churness to Matt Della Pina. Cole wimpy to Jr McCarthy to Nick Cuppa beat Jay Colin and Michelle Campbell at Heber and special thanks. Very special. Thanks to our amazing volunteer cheer squad that came out and weathered the Brooklyn cold to scream and Holler and bring this story to life. And speaking of that very special thanks to Brenna Farrell who found the story and produced it with us and a productions boy from Damiano Marchetti

Speaker 5:          36:47          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          36:50          So that was part of an episode called American football that we put together at radio lab a few years back. Hope you enjoyed it. There's more of that episode sexy, some great interviews that happened in the second half that you can hear it. radiolab.org I'm jet, I boom, rod, thanks for listening. Go Eagles.
