00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
now what we can do is we can go back to

now what we can do is we can go back to

in<00:08:22.560><c> the</c><00:08:22.740><c> module</c><00:08:23.160><c> was</c><00:08:23.460><c> pretty</c><00:08:23.729><c> strong</c><00:08:24.120><c> right</c>

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
in the module was pretty strong right
 

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.589 align:start position:0%
in the module was pretty strong right
except<00:08:25.440><c> for</c><00:08:25.560><c> on</c><00:08:25.860><c> this</c><00:08:26.070><c> one</c><00:08:26.400><c> let's</c><00:08:27.150><c> do</c><00:08:27.389><c> that</c>

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
except for on this one let's do that
 

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
except for on this one let's do that
yeah<00:08:27.930><c> let's</c><00:08:28.199><c> view</c><00:08:28.470><c> it</c><00:08:28.590><c> in</c><00:08:28.680><c> the</c><00:08:28.800><c> course</c><00:08:29.330><c> so</c>

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:30.330 align:start position:0%
yeah let's view it in the course so
 

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
yeah let's view it in the course so
that's<00:08:31.139><c> an</c><00:08:31.320><c> interesting</c><00:08:31.860><c> phenomenon</c><00:08:32.010><c> that</c>

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.610 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting phenomenon that
 

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.579 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting phenomenon that

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
seem to be doing quite well but then
 

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.390 align:start position:0%
seem to be doing quite well but then
when<00:08:38.880><c> some</c><00:08:39.089><c> time</c><00:08:39.330><c> goes</c><00:08:39.539><c> on</c><00:08:39.690><c> right</c><00:08:40.409><c> they</c><00:08:41.219><c> need</c>

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
when some time goes on right they need
 

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.459 align:start position:0%
when some time goes on right they need
to<00:08:41.550><c> retain</c><00:08:42.000><c> that</c><00:08:42.360><c> conceptual</c><00:08:43.229><c> understanding</c>

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:43.469 align:start position:0%
to retain that conceptual understanding
 

00:08:43.469 --> 00:08:46.250 align:start position:0%

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.260 align:start position:0%
and transfer maybe to a new situation
 

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:50.610 align:start position:0%
like that print function it's a common
 

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
like that print function it's a common
challenge<00:08:50.640><c> for</c><00:08:51.240><c> students</c><00:08:51.660><c> learning</c><00:08:51.900><c> to</c>

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:53.790 align:start position:0%
retain and transfer what they've learned
 

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:55.430 align:start position:0%
retain and transfer what they've learned
so<00:08:54.450><c> giving</c><00:08:55.320><c> the</c>

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
so giving the
 

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.380 align:start position:0%
so giving the
even<00:08:55.770><c> more</c><00:08:55.920><c> practice</c><00:08:56.490><c> and</c><00:08:56.670><c> more</c><00:08:56.790><c> distributed</c>

00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:57.390 align:start position:0%
even more practice and more distributed
 

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.690 align:start position:0%
even more practice and more distributed
practice<00:08:57.600><c> might</c><00:08:58.230><c> be</c><00:08:58.380><c> a</c><00:08:58.410><c> good</c><00:08:58.590><c> strategy</c><00:08:58.740><c> so</c><00:08:59.670><c> I</c>

00:08:59.690 --> 00:08:59.700 align:start position:0%
practice might be a good strategy so I
 

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.930 align:start position:0%
practice might be a good strategy so I
could<00:09:00.210><c> think</c><00:09:00.420><c> of</c><00:09:00.570><c> injecting</c><00:09:01.940><c> similar</c>

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
could think of injecting similar
 

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
could think of injecting similar
questions<00:09:03.930><c> in</c><00:09:04.260><c> other</c><00:09:04.800><c> modules</c><00:09:05.640><c> yes</c><00:09:06.030><c> exactly</c>

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:06.410 align:start position:0%
questions in other modules yes exactly
 

00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
questions in other modules yes exactly
so<00:09:07.410><c> then</c><00:09:07.590><c> they</c><00:09:07.800><c> learn</c><00:09:08.010><c> it</c><00:09:08.190><c> here</c><00:09:08.400><c> and</c><00:09:08.520><c> they're</c>

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:08.610 align:start position:0%
so then they learn it here and they're
 

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.060 align:start position:0%
so then they learn it here and they're
doing<00:09:08.790><c> well</c><00:09:09.090><c> but</c><00:09:09.840><c> then</c><00:09:10.050><c> you</c><00:09:10.290><c> can</c><00:09:10.470><c> come</c><00:09:10.650><c> back</c><00:09:10.680><c> to</c>

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:11.070 align:start position:0%
doing well but then you can come back to
 

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:13.070 align:start position:0%

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
help them practice it and refine it we
 

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.260 align:start position:0%
help them practice it and refine it we
could<00:09:16.950><c> see</c><00:09:17.190><c> then</c><00:09:17.400><c> if</c><00:09:17.550><c> you</c><00:09:17.670><c> make</c><00:09:17.850><c> that</c><00:09:18.030><c> change</c>

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:18.270 align:start position:0%

if the post-test performance looks
 

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.370 align:start position:0%
if the post-test performance looks
better<00:09:20.610><c> yeah</c><00:09:21.090><c> let's</c><00:09:21.330><c> try</c><00:09:21.630><c> to</c><00:09:21.690><c> do</c><00:09:21.960><c> that</c><00:09:22.140><c> next</c>

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:22.380 align:start position:0%
better yeah let's try to do that next
 

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.190 align:start position:0%
better yeah let's try to do that next
time<00:09:22.560><c> yeah</c><00:09:23.270><c> but</c><00:09:24.270><c> in</c><00:09:24.360><c> the</c><00:09:24.450><c> meantime</c><00:09:24.480><c> let's</c><00:09:25.020><c> see</c>

what this question holds similarly are
 

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:31.700 align:start position:0%
what this question holds similarly are

return value of a function yes yes and
 

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
return value of a function yes yes and
that<00:09:35.130><c> was</c><00:09:35.310><c> the</c><00:09:35.460><c> one</c><00:09:35.610><c> with</c><00:09:35.790><c> the</c><00:09:35.820><c> worst</c>

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:36.090 align:start position:0%
that was the one with the worst
 

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%

that's<00:09:38.610><c> right</c><00:09:38.820><c> but</c><00:09:39.810><c> if</c><00:09:40.230><c> you</c><00:09:40.620><c> compare</c><00:09:40.890><c> how</c><00:09:41.640><c> they</c>

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's right but if you compare how they

activity<00:10:55.890><c> that</c><00:10:56.070><c> I</c><00:10:56.100><c> should</c><00:10:56.520><c> improve</c><00:10:56.880><c> on</c><00:10:57.150><c> so</c>

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:57.810 align:start position:0%
activity that I should improve on so

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
students did not do that much that's why
 

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
students did not do that much that's why
it's<00:11:04.740><c> still</c><00:11:04.830><c> gray</c><00:11:05.250><c> and</c><00:11:05.790><c> those</c><00:11:06.270><c> students</c><00:11:06.660><c> who</c>

did work on activities related to this
 

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:10.940 align:start position:0%
did work on activities related to this
learning<00:11:09.420><c> objective</c><00:11:09.510><c> yeah</c><00:11:10.410><c> they</c><00:11:10.620><c> didn't</c>

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:10.950 align:start position:0%
learning objective yeah they didn't

learning objective yeah they didn't
excel<00:11:11.940><c> exact</c><00:11:12.780><c> so</c><00:11:13.880><c> one</c><00:11:14.880><c> reason</c><00:11:15.420><c> for</c><00:11:15.750><c> that</c><00:11:15.870><c> is</c>

00:11:16.130 --> 00:11:16.140 align:start position:0%
excel exact so one reason for that is
 

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.260 align:start position:0%
excel exact so one reason for that is
just<00:11:16.500><c> what</c><00:11:16.680><c> you're</c><00:11:16.830><c> saying</c><00:11:17.160><c> that</c><00:11:17.610><c> maybe</c><00:11:18.000><c> they</c>

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:18.270 align:start position:0%
just what you're saying that maybe they
 

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.110 align:start position:0%
just what you're saying that maybe they
did<00:11:18.480><c> not</c><00:11:18.630><c> have</c><00:11:18.930><c> enough</c><00:11:19.170><c> practice</c><00:11:19.880><c> to</c><00:11:20.880><c> get</c>

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
did not have enough practice to get
 

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.500 align:start position:0%
did not have enough practice to get

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:25.579 align:start position:0%
strong right in that skill another
hypothesis<00:11:24.510><c> is</c><00:11:24.750><c> that</c><00:11:24.780><c> there</c><00:11:25.140><c> were</c><00:11:25.290><c> enough</c>

00:11:25.579 --> 00:11:25.589 align:start position:0%
hypothesis is that there were enough
 

00:11:25.589 --> 00:11:28.460 align:start position:0%
hypothesis is that there were enough
practice<00:11:26.490><c> opportunities</c><00:11:26.750><c> but</c><00:11:27.750><c> students</c><00:11:28.140><c> were</c>

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:28.470 align:start position:0%
practice opportunities but students were
 

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:30.860 align:start position:0%
practice opportunities but students were
still<00:11:28.830><c> struggling</c><00:11:29.339><c> so</c><00:11:29.880><c> we</c><00:11:30.000><c> can</c><00:11:30.180><c> click</c><00:11:30.540><c> on</c><00:11:30.570><c> this</c>

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:30.870 align:start position:0%
still struggling so we can click on this
 

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:33.380 align:start position:0%
still struggling so we can click on this
link<00:11:31.170><c> here</c><00:11:31.260><c> and</c><00:11:31.740><c> see</c><00:11:32.040><c> how</c><00:11:32.370><c> many</c><00:11:32.430><c> activities</c><00:11:33.180><c> of</c>

link here and see how many activities of
practice<00:11:33.930><c> were</c><00:11:34.410><c> there</c><00:11:34.680><c> and</c><00:11:35.490><c> we</c><00:11:35.640><c> can</c>

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:35.820 align:start position:0%
practice were there and we can
 

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.210 align:start position:0%
practice were there and we can
distinguish<00:11:36.360><c> between</c><00:11:36.540><c> those</c><00:11:36.959><c> two</c><00:11:37.260><c> hypotheses</c>

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
distinguish between those two hypotheses
 

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.170 align:start position:0%
distinguish between those two hypotheses
and<00:11:38.550><c> it</c><00:11:39.330><c> looks</c><00:11:39.570><c> like</c><00:11:39.870><c> there</c><00:11:40.860><c> were</c><00:11:41.040><c> only</c><00:11:41.220><c> really</c>

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:42.180 align:start position:0%
and it looks like there were only really
 

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:45.970 align:start position:0%
and it looks like there were only really
three<00:11:43.010><c> so</c><00:11:44.010><c> three</c><00:11:44.760><c> practice</c><00:11:45.330><c> opportunities</c>

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:45.980 align:start position:0%
three so three practice opportunities
 

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:49.340 align:start position:0%
three so three practice opportunities
may<00:11:46.980><c> not</c><00:11:47.190><c> be</c><00:11:47.310><c> enough</c><00:11:47.580><c> for</c><00:11:48.480><c> students</c><00:11:48.930><c> to</c><00:11:49.110><c> master</c>

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:49.350 align:start position:0%
may not be enough for students to master
 

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.220 align:start position:0%
may not be enough for students to master
that<00:11:49.650><c> skill</c><00:11:50.370><c> okay</c><00:11:51.150><c> that's</c><00:11:51.510><c> good</c><00:11:51.750><c> that</c><00:11:51.959><c> we</c>

00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:52.230 align:start position:0%
that skill okay that's good that we
 

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:55.670 align:start position:0%
that skill okay that's good that we

00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
found that out absolutely so if we look
 

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
found that out absolutely so if we look
at<00:11:55.890><c> one</c><00:11:56.070><c> of</c><00:11:56.100><c> these</c><00:11:56.630><c> do</c><00:11:57.630><c> you</c><00:11:57.720><c> think</c><00:11:57.959><c> there</c><00:11:58.110><c> would</c>

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:58.290 align:start position:0%
at one of these do you think there would
 

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.470 align:start position:0%
at one of these do you think there would
be<00:11:58.320><c> some</c><00:11:58.680><c> other</c><00:11:58.830><c> activities</c><00:11:59.550><c> like</c><00:12:00.000><c> this</c><00:12:00.240><c> that</c>

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
be some other activities like this that
 

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.690 align:start position:0%
be some other activities like this that
you<00:12:00.570><c> could</c><00:12:00.720><c> add</c><00:12:00.930><c> for</c><00:12:01.350><c> practice</c><00:12:01.860><c> sergeant</c><00:12:02.400><c> ya</c>

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
you could add for practice sergeant ya
 

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.930 align:start position:0%
you could add for practice sergeant ya
next<00:12:03.180><c> time</c><00:12:03.390><c> great</c>
