00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.660
 Camera360 is 8 years old 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.500
 But the passion to create better video experiences with new technologies 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.680
 Still the same as the first day 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.240
 Hello everyone, I am Xu Wei. 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.120
 Founder and CEO of Pingo Technology 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.960
 The love for photography actually comes from my father. 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.380
 He is a photographer 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.160
 I have given me a lot of enlightenment and edification in photography since I was a child. 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.100
 After growing up 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.940
 I also hope that the beauty of photography will be felt by more people. 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.140
 And use new technologies and innovations 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.700
 Give people a more powerful and flexible shooting experience 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.140
 The equipment in the hands of users is becoming more diverse today. 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.140
 Demand is also increasingly complicated 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.080
 Want to always satisfy users and even stimulate their creative desires 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.780
 Inseparable from more open platforms and more advanced technologies 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.760
 Hello everyone, I am the technical director of Li Tao's Fruit Technology. 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.460
 We started paying attention to Kotlin long ago. 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.440
 After learning that it became the official Android development language 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.460
 We decided to promote Kotlin within the company immediately. 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 Small-scale participation in StudyJams from the beginning 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.880
 Go to the company twice a week for study courses 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.760
 Our engineers are extremely enthusiastic 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.020
 This is also due to Kotlin's more reasonable learning curve. 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.780
 And many efficient and convenient syntax features 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.040
 A lot of syntactic sugar more modern grammatical features 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.260
 Such as natively supported Lambda expressions 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.280
 Let Kotlin significantly improve our development efficiency 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.780
 New features developed with Kotlin 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.920
 It took only three months to advance to the point where it can go online. 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.980
 Refactoring old code with Kotlin also benefits a lot 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.980
 Nearly 200 lines of Java code 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.580
 After refactoring, you only need 86 rows on average. 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.820
 In terms of stability, we use a project that mostly uses the Java language. 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.220
 Compared to another project that uses Kotlin 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.260
 The latter has a significantly lower frequency of NullPointerException 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.680
 I am the co-founder and COO of Gu Rui Pin Guo Technology. 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.520
 It is important to continuously polish the details of the product. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.680
 We will overwhelm the event through Android vitals 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.100
 From 4.51% to 0.01% 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.340
 The crash rate dropped from 0.99% to 0.27% 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.900
 Monthly score increased from 4.341 to 4.471 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.800
 Camera360 after launching the innovative dynamic sticker feature 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.800
 Popular in the Japanese market 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.080
 This strengthens our determination to enhance the user experience with new technologies. 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.960
 We will continue to pay attention to Googleâ€™s new technologies such as ARCore 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.960
 To create a better image experience 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.240
 First use new technology 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.020
 And continuous independent research and development 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.700
 Make Camera360 occupy an important position in overseas markets for a long time 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.700
 We believe on Google Play 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.960
 We will reach more users around the world. 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.720
 And use our products to bring them more colorful smiles
