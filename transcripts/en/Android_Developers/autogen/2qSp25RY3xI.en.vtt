00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.429
this week absolutely yeah and you can
see here that they've got have done a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439
see here that they've got have done a
 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.050
see here that they've got have done a
pretty good job on their landing page on

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
pretty good job on their landing page on
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.320

Google Play it's one of the things that

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330
Google Play it's one of the things that
 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.399
Google Play it's one of the things that
they've done a little bit wrong here so

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409
they've done a little bit wrong here so
 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.899
they've done a little bit wrong here so
they've got a great logo which I really

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
they've got a great logo which I really
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.850
they've got a great logo which I really
like to see but what they've done which

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
like to see but what they've done which
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.020
like to see but what they've done which
I think they could really improve on is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030
I think they could really improve on is
 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.190
I think they could really improve on is
their feature graphic which is

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
their feature graphic which is
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200
their feature graphic which is
effectively just a combination of their

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210
effectively just a combination of their
 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.120
effectively just a combination of their
logo the app name in a bunch of

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130
logo the app name in a bunch of
 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.190
logo the app name in a bunch of
screenshots now it turns out that there

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200
screenshots now it turns out that there
 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.630
screenshots now it turns out that there
are other places on the Google Play

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
are other places on the Google Play
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.510
are other places on the Google Play
listing for your logo app name and

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520
listing for your logo app name and
 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.310
listing for your logo app name and
screenshots and so it's kind of a wasted

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320
screenshots and so it's kind of a wasted
 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.109
screenshots and so it's kind of a wasted
space so they've they've done the right

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119
space so they've they've done the right
 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.429
space so they've they've done the right
thing and having a feature graphic but

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
thing and having a feature graphic but
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.749
thing and having a feature graphic but
they could do a lot more with what God

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
they could do a lot more with what God
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.880
they could do a lot more with what God
sure so what is this app it describes

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890
sure so what is this app it describes
 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.859
sure so what is this app it describes
itself as a super-powered replacement

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
itself as a super-powered replacement
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.630
itself as a super-powered replacement
for SMS messaging and I'd say it pretty

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
for SMS messaging and I'd say it pretty
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.760
for SMS messaging and I'd say it pretty
much lives up to that claim you can do

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.830
much lives up to that claim you can do
all the regular instant messaging type

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
all the regular instant messaging type
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840
all the regular instant messaging type
behavior that expect which is basically

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
behavior that expect which is basically
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.609
behavior that expect which is basically
sending into the messages to other

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619
sending into the messages to other
 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.480
sending into the messages to other
people all without having to rely on a

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490

cell network connection in order to do
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.719
cell network connection in order to do
so so the big plus here is that if you

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729
so so the big plus here is that if you
 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.190
so so the big plus here is that if you
don't have an unlimited text messaging

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
don't have an unlimited text messaging
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.600
don't have an unlimited text messaging
plan you can send messages to your

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610

friends at no cost which is nice
 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.130
friends at no cost which is nice
as a bonus you can also do multimedia

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140
as a bonus you can also do multimedia
 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.990
as a bonus you can also do multimedia
stuff so you can send pictures images

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000
stuff so you can send pictures images
 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.940

which you can theoretically do with with
 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.310
which you can theoretically do with with
mms but this makes it a lot easier and

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320
mms but this makes it a lot easier and
 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.720
mms but this makes it a lot easier and

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.170
rather than having a secondary account
which is nice but it does mean you can't

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180
which is nice but it does mean you can't
 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.030

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:00.870
on each of the different services so how

on each of the different services so how
do you reconcile that and I think that's

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940
do you reconcile that and I think that's
 

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:04.100
do you reconcile that and I think that's
one of the challenges and something

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:04.110

to figure out how to do that

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:08.580
to figure out how to do that
 

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.320
to figure out how to do that
reconciliation otherwise the simplicity

notification gets expanded the user can
see all their recent notifications at a

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:15.400
see all their recent notifications at a
 

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.070
see all their recent notifications at a
glance you can see that in the gmail app

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:17.080
glance you can see that in the gmail app
 

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.840
glance you can see that in the gmail app
for instance i think you know if you

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:18.850
for instance i think you know if you
 

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.020
for instance i think you know if you
look at this particular style view on

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:22.030
look at this particular style view on
 

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.580
look at this particular style view on
the right there where it's expanded i

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:23.590
the right there where it's expanded i
 

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.130
the right there where it's expanded i
think you can see that's a perfect way

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:26.140
think you can see that's a perfect way
 

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:30.200
think you can see that's a perfect way
to receive a series of instant messages

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:30.210
to receive a series of instant messages
 

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:33.720
to receive a series of instant messages
you might also consider going one step

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:33.730
you might also consider going one step
 

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:37.020
you might also consider going one step
further with rich notifications and have

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:37.030
further with rich notifications and have
 

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.660
further with rich notifications and have
some action buttons for instance i

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:39.670
some action buttons for instance i
 

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.880
some action buttons for instance i
honestly would really appreciate a

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:41.890
honestly would really appreciate a
 

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:43.590
honestly would really appreciate a
button to automatically send a busy

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600
button to automatically send a busy
 

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.810
button to automatically send a busy
message from i am i am buddy you know

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:45.820
message from i am i am buddy you know
 

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.850

i'm driving or whatever just something
that's that's really really simple of

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:50.110
that's that's really really simple of
 

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:51.960
that's that's really really simple of
course i'm in a meeting right list

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:51.970
course i'm in a meeting right list
 

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.560
course i'm in a meeting right list
dangers yeah well anyway the point is

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:55.570
dangers yeah well anyway the point is
 

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.660
dangers yeah well anyway the point is
that there's a lot of stuff you can do

00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:57.670
that there's a lot of stuff you can do
 

00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:59.970
that there's a lot of stuff you can do
with rich notifications on jellybean but

00:13:59.970 --> 00:13:59.980
with rich notifications on jellybean but
 

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.800
with rich notifications on jellybean but
you don't actually have to be targeting

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:01.810
you don't actually have to be targeting
 

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.290
you don't actually have to be targeting
jellybean to get this if you use a

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:04.300
jellybean to get this if you use a
 

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:07.500
jellybean to get this if you use a
notification compat api it's easy to

00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:07.510
notification compat api it's easy to
 

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:09.330
notification compat api it's easy to
support both the old notification style

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:09.340
support both the old notification style
 

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.240
support both the old notification style
and the new hotness just remember that

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:12.250
and the new hotness just remember that
 

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.860
and the new hotness just remember that
any action buttons you create won't be

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:13.870
any action buttons you create won't be
 

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:16.050
any action buttons you create won't be
available on legacy versions of the OS

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:16.060
available on legacy versions of the OS
 

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:18.150
available on legacy versions of the OS
so you need to have some alternate way

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160
so you need to have some alternate way
 

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.670
so you need to have some alternate way
to access that behavior and of course as

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:20.680
to access that behavior and of course as
 

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:22.920
to access that behavior and of course as
we all know it's usually to just tap the

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:22.930
we all know it's usually to just tap the
 

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.620
we all know it's usually to just tap the
notification and send these are directly

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:25.630
notification and send these are directly
 

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:28.530
notification and send these are directly
to an activity that can handle that

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:28.540
to an activity that can handle that
 

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:30.090
to an activity that can handle that
notification or expand on it or offer

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:30.100
notification or expand on it or offer
 

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.460
notification or expand on it or offer
actions so using the notification compat

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:32.470
actions so using the notification compat
 

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.290
actions so using the notification compat
api you're right actually able to just

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:34.300
api you're right actually able to just
 

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:36.090
api you're right actually able to just
have a single code path which has all

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:36.100
have a single code path which has all
 

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.830
have a single code path which has all
the functionality for all the newest

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:37.840
the functionality for all the newest
 

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.840
the functionality for all the newest
versions and it just gracefully degrades

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:39.850
versions and it just gracefully degrades
 

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.030
versions and it just gracefully degrades
back to whatever supported essentially

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040
back to whatever supported essentially
 

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.740
back to whatever supported essentially
so yeah it's nice that's question yeah

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:43.750
so yeah it's nice that's question yeah
 

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.590
so yeah it's nice that's question yeah
that's really cool so the the code that

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600
that's really cool so the the code that
 

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.320
that's really cool so the the code that
you see on the screen is ripped from the

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:49.330
you see on the screen is ripped from the
 

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.480
you see on the screen is ripped from the
pages of developer android com and shows

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:51.490
pages of developer android com and shows
 

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:52.830
pages of developer android com and shows
you exactly how to make

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:52.840
you exactly how to make
 

00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:55.890
you exactly how to make
an inbox style notification as you can

00:14:55.890 --> 00:14:55.900
an inbox style notification as you can
 

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.410
an inbox style notification as you can
see it's really quite simple and I think

00:14:58.410 --> 00:14:58.420
see it's really quite simple and I think
 

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.720
see it's really quite simple and I think
I think in fact the if you go to Android

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:00.730
I think in fact the if you go to Android
 

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:02.610
I think in fact the if you go to Android
training or perhaps the API guides the

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:02.620
training or perhaps the API guides the
 

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.230
training or perhaps the API guides the
notification guide i think is being

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240
notification guide i think is being
 

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.330
notification guide i think is being
recently updated to have all the new

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:06.340
recently updated to have all the new
 

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.550
recently updated to have all the new
hotness explained in some detail so yes

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560
hotness explained in some detail so yes
 

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:09.810
hotness explained in some detail so yes
in fact that's where i stole all the

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:09.820
in fact that's where i stole all the
 

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.030
in fact that's where i stole all the

have been thieving like a madman today

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:14.610
have been thieving like a madman today
 

00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:17.430
have been thieving like a madman today
that's what we do here in as developer

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440
that's what we do here in as developer
 

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.870
that's what we do here in as developer
advocates we take all the hard work of

00:15:18.870 --> 00:15:18.880
advocates we take all the hard work of
 

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.610
advocates we take all the hard work of
our tech writers and steal it and pass

00:15:20.610 --> 00:15:20.620
our tech writers and steal it and pass

do you have for us today or ito well I

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560
do you have for us today or ito well I
 

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.110
do you have for us today or ito well I
think it's also worth discussing how

00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120
think it's also worth discussing how
 

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.640
think it's also worth discussing how
these instant messaging apps actually

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:29.650
these instant messaging apps actually
 

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:32.190
these instant messaging apps actually
work the key to a great experience is

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:32.200
work the key to a great experience is
 

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:34.080
work the key to a great experience is
really balancing that low latency

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.090
really balancing that low latency
 

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:37.410
really balancing that low latency
instant instant messaging with making

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:37.420
instant instant messaging with making
 

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:38.490
instant instant messaging with making
sure that you're not draining the

00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:38.500
sure that you're not draining the
 

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.440
sure that you're not draining the
battery in order to get that those rapid

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:40.450
battery in order to get that those rapid
 

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.420
battery in order to get that those rapid
updates so fundamentally there's a

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:42.430
updates so fundamentally there's a
 

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.980
updates so fundamentally there's a
couple of different approaches that you

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:43.990
couple of different approaches that you
 

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:46.260
couple of different approaches that you
can take on the first hand you can

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:46.270
can take on the first hand you can
 

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.150
can take on the first hand you can
maintain an open socket connection

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160
maintain an open socket connection
 

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.650
maintain an open socket connection
between your client running on each

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:49.660
between your client running on each
 

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:52.680
between your client running on each
device and your server now having an

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:52.690
device and your server now having an
 

00:15:52.690 --> 00:15:54.360
device and your server now having an
open socket will minimize your latency

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:54.370
open socket will minimize your latency
 

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.070
open socket will minimize your latency
because the connection is there you can

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:56.080
because the connection is there you can
 

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.810
because the connection is there you can
just sense it off through that pipe but

00:15:57.810 --> 00:15:57.820
just sense it off through that pipe but
 

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:59.640
just sense it off through that pipe but
you really need to carefully manage it

00:15:59.640 --> 00:15:59.650
you really need to carefully manage it
 

00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:00.810
you really need to carefully manage it
so that you're not draining your battery

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:00.820
so that you're not draining your battery
 

00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.790
so that you're not draining your battery
exceptionally quickly by maintaining

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:02.800
exceptionally quickly by maintaining
 

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.670
exceptionally quickly by maintaining
that socket so the way that you actually

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:05.680
that socket so the way that you actually
 

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.380
that socket so the way that you actually
keep the socket open is by sending data

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:07.390
keep the socket open is by sending data
 

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.480
keep the socket open is by sending data
or sending keep-alive pings to your

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:09.490
or sending keep-alive pings to your
 

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:11.610
or sending keep-alive pings to your
server at regular intervals which is

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:11.620
server at regular intervals which is
 

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:12.570
server at regular intervals which is
going to stop the network from

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:12.580
going to stop the network from
 

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.000
going to stop the network from
automatically closing those sockets but

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:15.010
automatically closing those sockets but
 

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:16.470
automatically closing those sockets but
if your ping to regularly you're just

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480
if your ping to regularly you're just
 

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.610
if your ping to regularly you're just
going to be keeping the cell radio

00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:17.620
going to be keeping the cell radio
 

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.590
going to be keeping the cell radio
turned on its going to drain the battery

00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600
turned on its going to drain the battery
 

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.810
turned on its going to drain the battery
and if you do it too infrequently you

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:21.820
and if you do it too infrequently you
 

00:16:21.820 --> 00:16:23.190
and if you do it too infrequently you
can lose your socket connection anyway

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:23.200
can lose your socket connection anyway
 

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.600
can lose your socket connection anyway
so the latency is going to go up because

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.610
so the latency is going to go up because
 

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.070
so the latency is going to go up because
you're expecting it to be zero latency

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:26.080
you're expecting it to be zero latency
 

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.810
you're expecting it to be zero latency
but it isn't you've got the additional

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:27.820
but it isn't you've got the additional
 

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:29.520
but it isn't you've got the additional

so if you have your own servers pawling

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:29.250
so if you have your own servers pawling
 

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:31.310
so if you have your own servers pawling
is never the right answer so if you're

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320
is never the right answer so if you're
 

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.380
is never the right answer so if you're
relying on someone else's servers to to

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:33.390
relying on someone else's servers to to
 

00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:35.210

populating those and asking me to
 

00:26:58.649 --> 00:27:00.649

them all in is all things which are

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:01.890
them all in is all things which are
 

00:27:01.890 --> 00:27:02.870
them all in is all things which are
going to make that sign-in process

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880
going to make that sign-in process
 

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:05.659
going to make that sign-in process
smoother absolutely so what do you think

00:27:05.659 --> 00:27:05.669
smoother absolutely so what do you think
 

00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:07.820
smoother absolutely so what do you think
about trillion trillion so kind of

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:07.830
about trillion trillion so kind of
 

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.500
about trillion trillion so kind of
similar to to the first step that we

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:09.510
similar to to the first step that we
 

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:11.000
similar to to the first step that we
looked at in that I'd really like to see

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.010
looked at in that I'd really like to see
 

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.190
looked at in that I'd really like to see
a modernized UI and an improved tablet

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200
a modernized UI and an improved tablet
 

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:15.740
a modernized UI and an improved tablet
support I think otherwise it's it's good

00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:15.750
support I think otherwise it's it's good
 

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:17.299
support I think otherwise it's it's good
in that it has that focus and so that's

00:27:17.299 --> 00:27:17.309
in that it has that focus and so that's
 

00:27:17.309 --> 00:27:19.159
in that it has that focus and so that's
a big thing for me as an app which has a

00:27:19.159 --> 00:27:19.169
a big thing for me as an app which has a
 

00:27:19.169 --> 00:27:21.260
a big thing for me as an app which has a
clear focus and in this app they're not

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:21.270
clear focus and in this app they're not
 

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.880
clear focus and in this app they're not
trying to reinvent messaging they're

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:22.890
trying to reinvent messaging they're
 

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.860
trying to reinvent messaging they're
just trying to make it easy for you to

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:24.870
just trying to make it easy for you to
 

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.630
just trying to make it easy for you to
use the tools and the services and the

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:26.640
use the tools and the services and the
 

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.799
use the tools and the services and the
contacts which you've already been

00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:27.809
contacts which you've already been
 

00:27:27.809 --> 00:27:29.690
contacts which you've already been
communicating with on a different

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:29.700
communicating with on a different
 

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.909
communicating with on a different
platform well and I guess it's not

00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919
platform well and I guess it's not
 

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:34.430
platform well and I guess it's not
showing up here because this slide was

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440
showing up here because this slide was
 

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.049
showing up here because this slide was
to put together by trained monkeys but

00:27:36.049 --> 00:27:36.059
to put together by trained monkeys but
 

00:27:36.059 --> 00:27:39.010
to put together by trained monkeys but
the real important thing I think is that

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:39.020
the real important thing I think is that
 

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.880
the real important thing I think is that
they should integrate with contacts

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:40.890
they should integrate with contacts
 

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.799
they should integrate with contacts
manager absolutely absolutely i've

00:27:42.799 --> 00:27:42.809
manager absolutely absolutely i've
 

00:27:42.809 --> 00:27:44.450
manager absolutely absolutely i've
already got my contacts there put all of

00:27:44.450 --> 00:27:44.460
already got my contacts there put all of
 

00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:46.159
already got my contacts there put all of
that data in there and that's going to

00:27:46.159 --> 00:27:46.169
that data in there and that's going to
 

00:27:46.169 --> 00:27:47.990
that data in there and that's going to
make life a lot easier so yeah I

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000
make life a lot easier so yeah I
 

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.570
make life a lot easier so yeah I
basically trillions been around for a

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580
basically trillions been around for a
 

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.159
basically trillions been around for a
long time and so that's why I think

00:27:52.159 --> 00:27:52.169
long time and so that's why I think
 

00:27:52.169 --> 00:27:53.870
long time and so that's why I think
tablet support is a big one for them

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880
tablet support is a big one for them
 

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.639
tablet support is a big one for them

it's like it's a company which clearly
recognizes that there is an opportunity

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:57.330
recognizes that there is an opportunity
 

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:59.270
recognizes that there is an opportunity
in adapting their service to people

00:27:59.270 --> 00:27:59.280
in adapting their service to people
 

00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.860
in adapting their service to people
using new devices
