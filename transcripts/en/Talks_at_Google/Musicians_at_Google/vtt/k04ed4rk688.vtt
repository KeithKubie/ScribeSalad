[MUSIC RAII &amp; WHITNEY KEATON,
 "NO WORRIES (STEP CLAP)"]

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.512
RAII: Thank you.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:48.496
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.300
RYAN LOREN: The
first thing I wanted

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.560
to ask you guys is let's
just talk about your life

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.550
and how you came together.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.220
RAII: I went to college at
the University of Illinois

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.560
in Champaign-Urbana, and that
happens to be where she's from.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.170
That's her hometown.

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.150
And at the end of
my freshman year

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.670
I was asked to join a
gospel recording group,

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.000
and she was a member
of that group.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.140
So that's how we met.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.910
We met through music.

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.840
There wasn't the
greatest introduction,

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.790
because I felt that she was not
the nicest person when I first

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.845
met her.

00:06:32.845 --> 00:06:34.150
She just didn't talk to me.

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:35.150
RYAN LOREN: Why is that?

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.510
RAII: OK, so check it out.

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.930
I'm the new guy--

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:37.850
WHITNEY KEATON: So check it out.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:38.641
RAII: Check it out.

00:06:38.641 --> 00:06:40.260
RYAN LOREN: Oh,
I'll check it out.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.040
RAII: I'm the new guy
in the group, right?

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.290
So I'm expecting everybody
to at least greet me.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.390
I met everybody at the
album release party

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:47.780
from their previous project.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.030
I'm expecting the new
members to be like, oh, hey.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.780
Nice to meet you.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:51.280
Welcome.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.280
Or something.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.580
And she's walking around and she
ain't giving me no eye contact.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.025
She ain't giving me no nothing.

00:06:58.025 --> 00:07:00.690
So I'm like, she is mean.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.775
And that's what
I thought of her.

00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:04.816
So it was not love at
first sight, unfortunately.

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.660
But yeah.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.640
WHITNEY KEATON: I
didn't really talk much.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.310
I just didn't really
talk much period.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.040
It wasn't me being mean.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.000
I wasn't being mean.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.890
RYAN LOREN: Well, clearly
we found that out.

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:21.862
RAII: Well, so then once
we got passed that--

00:07:21.862 --> 00:07:22.570
RYAN LOREN: Yeah.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.480
RAII: Right.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.900
We realized we liked a
lot of the same artists,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.370
and even on some of the
performances and rehearsals

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.930
and stuff like that we, would
sing on the bus on the way

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.680
to the different places the same
songs, the same artists, all

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.110
the way to, like, the last
seconds when it's fading out,

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.770
and nobody really
knows that part--

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.490
WHITNEY KEATON: I'm like,
oh, you know that part, too?

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.280
RAII: --unless you really
listen to that artist.

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:44.590
And so that's how we bonded.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:48.330
Like, it was a really
strong and organic and real.

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.830
And we became
really good friends

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.080
before we even started dating.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.060
WHITNEY KEATON: And I starting
singing background for him

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:53.545
in college.

00:07:53.545 --> 00:07:54.336
RYAN LOREN: Really?

00:07:54.336 --> 00:07:57.600
WHITNEY KEATON: He would do
performances, and I would be--

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.220
I--

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.170
RAII: She was my lead singer.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.010
WHITNEY KEATON: I was the
lead background singer.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.219
RAII: I mean, she really was.

00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:02.884
WHITNEY KEATON: I
would teach the parts,

00:08:02.884 --> 00:08:04.670
and, you know, he
would be comfortable

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.440
with me working with
the singers separately.

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.680
So we would perform together
and work with each other.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.780
RYAN LOREN: So name a
couple of the artists

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.422
that you guys liked in common.

00:08:14.422 --> 00:08:15.380
WHITNEY KEATON: Brandy.

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.471
RAII: Brandy was the artist
that we bonded over the most,

00:08:18.471 --> 00:08:18.970
I think.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.845
WHITNEY KEATON: Yeah.

00:08:19.845 --> 00:08:21.000
Yeah.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.460
RYAN LOREN: All right.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.987
Any particular songs?

00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:26.820
WHITNEY KEATON: The
whole "Full Moon" album.

00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:27.319
RAII: Right.

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:29.657
The whole "Full Moon."

00:08:29.657 --> 00:08:31.490
WHITNEY KEATON: The
whole "Full Moon" album.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:31.970
RYAN LOREN: All right.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:34.120
I think let's just fast
forward to Alicia Keys.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.620
RAII: OK.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.830
RYAN LOREN: So you guys
toured with Alicia Keys

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:39.150
as her background singers.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.900
You were there first,
if I'm not mistaken?

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:41.733
WHITNEY KEATON: Yes.

00:08:41.733 --> 00:08:43.110
I just made six
years in October.

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.754
RYAN LOREN: And then
you brought RAII?

00:08:44.754 --> 00:08:46.420
WHITNEY KEATON: He
just started in 2012.

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.336
RYAN LOREN: All right.

00:08:47.336 --> 00:08:49.670
I just want to hear what
you feel that experience

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:51.260
brought you guys.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.550
RAII: We were-- our
first professional gig

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:57.950
together was Estelle, and we
performed background for her.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:03.306
So that gave us an
opportunity to work together

00:09:03.306 --> 00:09:04.345
on a large platform.

00:09:04.345 --> 00:09:06.740
It taught us how to trust
each other musically.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:10.270
It taught us how to
listen more keenly.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.670
And then we took that and
took it with us to Alicia.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.190
And we learned how to
do this thing for real.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:18.770
What it takes on and off stage.

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.840
It's not just having
a great voice.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.580
It's about having a great
energy and a great spirit.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:25.270
And I think--

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.929
WHITNEY KEATON:
That's the biggest.

00:09:26.929 --> 00:09:27.970
RAII: More than anything.

00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.570
WHITNEY KEATON: That's the
biggest beyond the talent.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.580
Like, your personality,
how you communicate,

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:36.200
and how you work with each
other, how you treat people.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.800
Because on tour, Alicia's
such a huge artist

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.530
she has so many different
types of performances,

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.430
and so we could be in
sound check rehearsing

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.099
for another event or--
it's always changing.

00:09:50.099 --> 00:09:52.390
There are always different
renditions of the same song.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.670
We have so many
different endings

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.100
of "Fallen," so many
different endings

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.020
for "If I Ain't Got You."

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.140
We have a Spanish version
of "If I Ain't Got You."

00:09:58.140 --> 00:09:59.610
There's so many
different things,

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.290
and so with us,
it's not just about

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:05.750
are you capable of singing it,
because, well, we have the job.

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:09.230
So obviously she trusts
us in that department.

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.610
Since I'm the lead
background vocalist,

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.590
I arrange the parts
for tour, so when

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.820
there's something
changing, me and him

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:19.260
have to get together and arrange
new parts so that it's not

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.010
the same as the album
or it's not the same

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:22.176
as what we're doing on tour.

00:10:22.176 --> 00:10:27.194
So we have to humble ourselves.

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:28.610
He has to take
that position like,

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:31.080
she knows what Alicia
wants so let me let her.

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.210
Even if I disagree with
the way she's doing it,

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:34.210
I have to listen to her.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:35.500
And then when he
suggests something,

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.070
I have to humble myself even
though I've been there longer.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.130
I have to say, well, OK.

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:41.020
That's a good idea.

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:41.960
OK, we'll do that.

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:42.700
We can do that.

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:43.520
Like, that's good.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.690
So we have to do that
before we can even sing.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:52.250
You have to be able to
create, arrange, and get

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:54.000
what you-- you have
to be on the same page

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.920
with what you're
going to present,

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.980
because a lot of the
times, before she comes

00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.930
into the rehearsal,
the musical director

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.074
is there to help arrange
the music and do things.

00:11:01.074 --> 00:11:02.990
And we have to get
something to present to her

00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:05.880
to see if she even likes it
before we can even perform it.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.290
So when she's there we have
to, even though we probably

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:10.940
just made it up and just started
singing it 15 seconds ago--

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:11.600
RAII: She can't know that.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.690
WHITNEY KEATON: We have
to come in performing

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:15.023
as this is what we're going
to do for Letterman tonight.

00:11:15.023 --> 00:11:17.690
And, you know, she'll
come in and she'll listen.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.770
All right, that's cool.

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:20.630
Guitar, can you
give me an E flat?

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.440
OK.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.050
And then she'll
start rearranging it.

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.980
And so then it
changes again, and we

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:30.690
have to still sing it as if
this is show time right here.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:33.529
So we've learned to
catch onto things so fast

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:35.070
and learning how to
work in a moment.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.790
I'm constantly having my
BlackBerry out recording stuff,

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.660
because stuff changes so fast.

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.590
I might have to listen
to it right before.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.150
And here's Alicia
Keys, and I'm like,

00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:45.550
let me listen to my
BlackBerry real quick.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:47.466
And let me make sure
this is the right ending.

00:11:47.466 --> 00:11:49.470
I'm not doing ending
B or ending C. We're

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:51.630
doing ending D for tonight.

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:53.384
So just working together
before we even--

00:11:53.384 --> 00:11:54.550
RYAN LOREN: The D-th ending.

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:54.990
WHITNEY KEATON: Yeah.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.806
Yeah.

00:11:55.806 --> 00:11:57.430
Yeah, so we have to
be on the same page

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:59.559
before the vocals
even come, really.

00:11:59.559 --> 00:12:01.100
RYAN LOREN: What's
next for you guys?

00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:03.640
I know you just
finished the tour,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.987
and now you're ready
to have some space.

00:12:06.987 --> 00:12:07.820
WHITNEY KEATON: Yes.

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:11.240
We have time to, first,
focus more on our marriage.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.000
RAII: Yes.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.740
WHITNEY KEATON: On each other.

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:13.240
RAII: Yes.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.690
WHITNEY KEATON: Because
stage is an extension of--

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:16.190
RAII: Home.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:17.148
WHITNEY KEATON: --home.

00:12:17.148 --> 00:12:20.480
So we can't jump
right into career

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.140
and performing and
planning all of that

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:24.530
if, again, we are
not on the same page.

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:25.860
It just doesn't work.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:29.530
We don't want to be this
is who we are at home.

00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:32.600
And then on stage we're kind
of trying to fake this persona.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.460
We want it to be
authentic as possible,

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.740
and it only helps us mentally.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:38.840
That's just too much work
to be trying to fake.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.990
It's just too much work.

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.690
So we have time to
focus on each other,

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.610
and to talk to
family more, spend

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.250
time with friends
and family, and also

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:52.060
to be in the studio to
finish our project called

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:53.080
"A Time for Everything."

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:57.120
RAII: It's a joint
project, and it features

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:59.260
my wife Whitney Keaton--

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:00.760
WHITNEY KEATON: And
my husband RAII.

00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.310
RAII: Which is her
stage name, by the way.

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.226
WHITNEY KEATON: Right.

00:13:03.226 --> 00:13:06.010
My stage name is Whitney Keaton,
but legally I am Mrs. Smith.

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:08.580
RAII: Thank you.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.295
I worked hard for
that, by the way.

00:13:11.295 --> 00:13:14.615
And the project, some of
the songs feature her.

00:13:14.615 --> 00:13:15.990
Some of the songs
feature myself.

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.740
Some of the songs
feature us together.

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:20.800
It is a conversation
between a man and a woman,

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.442
and it's a relationship roadmap.

00:13:22.442 --> 00:13:23.400
Someone called it that.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.890
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.600
Thank you.

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.810
I really do appreciate that.

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.400
I like that you all liked it.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.484
And "A Time for Everything"
is the name of it.

00:13:33.484 --> 00:13:35.900
And there's a time for different
things in a relationship.

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.090
WHITNEY KEATON: And
those different things

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:38.370
are the titles of each song.

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:40.560
So each song is the journey.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:42.190
RAII: Yep.

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.950
We're going to
present "No Worries,"

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:49.830
and that is a song that
came at a really-- a moment

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.592
in our lives where we had
to think to ourselves, we

00:13:52.592 --> 00:13:53.550
gonna get through this.

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.070
WHITNEY KEATON: We were
unemployed for seven months.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.830
RAII: We were unemployed
for seven months,

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:02.710
and this is without unemployment
coming in at the time.

00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:04.500
And it was unexpected as well.

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:04.920
WHITNEY KEATON: In New York.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.365
RAII: In New York
City, so you all

00:14:06.365 --> 00:14:09.590
already know what that means.

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.760
But I was in the living
room working on some music,

00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.343
and my wife comes in with tears
in her eyes singing, [SINGING]

00:14:14.343 --> 00:14:15.350
no worries.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:16.610
We'll get through it all.

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:18.651
WHITNEY KEATON: That's
the first thing that came.

00:14:18.651 --> 00:14:19.750
It was just that.

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:21.850
RAII: And I said-- I said, what?

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:25.860
And she just kept singing it.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.530
And we just started
dancing and crying

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:31.197
and it was like the song
really meant something to us.

00:14:31.197 --> 00:14:32.780
It really helped us
through that time.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:37.360
So when we sing it, I
remember that moment.

00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:40.150
And then I look at where
we've gone since then,

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:41.530
being on the world
tour and going

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.780
to all these different places
that you read about when

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.010
you're in school, right?

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:46.850
It's true.

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:47.847
You get through it all.

00:14:47.847 --> 00:14:49.430
As long as you
believe, as long as you

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.330
can see yourself getting through
it, you can get through it.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.650
And so this project
is all of that.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:55.530
Ups and downs.

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.440
You know, it's some
love songs on there,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.426
because we are in love
and we do love love,

00:14:59.426 --> 00:15:01.050
but it's some real
songs that's talking

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:02.759
about some hurtful stuff, too.

00:15:02.759 --> 00:15:04.300
And I feel like
that's a conversation

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.240
that we need to have as
adults to not just be

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.180
so surface with it.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.382
It's not always
going to be roses.

00:15:10.382 --> 00:15:12.465
There are going to be some
issues and challenges--

00:15:12.465 --> 00:15:13.930
WHITNEY KEATON: Where you have
to be honest with yourself--

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:14.310
RAII: You have to be honest.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:15.650
WHITNEY KEATON:
To be vulnerable.

00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:16.275
To communicate.

00:15:16.275 --> 00:15:17.650
RAII: You got to communicate.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.566
WHITNEY KEATON: Right?

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:23.160
RAII: You got to
compromise, you know.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.515
And we talk about all of that.

00:15:24.515 --> 00:15:25.010
WHITNEY KEATON:
Sometimes you have to let

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:27.240
some things go in
order to move forward.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.780
Sometimes you just
gotta try and stop

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.580
trying to move forward with the
mindset of what used to happen.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:32.980
You have to just--

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.521
RAII: Sometimes you got to be
willing to get to know somebody

00:15:35.521 --> 00:15:38.037
for who they are and not for
what you want them to be.

00:15:38.037 --> 00:15:40.120
These are all the titles
of the songs, by the way.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.244
WHITNEY KEATON: By the way.

00:15:41.244 --> 00:15:42.262
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:42.262 --> 00:15:44.720
RAII: And God willing we'll be
able to put this project out

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.270
this year.

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.190
Hopefully we'll have
single out soon.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.440
"No Worries," hopefully.

00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:49.426
WHITNEY KEATON: Yes.

00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:51.997
RAII: And we would definitely
appreciate your support.

00:15:51.997 --> 00:15:53.580
WHITNEY KEATON: And
more performances.

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.900
RAII: More performances indeed.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.941
WHITNEY KEATON: More
performances, more concerts.

00:15:56.941 --> 00:15:59.030
We are looking to
expand, Atlanta, DC, LA.

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.700
We want to do more,
because we have--

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.650
we've done a few shows in New
York, but we need to build.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.460
We were able to fly everywhere
with Alicia on her dime,

00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.220
but now we got to
invest in ourselves.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.250
Now we got to put
the money for us.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.600
RYAN LOREN: Well, let
me be one of the first,

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.094
maybe, to say that it's an
investment well worth it.

00:16:19.094 --> 00:16:19.760
RAII: Thank you.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.070
RYAN LOREN: And thanks
again for being here,

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:26.057
and we wish you well for the
rest of this year and beyond.

00:16:26.057 --> 00:16:26.890
WHITNEY KEATON: Yes.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:27.874
RAII: Thank you, Ryan.

00:16:27.874 --> 00:16:28.790
RYAN LOREN: All right.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.140
[APPLAUSE]
