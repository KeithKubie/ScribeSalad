00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.580
This formula should be
recorded in your notebook.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.860
So, we know that the area
of a square is l times l,

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.020
what about the area of a rectangle?

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:17.300
What is the area of a rectangle with
length equals l and with equals w?

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.370
Is it l times w?

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.300
L plus l plus w plus w?

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.630
L times L L squared.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.550
