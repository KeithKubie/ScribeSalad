00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.330
It's far into the night, but sleep won't come.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.470
You turn over.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.000
Perhaps a different position will quieten
the mind.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.080
Or maybe the other side was better after all.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.840
Not sleeping feels like a disaster.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.840
But in smaller doses, insomnia does not need
a cure.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.350
It's there for a reason; it's doing work for
us.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.890
- and we should learn to let it take its course.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.829
Crucial things we need to think about are
seeking their chance to bubble into consciousness.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.420
This insomnia is a form of revenge for all
the many ideas we pushed away, or could not

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.510
entertain in the day - but that matter intensely
to our self-understanding and development.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.690
We have been busy for too long; we have been
running on empty.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.280
But at night, we can return to a bigger duty:
to ourselves.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.990
What we think about now would sound weird
to so many people - my partner, my mother,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:20.990
my friend, my boss, my child.
These people need us to be a certain way.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.600
We don't want to let them down. But their
expectations choke off important aspects of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.860
who we are.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.400
Yet now, it is just us and the universe

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:45.140
- and for a time, we can take on a little
of its boundlessness.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.049
With a pad of paper and a pen, and a little
bedsight light on, we can dare to investigate

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:01.689
the big questions that we normally push away
and that manifest themselves just as background anxieties.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.820
We start to untangle our knotted feelings
and ideas.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.900
Things will have to change.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.350
There are exciting plans afoot too.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.420
Perhaps we can chuck it
in, and start anew; perhaps itâ€™s time for

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.120
that idea we've had for so long.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.960
Night offers us safety from the scepticism
of sensible others. 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.420
It allows us time to get ourselves together.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.400
We want to arrive, eventually, at a feasible,
defensible strategy.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.440
But we can start with thoughts, schemes that
look unimpressive, weird and possibly absurd.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.980
Night is a friend to the slow process of growth
that every ambitious project demands:

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.080
it provides us with the cover to grow into
our more complete selves.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.920
We shouldn't be in such a rush to escape it.
