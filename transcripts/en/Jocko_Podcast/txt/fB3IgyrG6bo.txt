Speaker 2:          00:02          if you want to win so bad, what I need to be worried about is the team winning. Stop sitting around making excuses and take action.

Speaker 2:          00:17          what's your team and you put your mission above yourself and above your ego.

Speaker 3:          00:20          You will win. Nothing's going to get in my way. This isn't about data anymore. You're moving into real life. If they get it, you've done it right. If they don't get it, you haven't done it right. The a situation, make a decision and do something about it. You need to be at winter patches on. Don't always just think about that immediate short term measure. Think about this strategic mission as well. I know it sounds simple. It's not easy. Even though it's hard work. We had fun. Why? Because it's fun to win. What do you preach to other people, but actually hold the rate from yourself. Who in here made it

Speaker 2:          00:59          great decision when they were emotional? Raise your hand.

Speaker 3:          01:02          Yeah, that's right. And problems. They only get worse if you don't address them. They're not responding the way they should. It's not them. It's you. What do you call it? From the sidelines in life? Absolutely nothing. No excuses, no feeling sorry for yourself. Just me checking your ego. You can't self assess. You can't improve default aggressive. We were unstoppable on the battlefield. You gotta to truly believe that it's possible to win. What leadership means to me is winning at all costs.
