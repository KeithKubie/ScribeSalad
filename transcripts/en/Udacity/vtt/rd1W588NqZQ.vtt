00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, the speed is 30.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We've just gained another 10 m/s.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The arrow should end here.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's length has increased by 1 more unit.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
These arrows are something we're going to use a lot in physics,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and we're going to call them vectors.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Notice that these vectors have two properties--a length and a direction.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
These vectors happen to be pointing downwards,

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but we'll see soon vectors that will point in other directions.
