00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:02.640
NARRATOR: By now
you might have seen

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.010
this picture, or one like it,
floating around the internet.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.870
this is Dismaland, the
Banksy-created anti-amusement

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.810
park, put together to
spoof the Magic Kingdom.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.630
And it looks pretty amazing.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.590
But the dilapidated re-creation
of Sleeping Beauty's castle

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.720
and that warped statue
of the Little Mermaid

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.780
are just the beginning.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.543
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:24.042 --> 00:00:26.800
One of the first people
to experience Dismaland,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.009
and the man who took
this photo was this guy.

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:30.800
SASHA BOGOJEV: Hi, my
name is Sash Bogojev.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.640
I'm from Croatia, and
I'm a senior writer

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.700
at arrestedmotion.com,
a website that

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.310
focuses on art shows
and art related events.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.395
The photo was taken in
Weston-super-Mare in UK,

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:42.850
on 20th August 2015,
just after the door

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.490
of Dismaland Bemusement Park
opened for the exclusive press

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.100
review.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.430
This was pretty
much the first thing

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.080
I saw when I entered
these [INAUDIBLE] grounds.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.330
And being among the first
few lucky ones to witness it

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.820
in person, I instinctively
grabbed my camera

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.415
and started snapping photos.

00:00:56.415 --> 00:00:59.160
NARRATOR: Dismaland came from
the mind of the elusive street

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.320
artist Banksy.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.660
And no, that's not
actually a picture of him.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:03.900
There really aren't any.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.190
He travels the world, creating
thought-provoking street art

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.680
using mostly paint, dark
humor, and a public wall

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.852
to express his point you.

00:01:11.852 --> 00:01:13.560
SASHA BOGOJEV:
Officially, this Dismaland

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.330
is Banksy's biggest
show today, which

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480
is built around the idea
of creating a fanfare that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.780
is as much fun as real life is
when we scratch the surface.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.630
Sadly, the real life is far
from being glittery, happy,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.450
and bright.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.440
And I believe Banksy had
it in mind when he was

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.392
putting together this project.

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:29.850
Though, calling it
only an art show

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.766
would be an understatement,
because this thing

00:01:31.766 --> 00:01:34.320
is much more than that.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.280
NARRATOR: In some ways, it
is just an amusement work.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.637
You walk in, wait in
lines, buy tacky souvenirs.

00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:43.720
SASHA BOGOJEV: It's
definitely like no other park.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.678
The rides are not build
to make you feel happy,

00:01:45.678 --> 00:01:48.350
but instead they make you
feel awkward and comfortable.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.910
The staff isn't happy either.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.670
They're bored,
frustrated, and useless.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.070
And the whole setting just
slams the weight of the world

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.789
into your face.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.580
NARRATOR: But there is
a point to all this.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.607
A reason for all ugly, sad, and
bizarre art and attractions.

00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:04.690
SASHA BOGOJEV: Instead of
amusing kids and letting

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.106
them live in the
cloud's influence

00:02:06.106 --> 00:02:09.009
by fake reality shows
and unreal expectations,

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.600
this spark shows us what the
real world actually looks like.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.144
I believe the intention was
to make people uncomfortable,

00:02:15.144 --> 00:02:16.560
to do the point
they actually have

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.310
to deal with their feelings
about certain issues.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.670
Such as migration crisis, is
global warming, economy issues,

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.987
et cetera.

00:02:23.987 --> 00:02:26.070
NARRATOR: There's also a
more succinct moral here.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.322
This one suggested my Banksy.

00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:29.530
SASHA BOGOJEV: I believe
the main message is actually

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.005
the one the artist
stated himself.

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.900
It's sorry kids.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.750
NARRATOR: Looking for another
completely bizarre place?

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.390
Check out this
episode on exploring

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.660
the creepy and abandoned ruins
of the Chernobyl nuclear power

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.410
plant.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.080
PERSON: Was one of the
top places on my list

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.900
that I want to see.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.524
Not just for photographic
opportunities

00:02:48.524 --> 00:02:51.140
and to explore the
buildings, but also

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.215
from a historical perspective.

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:55.340
NARRATOR: And as always,
don't forget to subscribe.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.190
Thanks for watching.
