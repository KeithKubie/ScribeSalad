00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.019
The faster you move the slower time goes,
but… how slow?

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.920
And how fast?

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:18.510
What does it all mean!?!

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.740
Howdy nerds and friends, thanks for checking
out DNews today, I'm Trace.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.720
There are things about theoretical and mathematically-proven
physics that are difficult to see in practice,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.259
but of those things… there is one that is
no longer simply theoretical, we can actually

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:33.260
DO it.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.530
Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity states
that the faster something travels, the slower

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.260
time appears to move relative to a stationary
observer.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.010
To test the time dilation part of the TSR
massive experiments had to be conducted.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.129
In 1971, the Hafele (ha-fi-la) and Keating
Experiment flew four atomic clocks on airplanes

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.790
going around the world and compared the time-shift
from those clocks to the atomic clock at the

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.019
National Observatory in Washington, D.C.,
and JUST like Einstein predicted the airborne

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.700
clocks were going SLOWER.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.700
Think about it.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.890
When you're on an airplane, you're aging slower
than your Mom.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.830
Unless of course, she's on the airplane too….
as long as we're thinking about it, time dilation

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.849
theory says airline pilots might be aging
slower than their ground crews… think about

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:22.849
it.

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:23.950
Not a lot slower, mind you, but slower.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.450
Once we started going to space, time dilation
became a thing we actually had to deal with.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.780
GPS satellites, for example, are 20,000 km
up going 14,000 km/hour.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.250
So, relative to an observer on the ground,
the GPS satellites are going to lose about

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.660
7 microseconds per day!

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.310
It doesn't seem like a lot, but knowing PRECISELY
what time it is, is extremely important for

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.130
measuring your exact location on the planet.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.140
If they let this go unchecked GPS would fail,
so they have to correct for Special Relativity,

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.100
just so I can find the nearest Shake Shack.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.020
Usually, before now, scientists used mathematics
or space travel to test these out-there theories.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.780
Special relativity says, the faster you go,
the slower time goes.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.700
If you travelled a year at 95% the speed of
light; you'd age one year, and people on Earth

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.879
would age 3.2 years!

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.660
But if you were going 50% the speed of light
it would only be 1.15 years.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.720
The effect get's stronger as you go faster.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.500
A German study published this week has shown
you can create the time dilation effect IN

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.500
THE LAB!

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.030
Which is HUGE news for physics.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.280
The experiment, published in Physical Review
Letters, explains how these German scientists

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.950
used a heavy ion storage ring to accelerate
charged lithium particles to almost 40 percent

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.950
the speed of light.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.200
A storage ring is sort of like the ghost containment
box in Ghostbusters, but for charged particles.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.210
Once the ions were travelling at top speed,
the scientists shot two laser lights at them,

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.060
one in front and one behind, and then measured
the light absorption rate.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.180
Think of it like sonar or radar, they're measuring
the amount of energy that comes back…

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.880
Because they had two lasers and the speed
of light is constant -- they could use the

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.190
Doppler[a] effect // rrreeeerrrrr // to figure
out the time dilation those ions were experiencing.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.440
DAMN that's complicated.

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.440
If you want to read a full explainer, check
out Ars Technica.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.720
The reason this is so huge, is because we
don't have to measure the changes on spacecraft,

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.130
or use assumptions related to the movement
of planets or astronomical bodies.

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.500
On top of that, it verifies, yet again, that
Einstein was a badass, and the Standard Model

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.500
of Physics is accurate.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.850
What do you think of news like this?

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.850
Interested?

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.850
Excited?

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:30.850
Anything else you want to know about speed
and time dilation?

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.180
Speaking of speed, thanks once again to Subaru
for making this episode possible.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.310
Especially the all-new 2015 Subaru Legacy.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.140
Every sedan has its benefits, but only one
combines them all.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.230
It’s not just a sedan.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.230
It’s a Subaru.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.870

we just started DNews and we're almost to
