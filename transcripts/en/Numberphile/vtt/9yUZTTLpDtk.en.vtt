00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.240
Ten years ago

00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.060
I taught some eighth graders science.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.400
The principal said "Oh Cliff, you can teach exactly as you wish." So my idea in teaching is,

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.670
every day have the kids go home and do an experiment. And, first thing I did was say, okay,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.550
hey peoples,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.689
here's a homework assignment.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:26.639
Measure the area of this sheet of paper. Use metric units and show your work. And, by the way, here's a ruler for you.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.670
So, I don't know, what's the area of this sheet of paper?

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.329
Just go do it. Bring it in tomorrow. So the obvious thing to do is you take your ruler, you measure across here, 20 centimeters

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:37.300
this way.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:45.180
You go across this way, you measure up and down, 26 centimeters this way. 20 centimeters times 26 centimeters should be around

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.520
520 square centimeters. Okay, that much you would do, I'd do. What my students didn't realize is, of course,

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.250
this reflects the type of

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.530
science problem, or math problem,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.930
that has lots of wrinkles and difficulties. For example,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.279
oh, what do you mean by the area of this sheet of paper?

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.640
The front side, or the front plus the back? Or maybe just the back side?

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.920
Oh! Did you include

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.499
the circles that have been knocked out? Do they count as part of the area? Worse than that.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.560
When you measured this,

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.519
did you realize that its height over here

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.460
is different from its height

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.340
over here? Let's put this piece of paper onto a square sheet of paper.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.060
Oh, this isn't a rectangular piece of paper. In other words,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.899
multiplying height times width doesn't work. You're gonna have to do

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.069
at least some kind of outer product or an integral perhaps. The rulers that I gave to my students

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.509
9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 17 18 19 centimeters.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.279
Uh, there's something wrong with Theophilus Measure Company.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.700
It's an Imperfecto. In other words, this is a comment about doing science

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.940
Always examine the assumptions that you're making whenever you make a measurement.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.200
Whenever you write something.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:34.780
Hey! Look for the places where you have ambiguous statements. What's the area of this sheet of paper?

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.780
Should I count the edges?

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.140
Don't trust your measurement tools.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.940
Good science does not mean getting the perfect answer.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.300
Good science means figuring out what could go wrong.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.380
BRADY: "How did your students do? How many of these

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.300
embedded tricks did your students pick up on?"

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.120
Oh, so, I had two classes, fifteen sixteen people in each class.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.120
This is 10, 12 years ago

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.660
One kid right away picked up. Hey, there's these holes in it.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.120
I'll have to subtract the holes, if, you know, pi r squared, he figured,

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.220
and he subtracted from it. Another kid said, wait a second,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.080
I don't know what you mean by area. In fact, two or three kids said,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.640
oh, there's a front side, or front plus back, or was just the back side?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.160
Nobody picked up on

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.360
The Imperfecto ruler.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.980
Brady: "And the shape?"

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.200
And the shape? Nobody really saw that. Nobody saw this coming,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.120
and no one recognized that,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.280
oh, they'd been handed a bill of goods.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.580
Brady, people write to me and say I'm thinking of going to college. How do I write an essay?

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.000
People write to me and say I'm trying to get into grad school, what should I say on my application?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.240
My idea is,

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.760
what I want to see is somebody

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.860
who's got to figure things out, who says "I don't know now, but I got to know!"

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.199
and somebody,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.640
somebody who's got enthusiasm. Not somebody who's boring or puts me to sleep.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.060
Brady: "Cliff, is that natural? Do you learn that or does it come naturally?"

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.680
Does it come naturally? Who knows? I mean,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.060
to me,

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.740
to me,

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.620
I can't stand ... not ...

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.489
I want to know things. I gotta know things.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:35.249
What's the what's the -

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.760
Wait wait wait wait wait wait what's the mathematician, the German mathematician?

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:49.780
"We must know, we will know", What's his epitaph? What was his name? Uh hell, come on. You must know. Oh.

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:54.900
Hold on. We must know we must know. I'm gonna look him up real fast. I'll take a second.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.800
Well, he's curious. He's gone off to find out who the mathematician is.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:59.680
Brady: "Is that an iPhone?"

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.360
Yeah.

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.120
Brady: "I didn't think you'd be an iPhone guy."

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.360
Hilbert! It was David Hilbert! On his grave it says,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.700
"We must know, we will know."

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.020
I like that feeling.

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.520
...1894 1895 in Switzerland, came up with an absolutely wonderful device.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.879
A calculator called the millionaire.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.109
This device - check this out - this will not only ... hey! Go over here, over here...
