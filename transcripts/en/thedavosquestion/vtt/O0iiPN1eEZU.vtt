00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.710
&gt;&gt; Hi YouTube. I'm Carl Ganter from Circle
of Blue at the World Economic Forum in Davos

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.700
and we are trying to answer the one question,
the one priority, well, I'll give you two.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.950
One is to raise awareness and develop the
will to respond to the global freshwater crisis.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.920
Now we have a very complicated crisis with
so many different intersection points from

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:28.880
finances to climate to general watershed management
to biodiversity but how do we respond? How

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.970
do we unify everyone? We understand that we
have the solutions; we have many, many different

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.810
options, we have great challenges and what
I'm told here and elsewhere is that the missing

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:45.650
piece, the really piece of this puzzle, is
building the will and building the awareness

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.170
to respond so I think if we can do that, we
can help solve on the greatest challenges

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.370
that faces us on Earth.
