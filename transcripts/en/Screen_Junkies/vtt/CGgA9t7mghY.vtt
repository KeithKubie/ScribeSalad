00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.900
From the Michael Bay of the 80's

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.880
but better

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.420
comes a film that combines the best action,

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.080
the best horror,

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.840
and the best handshake in all of human history.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.860
"You son of a bitch."

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.840
So does anyone else grow a mustache every time they watch that?

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.740
Deep in the heart of the Central American jungle,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.100
where no one can hear you sweat

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.440
profusely,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.580
something is hunting men for sport,

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.780
and that something would've been an awesome mystery...

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.060
if they didn't show a spaceship in the first scene.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.840
"There's something in those trees."

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.800
It's an alien.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.760
"Those eyes then,

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:54.720
they're disappearing."

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.940
Yup, alien. Saw the ship.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.020
"There's something out there waiting for us,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.840
and it ain't no man."

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.940
OK, fine, I'll do what YouTube comments do.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.280
Movie starts at 1:29.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.920
Join an elite squad of assassins.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.720
"We're a rescue team, not assassins."

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.580
Uh-huh.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.840
"Stick around."

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.020
There's Billy,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.220
the jacked-up, macho Native American,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.040
Blain,

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.700
the jacked-up, macho redneck,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:20.900
Mac and Dillon,

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.900
the jacked-up, macho black guys,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.740
Poncho,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.620
the jacked-up, macho Latino,

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.520
Hawkins,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.800
the screenwriter they wanted on set for Punch Up,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.340
and their leader Dutch,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.340
a jacked-up, badass, cigar chomping Kevin McCallister.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.760
"Come and get me before I call the police!"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.080
"C'MON, KILL ME, I'M HERE!"

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.980
Keep the change, you filthy animal. Yaugh!

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.120
Thrill as they're up against the ultimate enemy:

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.440
Jean-Claude Van Damme in a stupid lobster costume.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.840
Yup, that really happened.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.160
But once he got fired,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.440
they went up against the real ultimate enemy:

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.620
the Predator,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.460
a perfect mix of awesome creature design,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.080
S&amp;M mesh bodysuit,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.600
and Vincent Price laugh,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.320
who uses advanced technology

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.620
to hunt the equivalent of fish in a barrel.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.000
Yeah, I guess he's less cool when you realize he's like those yuppies who shoot giraffes with a sniper rifle.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.480
So before you see The Predator,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.360
revisit THE Predator

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.060
that's never been improved on in its sequels

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.880
and could be released in theaters today because it's aged so well

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.520
"Bunch of slack-jawed f*ggots around here."

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.920
(uh, mostly well),

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.200
because in an action-horror movie this good

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.140
with so many iconic lines

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.480
"I ain't got time to bleed."

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.360
"Knock knock."

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.640
"You're one ugly motherf*cker."

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.500
"GET TO THE CHOPPAH!"

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.980
and such an iconic movie monster,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.620
you'll barely even notice that half the film

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.880
is just quietly...

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.600
looking...

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:00.860
at trees.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.200
"There's something in those trees."

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.540
IT'S AN ALIEN!

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.080
"My men are not expendable."

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.880
You changed, Arnold. You changed.
