JASON SILVA: You know,
mankind is a symbolic species,

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.800
which means that even physical
pleasures-- trivial things

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.060
for other animals, mating
habits, eating, reproduction,

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.850
so and so forth-- to us
become cosmic acts impregnated

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.776
with significance.

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:30.750
We are travelers in
search of signification,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.270
and so even sensuality has
been turned into poetry.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.820
Apes have sex, human
beings make love, you know.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.070
And Alan Harrington has this
great line where he says,

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.470
sensuality may itself
turn into a feverish hunt

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.256
for rebirth, for apotheosis,
for symbolic catharsis.

00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:49.870
And I just love this idea that
us-- as this meaning making

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.130
species, this symbolic
representational species-- all

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.380
the pleasure that we seem
to get from the world

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.090
comes from the story
we tell ourselves

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.200
about that experience.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.490
Like, we become the paint
brush, we become the meaning.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.140
We are the answer to the
question we're asking,

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.950
and I think that
loop is fascinating.
