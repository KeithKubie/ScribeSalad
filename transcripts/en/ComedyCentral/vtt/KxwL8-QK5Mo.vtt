No. The deal was I'd be
a famous movie star.

I loved you

That was Tom Cruise.

I just wanted to say

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.574 size:69% position:34%
have fun tonight,
but I got to head out.

Yes.

Take everything personally,
open with your best rape joke,

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:52.718 size:84% position:42%
and if the night goes slow,
just go into the audience,

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.053 align:start size:88% position:13%
grab a baby,
and slap it.

00:00:54.086 --> 00:00:57.123 size:72% position:64%
Wait a minute.
That's terrible advice.

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:58.558 size:72% position:36%
What can I say?
I give terrible advice.

I'm a terrible guy,

00:01:00.126 --> 00:01:01.561 align:start position:0%
just like that character
you played in "Topic Thunder."

you're taking my soul?

No. I can't.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:09.635 size:81% position:41%
You already sold your soul
when you did

00:01:09.668 --> 00:01:11.204 size:63% position:31%
those stupid
DirecTV commercials.

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:15.007 size:88% position:44%
Now go on out there

Hey, "RoLo,"
I got to come clean.
