SPEAKER 1: I'm a software
engineer born in Bulgaria.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.633
SPEAKER 2: I'm an Android
developer based in Berlin.

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:07.210
SPEAKER 3: I'm a
Flutter developer.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.260
SPEAKER 4: I am a web developer.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.167
SPEAKER 5: I'm an Android
engineer from Hangzhou, China.

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:13.750
SPEAKER 6: I'm Anna

SPEAKER 7: I'm from

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.363
SPEAKER 8: I am from Lima, Peru.

00:00:16.363 --> 00:00:18.150
SPEAKER 9: I am in
Denver, Colorado.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.860
SPEAKER 7: Flutter has changed
the way I develop really

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.290
because of the fact that
I've never really developed

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.457
with a bird by my
side all the time.

00:00:25.457 --> 00:00:27.790
SPEAKER 10: Flutter change a
lot of things in our lives.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.800
First of all, it change
the way that we code.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.730
SPEAKER 11: I fell
in love with Flutter

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.670
from the very first time I saw
Emily live-coding the meme chat

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.780
app on Google I/O.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.030
SPEAKER 3: And what's great
is that Flutter is native.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.336
SPEAKER 2: Me and my partner
built an app in a single day.

00:00:40.336 --> 00:00:41.710
SPEAKER 12: Our
company currently

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.159
works on five Flutter projects.

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:45.700
SPEAKER 6: With
Flutter, I don't have

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.952
to go online and check
the docs anymore.

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:49.410
The way the framework
is structured

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.480
makes it easy to jump
into the definition

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.690
and learn new things.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.065
SPEAKER 13: I
switched to Flutter

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:55.072
from JavaScript and PHP.

00:00:55.072 --> 00:00:57.280
Having strictly typed code,
it's just a game changer.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.030
SPEAKER 14: My favorite
part about Flutter

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.984
is that it does not
limit your imagination.

00:01:00.984 --> 00:01:02.650
SPEAKER 12: I love
that with Flutter you

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.010
can edit the UI code
and simultaneously

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.490
preview the changes,
both on Android and iOS.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.950
SPEAKER 15: The UI page
developed by Flutter

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.750
is very smooth, especially
on low-end machines.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.290
SPEAKER 16: Flutter
has immensely

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.342
helped me with my
transportation application.

00:01:20.342 --> 00:01:22.300
SPEAKER 6: This year we
decided to make our app

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.420
for the first interim factor.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.170
SPEAKER 13: We're using
Flutter to rebuild

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.370
our native mobile apps.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.320
We're going from three
code bases down to two.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.611
SPEAKER 11: With Flutter,
it's been really, really easy

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:33.080
to bring my ideas to life.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.621
SPEAKER 9: One of
the things I didn't

00:01:34.621 --> 00:01:37.400
have any experience with
was mobile app development.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.390
So I decided now is
as good a time as any.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.847
I'm building my own mobile app,
and I'm doing it with Flutter.

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:46.930
SPEAKER 17: I have also
open sourced three Flutter

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.900
applications on GitHub.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.816
SPEAKER 18: These animations are
entirely provided on Flutter.

00:01:52.816 --> 00:01:54.190
SPEAKER 19: I like
widgets, and I

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.690
like how it allows me
to build apps quickly.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.540
SPEAKER 20: You can
quickly turn your ideas

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.699
into real applications.

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:04.740
SPEAKER 4: I really like
the Firebase integration

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.449
because I usually use
Firebase for all my projects,

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:10.770
and it's super easy to
get started with Flutter.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.572
SPEAKER 21: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:02:15.572 --> 00:02:18.030
SPEAKER 11: I really, really
enjoy the community engagement

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.420
on Twitter, as
well as on GitHub.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.080
SPEAKER 22: What took
us almost 16 months

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.560
to create an iOS app has
taken less than four months

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.551
in Flutter.

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:28.800
SPEAKER 2: One of my favorite
things about the Flutter

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.430
community is that you can find
examples about everything.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.220
SPEAKER 23: My favorite
part about Flutter

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.595
is that it makes me
much more productive.

00:02:37.595 --> 00:02:38.970
SPEAKER 7: The
thing that excites

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.670
me the most about Flutter
and the Flutter community has

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.710
to be the support from
the development team

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.252
and from the community
of developers.

00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:47.751
SPEAKER 13: My favorite part
of Flutter is, without a doubt,

00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:49.509
the amazing
productivity it enables.

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.050
We're accomplishing in months
what in the past took us years.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.240
SPEAKER 24: Flutter
community is awesome.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.840
I mean, I have never felt so
home in any other developer

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.560
community.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.440
SPEAKER 1: With Flutter I
spend less time compiling,

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.360
and more time smiling.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.892
SPEAKER 11: That is my
Flutter development story.

00:03:05.892 --> 00:03:07.350
SPEAKER 9: That's
my Flutter story.

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.700
SPEAKER 7: And this
is my Flutter story.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:09.300
SPEAKER 25: Flutter!

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.966
SPEAKER 26: Woo!

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:11.111
SPEAKER 19: Flutter.
