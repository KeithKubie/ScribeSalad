00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.505
SIMON PAMPENA: I want to take
a little bit of a departure

00:00:01.505 --> 00:00:05.480
from looking at specific numbers
and ask the question,

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.410
how do you measure numbers?

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.820
This was one of the most
challenging things I came

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.090
across studying maths at uni,
was this notion of how to

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.180
measure, mathematically
measure.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.160
So this is what I'm
going to do.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.460
I'm going to show you the
real number line.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.020
Yeah, you're familiar
with that right?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.030
So think about this.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.475
This is the real number line.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.060
It's there in your head.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.750
So here's my question.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.560
What's the distance
between 3 and 4?

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.890
What's the measure?

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.560
How long is that section?

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.670
BRADY HARAN: 1.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.750
SIMON PAMPENA: 1.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.270
How did you get that?

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.192
BRADY HARAN: Because I know the
number that I need to add

00:00:41.192 --> 00:00:43.800
to 3 to get to 4 is 1.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.090
SIMON PAMPENA: OK,
that's good.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.440
So you know the number.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.092
So you know the answer,
basically, you're saying?

00:00:52.092 --> 00:00:53.490
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.880
SIMON PAMPENA: OK,
well, imagine you

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.350
didn't know the answer.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.400
So imagine this is the first
time you've ever tried to

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.010
measure the distance
between 3 and 4.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.250
What would you do?

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.970
BRADY HARAN: I'd make a piece
of wood the distance

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.390
between 0 and 1.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.680
And then I would take it to 3
and 4 and see how many of them

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.660
do I have to put on there.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:10.290
SIMON PAMPENA: OK,
that's good.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.820
That's good.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.480
I like that.

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.395
It's actually good that you
brought in reality.

00:01:14.395 --> 00:01:17.420
Because that's going
to really bite you.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.490
It's going to really bite you.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.350
But that's cool.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.700
That's cool.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.180
I like the fact you said that.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.160
So basically you said, OK, well,
I'm going to look at a

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.730
bit of a number line which
I know what the length is

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.000
because it starts at 0.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.450
And you're going to go
and drag it over

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.820
until you measure it.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.490
But another way you could do
it is you could say, this

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.390
number, take that number.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.210
So you're comfortable
with that.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.760
You know that that distance
there is 4 take 3.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.950
Now this is what's
called naive.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.540
And that's not a putdown.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.932
It's naive.

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:53.900
It's a naive way of
measuring numbers.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.600
I'm hopefully going to take you
down the rabbit hole now.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:07.010
3.5 is a point right there.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.500
I'm going to put a little
kind of, little bit of

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.420
choke wire around it.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.920
3.5 is a point.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.860
Do you agree that it exists?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.032
3 and 1/2?

00:02:16.032 --> 00:02:16.370
BRADY HARAN: I'm happy
with that.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.820
SIMON PAMPENA: You're
happy with that, OK.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.670
What's the length
of 3 and 1/2?

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.250
BRADY HARAN: What's
the length of it?

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.630
Well, to give you a length,
I need a start

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.440
point and an end point.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.790
SIMON PAMPENA: No, I'm just
talking about the point, just

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.460
the point, one point.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.180
So what's the length
of a point?

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:38.020
BRADY HARAN: Points
don't have length.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.590
SIMON PAMPENA: What's another
way of saying that?

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.030
3.5 take 3.5 is 0.

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.350
We use exactly the same logic
that we used here for the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.420
segment of line.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.960
We're going to use the same
logic for the point.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.820
Now, this sounds like I'm being

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.095
trivial, maybe even annoying.

00:02:56.095 --> 00:02:57.280
But I am getting somewhere.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.300
I'm making a point
about points.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.980
Because what now is the
length of 3 to 4 if we

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.470
remove the point 3.5?

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.310
What is the length of
that line segment?

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.560
BRADY HARAN: The length
is still 1.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.050
SIMON PAMPENA: Why?

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.050
BRADY HARAN: Because the thing
you removed took up no space.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.130
SIMON PAMPENA: That's right.

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.920
So this idea is that we've got
a line segment, 3 to 4, which

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.440
is made up of a continuous
set of points.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.650
There's only points
between 3 and 4.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.980
But if we remove 3.5, we
haven't changed it.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.750
We haven't changed it at all.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.430
And part of the reason behind
that is because the real

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.100
number line has this property
that there is no next number.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.820
What's the number after 3.5?

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.210
BRADY HARAN: 3.50000000000000--

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.020
SIMON PAMPENA: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.640
But you're not even saying
that correctly.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.540
Because the way that we describe
numbers doesn't

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.640
contain the awesomeness of
what's going on here.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.360
Why is this a problem?

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.320
Because we are using stuff
that we haven't proved.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.535
We're using naive notions
of measure.

00:04:18.535 --> 00:04:19.810
That's why that's a problem.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.540
We're making assumptions.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.250
This almost broke maths where
I'm going with this.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.570
It almost broke maths.
