00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.334
- [Voiceover] So right over here

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:02.994
like I've done in previous videos,

00:00:02.994 --> 00:00:05.078
we have a diagram of a mass.

00:00:05.078 --> 00:00:06.981
We really should conceptualize
it as a point mass

00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:08.417
although it doesn't look like a point,

00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:09.950
it looks like a circle.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.458
But imagine a point mass here

00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:13.976
and it's tethered to something.

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:16.862
It's kind of it's tied
to a massless string,

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:19.969
a theoretical massless
string right over here.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:21.401
Where functionally a mass of string

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:22.433
and it's kind of nailed down.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.733
And let's say it's on
a frictionless surface

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:28.409
and let's say it has some velocity.

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:32.500
And right here we have the
magnitude of its velocity

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.533
in the direction that is perpendicular

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:39.953
to the wire that is holding it,

00:00:39.953 --> 00:00:41.767
or I guess you can say perpendicular

00:00:41.767 --> 00:00:45.466
to the radial direction.

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.802
Now based on that, we've had a definition

00:00:47.802 --> 00:00:49.097
for angular momentum.

00:00:49.097 --> 00:00:50.800
The magnitude of angular momentum

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.466
is going to be equal to the mass,

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:58.134
times this velocity, times the radius.

00:00:58.134 --> 00:00:59.433
And you could also view that

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.433
and this is kind of always
kind of tying the connections

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.011
between you know, translational notions

00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:05.527
and rotational notions.

00:01:05.527 --> 00:01:06.801
We can see that angular momentum

00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.058
could be the same thing.

00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:09.833
Well, the mass times its velocity

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:13.100
you could do that as the
translational momentum row

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.392
in the magnitude of translational momentum

00:01:15.392 --> 00:01:17.900
in this direction times r.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.566
So once again, we took
the translational idea,

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.000
multiplied it by r

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.493
and we're getting the rotational idea,

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:25.466
the angular momentum versus
just the translational one.

00:01:25.466 --> 00:01:26.500
And we can also think about it

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.066
in terms of angular velocity.

00:01:29.066 --> 00:01:30.666
Now this comes straight out of the idea

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:34.533
that this v is going
to be equal to omega r.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.725
So you do that substitution,

00:01:35.725 --> 00:01:37.633
you get this right over here.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:39.802
Now, in previous videos we said okay.

00:01:39.802 --> 00:01:42.166
Like based on this and based on the idea

00:01:42.166 --> 00:01:44.266
that if torque is held constant

00:01:44.266 --> 00:01:46.233
then this does not change.

00:01:46.233 --> 00:01:49.367
You can describe or you could predict

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:51.286
the type of behavior, explain the behavior

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:52.223
that you might see.

00:01:52.223 --> 00:01:54.166
The figure skating competition

00:01:54.166 --> 00:01:57.223
where if someone pulls their
arms in while they're spinning

00:01:57.223 --> 00:01:59.700
and they're not, you know,
applying anymore torque to spin,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.433
and if they pull their arms in,

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:03.100
well this thing is going to be constant

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100
because there's no torque being applied.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.566
Well, their mass isn't going to change

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:10.800
so they'll just spin faster.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.700
When you do the opposite,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.433
the opposite would be happening.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:14.780
But you might have been left

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.933
a little bit unsatisfied
when we first talked about it

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:17.792
because I just told you that.

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:19.166
I said, hey look, if torque is,

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.176
if there's no net torque

00:02:21.176 --> 00:02:23.127
then angular momentum is constant

00:02:23.127 --> 00:02:25.200
and then you have this thing happening.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.704
But let's dig a little bit deeper

00:02:26.704 --> 00:02:27.840
and look at the math of it.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.600
So you feel good that
that is actually the case.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.096
So let's go back, let's go
to the definition of torque.

00:02:34.096 --> 00:02:35.473
And so the magnitude of torque,

00:02:35.473 --> 00:02:38.300
I'll focus on magnitudes in this video.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.594
The magnitude of torque
is going to be equal to,

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:45.766
it's going to be equal to
the magnitude of the force

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:50.209
that is in this perpendicular
direction, times r.

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:52.434
Times r.

00:02:52.434 --> 00:02:54.833
Now what is this, this force?

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:57.200
Well, this is just going to be equal to

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.919
the mass force, f equals ma.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.501
So this is going to be mass times

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:03.901
the acceleration in this direction

00:03:03.901 --> 00:03:05.900
which we could view as,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.767
which we could view as the change

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:12.924
in this velocity over time,

00:03:12.924 --> 00:03:14.366
and we're talking about magnitudes.

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:15.833
I guess you could say, it's through

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:18.866
the magnitude of velocity
in that direction.

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:22.384
And then of course we have times r.

00:03:22.384 --> 00:03:24.033
Times r.

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:26.900
Now if we multiplied both
sides of this times delta t,

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.000
we get and actually we do
tau in a different color.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.400
We do torque in green.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.766
We get torque times delta t.

00:03:35.766 --> 00:03:39.800
Torque times delta t is equal to,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.800
is equal to mass times delta v.

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:50.656
Delta v in that perpendicular
direction times r.

00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:53.166
Well, what's this thing going to be?

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.733
What's this?

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:57.215
Well, that's just change
in angular momentum.

00:03:57.215 --> 00:04:01.567
So this is just going to be
change in angular momentum.

00:04:01.567 --> 00:04:03.133
And there's a complete analogy

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:04.766
to what you might remember

00:04:04.766 --> 00:04:06.600
from kind of the translational world.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.866
The translational world
you have this notion,

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:10.533
if you take your force

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:11.833
and you multiply it times

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:13.766
how long you're applying the force,

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:16.025
should do this in a different color.

00:04:16.025 --> 00:04:19.783
So we multiply it by how long
you are applying the force.

00:04:19.783 --> 00:04:23.673
So this quantity we often call is impulse.

00:04:24.196 --> 00:04:25.366
Impulse.

00:04:25.366 --> 00:04:26.633
That's going to be equal to

00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:30.033
your change in translational momentum.

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.040
Your change in translational momentum.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.979
And if you have no force

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.607
then you're not gonna have
any change in momentum

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.496
or you're gonna have your
conversation of momentum,

00:04:36.496 --> 00:04:37.766
or it's not gonna change,

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:39.133
it's just going to be conserved.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:40.350
And then you can do all sorts of neat,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.400
you know, predicting
where your ball might go

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.733
or whatever else.

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:45.500
We have the same analogy here.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.866
The analog for force
in the rotational world

00:04:48.866 --> 00:04:51.700
is torque, it's obviously this force times

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.866
the kind of radial, times
that radial distance.

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:57.800
But if you take torque times

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.400
how long you're applying that torque,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.625
that's going to be your
change in angular momentum.

00:05:02.625 --> 00:05:04.446
So if you're not applying any torque,

00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:06.310
if your torque is zero,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.307
if your torque is equal to zero,

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:11.596
well that means that your delta L is zero.

00:05:11.596 --> 00:05:13.163
Your angular momentum is not changing

00:05:13.163 --> 00:05:17.466
or you could say your
angular momentum is constant.

00:05:17.466 --> 00:05:19.100
So if you don't apply any torque,

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.279
like once this figure
skater is already spinning

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.934
and he or she, she's
not pushing to get more,

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:25.535
to spin so she's not applying

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:27.166
or he's not applying more torque,

00:05:27.166 --> 00:05:29.540
well then, they're angular
momentum's going to be constant

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.466
but they can change their rate of spinning

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.483
by changing r, by changing how far

00:05:36.483 --> 00:05:37.858
in or out r is,

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:39.200
or how far enough the masses are.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.733
And obviously I said in the last video,

00:05:40.733 --> 00:05:43.245
a figure skater is a much
more complicated system

00:05:43.245 --> 00:05:46.235
than a point mass tethered to, you know,

00:05:46.235 --> 00:05:48.600
tethered to a rope.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.743
You could view a figure skater

00:05:49.743 --> 00:05:51.725
as kind of being modeled
by a bunch of point masses

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:53.900
but hopefully this gives you the idea.
