as a realist I'm not naive about the

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:06.819
as a realist I'm not naive about the
 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:08.759
as a realist I'm not naive about the
world it can be a dangerous place and

00:00:08.759 --> 00:00:08.769
world it can be a dangerous place and
 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.140
world it can be a dangerous place and
that's one of the reasons why we have to

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150
that's one of the reasons why we have to
 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.299
that's one of the reasons why we have to
have a strong national defense and it

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:12.309
have a strong national defense and it
 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.160
have a strong national defense and it
sometimes means we have to actually use

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.170
sometimes means we have to actually use
 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.080
sometimes means we have to actually use
our military power against other

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090
our military power against other
 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.970
our military power against other
countries and other organizations that

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980
countries and other organizations that
 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.950
countries and other organizations that
might threaten us or that have attacked

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960
might threaten us or that have attacked
 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.429
might threaten us or that have attacked
us that's the reality of the world but

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439
us that's the reality of the world but
 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.349
us that's the reality of the world but
we really do need to think about a

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359
we really do need to think about a
 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.189
we really do need to think about a
foreign policy that is careful to focus

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199
foreign policy that is careful to focus
 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.040
foreign policy that is careful to focus
on our interests and is cognizant of

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:32.050
on our interests and is cognizant of
 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.430
on our interests and is cognizant of
those human costs and I think that it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440
those human costs and I think that it
 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.210
those human costs and I think that it
isn't being mushy headed to say look

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220
isn't being mushy headed to say look
 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.670
isn't being mushy headed to say look
there are people real people harmed by

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680
there are people real people harmed by
 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.730
there are people real people harmed by
our activities you can think about those

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:44.740
our activities you can think about those
 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.880
our activities you can think about those
soldiers killed overseas now it's one

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890
soldiers killed overseas now it's one
 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.800
soldiers killed overseas now it's one
thing if they're killed in a war like

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810
thing if they're killed in a war like
 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.850
thing if they're killed in a war like
World War 2 a war that was necessary for

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860
World War 2 a war that was necessary for
 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.530
World War 2 a war that was necessary for
America to fight for its safety against

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540
America to fight for its safety against
 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.569
America to fight for its safety against
a really bad regime like Nazi Germany

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579
a really bad regime like Nazi Germany
 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.720
a really bad regime like Nazi Germany
and another thing to think about a

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
and another thing to think about a
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.310
and another thing to think about a
situation where we're trying to engage

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320
situation where we're trying to engage
 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.590
situation where we're trying to engage
in regime change against a country that

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600
in regime change against a country that
 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.719
in regime change against a country that
offers very little threat to the United

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729
offers very little threat to the United
 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.539
offers very little threat to the United
States and maybe a bad regime like in

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549
States and maybe a bad regime like in
 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.760
States and maybe a bad regime like in
the case of Saddam Hussein's Iraq but a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770
the case of Saddam Hussein's Iraq but a
 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.889
the case of Saddam Hussein's Iraq but a
regime that has not directly attacked us

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899
regime that has not directly attacked us
 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.139
regime that has not directly attacked us
and it's not necessarily a threat to

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149
and it's not necessarily a threat to
 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.819
and it's not necessarily a threat to
core American interests and we need to

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:17.829
core American interests and we need to
 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.590
core American interests and we need to
think hard about what those costs would

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600
think hard about what those costs would
 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.529
think hard about what those costs would
be in that situation and the human costs

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539
be in that situation and the human costs
 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.569
be in that situation and the human costs
are quite powerful and we can see that

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:24.579
are quite powerful and we can see that
 

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:27.120
are quite powerful and we can see that
here in America if you visit a military

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130
here in America if you visit a military
 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.830
here in America if you visit a military
hospital and you can see people who have

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840
hospital and you can see people who have
 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.989
hospital and you can see people who have
lost limbs or you could see it in in

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999
lost limbs or you could see it in in
 

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:34.919
lost limbs or you could see it in in
communities where there are people

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929
communities where there are people
 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.190
communities where there are people
suffering from things like PTSD that are

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200
suffering from things like PTSD that are
 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.219
suffering from things like PTSD that are
less obvious to the eye but you also see

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229
less obvious to the eye but you also see
 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.469
less obvious to the eye but you also see

it downrange and oftentimes we'd read
 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.629
it downrange and oftentimes we'd read
the newspaper and it says three American

the newspaper and it says three American
 

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.539

think about that and to make sure that
 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.129
think about that and to make sure that
if you're going to ask people to make

00:01:59.129 --> 00:01:59.139
if you're going to ask people to make
 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.080
if you're going to ask people to make
that ultimate sacrifice that they're not

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090
that ultimate sacrifice that they're not
 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.690

statecraft have been
 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.630
statecraft have been
exhausted and that you have an

exhausted and that you have an
 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.190
exhausted and that you have an
understanding of how to prosecute that
