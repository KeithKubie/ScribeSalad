[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:08.590
SPEAKER: Danny Iny has been
feature than the Harvard

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.530
Business Review Entrepreneur,
and he contributes regularly

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.610
to publications, including Inc,
Forbes, and Business Insider.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.130
He has guest lectured at
McGill University, as well as

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.520
Yale University, and he's the
author of multiple bestselling

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.710
books about online education.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.719
His most recent book,
"Leveraged Learning."

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:26.760
It's hot off the presses.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.850
It just came out in October.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.150
And it's the culmination
of Danny's research

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.190
into the latest work
in neuroscience,

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.030
instructional design, and recent
breakthroughs in education.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.970
The book aims to sow the seeds
of education's transformation

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.540
in the coming years.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.906
So please welcome Danny
to Google New York.

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:53.338
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:53.338 --> 00:00:54.304
DANNY INY: Thank you.

00:00:54.304 --> 00:00:55.470
It's a privilege to be here.

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.430
So once upon a time,
there was an emperor who

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.459
was powerful and influential.

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.070
And all of his
strengths and resources

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.280
were exceeded only
by his vanity.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.250
He wanted the most wonderful,
resplendent refinery that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.850
could be found in all the land.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.510
But where was he to find
this wonderful, resplendent

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.010
refinery?

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.000
There was no Google.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.620
He could not type
in where it is.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.950
So he put out an RFP.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.720
He had his missives go out to
all the tailors in the land

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.200
saying, bring to us your plans.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.370
Bring to us your sketches.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.410
Bring to us your fabrics.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.880
And the tailors did.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.590
They came to the
royal court, and they

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.650
paraded in front of him, and
they displayed their wares,

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.720
and he was never satisfied.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.570
Until finally two men
approached the emperor.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.350
They said, Sire, we have
the most wonderful garment

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.410
that we can create for
you, of a magical fabric

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.170
of unsurpassed beauty.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.700
And the emperor was excited.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.230
This is what he wanted--

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.590
the best of the very best.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.330
And so he had his men bring
a giant chest of gold coins

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.530
to these two men.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.210
They took the chest
of gold coins,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.440
and they went away to work,
except they didn't work,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.970
because they weren't tailors.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.290
They were conmen.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.820
So they goofed off
for a few weeks

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.590
while they were
supposed to be working.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.260
Then, they returned
to the royal palace.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.720
And they said, Sire,
we have brought

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.647
to you this wonderful,
incredible garment.

00:02:24.647 --> 00:02:26.730
But we must tell you
something important about it.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.760
You see, it is made
of a magical fabric.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.790
And all who are wise or
worthy who gaze upon it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.730
will see the most beautiful
construction they've ever

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.680
seen with their eyes.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.690
But those who are
not worthy, those

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.960
who are not deserving of their
post, those who are incompetent

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.430
will see nothing.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.970
And then one of the tailors
reaches into his bag,

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.260
he pulls out his arm,
and he's holding nothing.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.820
And the court is smiling
nervously, because they're all

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.650
thinking, am I the only one?

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.380
I don't want to be deemed
unworthy and incompetent,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.740
because being deemed as
incompetent and unworthy

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.430
inside the emperor's court
soon leads to being beheaded

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.860
outside the emperor's court.

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.660
And so they all
smiled nervously.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.940
And the emperor, not wanting
to lose face in front

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.160
of his subjects, said, wow.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.170
What gorgeous refinery.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.800
I am thrilled.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.070
And he made a show of
putting on nothing--

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.230
and give them their gold coins
and sent them on their way.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.220
And then, finally, he says,
I want the entire kingdom

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.340
to see the great beauty and
wonder that I now get to wear.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.500
So he organizes a parade.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.280
And he's marching down the
street with fanfare and music.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.370
And all his subjects are
smiling nervously and cheering.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.300
Until finally, a small boy looks
at him and begins to giggle

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.130
and says, mommy, the
emperor is naked.

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.726
And as parents, we've all
had those mortifying moments.

00:03:53.726 --> 00:03:55.600
And that's how the
parents felt for a moment.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.740
But then, the crowd
bursts out laughing.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:00.720
Because, of course,
they had realized

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.630
that the emperor was naked.

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.950
Now this is an old story.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.340
It was written by Hans Christian
Andersen almost 200 years ago.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.460
The emperor has no clothes
is an allegory for something

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.880
that everyone knows is
not true, but nobody

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.620
acknowledges it's not true.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.470
And for that final moment,
when the little boy points

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.690
at the emperor, says,
"the emperor is naked,"

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.180
everyone bursts
out laughing, there

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.850
are two awakenings
that have to occur.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.310
First, there's the
private awakening.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.980
This is the individual citizens
gazing upon the emperor

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.080
and thinking to
themselves, I don't

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.670
think he's wearing any clothes.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:39.250
And that stays inside them.

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.490
Later, there's a
public awakening

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.430
when they call out the emperor.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.020
Now it takes a very
different thing

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.570
to have that private awakening
and then to make it public.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.850
The private awakening
happens when

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.400
you have an impression
based on your experiences,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.520
based on your thoughts,
based on your perspective.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.420
The public awakening happens
when you feel strongly enough

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.340
about it and you
feel that you can

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.560
support the argument with enough
rigor when others disagree.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.130
Now emperors can be people,
but more often their ideas,

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.560
their institutions.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.500
And the biggest emperor
in our modern world

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.780
is higher education.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:21.330
We orient our entire
lives around it.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.690
We spend the first 18
years working to get in,

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.810
we spend the next 18
years paying it off,

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.022
and another 18 years saving
up so that our kids can

00:05:31.022 --> 00:05:31.980
start the same process.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.690
I had both of these awakenings
about higher education.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.220
And these two awakenings were
prompted by two pivotal moments

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.850
in my life.

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.770
The first was when
I was 15 years old.

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.990
Now a little bit of back story.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.220
As a child, I was the goody
two shoes, teacher's pet,

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.170
always gets perfect
straight A's.

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:59.770
I was that kid.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.530
And that worked for
me until about the end

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:02.363
of the eighth grade.

00:06:02.363 --> 00:06:04.020
But then I got into
the ninth grade,

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.570
and it was like a switch
flipped in my head.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.250
And I sat there in class.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.080
And I just thought
to myself, oh my god.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.410
I'm so bored.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.250
I can't take this anymore.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.520
And so I started
cutting classes.

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:18.770
Now here's the thing about me.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.190
I'm a bit of an
extreme personality.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.550
I don't do anything halfway.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.260
And so in that first
trimester of the ninth grade,

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.480
I missed 152 classes.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.310
152 classes.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.276
I was barely there.

00:06:35.276 --> 00:06:36.900
And the number just
went up from there.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.608
This went on for about
a year and a half,

00:06:38.608 --> 00:06:41.740
till about the middle of the
10th grade; I was 15 years old.

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.590
And then, I just
had this moment.

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.350
I looked in the
mirror, and I paused.

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.000
I thought to myself,
Danny, what are you doing?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.397
Like, what's the plan here?

00:06:50.397 --> 00:06:52.980
Am I just going to keep cutting
classes, and going to the gym,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.110
and watching MTV all day--

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.080
which is what teenagers
did back then.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.335
This doesn't make sense.

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:00.210
So I think it's time.

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:01.740
I'm going to make it official.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.850
I'm going to quit school.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.980
I'm going to start
my first business.

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:09.310
The prevailing narrative
around me at the time

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.270
was not encouraging
of this idea.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:16.090
The prevailing
narrative said, Danny,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:18.150
you are making a huge mistake.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.874
You are throwing your life away.

00:07:20.874 --> 00:07:21.790
Now let's unpack that.

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:23.170
There's two things there.

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.540
Danny, you're making
a huge mistake.

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.820
Basically saying, the
consequences of this decision

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.640
will not be positive.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:31.976
I disagreed.

00:07:31.976 --> 00:07:33.225
I had a different perspective.

00:07:33.225 --> 00:07:34.250
But I was like, you know what?

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.720
I could see that.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.719
I don't know everything.

00:07:35.719 --> 00:07:37.147
I might be wrong.

00:07:37.147 --> 00:07:39.230
But here's the thing I
couldn't get on board with.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:41.740
"You are throwing
your life away."

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.770
This implied irreversibility
to the decision--

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.450
not just it's the wrong
move, but your life is over.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.950
This is it.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.370
It's the end.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.460
And I thought to myself,
that doesn't make sense.

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.570
Like, worst case scenario, I can
always just go back to school.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:57.370
Like, this is a
reversible decision.

00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:59.740
And so I went ahead, and I
dropped out of school thanks

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.280
to the support of some people
in my life, especially my mom,

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.650
and I started my first business.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.680
And it turns out it was
one of the best decisions I

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.840
could have made for myself.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.405
I got to experience
things I never

00:08:12.405 --> 00:08:13.780
would have otherwise
experienced,

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:16.180
learned things I never
otherwise would have learned--

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.070
played out great.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:23.620
Now as a little aside, I
want to clarify something.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:27.940
Because there's a difference
between dropping out, meaning

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:30.940
opting out, meaning
saying, I don't

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.767
like the instructions that
have been set out before me,

00:08:33.767 --> 00:08:34.850
so I'm just going to quit.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:35.724
I'm going to opt out.

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:38.440
I'm going to sit on a couch,
watch TV, and eat pizza

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.820
all day long.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.710
That's not just
dropping out of school.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.580
That's dropping out of life.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.190
There's a huge
difference between that

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:49.150
and saying, I'm opting
into something else.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:52.090
I'm going to take a
self-directed and curious

00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:55.310
approach, and I trust that
I will find a way to do it.

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.637
So I'm not advocating that
anyone drop out, opt out,

00:08:59.637 --> 00:09:00.220
and that's it.

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.770
I think opting for something
better is worthwhile.

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:05.320
So that was the first instance.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.070
I was 15.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:07.570
I dropped out of school.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:09.520
And it worked out pretty well.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.790
Now, let's go on to this
second crossroads in my life.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.610
I'm going to fast
forward 10 years.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:16.870
Now I'm about 25.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:19.150
And in those
intervening 10 years,

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.060
I had been involved in a whole
bunch of different businesses I

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:25.120
had gotten to do a whole
bunch of interesting projects.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.370
And, most recently, I had tried
to build a software company.

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.090
We were developing technology
that taught kids how to read,

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:34.150
which is something I always
cared a great deal about.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.090
And we raised some money
from friends and family.

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:39.550
We got some really good early
traction with our prototype.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.480
The experts loved it.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.770
The kids loved it.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:43.360
But the parents
and the teachers,

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.970
who were the actual
customers, they didn't get it.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:48.400
I was a very young
and very inexperienced

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.270
CEO in what, in hindsight, is
the most complicated industry

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:54.070
on the face of the earth.

00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:58.090
And by the time this young and
inexperienced CEO figured out

00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:01.060
what I needed to do and
how things need to go,

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.440
we were almost out of money,
and it was August of 2008.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.710
In September of 2008,
the markets crashed.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.440
The bottom fell out
from under everyone.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.530
And I walked away from that
experience with about $250,000

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.720
in personal debt.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.980
It was not a great
time in my life.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.190
And when you have
that kind of setback,

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.530
you question your decisions.

00:10:23.530 --> 00:10:25.480
You question the
path you've taken.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:28.699
You think maybe I need
a little more security.

00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:30.240
Maybe I need a little
more stability.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.770
Maybe there's some virtue
to a more traditional path.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:36.110
And I said, what if
I go back to school?

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:39.490
What if I go to business
school and get my MBA?

00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.230
So I applied to schools.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.070
I got into one of the top
business schools in Canada.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.550
I didn't have a high
school diploma, by the way.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.010
Because even institutions
of higher learning

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.457
that value higher learning,
they have exception paths

00:10:54.457 --> 00:10:56.290
for people who have
interesting backgrounds,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:59.050
and interesting experience,
and who are resourceful enough.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:01.750
So even institutions
of higher learning

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.940
don't actually value
the traditional path

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:06.460
as much as they pretend.

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:11.050
But I got into one of the top
business schools in Canada.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:15.070
And the prevailing narrative
around me this time

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:18.320
was, Danny, this is great.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.385
You are going to set
yourself up for life.

00:11:20.385 --> 00:11:22.510
You're going to learn the
things you need to learn.

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:24.790
It's going to open
all the doors.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:27.950
This is the best thing
you can possibly do.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:30.160
So the expectation is
that the consequences

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.990
would be uniformly good.

00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:33.790
Nobody talked
about reversibility

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.690
or irreversibility.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.590
Who wants to reverse something
that's going to be all good?

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:41.920
Well, I went ahead, I
committed the time and very

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.380
substantial amount
of money that it took

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.610
to go through this program.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.930
I earned my degree.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:50.890
And as it turns out, if I had
to make a list of the 5 or 10

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.130
worst investments of time
and money in my life,

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.249
this would be high on that list.

00:11:56.249 --> 00:11:57.790
I had some great
teachers, but I also

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.560
had a lot of mediocre ones.

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.280
I met some interesting people.

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.430
I also met a lot
of mediocre ones.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.620
The brochures promised all the
future leaders of tomorrow.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.550
The class held all the
middle managers of today.

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:12.860
So it was not an
impressive experience.

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:16.950
It was certainly not
worth the investment.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.205
And, again, a clarifying
point, people will often say,

00:12:19.205 --> 00:12:21.080
Danny, wait, are you
saying you're better off

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:23.390
without an MBA than with one?

00:12:23.390 --> 00:12:25.140
The answer is no, of course not.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:28.500
But it's not about am I better
off with it or without it.

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:30.680
The question is, am
I better off with it

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.660
or with the other
things I could have

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:35.490
done with that time and money.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.790
And the answer is, I could
have done much better things

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:39.590
with that time and money.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:41.090
So it's about the
opportunity costs,

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.930
and it wasn't worthwhile.

00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:47.630
Now the contrast between
these two junctures in my life

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:49.220
was interesting.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.590
Dropping out of high
school at the age of 15,

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.930
everyone said it would
be a terrible idea

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:56.210
with irreversible
consequences, neither

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:58.440
of those turned out to be true.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:01.790
And going back to
school, getting my MBA,

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:04.250
everyone thought it
would be a great move,

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.490
but it wasn't, and it was
completely irreversible.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:09.380
I can never get that
time or that money back.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.936
What I've since found is
that these experiences,

00:13:15.936 --> 00:13:18.310
less the high school thing--
because most people stick it

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:19.570
through at least that far--

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.670
but especially the outcomes
and experience people

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:26.860
have with higher education, this
was not a unique experience.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.900
Digging into the data,
I found that if you

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.720
look at postgraduate
employment, look at people age

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.490
22 to 29 who have a college
degree, almost half of them

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.110
are underemployed,
meaning they're

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.450
working in a job that does
not require a college degree.

00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.282
So they traded four
or more years--

00:13:43.282 --> 00:13:45.490
it takes the average American
seven years to complete

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:46.600
a four-year program--

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.510
"four-year program--" so they
traded four to seven years

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:51.970
of their lives, tens if
not hundreds of thousands

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.280
of dollars-- the average
American graduates from

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.114
an undergraduate program
with over $30,000 in debt,

00:13:57.114 --> 00:13:59.530
which you figure in the interest
they're going to pay over

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:02.230
the life of the debt
is more like $46,000--

00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:04.030
they traded that
time in that money

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:08.080
to get a job that does not
even require a college degree.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.150
And off the balance
of these slightly more

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:15.130
than 50% of people age 22 to
29 with a college degree who

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.880
are working in a job that
requires a college degree,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.620
three quarters of them
are working in a field

00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:23.200
that is not what they studied.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.890
So how much credit can
the degree really take?

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.630
That's kind of messed up.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:31.520
Now I want to be clear.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.150
I'm not saying that
all college is bad.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.600
America's top schools have
a lot to offer besides just

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.460
the academics, and
there are few schools

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:41.920
that are innovating in
really interesting ways.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.080
If you look at Western
Governors in Utah,

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.412
if you look at Arizona State,
you look at Northeastern,

00:14:46.412 --> 00:14:48.620
you look at the University
of Southern New Hampshire,

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:51.160
there's some really
interesting things happening.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:56.380
But many people don't have great
experiences or great ROIs, even

00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.150
at the top schools, and most
schools are not top schools.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.840
Of the thousands of colleges
and universities in the US,

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.410
only about 200 of them are
what you can call selective,

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.160
meaning they accept less than
50% of the people who apply.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.880
So you get a mixed experience
at those top 200 schools,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.130
and most schools are
not anywhere near

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:20.530
that level of quality.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:24.310
Now all of that, my
experiences and then

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:29.406
finding this data, that led to
my private awakening of, OK,

00:15:29.406 --> 00:15:31.030
the emperor is not
wearing any clothes.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:34.300
There's something messed
up about higher education

00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:36.151
and people's
expectations from it.

00:15:36.151 --> 00:15:37.650
And I could have
just stopped there.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.080
I could have just been part
of the massive disillusioned

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.970
silent masses.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:45.370
But there are two
quirks to my personality

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.360
that took it further.

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.680
The first is that I am
fascinated and inspired

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.410
by education.

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.640
Now I'm not unique in being
fascinated and inspired

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.870
by something.

00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.930
Everyone is fascinated
and inspired by something.

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.180
For me, that's education.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.040
I just find it magical, not the
education industrial complex,

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:10.300
which I think is a disaster,
but education, the process

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:12.010
of empowering
people to do things

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.010
they weren't
formally able to do.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.620
There's a great quote that
I love by Walt Disney.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.970
"If you can dream
it, you can do it."

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:21.470
countless.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.930
People have been
inspired to great action

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.020
by this quote, this
idea, myself included.

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.120
And I'm inspired
by the possibility

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.740
of what we can dream.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:35.072
But I'm also fascinated by
the fundamental untruth of it.

00:16:35.072 --> 00:16:37.280
If you can dream it, that
doesn't mean you can do it.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.220
There's a world of a gap
between dreaming and doing.

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.360
And that gap is
bridged by education.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.940
So that just fascinates
me personally.

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.600
I think it's amazing that we
can spend a day watching videos

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.320
on Ted and be inspired by all
the amazing things we know how

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:56.782
to do, all the amazing
problems we know how to solve,

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:58.990
then we close our laptop,
we walk out into the world,

00:16:58.990 --> 00:17:02.420
we look around, we're
like, where is all of it?

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.589
That gap between what we could
do and what we actually do,

00:17:06.589 --> 00:17:07.790
that's what education does.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:11.480
That's really cool to me.

00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.180
The second quirk
about my personality

00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.240
is that when I'm
fascinated by something,

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:20.730
when I'm excited about
something, I talk about it.

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.000
So when I was a kid,
when I was four years old

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.250
or whatever in kindergarten,
I'd come home from school

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:28.040
and I'd say, mommy, mommy,
look at this thing I made.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.940
And she'd look at and
say, that's amazing.

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.510
What's it supposed to be?

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.640
But I was excited, and I
would do that every day.

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.050
And that hasn't changed.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.842
I write books.

00:17:36.842 --> 00:17:37.550
I write articles.

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:40.010
And I'll come home at the end
of the day with a printout

00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:41.780
and say, sweetie, my
wife, sweetie, look,

00:17:41.780 --> 00:17:43.890
look, you've got to read
this article I wrote

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:45.670
and tell me what you think.

00:17:45.670 --> 00:17:47.450
I'm telling you about
the meeting I had.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.570
I am excited about something,
and I want to talk about it.

00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:52.640
That just hasn't changed.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.470
So being excited about,
fascinated by education,

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.830
and also frustrated and
disillusioned with the way

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:03.920
that it works in real life,
and having a propensity

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.620
to talk about it means
that I found myself

00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.290
in a lot of positions
to get a lot of pushback

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:11.840
from people who disagreed.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.240
Because after all, the
people I have the privilege

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:15.930
of talking to are smart.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:17.540
They're educated.

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:21.020
And people, as a
whole, human beings,

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:25.400
are invested in the things
they have invested in.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:27.770
Dan Ariely is research
into the IKEA effect

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:30.320
has shown that when we
build something ourselves,

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:34.040
we value it more highly than if
someone else built it for us.

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.890
Back when fraternity
hazings were

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.850
a kind of sort of
acceptable thing,

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:39.980
the rationalization was,
well, I went through it.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.800
And look, it worked out for
me, and so I must be invested.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.270
Otherwise, what was the point?

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:48.980
We are invested in the things
that we have invested in.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:53.300
And so there was all this
pushback, all this, well, no,

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:54.560
education is important.

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.470
It broadens your horizons,
and it opens doors,

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:58.970
and it's not even
about the classes.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:59.990
It's about the network.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:02.180
And the excuses
would go on and on.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.310
Every time I would have
a counter argument,

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:06.480
they'd jump to a different one.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.900
And there's something
more fundamental

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.660
going on there, which is
that people don't want

00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:13.730
to make the wrong
choice with the most

00:19:13.730 --> 00:19:15.560
sensitive and important
decisions they'll

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:17.414
make in their lives.

00:19:17.414 --> 00:19:18.830
There's an old
saying in business.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.080
Nobody ever got
fired for buying IBM.

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.130
People used to say that.

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:25.230
IBM was in a different
business then.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.530
Well, no one ever
said that you're

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.740
a bad parent because you sent
your kid to college, right?

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.660
If you don't, a lot of
people might say that.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.243
Nobody ever said you're throwing
your life away because you're

00:19:35.243 --> 00:19:36.230
going to college.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:39.530
There's this fear
of getting it wrong.

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:41.420
And this was the thing
that really struck me.

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.670
I would talk to
people, even people

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.880
who agreed with me completely
about how fundamentally broken

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.300
higher education is, how bad of
a return on investment people

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.550
were getting, and
they were still

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.910
conflicted about the idea of not
sending their kids to college.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.290
It felt dangerous.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:19:59.810
It felt almost heretical.

00:19:59.810 --> 00:20:01.550
And that's what's weird to me.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.940
How could you look at the
numbers, look at the data,

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.950
know that it's a bad
deal and still think,

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.060
but I think it's too
dangerous not to do it?

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:12.810
And that led me to do more
research, to dig deeper.

00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:15.540
Remember, I have an
extreme personality.

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.660
So I don't do things halfway.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:19.700
So I started reading
articles, and I started

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.440
listening to interviews.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:22.850
And I started
talking to experts.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.600
And I started reading books.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.190
And I came back to the
people who pushed back,

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.947
and I had counter
arguments for them.

00:20:29.947 --> 00:20:31.530
And they had counter
arguments for me.

00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:33.350
And so I went back
and did more research,

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:36.320
and this cycle accelerated
over a seven-year period

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.230
until this kind of passive,
fun thing that I was doing

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:40.329
became, no, no, no.

00:20:40.329 --> 00:20:41.120
I'm taking this on.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.020
This is a research project.

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.350
So I went onto Amazon,
and I ordered every book

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:48.350
I could find about education,
instructional design,

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:51.214
the science of learning,
education reform.

00:20:51.214 --> 00:20:52.130
And the books arrived.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.004
Then, I looked at the
references in the back,

00:20:54.004 --> 00:20:57.560
and I ordered all the books
that they were referring to.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.050
And I had a mountain
of books in my house.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:02.817
My wife was like, Danny,
what are you doing?

00:21:02.817 --> 00:21:04.400
And I looked at this
mountain of books

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.160
and I was like, what am I doing?

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:08.900
There's no way I can
read all these books

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.120
in a human lifetime.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.700
And so I hired a research team.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:15.200
I said, I want you
to read this book

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.720
and write me a 20 or 30-page
summary with page stamps

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:21.050
so I can go back to the
original source of every idea

00:21:21.050 --> 00:21:22.460
and chase it down.

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.450
And I spent tens of thousands
of dollars getting a library

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:28.580
summarized so that I can
dig into, and research,

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.740
and organize, and think through.

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:33.210
I'm a little obsessive.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.540
So I did all this.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.990
And all of that
research culminated

00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:40.640
into "Leverage
Learning," the book

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.220
that I published in October.

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.486
Now I did all this
research looking for, once

00:21:46.486 --> 00:21:48.860
and for all, the definitive
data that I could show people

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.410
saying, look, this
direction in which I'm

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.900
saying education is
going, look, the data

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:56.490
is saying that's really
where it's going.

00:21:56.490 --> 00:22:01.880
What I actually found in the
data is that it's already here.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.350
There is a great quote
by William Gibson.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.360
He said, "The future is here.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.180
It's just not
evenly distributed."

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.750
The future is here.

00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:13.950
It's just not
evenly distributed.

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.749
So what does that mean?

00:22:15.749 --> 00:22:17.290
Well, let me tell
you a little story.

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:20.770
A couple of years ago, I was on
a business trip at a layover,

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.410
so I'm hanging out at the
airport killing some time.

00:22:23.410 --> 00:22:24.820
And I see a Brookstone store.

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.376
It's the store has all the
interesting tech gadgets.

00:22:27.376 --> 00:22:29.500
And having time to kill
and liking interesting tech

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.450
gadgets, I step inside.

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.900
And I see on display a Yoda
doll, Yoda from "Star Wars,"

00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:36.790
like this big on a pedestal.

00:22:36.790 --> 00:22:38.935
And as I approach,
Yoda's eyes open,

00:22:38.935 --> 00:22:40.810
and he turns his head
a little bit towards me

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:44.160
and he says, teach you
to use the force, I will.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:46.720
I'm like, cool, OK.

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:50.180
And Yoda says,
stretch out your arm.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:52.810
And so I'm kind of
tentatively doing this.

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.500
And through some combination
of sensors and motors,

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:58.420
Yoda gets flung back.

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.290
I'm like, oh my god!

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:01.240
This is so cool.

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.757
I need to buy this
and bring it home.

00:23:03.757 --> 00:23:06.340
And then, of course, I thought,
this won't fit in my carry-on,

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:07.381
and my wife will kill me.

00:23:07.381 --> 00:23:09.740
So I'm not going to buy
it, but this was awesome.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:11.570
Thank you very much.

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:13.270
And I keep walking
in the airport,

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:15.250
and I step into the
men's room, and I

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.120
see a line of men in front
of a line of sinks waving

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.420
their hands frantically trying
to get the motion activated

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.700
faucet to release some water.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:27.040
The future is here.

00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:29.830
It's just not
evenly distributed.

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:31.740
The sensors will get
into the faucets, too,

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:32.920
it's just a matter of time.

00:23:36.086 --> 00:23:39.400
Now what does that
mean about education.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.530
Has the whole world
caught onto the fact

00:23:41.530 --> 00:23:43.510
that education is broken?

00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:44.890
Not yet, but they are.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.120
It's happening.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:48.240
Is education broken already?

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.460
Yes, it is, and people
are catching on to that.

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:54.860
And when we're making big
decisions about our education,

00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:56.650
we have to think
ahead because you're

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:59.680
going to have to live with the
consequences of the decision

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:04.460
in the world that exists in
four to seven years, not today.

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:06.820
So what does this mean for
the disruption of education?

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:10.600
We hear a lot about the rising
cost of education, the student

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:11.770
debt crisis.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:16.120
It's $1.5 trillion now in the
US, second only to mortgages.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:17.650
It's more than credit cards.

00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:19.450
It is also, by the
way, the only kind

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:21.550
of debt you can't
even free yourself

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:23.115
by declaring bankruptcy.

00:24:23.115 --> 00:24:24.490
It's also the kind
of debt you're

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:28.330
most likely to incur before
you're even a legal adult.

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:30.450
Pretty crazy.

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:33.577
So we hear a lot about
the debt, the cost,

00:24:33.577 --> 00:24:35.410
but we don't hear a lot
about the other side

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.620
of the equation, which is what
is all that money paying for?

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.140
What is it actually buying?

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.710
Now we've already talked about
post-graduation employment

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.120
rates, which are abysmal.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.380
They're a disaster.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.970
But there's a whole lot more.

00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.300
There's all this
stuff that we think

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.940
is true, all these truisms
about the value of college

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.130
that just doesn't add up.

00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.536
Let's take, for example, the
lie of lifetime earnings.

00:25:00.536 --> 00:25:01.660
We've all heard the truism.

00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:05.300
If you go to college, you'll
make more over your lifetime.

00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.937
Well, that's accurate,
but it's also misleading

00:25:08.937 --> 00:25:11.020
because you're looking at
a massive amount of data

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:14.120
as a whole rather than looking
at the right pockets of it.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.549
So let's start with
a little analogy.

00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:19.090
Imagine you've got a bar, and
10 guys are sitting in the bar,

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.173
and they each are in the
median American household

00:25:21.173 --> 00:25:23.630
income of about $60,000.

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:25.990
And then Bill Gates
walks into the bar.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:28.090
The average income of
a person at the bar

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.670
just shot up by over
a billion dollars.

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.620
But none of those
guys got any richer.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.652
So it's true that, as a
whole, college graduates

00:25:35.652 --> 00:25:37.360
earn more over a
lifetime than people who

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.960
didn't go to college.

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:41.080
But let's filter out
those top 200 schools

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.650
which represent less than
10%, much less than 10%,

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:46.690
of college education in the US.

00:25:46.690 --> 00:25:48.472
Let's take that out
of the equation.

00:25:48.472 --> 00:25:49.930
Let's also take
out of the equation

00:25:49.930 --> 00:25:53.450
a very small subset of highly
paid vocation granting degrees.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:57.580
So we take out engineering and
medical school, for example.

00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.690
Most of those earnings
differences disappear.

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.690
Let's also remember that most
colleges are in major metro

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:07.570
areas, which means that
most college graduates are

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:09.580
in major metro areas,
where the cost of living

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.710
is a little higher and the
income is a little higher.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.920
Let's also remember that
if you graduate saddled

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.660
with enormous
amounts of debt, you

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.660
will have a bias to take a
higher paying job you might not

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:23.440
want, because you have no
choice, to service that debt.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.190
Let's also remember that just
about all post-college earning

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.734
data is self-reported.

00:26:28.734 --> 00:26:31.150
So the people who are excited
about how much money they're

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.060
making will presumably
be overrepresented.

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:39.640
So figure all that in, and
that difference disappears.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.960
And it goes further.

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.270
Because there's also a
question of attribution.

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:45.250
Let's look at the top schools.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.680
Let's look at, you go to one
of those top 200 schools,

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.240
you will earn more
over a lifetime.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.237
But is that because you went
to the top school therefore

00:26:53.237 --> 00:26:54.070
you're earning more?

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:57.310
Or is it because the people who
were going to earn more anyway

00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:59.200
went to the top school?

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.930
It's harder to get
into the top schools.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.710
It takes a higher caliber
person, as judged by academics

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:07.120
and whatever else.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.200
That can be a
confounding variable.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.750
So research has
actually been done

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:13.690
to try to untangle
those variables

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:16.019
Seth Stephens-Davidowitz,
he published a great book

00:27:16.019 --> 00:27:17.060
the last couple of years.

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.860
It's called "Everybody Lies."

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:22.490
He got a lot of his data from
Google, which is fascinating.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.060
So what he did is
he looked at the--

00:27:26.060 --> 00:27:28.859
because do we know that people
who graduated from Harvard

00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:30.400
earn more over a
lifetime than people

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.250
who went to Penn State, which
a good, but not quite as good

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:34.030
school?

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:37.060
Yes, but it's harder
to get into Harvard.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.170
So he looked at the data.

00:27:38.170 --> 00:27:40.420
He looked at the
people who applied to

00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:44.184
and got accepted to both
Harvard and Penn State.

00:27:44.184 --> 00:27:45.850
They could have gone
to either, but they

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:49.335
chose to go to Penn State
because it was closer to home.

00:27:49.335 --> 00:27:49.960
It was cheaper.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:51.710
There was a boyfriend
or girlfriend there,

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.870
closer to a family,
whatever it is.

00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:57.520
So let's compare that
cohort's postgraduate earning

00:27:57.520 --> 00:27:59.670
with the people who
went to Harvard.

00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.690
It's exactly the same.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:04.390
So is it that you
make more money

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.550
because you went to
Harvard, or is it

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:09.250
that the people who are going
to make more money anyway

00:28:09.250 --> 00:28:10.060
went to Harvard?

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:15.240
There's a huge
disconnect between what

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.430
we think education will do for
us and what it actually does.

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.270
But it raises the question, why?

00:28:21.270 --> 00:28:25.090
Why is education so out
of step with modern life?

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:26.680
It wasn't always like this.

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:30.330
100 years ago, 50 years
ago, even 30 years ago,

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.360
college really was the golden
ticket to the good life,

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.860
to opportunity, to possibility.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:37.450
It really did open doors.

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:39.620
So what has changed?

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.550
Well, over the last
few decades, everything

00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:47.350
about how we need education to
fit into our lives has changed,

00:28:47.350 --> 00:28:50.960
but education hasn't,
not nearly enough.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:53.050
So let's start with the
timing of education.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:56.770
The timing of education
in our lives has changed.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.797
Education used to follow
a just-in-case model.

00:28:59.797 --> 00:29:01.630
You're going to spend
a whole bunch of years

00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:03.370
studying at the
start of your career

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.590
just in case you need it.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:09.010
And this was always
pedagogical problematic

00:29:09.010 --> 00:29:12.190
because we know that the
amount of stuff you retain

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:13.899
is a lot less than people think.

00:29:13.899 --> 00:29:15.940
And so the stuff you
studied in college 5, or 10,

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.430
or 15 years later, most of
it's just not there anymore.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.410
But let's put that aside.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:23.530
The stuff that you learned
could still be current.

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:25.470
The world stage more
or less the same.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.670
You could graduate from
college, get a job,

00:29:27.670 --> 00:29:30.375
and be doing a similar
job 30 years later better

00:29:30.375 --> 00:29:31.750
because you have
more experience,

00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.300
but it's the same
fundamental skill set.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.190
That's not how our
world works today.

00:29:36.190 --> 00:29:38.890
The world changes
so much faster.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.780
I mean, here at
Google, anyone who

00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:44.890
learned how to code 20 years ago
and that was their knowledge,

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:45.920
it'd be useless.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:47.560
They couldn't do
anything, right?

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.060
The world has changed.

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:51.670
Larry Summers, the former dean
of Harvard is on record saying,

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:55.130
everything you learn is going
to be obsolete in 5 or 10 years.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.910
So we're shifting.

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.260
We're seeing a shift from a
lot of education just in case

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:02.830
at the start of a career to
actually a lot more education

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.580
just in time, over the
duration of a career.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.430
The timing of education,
informal institutions

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:12.230
has not kept up
with what we need.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:13.930
But even more
importantly, the way

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:18.700
in which we need to be empowered
by education has changed.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:20.870
Compare again the
world 100 years ago,

00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:24.410
50 years ago, 30 years
ago with the world today.

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:25.990
It used to be pretty static.

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:27.920
Things stayed more
or less the same.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.060
But now, things are changing
at an ever-faster pace

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:33.490
because of Moore's law, because
of how quickly technology

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:35.500
is changing, because
of automation, because

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:37.840
of AI, because of the
acceleration of all

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:40.390
those factors coming together.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:44.200
30 years ago, the world
was ruled by experts.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.652
But today, expertise is cheap.

00:30:45.652 --> 00:30:47.110
Being an expert
basically means you

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.330
can answer the questions
that Google can answer;

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.310
and Google is faster.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:53.470
Now, we need people who
can answer the questions

00:30:53.470 --> 00:30:58.150
that Google can't answer, and
that's not the same thing.

00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:00.100
30 years ago, a
model employee was

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.320
someone who could
follow instructions

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.960
with a high degree
of competency.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.840
And education did a pretty
good job of training people

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.080
to do exactly that.

00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.080
But things have changed.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:13.150
We've all heard
the clichés, right?

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:16.060
You know, the hottest jobs
today didn't exist 15 years ago.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.740
We're training people
to solve problems

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.342
that aren't problems
yet using tools

00:31:19.342 --> 00:31:21.550
that haven't been invented
yet, et cetera, et cetera.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:24.660
We've heard those
cliches, and they're true.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.350
But it raises the
question, well, then,

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:30.100
what does it take to
succeed in that world today

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.560
and into the future?

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.270
Well, let's do a little
thought experiment.

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:38.560
Imagine you're about to
start the most ambitious,

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.550
challenging, complicated,
sensitive, high-profile project

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:49.160
of your life and career, but you
don't know anything about it.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.240
Now, build your team.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:53.580
Who do you want on
your team with you?

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.490
You can't say, well, I need
a full stack developer,

00:31:56.490 --> 00:31:59.700
and I need a copywriter,
and I need a police chief.

00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:02.220
You can't say I need these
things because you don't know

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:04.457
what the subject matter is.

00:32:04.457 --> 00:32:06.040
So you're probably
going to say, well,

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.610
I want people who are
resourceful and think well

00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:11.890
on their feet, people who take
initiative and responsibility,

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.770
people who handle
ambiguity well,

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:17.197
and people who play
well with others.

00:32:17.197 --> 00:32:19.030
So how does that play
out in the real world?

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.880
Think about the
best people you've

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.790
worked with in your
careers, the people who

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:27.390
got great results,
delivered great outcomes,

00:32:27.390 --> 00:32:29.610
everyone wanted
them on their teams.

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.920
I'm willing to bet that other
than their subject matter

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:33.790
expertise, which
is also important--

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:36.206
these are all people who were
resourceful and thought well

00:32:36.206 --> 00:32:38.790
on their feet, who took
initiative and responsibility,

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:43.080
who handled ambiguity well, and
who played well with others.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.750
And what do employers
tell us they want?

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.970
They want people who are
resourceful and think well

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:48.960
on their feet.

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.790
They want people who take
initiative and responsibility.

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:54.570
They want people who
handle ambiguity well.

00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:58.560
And they want people who
play well with others.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.870
Competence is no longer enough.

00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:03.180
Our world demands excellence.

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:05.580
Memorizing the dots
is no longer enough.

00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:07.470
We have Google for that.

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:09.240
Our world demands that
we find novel ways

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.580
of connecting those dots.

00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:14.160
Knowing the answers
is no longer enough.

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:18.750
Our world demands that we
learn to ask better questions.

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:23.280
So given those needs, how does
higher education stack up?

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.010
The answer is, poorly.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:29.190
Higher education
does a terrible job

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:32.629
of preparing us to think
critically and creatively.

00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:34.045
There is a great
body of research.

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:37.200
You can we find the book
called "Academically Adrift"

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.230
documenting it, showing
that over a third

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:42.630
of people going through
a four-year college

00:33:42.630 --> 00:33:46.380
career as a student shows zero
games and critical thinking

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:49.020
skills over that time.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.380
This from institutions that are
"teaching you how to think."

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:53.257
Not so much.

00:33:53.257 --> 00:33:55.590
And this is especially scary
when you consider that most

00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:57.970
people going through this
four-year-type program,

00:33:57.970 --> 00:34:00.690
they're in the age
range of about 18 to 22.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.370
This is a time in our lives
when brain development is still

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:03.870
happening.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:06.900
You would expect cognitive
critical thinking abilities

00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.489
to be growing no matter
what you're doing.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:13.080
So what is really
going on there?

00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:15.169
Now this is what I
found in my research.

00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:16.710
This is what I
documented in my book.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:19.530
I found mountains of
data reaffirming story

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.530
after story of
people who felt bated

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:27.719
by the shiny promise of the
good life made by college

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:30.480
and then switched to
the soul-crushing debt

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.540
and dubious job prospects
that they actually got.

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:35.469
This is what led to
the second awakening.

00:34:35.469 --> 00:34:38.850
This is what led me to
speak out and say, look,

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.120
the emperor is naked.

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.929
And I'm not alone
in saying that.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:45.300
Clayton Christensen,
who teaches at Harvard,

00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.130
he wrote the
"Innovator's Dilemma"

00:34:47.130 --> 00:34:50.429
is on record saying that
he expects 50% of colleges

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:53.800
to be bankrupt in the
next 5 or 10 years.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:58.740
I'm not quite that
optimistic, but I'm close.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.490
Joseph Aoun, president of
Northeastern University,

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.157
wrote a great book
called "Robot Proof,"

00:35:04.157 --> 00:35:06.448
talking about all the ways
in which higher education is

00:35:06.448 --> 00:35:08.490
falling short when it
comes to preparing people

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:10.140
for the world of tomorrow.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.450
Ryan Craig has written
a couple of great books

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:15.360
on the topic, "College
(Un)Bound" and "A New U."

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.920
Bryan Caplan has
written about this.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.660
Many others have as well.

00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:22.110
We all see that for too
long the cost of education

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.540
has been going up, and
the value it provides

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.190
has been going down.

00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:28.500
Now this is a familiar pattern.

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.110
Costs going up,
value going down.

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:33.150
That's the definition
of a bubble,

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:36.210
and bubbles always burst.

00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:39.180
Sometimes they
burst dramatically,

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.330
like the financial
markets did in 2008 Bang!

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:43.530
It's all gone, right?

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.020
3/4 of the value
disappears overnight.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.970
But sometimes it's more gradual.

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:50.400
Sometimes the way a bubble
bursts is more like the air

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.630
being let out of a balloon.

00:35:51.630 --> 00:35:55.920
[MAKES DEFLATION NOISE]
And we have good reason

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.050
to believe that this is
already happening when

00:35:58.050 --> 00:35:59.880
it comes to higher education.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.180
Over the last five years, the US
saw an undergraduate enrollment

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:07.170
decline of 2.4 million people.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:10.950
That's almost 7% of would-be
students recognizing

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:13.950
that despite the huge power
commanded by the emperor,

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:16.290
he just isn't nearly
well-dressed enough

00:36:16.290 --> 00:36:19.620
to justify investing years
of their lives and tens

00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:23.520
if not hundreds of
thousands of their dollars.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.990
So where does that leave us?

00:36:24.990 --> 00:36:27.340
And what can we do?

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.350
Well, first, we can all be
smart about our own continuing

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:32.720
educations.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.610
I'm not necessarily
unilaterally suggesting

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:39.360
that you forsake and condemn
institutionalized education.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.250
But I am saying you
shouldn't take it

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.779
as a magical golden
ticket, either.

00:36:43.779 --> 00:36:46.320
I'll get it, I'll pay the price,
and I'll just trust and hope

00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:47.880
that things will work out.

00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.770
The cost is just too high.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.680
What other area of
life do we invest

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.780
that much time and
that much money

00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.020
and just hope for the best?

00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:58.750
Nowhere.

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:01.090
And regardless of
whatever formal training

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:03.820
you do or don't pursue,
you have to take ownership

00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:06.430
and responsibility for
developing yourself

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:08.290
into the sort of
person who will thrive

00:37:08.290 --> 00:37:11.620
in the modern world, someone who
is resourceful and thinks well

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.600
on their feet, who
takes initiative

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.840
and responsibility, who
handles ambiguity well,

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:20.000
and who plays well with others.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.740
So how do you do that?

00:37:21.740 --> 00:37:25.060
Well, I would love to give
you a set of instructions.

00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:28.180
And people ask me, and that's
what they're looking for.

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:28.952
But I can't.

00:37:28.952 --> 00:37:30.410
And there are two
reasons for that.

00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:31.900
First, everybody's different.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.910
What they find
fascinating, and inspiring,

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:37.310
and fulfilling won't be
the same for someone else.

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:40.480
But more importantly, how could
you possibly develop things

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.930
like resourcefulness,
initiative, and comfort

00:37:43.930 --> 00:37:46.600
with ambiguity by
following someone else's

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.730
clean set of instructions?

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:51.020
It doesn't work.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:53.590
What you need is a
shift in orientation.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:55.720
You move away from
thinking like a navigator

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.060
towards thinking
like an explorer.

00:37:58.060 --> 00:37:59.650
Navigators follow directions.

00:37:59.650 --> 00:38:01.840
They're looking for the
shortest, or safest,

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:05.260
or most direct path from
A to B. Explorers aim

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:10.430
to learn because they're excited
about what they might find.

00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:13.840
So how do explorers
get good at exploring?

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.550
By exploring.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:17.440
You have a model
for this right here

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.430
at Google, your famous 20%
time for engineers, the idea

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.180
being that you should
be working on things

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:24.910
that are not core to your job.

00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:27.520
You need to take that same
ethos to your own learning,

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:30.280
investing whether it's 20% or
whatever the appropriate time

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.980
is for you, of your time
and learning and growing

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.620
in areas that are not
immediately relevant

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:39.340
but are interesting, and
fascinating, and fulfilling.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.860
And the world is abundant with
tools to help you do this.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:43.600
There are books
and online courses.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.595
There are Ted Talks.

00:38:44.595 --> 00:38:45.595
There coaching programs.

00:38:45.595 --> 00:38:47.710
There are personal
research projects.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.600
There are
entrepreneurial ventures.

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.310
There are many ingredients.

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:54.320
But you have to invent
your own recipe.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:56.030
And that's the key.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.570
If you have kids, or
friends, or siblings

00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:00.070
who are considering
college, I'm not

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:01.840
saying that they
should read some books

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.700
or watch some videos instead.

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:05.200
I'm not even saying
they shouldn't

00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:07.270
go to college necessarily.

00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:10.000
But the first step is to
be crystal clear about what

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.560
it is that you want.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.420
And take the time to do it.

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:16.060
People can be forgiven
for, at the age of 17,

00:39:16.060 --> 00:39:19.000
not knowing what they want to
do for the rest of their lives.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.660
How many of us today would
like to be held responsible

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.710
and attached to some decision
we made when we were a teenager?

00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:27.840
It's OK if they don't know.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:31.600
But if you don't know,
take the time to find out.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.614
Do a gap year.

00:39:32.614 --> 00:39:34.030
Read a bunch of
books about things

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.410
you might be interested in.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:38.080
Make a list of areas that
you might like to work in.

00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.970
Reach out to people
working in those areas

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.470
and take them out
for lunch and say,

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:43.756
what is it like to
work in this area?

00:39:43.756 --> 00:39:46.130
If you think this is a field
you want to pursue say, hey,

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.460
can I work for you for free,
for a month, or two months,

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:49.126
or three months?

00:39:49.126 --> 00:39:51.640
All I want is to see what
it's like and get half an hour

00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.598
of your time at the end
of the month to ask you

00:39:53.598 --> 00:39:56.050
questions about what
this experience is like.

00:39:56.050 --> 00:39:58.765
People sometimes tell me, Danny,
what do you mean work for free?

00:39:58.765 --> 00:40:01.223
And I say that's a lot better
than paying tens of thousands

00:40:01.223 --> 00:40:02.320
of dollars.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.011
Get clear on what
it is that you want.

00:40:05.011 --> 00:40:06.760
And sometimes something
funny will happen.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.000
Sometimes this process will
bypass the rest altogether.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.710
It will just lead
to a job offer.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.126
And if that happens,
that's great,

00:40:13.126 --> 00:40:14.350
but that's not the point.

00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:16.916
Once you know what
it is you want to do,

00:40:16.916 --> 00:40:18.790
you can decide on the
best path to get there.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.710
Maybe college is the best path.

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:22.800
Someone who knows they
want to be a surgeon

00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:24.680
will have to go
to medical school.

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.590
Someone who thinks they
want to be a surgeon

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:29.910
goes to medical school and then
discovers they don't like it--

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:31.720
and I know people like that--

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.460
that's unfortunate.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:35.980
And many paths don't
require college

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.410
as the fastest way of getting
to where they want to go.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:42.190
Fundamentally, some training,
some education is vocational.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:43.990
It teaches you
how to do the job.

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:47.530
But in many cases, it's just
some generic calling card.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.890
It's a degree that is supposed
to impress a very small number

00:40:50.890 --> 00:40:52.810
of people in order
for them to open

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:55.030
a very small number of doors.

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:58.450
So if the goal is to impress
a very small number of people

00:40:58.450 --> 00:41:00.580
and you're allocating
years of your life and tens

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.680
if not hundreds of thousands
of your dollars to doing it,

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:07.180
is there not potentially at
least a more efficient way

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:09.440
of getting the job done?

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:13.360
So for many people, college
will not be the answer.

00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:15.190
And then the question
becomes, and I

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.670
get this question every day,
well, Danny, if not college,

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.170
then what?

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.330
And what people are asking
for with that question

00:41:22.330 --> 00:41:26.050
is a one-size-fits
all answer, right?

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:28.480
If everyone doesn't
go to college,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.970
everyone should go to
this thing instead.

00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:34.780
But that's still the assembly
line model of education,

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.570
with everyone going
through the same stations.

00:41:37.570 --> 00:41:40.660
And that doesn't fit our
era of personalization.

00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:42.650
That's not how
things work anymore.

00:41:42.650 --> 00:41:45.040
What we need is the
opposite of a one-size-fits

00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:46.900
all approach, where
everyone follows

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.500
some right set of instructions.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:53.210
And that leads us to the
most important ingredient,

00:41:53.210 --> 00:41:55.400
which is self-direction.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.100
It's not about opting out, and
quitting, and saying, well,

00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.990
I'm just going to
watch TV and eat pizza.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:03.830
It's about being
proactive in deciding,

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.960
here is what I'm going
to opt for instead.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.940
It's about being
led by curiosity

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.400
and charting your own path.

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.960
And you need to do it.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.100
Everybody needs to do it.

00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.260
But before everyone can do it.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:20.247
The people around them need
to trust that it can be done.

00:42:20.247 --> 00:42:21.330
Because that's the terror.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.030
Well, wait, no, I mean, people
left to their own devices

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.670
will just watch Netflix.

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.970
And people are reflecting
on a very limited subset

00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:29.970
of their own experience.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.810
They say, you know,
I work hard at work,

00:42:31.810 --> 00:42:34.309
but when I get home at the end
of the day or on the weekend,

00:42:34.309 --> 00:42:35.829
I just want to binge Netflix.

00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:38.370
It's like, yeah, because you're
tired from your work all week

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:39.730
long.

00:42:39.730 --> 00:42:43.470
But left to our own
devices people are curious.

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:44.490
People are interested.

00:42:44.490 --> 00:42:45.840
People are engaged.

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.210
The research, everything
that we know about education

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:55.230
shows that A, people can do
this; and B, we must do this.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:43:00.200
When we talk about deep
learning, powerful learning,

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.390
there's a lot of misconception
about how it works.

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:05.550
Many people have heard
of the 10,000-hour rule,

00:43:05.550 --> 00:43:08.310
the idea if you want to become
an expert, master in a subject,

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:11.230
you have to work
for 10,000 hours.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:12.962
This was popularized
by Malcolm Gladwell

00:43:12.962 --> 00:43:13.920
in his book "Outliers."

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.920
This is a great, fascinating
interesting book.

00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:17.640
He's incredibly talented.

00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.890
And it is based largely on
the research of Dr. K Anders

00:43:20.890 --> 00:43:24.750
Ericsson, who was so frustrated
by how misrepresented

00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:28.740
his research was that he wrote
a book called "Peak," that talks

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:31.080
about deliberate practice.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:34.660
There are three big steps
in any educational process.

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.140
The first is the
consumption of the new idea,

00:43:37.140 --> 00:43:38.301
of the new knowledge.

00:43:38.301 --> 00:43:40.050
That's where you're
attending the lecture,

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.800
watching the video, listening
to the audio, whatever it is.

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:47.940
The second step is application,
taking what you've learned

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.230
and doing something with it.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:53.190
And that can be theoretical--
doing homework, writing essays,

00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:56.360
whatever; it can be practical,
applying it in the real world.

00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:58.569
And then the third step
is when you get feedback.

00:43:58.569 --> 00:44:01.110
Here's where you got it right;
here's where you got it wrong.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:02.460
This can come from a coach.

00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.586
It can come from a teacher.

00:44:03.586 --> 00:44:05.126
It can just come
from the real world.

00:44:05.126 --> 00:44:06.810
I tried to sell
something nobody bought.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:07.925
That tells me something.

00:44:07.925 --> 00:44:09.300
Although, hopefully,
the feedback

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:14.370
is more directive and helpful
than just a binary yes or no.

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:19.170
Learning happens not in that
first bucket of exposure

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:19.710
to ideas.

00:44:19.710 --> 00:44:22.140
It happens in the
second and third buckets

00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.360
of playing with the
ideas, working with them,

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:28.530
applying them, getting
feedback, and improving.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:31.140
It's about doing that
work and doing it

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.760
at the edge of
your comfort zone.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.130
But it's hard to do that.

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:36.000
It's uncomfortable.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.250
You're going to be pushing
out of your zone of comfort

00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:38.792
all the time.

00:44:38.792 --> 00:44:40.916
You're going to be doing
things that are difficult.

00:44:40.916 --> 00:44:42.450
You're going to face setbacks.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:43.830
And that means you
need to be able to push

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:44.670
through discomfort.

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:46.700
You need to persevere.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.812
Now Angular Duckworth
calls this "Grit."

00:44:48.812 --> 00:44:50.520
She published a book
about this recently,

00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:53.550
but she published her first
research paper on the topic

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:55.470
in 2007.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:58.620
And since then, the idea
of grit has inspired

00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:01.440
the imagination of educators.

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.540
If grit leads to
success, then we just

00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:07.200
have to teach people
to be more gritty.

00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:09.450
But there's a key
thing that gets

00:45:09.450 --> 00:45:13.530
missed, which is that nobody
is gritty about everything.

00:45:13.530 --> 00:45:17.760
Nobody is gritty about things
that we have no interest in.

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.640
We are gritty about the
things that we care about.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:23.340
We're greedy about the things
that fascinate and inspire us.

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.090
So while it's true that
grit is a cause of success,

00:45:27.090 --> 00:45:32.710
grit is also an effect of
self-directed inspiration.

00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:35.680
So for us to engage in that
deep and powerful learning

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.480
and push through
the discomfort, it

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.880
has to be on things and
in ways that actually

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.320
engage and fascinate us.

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:45.580
And that is what leads to
actual success in real life,

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.350
again, as documented
by research.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:50.740
The key isn't to try to make
people greedy about things

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:52.610
that they don't care about.

00:45:52.610 --> 00:45:55.360
It's to empower them to focus
their energies on the things

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.220
that they do.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.680
Ultimately, we only
become the sort

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:03.100
of people who will succeed in
the present and in the future

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:07.030
if we get excited about learning
to figure it out on our own

00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:09.550
and trust that we can.

00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:11.030
I hope you will all do that.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:13.870
I hope you will encourage the
people that you care about

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:15.340
to do the same.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.138
Thank you.

00:46:16.138 --> 00:46:20.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:22.360
SPEAKER: All right, questions.

00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:29.020
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.690
I'm curious about the
role of social interaction

00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.000
in institutional education.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.030
I agree with your
assessment completely.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.790
For the sake of argument,
I ended up at Yale,

00:46:39.790 --> 00:46:41.680
and I'm grateful
for that opportunity

00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.380
most because of the
people I met in my class.

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.750
And I think I've learned
the most in the last couple

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.060
of years from those people.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:50.650
And to your point
about maybe it's

00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:54.220
the ones who are destined
anyway who end up there,

00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:56.470
where does that enter the
balance in the big picture?

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:57.950
DANNY INY: Oh, I
think it's huge.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:00.220
I think it's incredibly
important and incredibly

00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:01.360
valuable.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.150
I would just
question-- and I mean,

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.590
everyone can kind of be
divided into two categories.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:10.330
There are the people who have
functionally infinite resources

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.640
and the people who don't.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:14.690
So is it easier to
just go to Yale,

00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:17.760
where all these smart people
and great people already are?

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:18.760
Sure.

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:22.240
But does that convenience
justify the incredible cost

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.830
of going to Yale?

00:47:23.830 --> 00:47:24.590
Maybe not.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.280
Because if the whole goal is
to find all these great people,

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:30.464
and build relationships,
and develop the networks,

00:47:30.464 --> 00:47:32.880
there are more efficient and
effective ways of doing that.

00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.710
Like, a case in point, you
could move to New Haven

00:47:35.710 --> 00:47:39.580
and hang out with students--
like, you can do things

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.080
without investing in all that.

00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:45.160
So a lot of the component
pieces of higher education

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:48.120
are valuable, but the challenge
is that it's a bundle.

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:50.527
It's like, when
you had a cable--

00:47:50.527 --> 00:47:51.610
you're going to get cable.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:53.350
You get 427 channels.

00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:54.810
You only really
want six of them.

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:59.110
But you're paying for
the other 421 as well.

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:02.040
And college has to be that way
because of the cost structure.

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:04.100
It's not an easy thing
for them to change.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:07.720
So it's incredibly important
that they're probably

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.317
cheaper and faster
ways of getting just

00:48:10.317 --> 00:48:11.150
as important pieces.

00:48:15.619 --> 00:48:18.800
AUDIENCE: Hi, so I'm
totally bought-in.

00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.490
You're the god of this thing.

00:48:20.490 --> 00:48:24.150
And I'm, like, totally
into it to the point where

00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:27.580
I like a side project, which
is an educational programs,

00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:31.174
so I'm like fully immerse.

00:48:31.174 --> 00:48:33.090
I've been doing this for
about a decade or so.

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:35.790
I have a nine-year-old now that
I'm shuffling through the New

00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:37.980
York City public
school education system

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:40.260
and with the Manhattan
Upper East Side parents,

00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:43.650
it's really hard
not to get caught up

00:48:43.650 --> 00:48:50.730
in the whole culture and the
vision of what-- you know,

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:53.520
if I'm saying, like, college
is this terrible thing,

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.505
we should do it.

00:48:54.505 --> 00:48:56.130
I shouldn't push my
kid into it, I also

00:48:56.130 --> 00:48:59.060
feel like, well,
what if I'm wrong?

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.840
This is my child's
future that's,

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:02.215
like, really in my hands.

00:49:02.215 --> 00:49:04.590
Like, she'll basically right
now buy into almost anything

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:05.610
I tell her.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:08.190
I think part of the
problem I have is

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:10.470
that this ongoing
narrative that even

00:49:10.470 --> 00:49:13.660
for my generation that we've
been telling ourselves,

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.280
which is like, oh I'm the first
in my family to go to college,

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:19.215
or I'm the second
generation to go to college.

00:49:19.215 --> 00:49:20.340
My parents went to college.

00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:21.150
I went to college.

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:22.710
There's something
that has built up.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:25.332
And for me to come
in and say, but now,

00:49:25.332 --> 00:49:26.790
my daughter will
not go to college.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.830
I feel like there's
this downshift.

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:34.120
It's really hard to connect
those neurons and be OK with it

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:37.560
unless we had other
narratives around--

00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:39.840
but Uncle Joe, he
didn't go to college,

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:41.710
and he's got this
successful business.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:45.270
And then there's Cousin
Suzanne, and she did--

00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:47.250
we just-- we don't
have the stories

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:49.440
in the kind of
middle class families

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:52.250
that I think something like
this is trying to touch.

00:49:52.250 --> 00:49:54.306
So what do we do about that?

00:49:54.306 --> 00:49:56.320
DANNY INY: So I
love that question,

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.190
which is really 11 questions.

00:49:59.190 --> 00:50:00.910
And so I'll try to
cover all of it.

00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:07.170
If I miss some, call me out,
and I'll try to come back to it.

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:08.790
So there's a lot in there.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:12.600
Part of is it's very
hard to go against what

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:15.600
you've been taught and
trained and society around to

00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.570
tells you feels right.

00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:21.509
There's all this stuff out
there about follow your heart.

00:50:21.509 --> 00:50:22.800
It's easy to follow your heart.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.450
It's a lot harder
to follow your brain

00:50:24.450 --> 00:50:26.880
when your heart, and your
feelings, and people around you

00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:29.160
are telling you
something different.

00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:33.810
I think it helps a lot to remind
yourself that the worst case

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:37.840
scenario is not that bad because
it is a reversible decision.

00:50:37.840 --> 00:50:39.960
I don't think anyone
should make a unilateral,

00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:42.630
I will never send
my kids to college.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:44.130
I do think everyone
should move away

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:48.289
from the default, that option A
is that my kids go to college.

00:50:48.289 --> 00:50:50.580
Let them chart their path,
figure out what makes sense.

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.690
And if it turns out
to be college, OK.

00:50:54.690 --> 00:50:56.440
There are a lot of
other paths to success.

00:50:56.440 --> 00:51:02.130
I also think there's an unfair
and unreasonable bar for going

00:51:02.130 --> 00:51:04.200
to college versus not.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:09.450
If you go to college, success
means you land a good job.

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:12.375
You make a high five-figure,
low six-figure income.

00:51:12.375 --> 00:51:15.180
That's, like, you know,
the bar for success.

00:51:15.180 --> 00:51:17.610
You say, well, I think I'm
not going to go to college.

00:51:17.610 --> 00:51:19.692
And other people have
been successful not

00:51:19.692 --> 00:51:20.400
going to college.

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.270
Yeah, but you're not Bill Gates.

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:22.680
You're not Mark Zuckerberg.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:26.490
So if the bar for success
for going to college

00:51:26.490 --> 00:51:29.040
is a six-figure
income, why is the bar

00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:33.050
for success for not going to
college becoming a billionaire?

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:35.230
Like, that doesn't make sense.

00:51:35.230 --> 00:51:36.710
That's not how ROI works.

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.900
So I would just keep
all of that in mind.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:43.512
And the counterargument is--

00:51:43.512 --> 00:51:44.970
one of the things
I didn't touch on

00:51:44.970 --> 00:51:47.420
is that a big reason
why the value of college

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:52.470
is declined aside from the
internal actual value of what

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:54.570
it prepares you to do
and all that, college

00:51:54.570 --> 00:51:56.146
has been a signal.

00:51:56.146 --> 00:51:58.020
It's been a signal that,
look, the person who

00:51:58.020 --> 00:52:00.020
bears this has gone through
certain experiences,

00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.300
has certain wherewithal
and financial resources,

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:06.180
comes from a certain echelon of
society, et cetera, et cetera.

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.901
And the value of that
signal is declining

00:52:08.901 --> 00:52:10.650
for all the reasons
we discussed, but also

00:52:10.650 --> 00:52:12.430
because of ubiquity, right?

00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:14.790
It used to be that you
apply for a job 40 years ago

00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:18.910
and your résumé has MBA after
your name, you're the only one.

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:19.680
So you stand out.

00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:21.640
If everyone has an
undergraduate degree,

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.410
you don't stand out at all.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:25.176
And if you don't,
it might actually

00:52:25.176 --> 00:52:26.550
be an interesting
differentiator.

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:29.277
Well, what has this
person does instead?

00:52:29.277 --> 00:52:31.110
And so that's the reason
why it's gone down.

00:52:31.110 --> 00:52:35.460
That said, that ubiquity
is kind of shift--

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:37.560
and that's part of why
the decline in the value--

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.930
it's kind of shifted
what the degree signals.

00:52:39.930 --> 00:52:42.330
It used to say, look,
the bearer of this degree

00:52:42.330 --> 00:52:44.610
is better than everyone else.

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:46.830
Now, it says, the
bearer of this degree

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:49.320
is no worse than anyone else.

00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:54.660
And, unfortunately-- and I hate
to say this-- but for people

00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:56.940
in society who are in a
position where they will not

00:52:56.940 --> 00:52:59.377
be given the benefit
of the doubt,

00:52:59.377 --> 00:53:00.960
where whether it's
women, whether it's

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:03.000
people of color,
people who are coming

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.312
from a disadvantaged
position, that stamp of, look,

00:53:06.312 --> 00:53:07.770
you're no better
than everyone else

00:53:07.770 --> 00:53:09.311
but you're no worse
than anyone else,

00:53:09.311 --> 00:53:11.950
either, could have more value.

00:53:11.950 --> 00:53:14.260
So I don't advocate
it in general.

00:53:14.260 --> 00:53:16.220
And I think there
are good reasons to.

00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.720
If you're going to
do it, find a way

00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:19.460
to do it that is cost effective.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:24.392
But that could skew the math.

00:53:24.392 --> 00:53:26.540
SPEAKER: All right.

00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:27.350
Can we keep going?

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:30.730
We're actually at time.

00:53:30.730 --> 00:53:32.762
All right.

00:53:32.762 --> 00:53:35.880
All right, so if you have any
questions, come talk to Danny.

00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:41.630
[APPLAUSE]
