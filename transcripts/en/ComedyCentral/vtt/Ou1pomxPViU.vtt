00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:04.704
(upbeat instrumental music)

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:06.239 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I will turn the program
over now to someone

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:09.142
whose accent falsely makes
you believe can trust him.

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:10.377
(laughing)

00:00:10.377 --> 00:00:11.244
John Oliver, John.

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:12.412
(laughing)

00:00:12.412 --> 00:00:15.749
(cheering and clapping)

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.551
- Thank you.

00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:20.286
Thank you, John.

00:00:20.286 --> 00:00:23.123 align:start size:81% position:19%
Thank you John and
please, please.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.459
Before I continue, let
me assure my viewers

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:31.064
that from now on, there
will be no pussying out.

00:00:31.064 --> 00:00:32.599
- Taxation is slavery.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.769
- New Jersey has the highest
property tax in the nation.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.736
- I know.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:37.704
What are you getting for it?

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:38.405
Because it is an awful state?

00:00:38.405 --> 00:00:39.239
- Exactly.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.073
It's not an awful state.

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:40.774
It's a great state.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:41.941
- Oh.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:42.776 align:start size:84% position:16%
- It's the government
that's awful.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:43.743
- Right.

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:45.211
- The Democrats are awful.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.746 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's just you look around
Jersey and you think,

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:47.614
where is the money going,
because I just don't see it

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:48.915
in this state.

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:50.183
- Yes.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.751
- It just seems
like a wasteland.

00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:52.552
- I am from a small town,
so I can tell you exactly

00:00:52.552 --> 00:00:53.820
what that means.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.955
- Well that's what
I'd like you to do.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.793 align:start size:88% position:13%
- It's real people, real
values, common sense.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.264
- Can you be more generic?

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.833
- Mic check.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:07.667
- [Crowd] Mic check.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:08.501
- Mic check.

00:01:08.501 --> 00:01:09.335
- [Crowd] Mic check.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.170
- Can I try?

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.004
- Yes.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:12.872
- Okay. (grunts)

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:13.907
Mic check.

00:01:13.907 --> 00:01:14.841
- [Crowd] Mic check.

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:16.276
- The human microphone.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.911
- [Crowd] The human microphone.

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.345
- While well-intentioned.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.747
- [Crowd] While
well-intentioned.

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.382
- Is incredibly annoying.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:24.050 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Crowd] Is
incredibly annoying.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.585
- And embodies everything.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:27.087 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Crowd] And
embodies everything.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.621
- That people find frustrating.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:30.690 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Crowd] That people
find frustrating.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.158
- About movements like this.

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:33.793 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Crowd] About
movements like this.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.895
- What do you have
to say about CNN?

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:37.063
John Oliver.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.499
- They are goat (beeping), John.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:40.600
(laughing)

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.702
(cheering and clapping)

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:44.037
Pure and simple.

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.338
Pure and simple.

00:01:45.338 --> 00:01:48.041
An organization whose
sole desire and drive

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:50.743
is the pursuit and
seduction of goats.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.480
(laughing)

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.682 align:start size:81% position:19%
For the purpose
of (beeping) them.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:56.916
(laughing)

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:00.186 line:0%
Leroy, you want to
ban this word, Larry.

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.256 line:0%
Thank you.

00:02:03.256 --> 00:02:04.090
What he said.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.091
Is the word.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.093
(beeping)

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:09.863 align:start size:84% position:16%
Offensive to
everyone or just to.

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.064
(beeping)

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.599
No, no, no, no, I was
saying I was just,

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.833
I was just pointing.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:14.767
- I'm sorry.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.202
- Don't use that term, please.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:18.505
If black people enjoy doing it,

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:19.706
it must be stopped.

00:02:19.706 --> 00:02:21.207
- Right.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:22.709
- Well those times it's black
people who are overdoing it,

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.878
because now it's other
races that are doing it.

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:27.013
- Well they did it first.

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:28.648
- We did do it first, Leroy.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:30.850
You do know they don't
even have a teleprompter

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.820
at Fox News, it's just
a man jangling his keys

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.388
above the camera.

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:39.392
If they're stupid, John,
staggeringly, achingly,

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:44.864
almost inspiringly stupid.

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:48.001
- John, what is the status
right now of the NFL dispute?

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.337
- Two families both
alike in dignity,

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:55.408 align:start size:94% position:6%
one the referee, the other
the League of National

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:58.745
Football, is locked
in dispute ages old.

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:03.550 align:start size:84% position:16%
- John Oliver, you
have almost overnight,

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.051
improved exponentially.

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:05.985
(laughing)

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:07.020
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.288
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:09.122
No, no, no.

00:03:09.122 --> 00:03:09.956
No, no, no.

00:03:09.956 --> 00:03:11.424
No, strike over.

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:12.258
Strike over.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.326
Good news, everyone.

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:14.527
We've reached a settlement.

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:15.461
- No, no, no, no.

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.863
No settlement.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.364
You don't work here
anymore, Oliver.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:20.266
As far as I'm concerned, I
just traded up my '83 Toyota

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.467
for a Maserati.

00:03:21.467 --> 00:03:22.635
(cheering and clapping)

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.604
- Welcome to The Daily Show.

00:03:24.604 --> 00:03:25.905
I am John Oliver.

00:03:25.905 --> 00:03:27.207
Great show for you tonight.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.875 align:start size:84% position:16%
Fareed Zakaria
will be joining us.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:29.976
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:30.810
What are you doing?

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.644
What are you doing?

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:32.478
- What?

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:33.413
- What are you doing?

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.314
- You resigned your chair.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:35.715
- It's a (beeping) bit.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.250
- What?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.384
- We were doing a bit,
we were just talking

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.319
about that story.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.053
- Get out of my (beeping) chair.

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:41.054
(laughing)

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:41.888
- Sorry to miss the rest.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:42.722
Have a great show.

00:03:42.722 --> 00:03:43.690
I was kidding.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:44.624
I was kidding about.

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:45.358
You wanna get that seen too.

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:46.593
- Yes, I will.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:47.393
- That's a problem,
that's a problem.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:48.194
- Get that seen too.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:48.861
- That's a problem.

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:49.662
John Stewart.

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:50.463
- We'll be right back.
