We had a planar graph. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;About the planar graphs. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yup.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And then--so you said draw yourself a planar graph but we know the relation n-m+r=2.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I did actually draw a graph as well, in fact two. So it comes out to be 9.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Well we can draw a graph. We can basically make a grid of sorts.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.000
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; And I just moved the grid width. &amp;gt;&amp;gt; Yeah. I think it's fine to use the formula. &amp;gt;&amp;gt;Yeah.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You know, it gives you confidence that it's going to work

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
for all possible arrangements of graphs, so--

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Part of the amusement is when it works for every graph.
