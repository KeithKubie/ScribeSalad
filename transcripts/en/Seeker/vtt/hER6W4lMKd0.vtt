00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.650
The best thing about flying first class?

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.400
Getting drunk fast on free booze!

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.790
Actually that doesn’t happen, but other
things do happen to your body at altitude.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.700
Hey guys!

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.150
An Earthbound Amy with you on DNews today.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.669
That you get drunk faster at high altitudes
is the myth people love because, well, a lot

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:23.869
of humans like alcohol’s effects.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.339
The problem is, that doesn’t really happen.

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:29.970
Multiple studies have shown that regardless
of where you drink, your blood alcohol level

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.230
will be the same.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.500
If you feel loopy and weird after one drink
on a plane, it’s more likely your body is

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.640
reacting to the altitude itself.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.180
But before we leave the Earth, let’s start
with where many of us live: at sea level,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.190
or thereabouts.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.489
This is where humans have evolved to live
comfortably.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.150
With 1 bar of atmospheric pressure, the air
is thick and carries plenty oxygen molecules

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.000
to oxygenate our blood to keep our organs
healthy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.830
And because the pressure is greater outside
our bodies than inside, it's easier for our

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.280
lungs to fill, which helps keep our heart
rates and blood pressures at a good level.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.610
But as you rise off the planet, say climbing
a mountain, the air pressure steadily drops

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.820
off; it’s gravity that keeps the atmosphere
on the surface.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.020
As the atmosphere thins, there’s less oxygen
available for your body, and things start

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.090
to go bad pretty fast.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.920
Most of us will experience altitude at one
point in our lives flying in an airplane.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.590
Though a commercial jet flies at about 30,000
feet, the cabin is pressurized, just not to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.600
sea level.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.340
It mimics about 8,000 feet.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.410
It’s harder on your body, but not so hard
that you would really notice.

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.750
At 8,000 feet, the air pressure is lower so
there's less oxygen available.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.700
You might feel some symptoms of hypoxia, which
is the condition where too little oxygen reaches

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.700
the brain.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.470
Your respiration rate might increase, too,
as your body tries to get more oxygen out

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.619
of the thin air, which in turn increases your
heart rate as blood pumps furiously through

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.840
your body, focusing on vital organs.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.380
This could make you feel sick.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.200
An increase in blood to the brain can cause
headaches, while less blood to the digestive

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.450
tract can leave you feeling nauseous and kill
your appetite.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.009
But what if that cabin wasn’t pressurized
and you were exposed to the environment at

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.619
that jet's cruising altitude of about 30,000
feet?

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.789
Well, that’s only a little higher than Everest’s
peak, which is at 29,029 feet, so we know

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.069
what happens.

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.390
And it's really not good.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.090
Above 8,000 feet, humans become susceptible
to altitude sickness.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.910
At 18,000 feet, there's half as much oxygen
in the air as there is at sea level.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.260
The area above 25,000 feet is colourfully
referred to as the Death Zone, and at Everest’s

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.819
peak, the air is so thin it has only one-third
the oxygen concentration of air at sea level.

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.120
As the body tries to get more oxygen, your
respiration rate increases, as does your heart

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.819
rate to keep your organs from starving.

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.680
And even breathing is harder!

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.160
At 29,000 feet, the air pressure is so low
it's actually lower than the pressure in your

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.830
lungs, so you have to work for each breath.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.500
The stress on your body can lead to incredible
headaches, confusion, and complications.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.370
One is HAPE, which is swelling caused by excess
fluid trapped in the lungs.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.769
It starts with a cough, weakness, and shortness
of breath, and it can be fatal within 24 hours

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.970
but can be cured if you get more oxygen.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.950
Rarer but scarier is HACE, the same condition
affecting your brain that can seriously impair

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.130
your functionality and demands medical attention.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.740
So how do people ski in Colorado or climb
Everest?

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.780
Acclimatization!

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.159
It usually takes a few days to acclimatize
to a higher altitude, but your body will become

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.769
more efficient at taking deep breaths, producing
more red blood cells to carry haemoglobin,

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.670
the pressure in your pulmonary arteries increases
so your lungs become more efficient.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.880
And if you’re doing all that, getting drunk
faster should be the furthest thing from your mind!

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.240
And speaking of flying, do you guys like to pass the time on long flights binge-watching your favorite shows?

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.440
Now you can watch all kinds of great content on the new DiscoveryGo app. Including one of my all time favorites: When We Left Earth.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.520
You can check it out at the link below or download it from your app store.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:53.740
So we know why we might feel a little but light headed on airplanes, but how can we actually breathe inside a sky tube?

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.720
Trace has the answer to that question in this episode of DNews right here.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:20.560
