00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.700
It's actually pretty hard to pin
down

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.500
a scientific definition of tickling.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:21.760
And this is probably because it's a
phenomenon that involves

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.420
a range of sensory and neurological
elements.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.920
Because of this the evolutionary significance of tickling is also unclear.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.680
In other words - why do we
feel ticklish?

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.280
Some suggest that tickling is socially significant

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.000
promoting bonding between us and our friends.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.740
Others think that is serves as an alarm system to alert us

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.270
to the feeling of something crawling on our skin.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.140
Which only becomes funny once we realise
that the sensations are coming from

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.289
another human being.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.840
But have you ever tried to tickle
your self?

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.460
It just doesn't work, does it?

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:04.740
But why?

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.920
Well, here we have a person.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.900
Hello person.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.400
A'right?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.140
Inside this person is a human brain.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.610
And inside the brain there is an area called the cerebellum

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.670
which can make predictions as to how
sensations on your skin will feel

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.290
caused by your own movements.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.980
So when you go to tickle yourself...

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.320
Your brain already has a pretty good idea of 
where that sensation will occur

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.630
and therefore how it'll feel.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.910
So it suppresses the tickle response.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.460
Interestingly, scientists have been able to demonstrate
decreased activity

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.620
in the areas of the brain associated
with the tickle response

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.960
when people attempt to tickle
themselves.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.920
So the tickly feelings of someone else tickling you...

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.220
Come from the fact that your brain isn't
able to make predictions as to how the

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.090
sensations will feel on your skin

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.150
and therefore can't suppress the tickle
response which serves to alert you

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.710
to the ticklers presence.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.740
Now the best part about this is that this information

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.060
Can help you to disarm a potential tickler!

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.280
The next time someone attempts to
tickle you simply place your hands

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.340
on top of theirs.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.700
This will allow your brain to better
predict the sensations of their hands

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.239
and therefore suppress and ultimately
protect you from

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:28.319
the tickle response.
