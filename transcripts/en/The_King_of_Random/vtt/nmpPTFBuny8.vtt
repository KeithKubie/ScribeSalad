00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
[Captions by Y Translator]
Kinetic sand is
a weird combination

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:05.660
of fine grit colored sand
and a rubberized polymer.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.540
We wanted to see what happens

00:00:06.545 --> 00:00:08.800
if you heat it up
in a variety of ways.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.600
Can you burn it?

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.400
Can you melt it?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.100
What happens if you
put it in a microwave?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.140
[Music]

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.960
We've done some fun experiments
with kinetic sand in the past

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.880
including casting metal into it
in a few different ways.

00:00:24.894 --> 00:00:26.061
And now we want to see

00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:28.450
what happens if we apply
heat really directly.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:30.031
We've got five different methods

00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:32.650
that we're gonna use to apply
heat to our kinetic sand

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.680
and see what it does.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.840
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:34.849 --> 00:00:36.980
We've got some colors
of kinetic sand,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.300
and we're going to try applying
heat to them in a few different ways.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.660
We're gonna try
our backyard foundry,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.080
we'll try our arc furnace,

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.620
we'll see what happens
if you boil kinetic sand,

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.560
microwave kinetic sand
and hit it with a blowtorch.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.200
First off, let's take some sand,
put in a crucible,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.665
and get it going in our backyard foundry.

00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:55.831
Will the sand burn?

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.280
Will the sand actually melt?

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.120
Can we turn this into glass?

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.240
Let's find out.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:32.260
[Music]

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.980
Sand in our crucible is,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.100
I think it's actually
on fire now.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.120
Fair bit of flame coming up out
of the crucible at this point.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.920
It's, it's kind of fun

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.640
cause it's got
like swirling smoke.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.642
Well, then like the fire
gets into two.

00:01:45.642 --> 00:01:46.442
We've almost got

00:01:46.442 --> 00:01:48.872
a little bit of fire tornado
coming up out of here.

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:57.197
Okay, we've got a couple
of multicolored sea creatures

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.140
here just sitting
on a piece of fire brick.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.180
We're gonna see what happens

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.560
if we go for a really
direct approach with our heat.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.460
We're gonna just hit him
with a blowtorch and see

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.620
what happens to him.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.300
We've got a blowtorch
and our little sand creatures.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.140
Wow!

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.520
As soon as the heat
gets on that,

00:02:12.526 --> 00:02:15.200
it's like the pink
changes to purple.

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.527
And it actually goes
away a little bit

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:21.800
when it cools down.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.280
So once we've got gray,

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.140
I don't think there's
any coming back from that.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.240
I think it's pretty
much ruined at that point.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.600
Burned all the color
and the polymer out of it.

00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:40.182
Let's keep this going.

00:02:40.182 --> 00:02:51.360
[Music]

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.050
Oh, That arm is gone,
that arm is gone.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.814
Starfish are supposed
to be able to regrow arms,

00:02:56.814 --> 00:02:58.752
but this might be
too much for it.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:06.440
[Music]

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.780
So here's the sand
that got the most heat

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.392
on it and it's just
completely a powder.

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:14.001
Over here some sand,

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:16.990
they get burned, but it's
also still cohesive.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.300
It's staying together
a little bit.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.500
Then in the very middle,

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.872
there's the part
that still have their color.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:27.482
So the color goes first and then
the ability to hold together,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.700
and then it's just powder.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:41.620
[Music]

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:42.180
All right.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.680
So we've got a glowing
orange crucible

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.150
full of what appears to just be
really hot sand at the moment.

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.120
Don't think we got much
more results from that

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.900
although, a little bit on the side,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.040
looks like maybe it vitrified.

00:03:58.042 --> 00:04:00.970
We've melted glass
in this same crucible before,

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.534
so it's hard to know what
exactly it is we're looking at.

00:04:04.534 --> 00:04:06.762
See if we can pour
some of this out.

00:04:06.762 --> 00:04:12.060
[Music]

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.640
Oh, that's cool,
glowing orange glass powder.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:27.400
[Music]

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.540
Some glass with embedded
sand right here,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.180
some very fine-grain sand too,

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.000
much more so
than playground sand

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.420
or something like that.

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.680
[Music]

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.980
Yi-hi-hi, It works just right.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.080
[Music]

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.640
This is cool.

00:04:49.649 --> 00:04:51.835
So I'm just dripping
water onto our sand

00:04:51.835 --> 00:04:53.600
and our sand is extremely hot.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.760
So as the water gets poured in,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.740
it seeps down past the sand,

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.700
but then it keeps getting
heated up and boiling away.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.740
So it's just bubbling

00:05:01.744 --> 00:05:04.000
underneath the super hot sand.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.180
Overall though, I would say there is
like none of the polymer left.

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.593
This is just sand at this point.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.260
I'm gonna take
our little castle mould

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.600
and fill it with some
of our blue and green sand

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.880
and then we're going
to try putting it in a microwave,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.900
and see if that does anything to it.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:39.800
[Music]

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.260
Still put a little longer.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:54.320
[Music]

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.120
The plate that this is sitting
on is now hot enough

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.020
that it's uncomfortable to touch
but the sand itself...

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.940
[Music]

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.160
Not tasting, I'm just feeling it
on something more sensitive.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.060
It's warm.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:14.380
It's not hot.

00:06:15.392 --> 00:06:17.100
Really doesn't seem
to heat up much

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.300
like it's definitely
much warm on the bottom.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.500
I think most of the heat

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.795
that it's experiencing,
is coming up through the plate

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.860
at the bottom and into the sand,

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.625
but the microwave

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:29.558
doesn't seem to affect
the sand very much at all.

00:06:29.558 --> 00:06:30.719
Let's go for broke.

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:33.652
Just gonna put it in
for three, four more minutes.

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:40.240
[Music]

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.380
Once again,
the bottom is fairly warm,

00:06:42.381 --> 00:06:44.450
but that is mostly
from the plate,

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:45.792
which is very hot.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.640
And the top of a sand
is just kind of normal.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.200
I've got a small pot
of boiling water

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.620
and now let's see what happens
if we boil a little sand castle.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:59.540
[Music]

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.600
Here it goes.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:08.720
[Music]

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:11.120
Don't see a lot going on
with our sand that's

00:07:11.123 --> 00:07:12.952
in our boiling water either.

00:07:13.112 --> 00:07:14.162
It may have begun

00:07:14.162 --> 00:07:17.577
to puddle just a little bit lose
a tiny bit of definition,

00:07:17.577 --> 00:07:18.476
but you can see

00:07:18.476 --> 00:07:21.592
that a lot of the definition is
actually still there.

00:07:21.652 --> 00:07:23.739
All the little tiny stair steps,

00:07:23.739 --> 00:07:27.187
that little crenellations
on the top of the towers are

00:07:27.187 --> 00:07:28.492
still quite visible.

00:07:32.222 --> 00:07:35.973
It appears that on the inside,
the water hasn't made it through.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.980
So this stuff I think is
kind of waterproof.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.032
Outside is getting boiled

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.280
but inside is not
really changing much.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.400
Just let it run
for a few more minutes.

00:07:48.775 --> 00:07:51.237
You have started
to see a result.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.250
During enough time, in the water.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:58.952
I did add some more water this
had boiled quite low.

00:07:58.952 --> 00:08:05.760
[Music]

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.860
Let's pour off the water
and see how this stuff is.

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:13.220
[Music]

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.660
The water is slightly
tinted green.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:31.240
[Music]

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.917
Little hard to tell,
but it doesn't feel

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:34.917
like it's acting the same.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:46.020
[Music]

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.480
This is acting a lot more
like wet sand,

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.434
and a lot less like kinetic sand.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.460
I may have ruined it.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.220
Let's do a side
by side comparison.

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:58.020
Here's our kinetic sand unheated,

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:02.200
and our boiled kinetic sand.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:07.480
[Music]

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.280
Not even the same color
anymore, but close.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.800
This is yellower.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.820
So we definitely had to boil it
for a little while

00:09:13.832 --> 00:09:15.383
before we had an effect.

00:09:15.383 --> 00:09:15.900
At first,

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.660
It didn't seem to change much
but after about 10 minutes,

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:22.340
it seems to have completely
ruined the effect.

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.700
We've tried some things

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:25.685
that heat it up
our sand a fair amount,

00:09:25.685 --> 00:09:29.050
but now we're going to try when
that heats it up a lot more.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:31.050
We're going to use
our arc furnace

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.720
and see what happens.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.356
Castle being made
of not just built on sand

00:09:35.356 --> 00:09:39.426
but literally being made of sand
has collapsed a little bit

00:09:39.426 --> 00:09:41.040
into our heart furnace.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:41.882
That's okay.

00:09:41.882 --> 00:10:14.240
[Music]

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.920
That right there is melted sand.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:23.620
So it very quickly ruins
the effect of the kinetic sand

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.763
and see like,

00:10:24.763 --> 00:10:27.830
look at this digging down
into it still burns,

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:28.648
still burns.

00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:32.342
So that got hot enough to ruin
our kinetic sand quickly

00:10:32.482 --> 00:10:34.050
and our one little spot

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.652
where we had all
of our heat concentrated,

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.320
we got it to melt and turn it
into a crude form of glass.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.015
Guys, that's it for today,
but the fun doesn't end here.

00:10:43.015 --> 00:10:44.389
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:46.936
That box up at the top will take
you directly to our last video.

00:10:46.936 --> 00:10:48.006
You should go check that out.

00:10:48.006 --> 00:10:49.002
The other box will show you

00:10:49.002 --> 00:10:50.787
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next

00:10:50.787 --> 00:10:52.277
and if you hit this bomb
in the middle,

00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:53.460
you'll be subscribed to our channel.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.060
and that way
you'll never miss a video.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.318
Don't forget to ring that bell

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.500
and we will see you
in the next one.

00:10:57.500 --> 00:10:58.500
Talk to you then.
