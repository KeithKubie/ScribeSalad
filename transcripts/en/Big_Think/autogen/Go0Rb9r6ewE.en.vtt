00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.860
on the other side of that so it's an
interesting and interesting evolutionary

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
interesting and interesting evolutionary
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.920

it's a very different environment and
 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.809
it's a very different environment and
the you know the search for seed money

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819
the you know the search for seed money
 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.000

really put in the sweat equity that's

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000
really put in the sweat equity that's
 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.449

entrepreneurial venture so I think and
you know that's the upside of it that

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069
you know that's the upside of it that
 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.199
you know that's the upside of it that
that there there's more talent available

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209
that there there's more talent available
 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.240

kinds of those kinds of risks and they
 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.240
kinds of those kinds of risks and they
see the the risk-reward trade off as

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250
see the the risk-reward trade off as
 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.610
see the the risk-reward trade off as
being a good one at this point in time

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620
being a good one at this point in time
 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.250
being a good one at this point in time
better than it would be when the

as a nation and and they are in some
sense very underdeveloped sectors that

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940
sense very underdeveloped sectors that
 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.279
sense very underdeveloped sectors that
are that that haven't been invested in

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289
are that that haven't been invested in
 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.350

alternative energy innovation so I think

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570
alternative energy innovation so I think
 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.629
alternative energy innovation so I think
we're going to see some some very

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639
we're going to see some some very
 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:11.960
we're going to see some some very
exciting developments in those in those

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970

you know now there's probably a tendency
to be a bit too short-sighted about the
