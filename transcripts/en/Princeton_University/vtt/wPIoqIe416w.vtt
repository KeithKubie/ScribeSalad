00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.210
AKIL WORD-DANIELS:
Light's all around us.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.150
So you see how have
lights in LED form,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.010
you have lights shining
from the ceiling,

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.510
you have lights
coming from the sun.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.980
A laser's just the
purest form of light.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.450
It's just something
majestic about a laser that

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.170
just drives me to
it and makes me

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.610
want to create them, and use
them, and just play around

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.550
with them.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.090
My name is Akil
Word-Daniels, and I'm

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.510
an electrical
engineering graduate

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.270
student working on my Ph.D.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.140
Not to mention, these are
pretty robust actually.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.260
These samples came
out very good.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.800
In my opinion,
electrical engineering

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.470
is one of the broadest fields
that you could possibly do.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.840
You can go to the extreme
sides of computer science

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.300
and work on the
toughest algorithms --

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.770
maybe for error correction
and quantum computing --

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.980
or you could do optical
coherence tomography for health

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.500
sensing, or you can go all
the way to the physics side

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.440
and look at single spins of
electrons using magnets to work

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.620
with quantum information.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.240
CLAIRE GMACHL: Do
you know why it's not

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.650
like a smooth function?

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.520
AKIL WORD-DANIELS:
So that, I think,

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.900
is because the way functions
themselves also overlap other --

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:00.730
CLAIRE GMACHL: Good.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:01.690
AKIL WORD-DANIELS:
-- others varies as well.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.750
And I think that's where some
of these bumps are coming from.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.150
I specifically work with
quantum cascade lasers.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.780
What my job is, is to make sure
that I could either optimize

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.620
how quantum cascade laser
works or maybe even transfer it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.410
into a new material system.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.280
Like if you could put
a quantum cascade laser

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.330
into like a silicon
system -- something

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.740
that we use an all
microelectronics -- then

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.480
you could get cheap,
affordable systems that you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.600
can use on your cell phone.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.930
Academics are only
half the story.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.300
I mean, there's
only so much time

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.810
that you can put into your
research in the science.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.000
But in order to be a
well-rounded person,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.810
you have to get
away from the lab.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.370
You have to go out and get
involved in different student

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.870
groups.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:46.380
You have to get out,
exercise your body.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.540
It's important that you
exercise things other than just

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:50.970
your scientific mindset.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.560
I wanna say you should get out,
play soccer, get out, become

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.350
part of organizations,
lead organizations.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.860
My favorite thing to do,
actually, in my off time,

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.940
by far, is softball.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.000
I used to play
baseball in college.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.100
And so every summer we
have a softball league

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.300
where the departments
go against each other.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.280
And we bring in things like the
treasury department or maybe

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.240
the facilities, and we all
have these massive

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.230
free-for-alls in softball.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.650
And it's just so much
bonding and laughing and just

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.240
having a whole bunch of fun
hitting baseballs and softballs

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.950
and just playing a
whole bunch of sports.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.020
After Princeton, by far, I want
to be an advocate for science --

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.010
specifically for
science policies,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.560
how they are implemented, and
basically influence communities

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.540
that you have a non-ideal
environment for science

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.700
education.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.400
I don't feel like science
is really promoted enough

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.940
and I feel like,
even as researchers,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.380
sometimes we don't go out and
bring people into the science

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.450
community, as well.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.160
Every day, I wake up and
I try to think about,

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.860
how can I improve
my communities?

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.080
It's something that's a
deep-seated passion for me.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.110
And my research training here is
just setting me up for success

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.740
in that sense.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.760
In my opinion,
scientific research --

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.900
the fundamentals
of it -- I think is

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.640
a gateway on solving all of
the problems in the world.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.990
