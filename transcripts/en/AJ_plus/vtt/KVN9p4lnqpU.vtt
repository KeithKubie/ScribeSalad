00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.380
This attack that took place in the
fairly small city in Christchurch,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.780
New Zealand, was one with
massive ramifications.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.220
This is part of an increasingly global
phenomenon of white nationalist,

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.580
white supremacist violence.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.180
My name is Kanishk Tharoor.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.860
I am an author and a broadcaster

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.460
and I write quite a bit about 
multiculturalism and globalization.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.660
The attacker in Christchurch inscribed
on his gun the name of

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.580
an Italian militant who shot six
African men in Italy in 2017.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.700
He also inscribed the name
of the Québécois man

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.540
who went into a mosque in 2017

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.460
and killed six worshippers there.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.500
He was consciously enacting his part
in what he sees as a global struggle.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.100
The Christchurch killer simply described
Muslims and immigrants as "invaders."

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.580
And so we get this immediate
language of invasion, of opposition,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.140
of clash and war almost.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.860
You see echoes of that in the way the
man who committed the attack

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.180
on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.700
would refer to immigrants as "invaders." 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.780
He was particularly angry with the HIAS activists
in the synagogue 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.940
because they were helping settle refugees.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.180
If you look at attacks on places of worship
just in the United States

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.660
in the last seven years,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.980
you've had a white nationalist attack
on a Sikh Gurdwara in Wisconsin,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.380
on a predominantly Black
church in Charleston,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.300
on a synagogue in Pennsylvania.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.860
This is an ideology and a tendency in
American life and American society

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.780
that goes beyond just hatred of Muslims.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.820
These white nationalist ideas are available freely

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.260
in the sort of far-right and right-wing media landscape.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.500
Ideas like the "white genocide"

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.380
or the "great replacement theory" come out of

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.420
the mouths of mainstream politicians.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.300
People like Steve King,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.980
the congressman in Iowa who said
famously that

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:12.980
"We cannot restore our civilization with other people's babies."

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.780
A chilling statement for any American politician to make.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.020
And in terms of what it suggests about
the way he understands

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.300
culture and citizenship and belonging.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.300
But likewise, you have a Fox News anchor

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.220
like Laura Ingraham saying that

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.980
"The America we know and love no longer exists ... "

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.620
"The America that we know and
love doesn't exist anymore.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.740
Massive demographic changes have been
foisted upon the American people

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.940
and they are changes that none of us ever
voted for. And most of us don't like."

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.260
Now, look at that language:

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.300
"Massive demographic changes have been
foisted upon the American people."

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.900
Not only is that untrue,

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.180
but what it's suggesting to its audience
very deliberately is that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.500
what they imagine as great demographic
change is being done to them.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.500
And this borrows completely from the way
white nationalists also frame the issue

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.820
of immigration, the issue of
demographic change in their societies.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.100
It's not surprising that
somebody like David Duke,

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100
the former head of the KKK,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.700
was quick to congratulate Laura Ingraham
and say that what he had heard her say

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.460
on the TV was "the most important and
truthful monologue

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.820
he'd heard in American media."

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.420
The president of the United States
happily uses the same rhetoric.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.660
Just a matter of hours after
the Christchurch attack,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.820
he was sitting in the Oval Office,

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.620
happily decrying what he called the "invasion"

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.660
of his country by Latin American immigrants.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.220
"People hate the word 'invasion,'
but that's what it is.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.420
It's an invasion of drugs and criminals.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.660
And in some cases, you have killers coming
in and murderers coming in

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.140
and we're not going to allow that to happen."

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.300
It's galling to see that language also
come out

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.060
of the most powerful office in the world.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.340
I think a lot of white nationalist
terrorists see in Trump a figure

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.500
who vindicates for them 
their rise on the world stage.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.700
Until we as people who live in ostensibly
liberal societies can stress

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.260
that it's important to find solidarity
in our differences,

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.100
bigotry of this kind is
only going to get stronger.
