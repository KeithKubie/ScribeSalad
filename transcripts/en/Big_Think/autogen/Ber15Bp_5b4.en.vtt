I think people are going to because

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
I think people are going to because
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.530
I think people are going to because
there's so much more information and

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540
there's so much more information and
 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.290
there's so much more information and
because there is so much more access

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300
because there is so much more access
 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.990
because there is so much more access
everybody's starting to get this a DD

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000
everybody's starting to get this a DD
 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.640
everybody's starting to get this a DD
thing you know attention spans are

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
thing you know attention spans are
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.760
thing you know attention spans are
getting much shorter and and I think

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:25.770
getting much shorter and and I think
 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.070
getting much shorter and and I think
it's it requires of the individual and a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080
it's it requires of the individual and a
 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.299
it's it requires of the individual and a
sort of a talent and the skill to filter

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309
sort of a talent and the skill to filter
 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.310
sort of a talent and the skill to filter
to really with all the information that

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320
to really with all the information that
 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.729
to really with all the information that
you see to just very quickly understand

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739
you see to just very quickly understand
 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.380
you see to just very quickly understand
and grasp whether this information is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390
and grasp whether this information is
 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.580
and grasp whether this information is
relevant for you or not and so I think I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
relevant for you or not and so I think I
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.800
relevant for you or not and so I think I
think that's probably one of one of one

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810
think that's probably one of one of one
 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.300
think that's probably one of one of one
of the changes because I mean everything

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.310
of the changes because I mean everything
 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.860
of the changes because I mean everything
is getting small it's getting more

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870
is getting small it's getting more
 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.340
is getting small it's getting more
mobile that's getting more real-time so

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350
mobile that's getting more real-time so
 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.709
mobile that's getting more real-time so
so it just really depends on what people

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719
so it just really depends on what people
 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.160
so it just really depends on what people
make of the opportunity
