00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:07.390
VINIT MODI: We started exploring
how to improve the Android

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.690
camera experience and
discovered that over 70%

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.350
of all camera usage occurs
on developer-made apps

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:15.817
versus the native camera.

00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:17.650
So we heard from many
developers that they'd

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.260
like to make Android
camera development easy,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.020
like managing the
Android device variation.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.120
And they're craving
access to the latest

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.710
features like night mode.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.650
So we built CameraX, a
Jetpack support library

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.229
that makes development
incredibly simple

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:34.940
and enables new features
with just two lines of code.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.850
CameraX just works
across many devices.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.150
You don't have to do
device-specific testing.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.500
Google takes care of
that on your behalf.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.370
We made a significant investment
into an automated camera test

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.500
lab that does
basic functionality

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.170
testing like rotation,
orientation, taking

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.620
a picture, et cetera.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.800
This significantly
reduces the test burden

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.370
the developers have today.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.287
LOUIS CHEN: One of the
features that we really

00:00:57.287 --> 00:00:59.700
like in CameraX is the
extension capability.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.260
So users will be able to take
very high dynamically ranged

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.030
images.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.350
The [INAUDIBLE] is very highly
wanted by our user base.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.070
So we are creating a series of
different [INAUDIBLE] effects

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.700
that can be also implemented on
top of the CameraX extension.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.610
TAO LI: We have been
paying close attention

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.160
to new technologies and APIs.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.270
CameraX has been a bridge
through in camera API for us.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.450
RUI MA: It has reduced our
core camera code by 2/3,

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.810
and greatly improved the
efficiency of new product

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.590
developments.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.990
VINIT MODI: CameraX is
backwards-compatible to Android

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.190
L or API 21, and works
seamlessly with Kotlin.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.520
CameraX enables developers
to get the same features

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.170
as the native camera.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.820
We've been working
with many developers

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.400
from around the world,
and we're excited for you

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.990
to try out this new API.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.940
