00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:01.859
Vsauce!

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:02.859
Kevin here.

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:06.120
But in my head where am I?

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.299
I think my consciousness is me.

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:14.679
And it feels like a bead, floating and shifting
inside my head.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.940
When I wake up - the bead appears.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.790
Centered, rested, ready.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.790
Time to go.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:21.790
Let the dog out.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:22.790
Brush teeth.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.890
My limbic cortex tells me it’s time to eat.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.670
So I make breakfast.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.680
The bead hovers behind the back of my eyes.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680
Energy drink.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.680
Focus.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.680
Computer.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.500
The bead locks against the front of my skull.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.810
My prefrontal cortex, proportionally larger
in humans than any animal in the world is

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.750
considering my future.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.460
Work hard today, prepare for tomorrow.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.150
The bead is pressing against the front of
my head like it's determined to burst through.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.300
There are no distractions.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.660
This is my maximum attention.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.220
I am in the moment.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.710
I am here.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.180
Until I’m not.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.829
Distraction sinks in.

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:01.829
Check Twitter.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:02.829
Check Facebook.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.829
Check clock.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.510
The day is getting away.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.390
I have to go to the store.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.040
An activity that seems to cause the bead to
drift further and further back.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.470
To disconnect.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.810
Just get the stuff on the list.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.640
Avoid eye contact.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.520
I recede further back into the recesses of
my mind.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.619
Almost mindless.

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.310
It’s like my eyes become windows and I’m
peering through them at a great distance.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.390
Seeing people.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.439
Wondering who they are?

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.850
What impossibly complex and somehow remarkably
simple journey are they on?

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.370
What’s the bead in their head doing right
now?

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.240
What’s the bead in your head doing right
now?

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.720
I return home.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.259
It’s time for sleep.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.150
A time where I lose control of the bead and
it goes somewhere without me.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.390
Storing, organizing and recounting the events
of the day.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.670
And then before I know it…

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.670
I awake.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.670
Vsauce!

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.670
Kevin here.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.840
But where am I?

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.950
And as always - thanks for watching.
