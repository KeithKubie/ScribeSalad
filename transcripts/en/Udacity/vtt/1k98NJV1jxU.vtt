00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.397
&gt;&gt; I believe I did. So is the first frog dead or alive? I can't imagine you

00:00:06.397 --> 00:00:10.420
eating a frog and the frog staying alive, so I'm going to say the frog is dead.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.340
Where is the frog if you ate it? It's probably in your stomach.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.340
And are you happy or sad? I don't know if you like to eat frogs, but

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.520
I'm going to assume that you do. So I'm going to assume that you are happy.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.730
Thank you, David. So David just did common sense reasoning.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.690
There was nothing in this input which said whether the frog was dead or alive.

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.060
There was nothing in the sentence which said Ashok was happy or sad. But David

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.470
made sensible inferences. I will discuss a lot more about common sense reasoning

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.950
a little bit later. For now, I want to talk about the knowledge representation

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.150
called Frames that will allow us to make some inferences of this kind.
