that's a real legitimate worry but we're

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500
that's a real legitimate worry but we're
 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.760
that's a real legitimate worry but we're
far away away from that and i think that

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770
far away away from that and i think that
 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.080
far away away from that and i think that
the leadership within the Democratic

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090
the leadership within the Democratic
 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.299
the leadership within the Democratic
Party understands that as well and I

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
Party understands that as well and I
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.209
Party understands that as well and I
have faith that the that the right will

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219
have faith that the that the right will
 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.850
have faith that the that the right will
prevail and I also AM think on a part of

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860
prevail and I also AM think on a part of
 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.010
prevail and I also AM think on a part of
the process now that I could at least

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
the process now that I could at least
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.450
the process now that I could at least
let my voice be heard as we as we

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
let my voice be heard as we as we
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.329
let my voice be heard as we as we
hopefully go to that end
