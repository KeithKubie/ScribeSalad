00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:09.309
The One Man Riot Squad

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.860
Serving with the NYPD between 1923 and 1947,
for over two decades John “Johnny” Broderick

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.460
struck fear into the hearts of New York’s
deadliest criminals working as a no-nonsense

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.660
detective who wasn’t afraid to throw hands
and kick bad guys through windows (literally).

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.980
Over his long and controversial career, Broderick
earned over half a dozen medals for valor,

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.290
a nod from the president of the United States
and the begrudging respect of the criminal

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.440
underworld who, when they weren’t referring
to him by various expletives, referred to

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.870
him as “the one man riot squad”.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.559
Born in 1896 in the Gashouse District of Manhattan,
New York, Broderick had a hard, unforgiving

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.760
early life, quitting school at just age 12
when his father died so that he could drive

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.530
trucks to earn money for his family.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.629
When WW1 rolled around, Broderick dutifully
enlisted in the Navy and took part in his

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.240
only known official pugilistic bout, ironically
enough given his later reputation, being summarily

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.899
knocked out in the first round by an unknown
seaman.

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.330
At the close of the WW1, Broderick used the
connections he’d made driving coal trucks

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:12.690
to secure a job in the Teamsters union, where
he eventually came to the attention of labor

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.440
leader, Samuel Gompers.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.550
Gompers hired the 5 foot 10 inch, 170 pound
Broderick to serve as his personal bodyguard

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.800
after hearing stories about Broderick’s
skills with his fists.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.060
Broderick grew tired of being a bodyguard
and in 1922 he applied to become a New York

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.150
City fireman, passing the physical exam with
flying colors.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.970
However, he soon became disillusioned with
the nature of the work which he described

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.280
as “boring”.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.440
Somewhat ironically, after quitting the fire
department and enlisting as a police officer

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.020
in 1923, the first thing Broderick did was
rescue two children from a burning building

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.170
hours into his first shift.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.420
Heroics like these saw Broderick promoted
from beat cop to detective third grade just

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.800
three months after joining the NYPD.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.410
This was an impressive, almost unheard of
feat that Broderick topped not long after

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:00.060
by being promoted again, and then the year
after that was promoted a final time to detective

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.610
first grade in 1926.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.209
To put this in perspective, in just three
years Broderick earned three promotions that

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:09.780
often took regular officers their entire career
to achieve.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.820
The New York Herald Tribune noted that his
rapid rise must have been the result of “extraordinary

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.360
luck or influence or both”.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.780
While rumors of backroom deals and connections
from his time as a union man dogged Broderick’s

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.320
meteoric rise through the ranks of the NYPD,
stories of his penchant for doling out justice

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.660
with his fists in an era when criminals often
openly skirted the law earned him a great

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.550
deal of goodwill with the public and his fellow
officers.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.800
The newspapers particularly ate up Broderick’s
exploits, gleefully reported stories about

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.630
him attacking various criminals just because
he could, whether he caught them doing anything

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:41.630
wrong or not.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.410
For example, Broderick became infamous for
his habit of slapping known criminals upside

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.640
the head with a rolled up newspaper.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.250
If that doesn’t sound so bad, it should
be noted that the newspapers in question generally

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.470
had an iron bar hidden inside, allowing him
to beat suspects unconscious in broad daylight,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.250
but later still able to claim in court that
he had only given them a playful whack with

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.450
a newspaper.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.080
Broderick was seemingly unafraid of even the
most fearsome gangsters and was known to respond

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.670
to the threats on his life by driving over
to the gangster who made the threat’s house

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.300
and attacking him.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.610
The most famous occasion of this was when
high-profile mobster Legs Diamond was drinking

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.200
one night with his cohorts and, after calling
Broderick various uncouth names, stated he

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.210
was going to “take Broderick for a ride
tonight”.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:28.180
Diamond and crew then began to hunt for Broderick
to make good on the promise.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.330
Other lowlifes who heard about it joined the
entourage, eager to see the spectacle.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.430
Unfortunately for Diamond, Broderick also
heard about it and began hunting Diamond in

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.430
turn.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.750
Newspapers later reported that soon enough
Broderick found him at the corner of 46th

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.750
and Broadway.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.420
Broderick approached Diamond and co.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.490
stating, “I understand you are looking to
take me for a ride”.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.930
At this point, Diamond’s bodyguard fled,
leaving Diamond to face Broderick alone.

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.680
With his wingman out of the picture and a
whole crowd of underworld types looking on,

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.570
Diamond tried to play the whole thing off,
reportedly stating, “Ah, listen Johnny,

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.209
can’t you take a joke?”

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.900
It was at this point that Broderick punched
him in the face and then unceremoniously dumped

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.930
him headfirst into a nearby garbage can.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.200
With so many criminals witnessing the mob-boss
humiliated, and Diamond’s subsequent fall

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.380
from underworld influence, the mayor of New
York, Jimmy Walker, credited this incident

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.720
as ending Diamond’s criminal career: “Broderick
as good as killed Diamond with that garbage

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720
can stunt.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.320
It finished him as a leader.”

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.290
(Afterwards Diamond found himself the victim
of several assassination attempts, often ending

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.250
up in the hospital with bullet wounds.

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.500
After an incident in late 1931, while Diamond
was in the hospital, police raided his house

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.070
and found hard evidence he’d been bootlegging.

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.640
He was subsequently given a four year prison
sentence, but appealed the ruling and was

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.970
let walk free.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.230
This didn’t work out for him.

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.230
Yet another assassination attempt was carried
out, this time successfully as they put the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.940
bullets through his brain rather than his
body in December of 1931.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.960
Rumor had it that Democratic Party Chairman
Dan O’Connell was behind the hit and that

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.320
it was the police who carried it out.)

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.180
Such brazen tactics became Broderick’s calling
card.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:05.120
For instance, during one of his more widely
reported exploits, in 1931 Broderick boldly

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.280
faced down Two Gun Crowley who had been trapped
by several hundred policemen in an apartment.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.300
A firefight soon erupted between the police
and Crowley.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.500
When Broderick arrived, with a crowd that
newspapers reported swelled to nearly 15,000

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.650
looking on, he simply strolled across the
street with no cover and knocked on the door,

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.360
reportedly with the following exchange,

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.420
Broderick: Hey, they got you, Crowley.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.900
Why don’t you give up?

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.570
Crowley: You know me good enough, Johnny.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.270
You know the only way I’ll come out of here
is shootin’

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.740
Broderick: Aw you’re nutty, Tell you what
I’ll do: I’ll go around the corner for

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.740
two hours.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.540
If you ain’t out by then I’ll come in
and get you.

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.590
Later, after firing an estimated 700 rounds
at the building and lobbing tear gas in, Broderick

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.590
and co.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.360
ran back to the door and knocked it down.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.699
They found an injured Crowley (shot four times)
inside.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:52.960
He pointed his gun at Broderick, but rather
than try to get out of the line of fire, Broderick

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.490
simply approached stating, “Drop that gun,
y’runt, and keep your hands in the air”.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.030
When he got close enough, he punched the injured
Crowley in the face and disarmed him.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.740
Another of his widely reported exploits occurred
five years previous, in November of 1926,

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.880
when he put an end to a standoff at The Tombs
prison in Manhattan.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.990
In an attempted prison break, three prisoners,
Hymie Amberg, Bobbie Berg, and Red McKenna,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.770
killed a guard and the warden and ended up
trapped behind a coal pile.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.330
When Broderick arrived, rather than duck for
cover as the rest of the police were doing,

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:26.900
he grabbed a metal garbage can lid as a shield
and sprinted towards the shooting criminals.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:30.870
From here, the news report that came out directly
after the event stated the criminals in question

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:35.330
saw it was Broderick coming at them and simply
committed suicide instead of face him…

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.040
However, the truth seems to be that once Broderick
got to them and started firing at close range,

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.970
they fled the coal pile and, now without cover,
were gunned down by the police.

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.840
Yet another tale of this John McClane style,
Hollywood-esque policeman reported in the

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.919
news was an instance where he did a very un-Hollywood
thing that resulted in a car containing five

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:55.940
armed gangsters flipping over during a high
speed chase.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:56.940
How?

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.980
He leaned out of a police car travelling at
high-speed and, instead of aiming at the occupants

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.840
as is generally the moronic strategy in movies,
he simply shot out one of the tires.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.870
Broderick’s exploits didn’t go unnoticed
by celebrities who began requesting Broderick’s

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:12.570
services as a bodyguard when they visited
New York.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:16.820
This culminated in Broderick being personally
asked by President Franklin Roosevelt to lead

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.860
his protection detail when he attended the
1936 World Series.

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.650
Similar requests were made by the Queen of
Romania and the King of Belgium when they

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:25.650
were in town.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.180
Despite his fearsome reputation, somewhat
questionable crime fighting tactics, and how

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:33.750
famous Broderick was nationwide at the time,
Broderick was known to be a generally humble,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.729
down to earth guy when he wasn’t on the
job.

00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:39.509
He almost never talked to the press about
any of his heroic acts, except through official

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:40.509
police reports.

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:44.330
He also refrained wholly from smoking and
drinking and typically spent his free time

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:46.860
at home with his wife or exercising at the
gym.

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:50.400
This not drinking or smoking bit was an important
one to him, as told by one of his friends,

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.650
Toots Shor, who owned a pub in town.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.990
One night Shor claimed he called Broderick
up as actor Edward G. Robinson was in his

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.850
pub and wanted to meet Broderick in person.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:02.320
You see, Robinson had played Broderick in
the 1936 movie Bullets or Ballots.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.780
Far from being excited to meet the actor,
Shor stated Broderick told him, “Tell him

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.780
I don’t want to meet him.

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:09.910
Tell him I oughta flatten him.”

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:11.830
Confused, Shor responded, “What’s eating
you?

00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:13.139
Robinson’s a fine guy.”

00:08:13.139 --> 00:08:15.330
To which Broderick said, “Yeah?

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.720
Suppose I had let my kids go see that picture-
and they had seen him, playing the part of

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.570
me, actually taking a drink and smoking a
cigar?”

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.960
Broderick was also a complete teddy bear when
it came to women and children, never hesitating

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:29.110
to walk young women home at night if they
felt unsafe and offering his services as a

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.289
bodyguard, free of charge, to women who’d
been victims of domestic assault, occasionally

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:36.949
visiting their former partners to “teach
them a lesson”.

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:40.689
In one instance, the New York papers reported
that Broderick beat up several young men who

00:08:40.689 --> 00:08:42.430
had been harassing women on the street.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:46.339
Then, for good measure, Broderick tossed them
each through windows so that he could arrest

00:08:46.339 --> 00:08:48.429
them for malicious destruction of property.

00:08:48.429 --> 00:08:52.480
It was reported that they all got 30 days
in jail for the charge of destruction of property.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.579
If you’re guessing from all this that Broderick’s
career was marred by controversy, you’re

00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:57.579
correct.

00:08:57.579 --> 00:09:01.350
However, it should be noted that his abusive
treatment of those he felt were criminals

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:04.709
(whether they were or not) wasn’t that uncommon
at the time for police.

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:08.410
It wouldn’t be until a couple decades after
he retired that the New York police force

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.519
would try to curb this type of behavior, starting
to give training courses for their officers

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.639
in respecting people’s civil rights.

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:18.290
But during Broderick’s time, gangsters were
often able to flaunt their crimes with little

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:22.870
risk of actually being punished in any meaningful
way due to paying off the right officials.

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.170
This left some members of the police seeing
it as their duty to dole out justice when

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:27.740
the justice system wouldn’t.

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:32.220
As former assistant chief inspector Walter
Henning noted in 1966, “They had rather

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:34.260
be locked up than to meet Johnny.”

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:38.490
Nevertheless, Broderick took excessive force
to a whole new level.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.470
In one instance in 1937, the New York Supreme
Court even had to step in, freeing a prisoner

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.689
long before his sentence was complete.

00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:46.689
Why?

00:09:46.689 --> 00:09:48.959
Think Captain Hadley / Bogs in Shawshank Redemption.

00:09:48.959 --> 00:09:52.899
They stated in their ruling that Broderick
had “beat him so badly that he will be a

00:09:52.899 --> 00:09:53.899
cripple for life.

00:09:53.899 --> 00:09:56.510
I think this man has more than expiated his
crime.”

00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.850
On top of the severe beating, the man was
given no medical attention while in police

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:00.850
custody.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.019
Yet again, Broderick got off scot-free.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:07.300
On top of this, the Industrial Squad (later
repurposed as the Gangster Squad) of plainclothes

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:12.209
officers Broderick led for a time was frequently
cited for excessive force- not against trying

00:10:12.209 --> 00:10:16.230
to break up crowds of strikers by breaking
various parts of said strikers’ bodies.

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:20.749
In one instance in 1926, the American Civil
Liberties Union accused the Industrial Squad

00:10:20.749 --> 00:10:25.449
of attacking the Interborough Rapid Transit
Company workers, seriously injuring 20 of

00:10:25.449 --> 00:10:26.610
them, for no reason.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.550
Broderick claimed it was self defence, as
he did in many other such instances.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:34.209
Of course, the Industrial Squad didn’t always
intervene in strikes and there were several

00:10:34.209 --> 00:10:38.449
accusations over his career that Broderick
and his fellow officers on the squad often

00:10:38.449 --> 00:10:42.350
offered to “protect” the strikers from
such beatings (and look the other way when

00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:46.509
strikers attacked scabs) if the union officials
would pay them for it.

00:10:46.509 --> 00:10:49.480
In each instance, however, Broderick and his
crew were cleared of all charges or in other

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.660
cases no action was taken to investigate the
accusations.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.920
It should be noted here that Broderick was
known to walk around wearing thousand dollars

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:02.339
suits, drove a Cadillac and owned a luxurious
apartment in Queens he somehow maintained

00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:06.399
on a $4000 a year salary ($70,000 today).

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:10.199
He was also known to have many connections
with the controversial Democratic Tammany

00:11:10.199 --> 00:11:11.560
Hall political machine.

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.629
Beyond that, journalist Francis James Westbrook
Pegler noted that while Broderick didn’t

00:11:16.629 --> 00:11:20.349
hesitate to beat up many known criminals he
encountered on the streets, other times, he

00:11:20.349 --> 00:11:24.189
casually looked the other way for no apparent
reason, “there were many low characters

00:11:24.189 --> 00:11:28.579
in the city, notorious for their activity
in the rackets, who were walking right past

00:11:28.579 --> 00:11:32.310
Detective Broderick on the street and in the
lobby of [Madison Square] Garden, whom he

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:34.680
did not find any occasion to bounce around.”

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:38.950
However, due to the public perception of his
unflinching dedication to duty (whether an

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.899
accurate portrayal or not), Broderick was
seldom reprimanded for his actions and the

00:11:42.899 --> 00:11:47.139
numerous complaints filed against him for
assault and excessive force were largely swept

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:48.139
under the rug.

00:11:48.139 --> 00:11:51.019
Even lawsuits against him, which weren’t
that uncommon, were typically thrown out by

00:11:51.019 --> 00:11:55.009
judges who were friendly with, or juries who
admired, Broderick and his efforts to clean

00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:56.160
up the streets of New York.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.269
But there are always limits, and after years
of these complaints piling up, Broderick was

00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:02.959
demoted in 1934 to the rank of patrolman.

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:06.990
It was reported by journalist Westbrook Peglar
that the demotion was because Broderick “has

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:11.429
enjoyed for some years the endorsement and
assistance of some of the most pernicious

00:12:11.429 --> 00:12:13.690
Tammany politicians in the city.”

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:16.980
Within a few years of this, he was reinstated
to detective but the problems didn’t go

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:22.579
away and by 1947 he was very quietly forcibly
retired from the police force by Mayor William

00:12:22.579 --> 00:12:26.589
O’Dwyer amidst accusations that Broderick
was in cahoots with gangsters.

00:12:26.589 --> 00:12:31.569
You see, it was discovered that in November
of 1946, Broderick had accompanied ex-convict

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:35.989
Ben Kaye to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where the
pair met up with mobster Owney Madden for

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:37.459
undisclosed reasons.

00:12:37.459 --> 00:12:41.059
Broderick later denied that there was anything
fishy about this, stating that he frequently

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:45.129
associated with various gangsters and other
criminals to keep tabs on what was going on

00:12:45.129 --> 00:12:49.059
with the criminal underworld in New York;
it was just part of his job.

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:53.269
After retirement, Broderick made an unsuccessful
bid for political office in 1949, but the

00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:57.299
aforementioned reason why he retired came
to public light and his political aspirations

00:12:57.299 --> 00:12:58.329
went down the toilet.

00:12:58.329 --> 00:13:04.100
He then sold the rights to his life story
to RKO Pictures for $75,000 (about $753,000

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.100
today).

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:10.069
A script was made, tentatively called “Broadway’s
One-Man Riot Squad”, and actors hired, but

00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:13.480
they never got around to making a film based
on his life due to budget concerns.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.360
Broderick took the money and retired to a
farm where he raised horses and dogs.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:22.930
He died in 1966 at the age of 70 with newspapers
across the nation hailing him as “The Toughest

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:34.439
Cop in 

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:37.059
the World”.
