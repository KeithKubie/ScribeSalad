There are much better
options than dropdowns.

00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:07.770
Check the links in the instructor
notes if you still don't believe us.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.500
After watching Cam having
terrible time with dropdowns,

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.200
you should be asking yourself,
how do I pick the right ones?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.960
How do I decide what input to pick?

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.720
These are great questions.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.510
Luckily the HTML five star includes
a number of input types tailored for

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.940
every situation.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.510
You can find a link to the list
in the instructor notes.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.740
Consider these the tools or
building blocks for your forms.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.870
This should look pretty familiar.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.040
Here is on the left is the phone input.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.780
So here on the right is the Email and
in the middle you could see the URL.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.195
And of course we have many more.

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:48.200
Notice how each specialized input

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.960
contains the buttons
that the user needs.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.690
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.940
This is great because we don't have too
much real estate on a mobile device and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.660
we want to enable our users
the most convenient way

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.830
to type the information they need.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.040
In the next quizzes, Cam will challenge
you to research on your own and

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.300
pick the best input types for
your forms.
