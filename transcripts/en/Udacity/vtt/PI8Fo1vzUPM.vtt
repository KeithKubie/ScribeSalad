[P. Norvig] So, Dave, I hear you just finished a great class, CS101: Introduction to Computer Programming

00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:07.049
[D. Evans] Thanks, Peter, it's been a lot of fun,

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.057
and I heard you're going to be teaching a new class that starts soon.

00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:13.075
[P. Norvig] That's right; I'm starting up with 212, Design of Computer Programs

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.015
It's all about the process of design;

00:00:15.018 --> 00:00:18.065
how you go from an informal description of a problem

00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:22.002
to working code...uh...through a process of decomposition

00:00:22.004 --> 00:00:24.068
and how to distinguish a good design from maybe a not-so-good design.

00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:27.049
[D. Evans] Cool; that sounds really useful what...what students should be learning

00:00:27.049 --> 00:00:30.006
after 101.  What's the first unit about?

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:34.056
[P.Norvig] Well, first unit is actually about ranking hands in a game of poker.

00:00:34.056 --> 00:00:36.078
[D. Evans] Ahhh...I think I probably should learn that.

00:00:36.078 --> 00:00:39.057
[P. Norvig] Hmm...well, let's play.  [D. Evans] Ok.

00:00:39.057 --> 00:00:45.036
Well, I'm going to bet...101...

00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:46.008
[P. Norvig] Hmm...

00:00:46.008 --> 00:00:47.072
[D. Evans] ...billion nanodollars.

00:00:47.072 --> 00:00:58.077
[P. Norvig] I'll see your 101, and I'll raise you...212.

00:00:58.077 --> 00:01:04.072
[D. Evans] Wow...hmm...well, I'm going to go all in.  And I also want the shirt off your back.

00:01:04.072 --> 00:01:09.036
[P. Norvig] The shirt off my back.  Well, I'm pretty confident, so I'm all in, too.  What do you got?

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:12.028
[D. Evans] I got three kings and two jacks.

00:01:12.028 --> 00:01:16.072
[P. Norvig] Ahhh... full house.  Well, I got four aces, and we'll soon see

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:20.045
how to program a computer to know that four aces beats a full house.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:22.020
[D. Evans] It's good you didn't want my shirt then.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.085
[P. Norvig] Ok, we'll see you in class.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:30.095
