- But every once in awhile
the second-hottest girl

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:04.471
is also the first-ugliest girl.

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.939
(audience laughing)

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.608 align:start size:94% position:6%
But you live by the sword,
you die by the sword.

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:09.542

(electronic hip hop music)

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.294 align:start size:84% position:16%
Welcome to This is
Not Happening presents

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:29.662
World of Blunder.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.097
If you've never been
to this show before,

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.999 align:start size:94% position:6%
this is a bunch of comics
telling fun stories

00:00:32.999 --> 00:00:34.300
about real shit that happened.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.770
- [Announcer] Give it
up for Ari Shaffir.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.939 line:0%
(audience applauding)

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:44.544
- You're gonna hear
a lot of stories

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.413
about real degenerate behavior.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:47.580
I'm most positive.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.249
Comedians are all degens.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.550
We're bad.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.818
We're good people
but we're degens.

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.954 align:start size:84% position:16%
We have sex with
questionable people.

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.490
We do a lot of drugs.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.025
But we don't start that way.

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:00.293
We don't start that way.

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:01.561
I started like,
as a good person.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.430
I was 28 years old, I'd
had sex with two people.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:04.764
(audience member laughing)

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:05.799
That's not--

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:08.802
(audience laughing)

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.277
Jesus.

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:19.612
(audience laughing)

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.247
I know, whatever.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.482
(audience laughing)

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:23.750
In college when I
was still a virgin,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.884
I would tell all my
friends in college,

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:25.685 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm like, "Masturbation
feels the same."

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:26.753
(audience laughing)

00:01:26.753 --> 00:01:28.354
They're like, "You're an idiot."

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.989 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm like, "You're an idiot,
it's the same thing."

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.691
But I was wrong.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.027
(audience laughing)

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:35.895 align:start size:84% position:16%
But there comes this
right of passage

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.031 align:start size:94% position:6%
that every LA comedian has
where you really become

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.599
like a full comic.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.401
And it's when Bobby Lee
takes you to San Diego.

00:01:41.401 --> 00:01:43.103
(audience laughing)

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.306 align:start size:84% position:16%
That's when you become
a real comedian.

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:48.141
This was summer of 2001.

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:51.010
I was sleeping, Bobby
Lee called me one day,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.579
and he goes, "Hey what
are you doing right now?"

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:54.681
And I was like, "It's 12:45
on a Wednesday, I'm in bed.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:55.782
"What should I be doing?"

00:01:55.782 --> 00:01:57.050
(audience laughing)

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.251
And he goes, "Let's go
to San Diego right now,

00:01:58.251 --> 00:01:59.786 align:start size:88% position:13%
"We're gonna go to
this bar and do spots."

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.054 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I'm like, "Yeah, sure
I'm in, let's do it."

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.323
And he goes, "Oh, also,
we gotta go to Tijuana,

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:04.891
"for um, pills."

00:02:04.891 --> 00:02:06.860
(audience laughing)

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.730
And I'm like, "Oh, yeah,
okay cool, that's fine."

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:12.298
(audience laughing)

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.933 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then he goes, "Also,
you have to drive."

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:14.901
I'm like, "Why do
I have to drive?"

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.102
(audience laughing)

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.804
And he goes, "Cause
I'm outta pills,

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.105
"and I haven't slept
in like three days.

00:02:19.105 --> 00:02:21.875
"So it's gonna be dangerous."

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.977 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I was like,
"Alright, let's do it."

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.578
We drive, it's about a two
hour drive to San Diego.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:28.314 align:start size:97% position:3%
What we're gonna do is San
Diego, go straight to Tijuana,

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.284
get pills, come back,
do spots at night.

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.986 align:start size:81% position:19%
San Diego is known
for two things.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:35.088
Sea World and girls
who love to fuck.

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:39.259 align:start size:94% position:6%
So we're hoping that maybe
we can get the latter

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:41.194
after that show.

00:02:41.194 --> 00:02:42.428
It's a shitty spot.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:43.530
I went up first,
I bombed horribly.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.664
(audience laughing)

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:45.899
I was not a good comedian.

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:48.268
Bobby went up next,
killed, destroyed.

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:50.103 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then after the show,
I'm walking around,

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:53.006 align:start position:0%
he goes, "Ari, I have these
two girls I'd like you to meet,

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.807 align:start size:94% position:6%
"I talked to them, I'm
kinda friendly with them."

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.943
I was like, "Were they
here during my set?"

00:02:56.943 --> 00:02:59.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he goes, "No
they just got here."

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.313
I was like, "Oh, how
you doin, Ari Shaffir.

00:03:00.313 --> 00:03:01.581
(audience laughing)

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:02.382
"Nice to meet you,
I'm really funny."

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:05.251
(audience laughing)

00:03:06.352 --> 00:03:08.821
And we started buying em drinks.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.590 align:start size:84% position:16%
We, Bobby Lee started
buying em drinks.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:11.791
He wouldn't have any.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:13.293 align:start size:88% position:13%
Cause he was at the
weird stage of relapse,

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.727
you know that where you're like,

00:03:14.727 --> 00:03:16.196
"No, I don't drink,
that's ridiculous.

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:19.299 align:start size:97% position:3%
"I'll take a bunch of pills,
but no, there's a line."

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.067
But he's better now.

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.336
But so we're talking
to these two girls,

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.737
it's going pretty well.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:25.705
There's two of them.

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:26.639
One is like really hot.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.674
Like a San Diego eight.

00:03:27.674 --> 00:03:30.176
(audience laughing)

00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.979
Which is like an
LA, seven or nine,

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:34.714
depending on where
you are in San Diego.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.382
(audience laughing)

00:03:36.382 --> 00:03:40.153 align:start size:88% position:13%
But the other one is
disgusting, she's gross.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.890
I describe her face as, "Ugh."

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.060
(audience laughing)

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.528
And we're all talking, it's fun,

00:03:48.528 --> 00:03:50.363
they were researchers at
the Scripps Institute.

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:52.198
Which means they
were intelligent,

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:53.433 align:start size:81% position:19%
which we didn't
care about at all.

00:03:53.433 --> 00:03:54.934
(audience laughing)

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.337 align:start size:97% position:3%
So it worked out, some point
they go to the bathroom,

00:03:57.337 --> 00:03:58.871 align:start size:84% position:16%
and Bobby goes, "Which
one do you want?"

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:00.707 align:start size:94% position:6%
By the way, girls, that's
a normal situation.

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.308
(audience laughing)

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:03.810
Just so you know, when
you go to the bathroom,

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.613
guys are talking about you as
if you're a slice of pizza.

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.681
(audience laughing)

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:11.384
"Which would you like?"

00:04:11.384 --> 00:04:13.152
"I don't care."

00:04:13.152 --> 00:04:16.756
(audience laughing)

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.858
So Bobby wanted the
hot one, I was like,

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:20.126
"Alright, I'll take
the uglier one."

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:21.728
By the way, I have
this general rule.

00:04:21.728 --> 00:04:24.030 align:start size:94% position:6%
My general rule of hitting
on people is I never go

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:25.298
for the hottest girl in a group,

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:26.566
I always go for the
second-hottest girl.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:28.268
Cause the hottest girl
she's got a big head,

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.203
everyone's trying with
her, it's too difficult.

00:04:30.203 --> 00:04:31.838
Second-hottest girl,
she feels insecure,

00:04:31.838 --> 00:04:33.606
swoop right in there.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:35.441
(audience laughing)

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:37.210
But every once in awhile,
the second-hottest girl

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.512
is also the first-ugliest girl.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:42.515
(audience laughing)

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.954 align:start size:94% position:6%
But you live by the sword,
you die by the sword.

00:04:47.954 --> 00:04:50.223
(audience laughing)

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.724
So I was like, "Alright, I'll
take Uggo McGee over there.

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.960
"Let's fucking do it."

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.029 align:start size:97% position:3%
So everybody's drunk, except
Bobby, we're all talking,

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:58.031 align:start size:84% position:16%
we're like, oh they
gotta get their bikes,

00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:59.232 align:start size:88% position:13%
they chained their bikes
up around the corner.

00:04:59.232 --> 00:05:00.700 align:start size:81% position:19%
They gotta get
their bikes first.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.168 align:start size:97% position:3%
So we're like, "Alright
cool, let's get your bikes,

00:05:02.168 --> 00:05:03.770
"put em in Bobby's hatchback,
we'll drive to the hotel."

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.105 align:start size:88% position:13%
We were sharing a room,
two different beds.

00:05:06.105 --> 00:05:07.907 align:start size:84% position:16%
We get to the bikes,
bikes are stolen.

00:05:07.907 --> 00:05:09.409
(audience laughing)

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.943 align:start size:88% position:13%
Stolen or towed, I don't
know, but either way,

00:05:10.943 --> 00:05:12.779
the girls started crying.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.048 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like literally,
tears streaming out,

00:05:15.048 --> 00:05:16.516
they were crying.

00:05:16.516 --> 00:05:18.017 align:start size:97% position:3%
Which by the way, crying,
that's one of the worst things

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:19.052
for your boner.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:20.753
(audience laughing)

00:05:20.753 --> 00:05:22.155 align:start size:88% position:13%
Unless you're a
rapist, you don't want.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.691
(audience laughing)

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.559 align:start size:88% position:13%
Like, I'm not gonna
lube myself with tears.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:29.562
(audience laughing)

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:33.232 align:start size:88% position:13%
So Bobby goes, "Well how
much were the bikes?"

00:05:33.232 --> 00:05:36.836
And the one girl goes, "Mine
was $100, and hers was $200."

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:39.272 align:start size:88% position:13%
And Bobby goes, "Oh hey,
I'm on MadTV, here."

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:43.309
And he just pulled
out four $100 bills.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.844 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he goes, "Will
that take care of it?"

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.547 align:start size:84% position:16%
And their tears
climbed up their face.

00:05:47.547 --> 00:05:49.916
(audience laughing)

00:05:49.916 --> 00:05:54.087
Defying gravity to
go, I literally saw
money buy happiness.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:58.391
(audience laughing)

00:06:03.596 --> 00:06:04.997
We went back to the
room, but it's weird.

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:06.265
I've had sex with two
people at this point,

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.367
so it's fucking weird.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.868
I don't know what to do.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.970
There's a guy in the room
with you on a separate bed,

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:13.106 align:start size:94% position:6%
you're with your fucking,
the Ewok on your bed.

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.474
(audience laughing)

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:16.042
And you don't know what to do.

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.810
So I'm trying, kiss
every once in awhile,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.345
we start making out.

00:06:19.345 --> 00:06:20.947
As we're kissing, you just
hear him on the other bed,

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:22.715
going, "Can I just
touch your elbow?

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:25.718
(audience laughing)

00:06:28.921 --> 00:06:30.590 align:start size:84% position:16%
"I would like to brush
the back of my hand

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.626
"against your shoulder,
would that be alright?"

00:06:33.626 --> 00:06:35.528 align:start size:84% position:16%
He's even funny when
he tries to fuck.

00:06:35.528 --> 00:06:37.397
So eventually it got too weird.

00:06:37.397 --> 00:06:39.999
So Bobby took a bunch of
pillows and the hot girl

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.902
and the blankets into this
closet, this walk-in closet.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.237 align:start size:81% position:19%
And he went in
there to separate.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.505
It was a big closet.

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:46.773
And so me and the
girl we hooked up.

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:48.474
And then after about
an hour, Bobby came out

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:51.978 align:start size:94% position:6%
and we drove em back to
their place, $400 in hand,

00:06:51.978 --> 00:06:54.714
not for sex, but
it was all fine.

00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.117 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then Bobby's like,
"Oh, so you got laid, huh?"

00:06:58.117 --> 00:06:59.452
I was like, "No I
didn't get laid."

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:00.953
Cause I knew he didn't.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:02.155
Cause here's what happened,
when he went into the closet,

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:03.656 align:start size:88% position:13%
that girl, the hot girl,
immediately is like,

00:07:03.656 --> 00:07:05.057
"I'm too drunk don't touch me."

00:07:05.057 --> 00:07:06.859
And she fucking went
against the corner

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.127
and Bobby just had to
wait until I was done.

00:07:08.127 --> 00:07:09.862
(audience laughing)

00:07:09.862 --> 00:07:11.063
Yeah, so he's like,
"I didn't get laid,

00:07:11.063 --> 00:07:12.565
"but you did, huh?"

00:07:12.565 --> 00:07:13.499
I didn't want to make him
feel bad so I was like,

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:14.667
"No, no we just messed around,

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:15.835 align:start size:84% position:16%
"we just fooled
around a little bit."

00:07:15.835 --> 00:07:17.303 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he goes, "You're
lying to me."

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.104
I'm like, "No, I would
never lie to you, Bobby."

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:18.938
(audience laughing)

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:20.706
I was lying to him.

00:07:20.706 --> 00:07:21.908
(audience laughing)

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:23.443 align:start size:84% position:16%
But he goes, "I
know you're lying."

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:24.644
And this is how he knew, he
drove us back to the hotel,

00:07:24.644 --> 00:07:26.279
he walked me into that closet.

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.882
There was like a heating
grate like right there,

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.151
looking directly up my bed.

00:07:33.853 --> 00:07:37.223
So he's like, "I watched
here, I sat and looked,

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:39.525
"I could see this angle
pretty much, just like."

00:07:39.525 --> 00:07:42.595
(audience laughing)

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.330 align:start size:84% position:16%
He was like, "I didn't
just see you go,

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:45.665
"I saw you fuck.

00:07:46.766 --> 00:07:50.503 align:start size:88% position:13%
"I saw your penis
disappear into a vagina,

00:07:50.503 --> 00:07:52.238
"And then reappear,
and then disappear,

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:53.739
"over and over again."

00:07:53.739 --> 00:07:56.042
(audience laughing)

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:57.577 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like, "Well,
what did you do?"

00:07:57.577 --> 00:07:59.479
And he goes "What could I do?

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.147 align:start size:94% position:6%
"I just sat there and
watched and masturbated."

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:04.150
(audience laughing)

00:08:05.952 --> 00:08:08.187
I'm like, "Yeah, seems fair."

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.856
So, anyway, went to sleep.

00:08:09.856 --> 00:08:12.291 align:start size:88% position:13%
The next day, we went
to Tijuana to buy pills.

00:08:12.291 --> 00:08:13.626
This is how you buy pills
in Tijuana by the way,

00:08:13.626 --> 00:08:15.161 align:start size:97% position:3%
you don't need a prescription,
that's ridiculous.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.696 align:start size:97% position:3%
You show your
prescription, they're like,

00:08:16.696 --> 00:08:17.964
"I don't know, what do you
want me to do with that?"

00:08:17.964 --> 00:08:19.432
(audience laughing)

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:21.367 align:start size:88% position:13%
You just point to
whatever pills you want,

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:23.436
and they just bring
you bottles of those

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:24.871
until you're like, thumbs up.

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:26.072
And they're like,

00:08:26.072 --> 00:08:28.875
"Cool, thanks, that was
a nice transaction."

00:08:28.875 --> 00:08:30.743
But we got the pills
and then Bobby goes,

00:08:30.743 --> 00:08:33.212
"Hey do you want to
go get a prostitute?"

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:35.882 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I was like, "Well
who's gonna pay for that?"

00:08:35.882 --> 00:08:37.650
And he goes, "MadTV
will pay for it.

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.118
(audience laughing)

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:40.953
"I'm a full cast member now."

00:08:40.953 --> 00:08:42.522
And I was like, "Alright."

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.657
How much do you guys think
a Tijuana prostitute costs?

00:08:44.657 --> 00:08:46.659 align:start size:84% position:16%
How much do you
think, you're close.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:47.793
- 40 pesos.

00:08:47.793 --> 00:08:48.761
- 40 pesos!

00:08:48.761 --> 00:08:50.663
You don't value pussy at all!

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:51.931
(audience laughing)

00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:53.132
What is that like nine cents?

00:08:53.132 --> 00:08:54.433
(audience laughing)

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:55.268
40 pesos!

00:08:58.571 --> 00:08:59.539
No, it does not.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:01.440
It costs $500.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.842
No, I'm joking it
does not cost $500.

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:03.943
(audience laughing)

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:05.778
This is Mexican girls.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.316
It's $72, that's how
much it costs, $72.

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:12.385
And here's the breakdown,
if you ever wanted to know.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:16.556
$60 goes to the girl, I don't
know what she does with that.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:19.425 align:start size:84% position:16%
$11 goes to the
hotel room next door,

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:21.827 align:start size:88% position:13%
and that leaves $1 over,
for which I consider

00:09:21.827 --> 00:09:23.329
the worst job in the world,

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:27.066 align:start size:88% position:13%
the Mexican whore-house
clean-up guy.

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:29.569
(audience laughing)

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.638
Yeah, for $1 a pop,
he goes room to room,

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:35.041
cleaning up love mess.

00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:38.277
(audience laughing)

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:39.946
So my girl didn't
speak any English,

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:42.515 align:start size:97% position:3%
she pointed at a table,
eventually I put money down,

00:09:42.515 --> 00:09:44.483
the $80 Bobby gave me, he goes,

00:09:44.483 --> 00:09:46.586
"Pre-tip them, they'll
do a lot better for you."

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.988 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then, but I couldn't
get a boner at all.

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:50.990 align:start size:88% position:13%
It was super hot, it
was 100 degrees outside,

00:09:50.990 --> 00:09:53.793
I'm nervous as shit, she
put this condom on me,

00:09:53.793 --> 00:09:56.128
and the only English
she knew, she goes,

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.730
"Too much cerveza?"

00:09:58.564 --> 00:10:01.567
(audience laughing)

00:10:04.604 --> 00:10:06.572
I'm like, "Yeah, I guess so,
I don't know, I only had one.

00:10:06.572 --> 00:10:07.873
"I don't think it's that but,

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:09.175
(audience laughing)

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:10.676
"Let's just call it that."

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:12.712
But he paid for it, I didn't
want the money to go to waste,

00:10:12.712 --> 00:10:14.714
so I just kinda stuffed.

00:10:16.582 --> 00:10:19.986
(audience laughing)

00:10:19.986 --> 00:10:21.454
You ever see a magician
pushing a handkerchief

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:22.788
into this fist?

00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:25.124
(audience laughing)

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:26.826
And they're kinda like?

00:10:26.826 --> 00:10:28.160
(audience laughing)

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.564 align:start size:97% position:3%
Well I used that
technology and I just kinda

00:10:31.564 --> 00:10:33.499
shoved it all in there.

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.235
And just like, uh,
yep that counts.

00:10:36.235 --> 00:10:37.970
Got my money's worth.

00:10:39.438 --> 00:10:41.374
And my numbers went up
from two people ever

00:10:41.374 --> 00:10:44.477
to four people within 17 hours.

00:10:44.477 --> 00:10:47.647
(audience applauding)

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.618
And as we were walking back,

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:54.120
we were walking back
across the border,

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.956 align:start size:97% position:3%
like gentlemen, with pill
bottles stuffed up our taints,

00:10:56.956 --> 00:10:58.624
like real Americans.

00:11:00.026 --> 00:11:03.162 align:start position:0%
And Bobby turns and says,
"Ari, you're now a real comic."

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.764
Congratulations.

00:11:04.764 --> 00:11:05.698
Thank you everyone.

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:06.666
(audience applauding)

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.734
(electronic hip hop music)

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:10.202
That's the episode everybody.

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:12.038
And the season, it's all done.

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.706
That's 13 up and 13 down.

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.408 align:start size:81% position:19%
Thank you guys
all for tuning in,

00:11:15.408 --> 00:11:17.309 align:start size:88% position:13%

Facebook and on Twitter.

Continue to do that.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:20.546 align:start size:84% position:16%
Without you guys
watching and sharing,

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:22.481
we wouldn't have done
these, so fuck yeah.

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:24.083
Next week, there's
no comment section.

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.152
I mean, there is now, but
it won't post anything

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:27.486
cause they'll be no story.
