00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.620
 You have approximately 171 billion brain cells 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.740
 86 billion of these cells are nerves 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.720
 Which processes the information, and the sense of different influences 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.520
 And make you 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.940
 What you are. 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.880
 But there are things in our daily lives 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.720
 Reduce this number? 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.900
 What could kill your brain cells? 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.880
 Previously, we had a belief that the brain could not 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.300
 Produce new neurons. 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.180
 Although neurons are a type of metastatic cell, this means they do not multiply. 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.460
 We now know that new neurons are produced from nerve stem cells. 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.180
 Throughout our lives. 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.320
 But this is only done in certain areas of our brain. 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.060
 In two small areas in the anterior brain. 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.240
 So, while it can produce new neurons 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.440
 The death of brain cells in large quantities may be dangerous and irreversible. 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.800
 For example, within 5 minutes of a blow to the head 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.440
 The axes compress and drive calcium to the nerve cells 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.300
 Which can stimulate a number of different pathways and enzymes to initiate cell death. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.060
 This may explain confusion, loss of consciousness 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.440
 And sensitivity to sound or light common in concussion of the brain. 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.120
 Getting enough sleep? 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.300
 Although the brain can adapt to lack of sleep in the short term 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.340
 The 2014 study showed that waking up all night for many nights 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.540
 May kill nerve cells in the blue position 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.960
 This area of ​​the brain is responsible for coordination 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.900
 Stimulate, maintain interest and excitement. 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.840
 After long waking periods 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.200
 We become unable to make important proteins to keep these neurons alive. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.120
 But do not be nervous about it, literally. 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.120
 Long-term stress was associated 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.020
 With damage to our Hossain area. 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.980
 And reduced ability to make new neurons. 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.880
 Which may explain why stress can result in many mental illnesses 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.700
 Such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and schizophrenia. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.480
 Nicotine affects the hippocampus, too. 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.740
 By cutting the creation of new neurons by 50% 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.660
 While increasing cell death 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.680
 Such as the smell of gasoline or permanent marker pens? 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.100
 Although they do not cause direct damage to the brain 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 Some chemicals are stuffy 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.480
 In the sense that it burns oxygen from the air you breathe 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.700
 And deprive the vital tissues of it! 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.720
 Eventually, brain cells are killed 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.640
 Carbon dioxide, commonly released from stoves, furnaces, 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.760
 Grills and cars, works the same way 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.660
 By taking your hemoglobin 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.180
 Which carries oxygen in the blood. 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.860
 Cells in the main organs, such as the brain and heart 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.180
 Will suffocate and die on a number of levels 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.200
 What about alcohol? 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.580
 It seems that exposure to alcohol in the short term 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.360
 Do not kill brain cells! 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.480
 However, communication can reduce them. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.280
 And over longer, chronic alcohol consumption 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.940
 It can activate the immune cells in the brain to produce pro-inflammatory chemicals 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.740
 Free radicals that can lead to cell death. 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.883
 Alcohol addicts can also be affected by thiamine, vitamin B, 

00:02:40.883 --> 00:02:42.920
 Which is called Fernik Korsakov syndrome 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.020
 Which can kill brain cells and lead to memory problems 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:48.780
 Loss of memory, and lack of muscular coordination. 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.240
 Taking a break from drinking may be the best way 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.820
 To promote the growth of nerve stem cells and other neurotransmitters. 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.700
 But no matter how afraid of losing brain cells 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.800
 We may not have a choice in this matter 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.872
 Our brain volume decreases by 5% per weight per decade, 

00:03:03.872 --> 00:03:05.260
 After the age of forty 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.060
 With an increase of around 70. 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.220
 The most common is memory loss 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.340
 Which can be a natural part of aging. 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.520
 In general, we should not be preoccupied with the number of brain cells we have lost today. 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.560
 As losing it may be a sign that things are fine 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.640
 During growth we produce more nerve cells than we need 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.480
 Brain cells must die to keep the brain organized. 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.865
 Research conducted on rats indicates 

00:03:27.865 --> 00:03:30.120
 "We lose neurons in the frontal cortex of the brain. 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.140
 As a way to reorganize our brain during and after puberty 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.040
 More neurons do not make a person necessarily better or smarter. 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.220
 Sometimes cell death leads to a healthy life. 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.420
