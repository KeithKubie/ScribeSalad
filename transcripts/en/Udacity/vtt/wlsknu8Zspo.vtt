00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.780
Do you remember my personal site from
the beginning of the first lesson?

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.980
Well, it looks like there
are some issues with it.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.380
When I opened it up to test on mobile,
in this case, a Nexus 5.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.860
It looks awful.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.370
See how I have to scroll back and
forth to see the whole page?

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.120
The page defaulted to desktop
resolutions, which does not look so

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.950
awesome on this mobile viewport.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.330
For this quiz,
open up this site with mobile dev tools.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.340
Add a viewport, so
that it doesn't look totally awful.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.430
You will know you've done it correctly
when the page actually fits,

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.470
when you try to emulate a mobile device.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.830
Additionally, when you've
set the viewport correctly,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.330
a code will be displayed,
type it in below to continue.
