[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.750
DAVE LANGERT: Now while the
Blackhawks are certainly

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.510
a core piece of this
story, it's much more

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.910
than a hockey or a sports book.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.720
So what do you see
as the central theme

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.030
of "The Breakaway"?

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.821
BRYAN SMITH: Well, I'm
glad you asked that.

00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:46.340
It's a great question.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.840
Yeah.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.290
I mean, I know for those--
how many are Blackhawks fans?

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.230
Yeah, everybody here.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.110
Yeah.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.320
See, I mean, that's--

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.390
you know, obviously
the juice to the story

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.270
is the Blackhawks and
the big turnaround.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.209
What I found, though--

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.130
I mean, to me, unless
it's going to be

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.950
like kind of a puff piece book,
that's not enough of a story.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.040
So part of what led
me to believe there

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.000
was a book there was
digging into this family.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.390
And what I discovered-- well,
so the theme that emerged

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.660
is this almost
Shakespearean relationships

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.410
between father and son
and brother and brother,

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.100
meaning Bill and Rocky.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.700
Just the depth of
their animosity

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.660
to each other clashing,
and the horrible way Bill

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.610
treated Rocky, basically
excommunicating him

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.860
from both the business and
the family, the Blackhawks

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.350
and the family.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.640
And then his brother, Peter,
who was with the Blackhawks

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.905
and Rocky, and their--

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.066
I don't know if rivalry
is the right word.

00:02:07.066 --> 00:02:08.440
But they just
clashed all the way

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.740
back to when they were kids.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.510
And I didn't know this.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:22.030
And so I started to see more
of a family empire story,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.140
but just a family
dynamic like we all have.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.780
I'll admit it, I have problems
sometimes with my father.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.630
And I think we all have a
little dysfunction somewhere

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.830
in our family.

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.490
And it felt relatable.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.940
But-- oh, who am I kidding?

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.690
It's about hockey.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.510
And it's hard to kind of convey
that because hockey is fun,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.490
and there's plenty of hockey.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.690
It's kind of the backdrop.

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.790
We were talking earlier.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.040
Anybody watch "GLOW,"
that show on Netflix?

00:02:53.840 --> 00:03:01.120
It's about the women of
female wrestling in the 1970s.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.360
That's the backdrop.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.250
But the story, of course,
is about these relationships

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.980
and dynamics.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.820
And talking about
the movie "Titanic",

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.480
which I didn't really care
for-- but the ship going down

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.530
is not the story.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.330
It's the love story.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.320
Spoiler alert, the ship sinks.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.120
So that's what I tried
to do with the book.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.180
So I think-- all of you
are Blackhawks fans.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.480
You'll love it.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.350
But even those who aren't,
I think, will like it, too.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.620
DAVE LANGERT: And the Blackhawks
are a part of the Wirtz empire.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.410
But really there's a
much bigger piece to it.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.910
Can you talk a little bit about
how that empire came to be

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.521
and what it all encompasses?

00:03:45.521 --> 00:03:46.270
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.120
It's interesting.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.210
I didn't know before I
started researching it

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.780
and people would ask me,
like, so the Wirtzes,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.200
is that old money?

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.270
Did they come up from
some European royalty

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.550
and come over here?

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.350
The answer is very much no.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.880
It's very much an
American bootstraps kind

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.765
of empire building story
that traces the Wirtzes--

00:04:13.765 --> 00:04:16.600
and hopefully not in a dry
way, but a compelling way--

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.760
from the original Wirtz.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.850
Michael Wirtz was a dirt
poor farmer in Luxembourg,

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.650
came over, steamer, landed
in France, went to New York,

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:31.090
and settled in a farm
in suburban Illinois

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.840
because the land was a lot
like his land in Luxembourg.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.710
And so the Witzes kind
of spread out there--

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.290
I guess near Mundelein--

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.810
and kind of gotten
involved with the town

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.560
and so forth, but nothing big.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.590
And then this guy
Arthur Wirtz was born,

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.220
I think third or
fourth generation.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.330
And his father, Fred, for
some reason left the farm

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.930
and went to Rogers
Park and became a cop.

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.010
Arthur was born, and
it's still a mystery

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:14.440
where he got this gene from
but he, during the Depression,

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.640
was in real estate.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.090
He was cash rich, and he
started buying arenas.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.130
He bought the old
Chicago Stadium.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.860
He bought Madison Square
Garden, St. Louis, Detroit--

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.420
there were a couple of others--

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.010
and so cornered the market,
kind of, on these big stadiums.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:34.030
And with Chicago Stadium
came the Blackhawks.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.364
And back in those days,
you could do this.

00:05:38.364 --> 00:05:40.030
His partner owned the
Detroit Red Wings.

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.150
And they just kind of like--

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.100
such a conflict.

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.930
Literally, they were brazen
about taking the good players

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.990
to Detroit and just kind
of letting the Blackhawks

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.230
do whatever they wanted.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.370
So Arthur starts building there.

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.627
He also made Sonja Henie--

00:05:58.627 --> 00:06:00.460
I don't know if you've
ever heard that name.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.487
She was a figure skating
queen of the day,

00:06:03.487 --> 00:06:04.570
and they turned her into--

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.810
I don't know, Ariana Grande.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.300
I mean, she was a
rock star [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.530
packing a figure skater.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.190
And they made these
Ziegfeld Follies shows.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.800
It's the forerunner of
Ice Capades and Holiday

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.060
on Ice and Disney on Ice.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.460
And so that was another way.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.350
And then he moved into
liquor distributorship.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.780
And now the Wirtzes
are, I think,

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:35.500
the third biggest in the
country liquor distributors.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:41.620
And I do want to
mention one other thing.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.070
For a time, Arthur and his
partner moved into boxing.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:47.560
They called it prize
fighting back then, back

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.670
before cable and stuff.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:53.050
And there was one fight,
Friday Night Fights.

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:58.840
And everything was rigged,
and Arthur ruled all of it.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.630
And the Feds finally broke it
up as a monopoly, made him sell

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.550
Madison Square Garden.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.050
And there were mobsters
and unsavory characters.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.856
And Jimmy, his
partner, walked around

00:07:08.856 --> 00:07:11.750
with $100 bills, dollar
bills in his pocket.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.990
He was like, slicked back hair.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.490
And so Arthur is such
a character in himself,

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.110
a book in himself.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.740
Gave birth to Bill,
and here we are.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:25.810
DAVE LANGERT: And I mean,
Arthur comes to life

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.000
in the book in a
lot more details.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.690
My personal favorite is how he
handled a poor earnings report

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.620
that Rocky had one time.

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.880
Are there any other
anecdotes about Arthur Wirtz

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.600
that you can share that may
help bring his character to life

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.200
a bit more?

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:41.950
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.620
Well, so you guys
know Bill, right?

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:50.510
He's just cantankerous,
belligerent, defiant, almost,

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:56.440
in his pushing of the fans.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.600
So Rocky told me that Arthur
made Bill look like a pussycat.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.600
That was this his words.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.750
And he said he was the most
intimidating man he'd ever met.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:05.650
Amazing business man.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:11.230
But he was like
six four, 280, 300.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.040
Huge, imposing figure.

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.310
And one of the best
stories was Rocky

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.040
described what it'd
be like for someone

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.140
to come into Arthur's office.

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.210
First of all, he had
this round table built,

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.490
King Arthur round table.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.689
Guess who was the king?

00:08:29.689 --> 00:08:30.730
DAVE LANGERT: Not subtle.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:31.300
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah, right.

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.039
So Arthur would be
sitting at his desk.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.510
Nothing on it.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.230
Pencil.

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.110
And someone would come in,
and Arthur kept the air

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.480
conditioning at, like, 50.

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:44.451
And so immediately-- the person
comes in all cocky, you know,

00:08:44.451 --> 00:08:45.700
I'm going to get a great deal.

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.030
And after a few minutes,
shifting around,

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.400
uncomfortable--

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.607
Arthur's up higher,
and Arthur would say,

00:08:54.607 --> 00:08:55.940
I need to make some phone calls.

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:58.000
I'll be right with you.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.580
And he'd make 25 phone calls.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.490
And the person was
just sitting there.

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:07.842
And then Arthur would
put down the phone

00:09:07.842 --> 00:09:08.800
and look up at the guy.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.420
And he had a sharpened pencil,
and he would point the pencil

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.349
at the person.

00:09:15.349 --> 00:09:16.390
And he had these glasses.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.190
He would put on
glasses and take off--

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.190
this ritual.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.120
And Rocky was like, it's
psychological warfare.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.790
And this story about Rocky was
he came in with a bad report,

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:26.110
and this is how--

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:29.860
so he came in, went
through the whole routine.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.810
And the report was just
sitting on the desk,

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:36.070
and Arthur didn't say a word,
made 40 calls, Rocky thinks.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:37.870
And then he said,
I'll be right back.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.370
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:40.830
I'll be right back.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.040
Then we'll talk.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.777
So Rocky's sitting there, and
45 minutes later, no Arthur.

00:09:46.777 --> 00:09:48.110
And Rocky went to the secretary.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.630
He's like, is he still here?

00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:53.620
And they said, no,
he went to dinner.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.540
That's his grandson.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.122
And that's how he
let him know he

00:09:57.122 --> 00:09:58.330
wasn't happy with the report.

00:09:58.330 --> 00:09:59.620
So that's Arthur.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:01.614
Gives you a little
taste of Arthur.

00:10:01.614 --> 00:10:03.280
DAVE LANGERT: That's
just the beginning.

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.530
But really, in one of the
reviews of "The Breakaway",

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:09.010
Rick Hogan says that
this story has enough

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:12.130
dysfunction for a couple
of Eugene O'Neill plays.

00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.190
So coming from this
figure, Arthur,

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:17.230
how did all the
dysfunction lay out?

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.830
And can you go into detail
about that family dysfunction?

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:21.580
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.770
I mean, Arthur is
the author of it

00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:26.290
because he set out
the succession plan.

00:10:26.290 --> 00:10:27.760
Arthur was an old school guy.

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:33.910
So he said when I die, the
oldest son inherits the team.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.440
That was Bill.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.230
And that succession plan
extended three generations.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.730
So when Bill died, no
matter what Bill wanted,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:48.760
Rocky was the eldest,
and he got the team.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.170
And so right there
Bill resented kind

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.470
of being ruled from the
grave by his grandfather.

00:10:56.470 --> 00:11:01.202
But the reason for
the Eugene O'Neill--

00:11:01.202 --> 00:11:02.410
I wish I'd written that line.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:08.020
It's great-- is
so Rocky's brother

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:12.940
Peter was with the
Blackhawks for decades

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:19.570
and was almost to the point
of obsequious to Bill.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:21.730
He would never question Bill.

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.070
And had he taken
the team, he would

00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:29.120
have made none of the changes
that led to where we are today.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.620
And it was a good
thing because Bill--

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.750
I got in a little
trouble with this

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:41.740
before, but Bill is a little
Trumpian in the way that--

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.590
there's good old Dollar
Bill, as they called him,

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:46.150
for his cheapness.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:48.100
He wouldn't put the games on TV.

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.840
Drove people insane.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.700
And he was defiant about it.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.080
He'd rub your face in it.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:12:01.450
And you just couldn't say a word
against Bill or you were out.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:02.440
And Rocky did.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.050
He was the one person.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:11.980
So Bill shuffled Rocky
off to run the liquor,

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.940
excommunicated him from
the team, basically.

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:19.060
And Peter ran it, but
he didn't do anything.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:24.620
Bill ran everything and ran
the team into the ground.

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.840
So it got so bad,
how Bill treated

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.880
Rocky, he wrote a
letter to Rocky's

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.960
kids, his own
grandchildren, and said,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:38.620
don't bother showing
up for Thanksgiving,

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.800
and I'll send you
the Christmas gifts.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.440
I mean, that's
his own grandkids,

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.460
and wrote other
ugly stuff to them.

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:52.070
And there's a restaurant,
and Rocky would come in--

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:53.900
there's a restaurant
at the United Center,

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.650
and Bill would be holding court
over here with other family

00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:59.240
members.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.550
And Rocky would be over in
the corner with his wife

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:04.770
and maybe one of his kids.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:09.760
And they never even
looked at each other.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.700
It's crazy and ugly.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:14.980
DAVE LANGERT: You alluded
to this maybe a little bit,

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:16.060
but why?

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:19.295
Why do you think Bill
treated Rocky so poorly?

00:13:19.295 --> 00:13:20.920
BRYAN SMITH: It really
is because Rocky

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.240
was the one person
who dared cross Bill,

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.380
confront him, and
didn't back down.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.670
And you just didn't do that.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:33.220
I mean, if you look at all
of the people in Bill's

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:37.140
inner circle, they
were all yes men.

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.750
There was no one who
would stand up to him.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.230
And Rocky just couldn't do it.

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:45.890
So he bided his time.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:47.980
And I think part
of it, too, Rocky

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.480
was watching the team
just in free fall.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.910
And he frankly
didn't want his name

00:13:54.910 --> 00:14:00.530
associated with this
Hindenburg, this disaster.

00:14:00.530 --> 00:14:03.320
And so he stayed out, did great.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.050
The irony is-- with
the liquor side,

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.600
the irony is when the
team, as it went down,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.980
it was pulling money out of
the liquor side to prop it up.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:19.780
DAVE LANGERT: And Rocky didn't
have just a rough relationship

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.980
with Bill.

00:14:20.980 --> 00:14:23.140
His relationship with
Peter is deeply fraught,

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.770
you mentioned even
going back to childhood.

00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:28.070
What was that all about?

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:32.140
And do you think they'll ever
actually mend the fences?

00:14:32.140 --> 00:14:33.640
BRYAN SMITH: No, I don't.

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:36.310
They don't talk to this day.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:45.250
And Peter-- when they were kids,
they had a falling out over--

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.790
it's kind of this
lurid little side story

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:53.290
that Peter had dated
this much older woman,

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:56.500
by a couple of decades,
and moved out of the house.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:03.760
And the family, the parents
were crushed, and Rocky was mad.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.510
And Rocky came home from
college and confronted Peter,

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:11.420
and he said--

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.000
I think it was a holiday party.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.770
Peter was wearing a tie,
and he pulled the tie out,

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.570
Rocky did, and said lesson one,
don't wear a tie to a fight.

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:27.230
And from that moment on they
were kind of at each other.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.050
And then later,
when Bill and Peter

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:37.580
were huddling together and
plotting against Rocky,

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:42.490
here's probably one of the
most ugly and shocking things

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.350
that really had not
come out before,

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:48.670
was that Bill and Peter were--

00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:51.049
I don't think it's too strong
a word to say scheming or--

00:15:51.049 --> 00:15:52.090
DAVE LANGERT: Conspiring?

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:54.310
BRYAN SMITH: Conspiring
against Rocky.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.330
Whispering campaign.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.440
You can't trust Rocky
to other relatives,

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.840
just spreading scurrilous
rumors about him.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.240
I mean, their own family member.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.260
My god, you know?

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:08.050
And so yeah.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:11.670
And when the father
died, and it was clear

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:18.160
that Rocky was going
to take the team,

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.070
Peter said I'm not going
to make the changes.

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:22.870
I'm not going to go
against Dad's wishes.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:29.020
And Rocky said well, then
I can't make you president.

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.130
I'd love your help, but--

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:35.800
and that really, finally
completely severed

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.110
the relationship.

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.680
Peter had actually gone
behind Rocky's back

00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:45.940
and asked if there was anything
in the will, Bill's will,

00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.270
that the team was left to
him, and did stuff like that.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.020
It was just a mess.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.340
But Rocky took over
and never looked back.

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:00.220
It's like, if you're not
going to help me, OK.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:04.374
But I'm going to change
this team dramatically.

00:17:04.374 --> 00:17:06.040
DAVE LANGERT: And the
family dysfunction

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.940
wasn't the only thing
that was dysfunctional.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:12.670
Bill had been known as
a shrewd businessman

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.599
for most of his life.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.990
But toward the end, and
certainly at the point when

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:19.420
Rocky took over, not
just the Blackhawks,

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.310
but the entire
corporation was really

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.500
in jeopardy of going under.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.520
What happened?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.660
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.160
Yeah.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.960
The whole organization
was tottering.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.040
I mean, you have to remember
that this was '07, '08 was when

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.740
the real estate crash happened.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.340
So the economy is plummeting.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.200
Meanwhile the
Blackhawks are drawing

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:46.540
4,000, 5,000 people a night
in a 20,000 seat arena,

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:50.410
selling no merchandise.

00:17:50.410 --> 00:17:53.260
And part of it is
Bill's stubbornness.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:57.280
Bill thought the way
back to profitability

00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:00.290
was that he'd cut his way
back to profitability.

00:18:00.290 --> 00:18:05.050
So he cut staff, cut staff,
cut staff, cut expenses.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:09.460
Just the TV thing got to be
almost like this weird point

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.240
of pride with him.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.070
He just wouldn't give in on it.

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:16.690
Merchandise, they didn't have
any marketing department.

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:20.890
When Rocky took over the team,
on his first visit around,

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:21.970
there's phones ringing.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.440
No one's answering the phones.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:28.600
And the phone that went to
season tickets, he found out,

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:30.800
didn't actually ring
through to anybody.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.240
It just went off into nowhere.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.790
They didn't have post-its.

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.040
Like Rocky is walking through.

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:40.690
He's like, can I get
a bottle of water?

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.700
And no, we've got a
cooler in the corner.

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:48.759
It's like I don't guess
you have post-its, do you?

00:18:48.759 --> 00:18:49.300
I don't know.

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:52.930
Maybe someone in a desk.

00:18:52.930 --> 00:18:55.390
That was what the
business had come to.

00:18:55.390 --> 00:19:00.460
And Rocky-- I won't
draw parallels here.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:04.390
But Rocky's philosophy
was you've got to spend.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.640
You've got to get
great staff, and you've

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.600
got to make things attractive
to attract that great staff.

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:13.300
Bill thought we don't
want to spoil the players

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.580
and get them their
own charter plane.

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.470
They're too spoiled.

00:19:17.470 --> 00:19:18.970
Rocky though, well,
we're not going

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:23.180
to get these star players if we
have these crappy locker rooms.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.971
We don't have a sales staff.

00:19:24.971 --> 00:19:26.470
So how are we going
to sell tickets?

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.300
So he changed everything.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.880
And it seemed like
it was overnight.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.910
But the difference--

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.520
I think they've sold out
probably more than 500 games

00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:40.000
in a row now, from
4,000 a night to 20,000.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.919
So that's the difference.

00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:44.710
DAVE LANGERT: Yeah.

00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.585
And you described it a
little bit about this,

00:19:46.585 --> 00:19:48.610
but the challenges
that Rocky faced when

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.290
he took over the Blackhawks.

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:55.570
You already mentioned just the
office infrastructure, but just

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:57.006
the general perception as well.

00:19:57.006 --> 00:19:58.630
Can you go into just
how the Blackhawks

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.040
had become an afterthought?

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:00.790
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah.

00:20:00.790 --> 00:20:02.620
You alluded to it.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:06.290
They were named the worst
franchise-- not just hockey,

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.900
in all of sports--

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.710
by ESPN.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:12.010
Bill Wirtz, I think, was
named the worst owner.

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.430
Rocky learned a few
days after he took over

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:18.730
that they were losing
$30 million cash a year.

00:20:18.730 --> 00:20:22.580
Six days into Rocky taking over,
they couldn't make payroll.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.920
And they had to make a capital
call to the liquor company

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.710
just to meet payroll.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:35.120
Again, the national economy is
plunging, and Rocky is going,

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.710
this isn't sustainable.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:39.560
It could take the whole
company down because they were

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.390
in banking, they
were real estate,

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.620
two terrible businesses
to be in '07, '08.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:50.000
And on the surface, what
we all saw was, oh, gosh,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.410
the guy made all
the right steps.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:53.545
And it's fated.

00:20:53.545 --> 00:20:55.670
Dale Tallon had already
picked these great players,

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:59.570
and it's fated to turn around.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:02.570
But really, there must
have been 50 points

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.890
where if it had
gone another way,

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.340
they may have sold the team.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:11.660
They may have moved the team,
original six hockey team.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:18.090
And so he was facing Everest.

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:20.520
DAVE LANGERT: Coming out of
that, I mentioned earlier

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.470
"Forbes" called it
the greatest sports

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.110
business turnaround in history.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:28.500
So what lessons do you think
can be learned from a business

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.470
perspective, and how
Rocky changed things

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:32.730
from what Bill had run?

00:21:32.730 --> 00:21:33.510
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.890
I think quickly,
the one thing is--

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:40.680
yeah, it's awesome.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.580
He let me, by the way,
take some pictures

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.220
with the cup by myself.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.224
It was really cool.

00:21:45.224 --> 00:21:46.890
He had remembered
that I wrote the story

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.484
and invited me to the office,
like come take some pictures.

00:21:49.484 --> 00:21:51.650
DAVE LANGERT: I doubt Bill
would have done the same.

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:52.399
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah.

00:21:52.399 --> 00:21:54.720
Bill would have done it, yeah.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.210
Get over here.

00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.110
So business lessons.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.810
We alluded to it.

00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:08.149
Cutting your way to success
versus investing smartly.

00:22:08.149 --> 00:22:09.690
Rocky says the best
thing he ever did

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:13.110
was hire John McDonough,
the amazing marketing whiz

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:14.790
from the Cubs.

00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:16.950
His best sell job, Rocky says.

00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:19.590
So that's one lesson.

00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:25.190
The other lesson
is recognizing--

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:29.400
it's sort of reading the
room, embracing your fans

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.610
and knowing how hurt they are.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:34.860
Rocky said it wasn't
that we were just bad.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.000
We were irrelevant.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.870
No one cared.

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:41.970
And so embracing the
fans by bringing back

00:22:41.970 --> 00:22:47.830
Stan Mikita and Bobby Hull,
mending all these fences.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:50.840
When Rocky took over he said,
we were in the grudge business,

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.340
and we're not going to succeed
being in the grudge business.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:58.230
There is a business
upside to treating people

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:00.900
right and treating people well.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.140
And the outpouring, I think--

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:06.450
Rocky was a rock
star for those years.

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:11.220
I mean, he could barely walk the
concourse without being mobbed.

00:23:11.220 --> 00:23:13.410
And it was because
he had this team

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:18.510
that we grew up with and
loved and watched them--

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:24.250
Bill-- stick his thumb in our
eye and take that from us.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.560
And Rocky-- of course, it
was cast of thousands--

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.810
but gave that back.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.950
This is a team generations
grew up loving.

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:40.080
And he gave that back, and
that's pretty powerful.

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:41.520
DAVE LANGERT: And
Bill never would

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.810
have walked the concourse.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.590
He always watched
from his suite.

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:51.240
And he had an aisle
seat in the 100 level

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.369
where anyone could come up.

00:23:52.369 --> 00:23:53.410
BRYAN SMITH: Rocky, yeah.

00:23:53.410 --> 00:23:55.826
DAVE LANGERT: There's a cute
story about a little boy that

00:23:55.826 --> 00:23:57.164
approached him.

00:23:57.164 --> 00:23:58.830
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah,
completely different.

00:23:58.830 --> 00:24:00.920
Yeah, Bill holed up in
his office with scotch--

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.610
he drank a lot--

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:08.110
and Peter, and just watched
another horrible game.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.780
And

00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.240
DAVE LANGERT: So I have
a couple more questions.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.920
But I'd like to open
it up if any of you

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.362
have questions you want to ask.

00:24:16.362 --> 00:24:17.820
AUDIENCE: So
obviously is an expose

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.360
that airs a lot of
family dirty laundry.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:22.440
Rocky was on board.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.930
How is the rest of the family?

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.312
Did Peter and everyone come
to you, like, don't do this?

00:24:26.312 --> 00:24:28.020
What was the reaction
from everyone else?

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:31.650
BRYAN SMITH: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:36.090
And as a corollary, a lot
of people have asked--

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.130
and I wonder, found
myself wondering--

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:41.730
look, I'm a journalist.

00:24:41.730 --> 00:24:45.000
I mean, I'm paid to dig
out this kind of stuff.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.070
But a couple of times it
was so painful to hear.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:51.300
I was like, are you sure?

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.760
I mean, are you good with this?

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.450
And he said put it all in,
Rocky did, to his credit.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.500
And so yeah, the siblings.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.230
As I say, Rocky
and his siblings--

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:11.994
I think he occasionally talks to
his sisters, but not to Peter.

00:25:11.994 --> 00:25:13.410
And none of them
would talk to me.

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:19.650
And I really tried because
I knew Peter really came off

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:22.030
looking bad in the story.

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.080
But you have to be fair.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.710
And I told him, I can tell
the story, or your story,

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.870
or these people can tell
your story, or you can.

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:35.070
It's weird.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.260
It's almost like he
had a psychic break,

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.000
like PTSD or something.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.010
He just cannot--
when he was leaving,

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:48.840
he left this beautiful, gracious
letter saying how much he loved

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:53.620
the team and pledged his
loyalty and life to the team.

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:56.580
But after Rocky started
making all the changes,

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:58.590
he stopped coming to games.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:03.150
He divested of anything having
to do with the Blackhawks.

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:05.820
He's still on the
board of Wirtz Corp.,

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.600
but doesn't have
anything to do with them.

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:11.070
It's just really weird.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.680
He didn't come to
any of the parades.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:15.690
Stanley Cups.

00:26:15.690 --> 00:26:16.340
That's sad.

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.980
And they actually sued Rocky
for some little dumb thing

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.480
after they'd won
a couple of cups.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.810
So fortunately I did
find some relatives,

00:26:27.810 --> 00:26:33.530
like Bill's sister,
Rocky's aunt, who backed up

00:26:33.530 --> 00:26:35.340
Rocky's side of the story.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.840
And she was very,
very Aunt Betty.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.420
Not to be messed with.

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:43.840
And she told it.

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:45.280
And so yeah.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:48.570
And also, why would Rocky--

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:50.610
he spent a lot of
money promoting this.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.790
Why would he push
something that is so

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.910
filled with these
intimate family details?

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:59.310
And I'm still not sure.

00:26:59.310 --> 00:27:01.290
I think he wants
it to be a legacy.

00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:03.690
He wants a story out
there to be known.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.890
And his half of the royalties
do go to the Blackhawks

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:10.620
Foundation, which is good.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.010
it's not like he's trying
to make money off of this.

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:17.320
I mean, me, charity
begins at home.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.970
DAVE LANGERT: There will be
books for sale in the back.

00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.470
BRYAN SMITH: We
have books for sale.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.770
Makes a great Christmas gift.

00:27:23.770 --> 00:27:28.470
And I'll be thrilled
to sign them for you.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.517
So, yeah.

00:27:30.517 --> 00:27:31.350
AUDIENCE: Hi, Bryan.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.650
Thanks for coming in.

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:33.900
I'm excited to read your book.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.120
BRYAN SMITH: Oh, good.Thanks.

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:36.620
AUDIENCE: So this
is the perspective

00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.220
of a newer Blackhawks fan.

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:39.600
So I didn't grow up--

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.680
I was too young to know
the Arthur and Bill eras.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.230
So I find the time line
really interesting,

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.090
and you alluded to
this at the beginning,

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:49.506
because the dominoes
were starting

00:27:49.506 --> 00:27:51.630
to fall a little bit
in the right direction.

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:54.300
During Bill's
final few years yes

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:56.520
they drafted a guy named
Patrick Kane, a guy named

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.070
Jonathan Toews in back-to-back
years, kind of important.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:28:02.580
And you had Stan Bowman, who
was already in the organization

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.380
kind of rising up already.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.390
Just from your perspective, if--

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:09.570
maybe take away the
huge debt that they

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:11.700
were in that kind of
Rocky found out about.

00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.180
But if Bill is still
on the team for, say,

00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.104
all the way another
five years, how

00:28:17.104 --> 00:28:18.270
do you think that plays out?

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.070
I mean, they're still
probably competing

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.152
for a Stanley Cup championship.

00:28:22.152 --> 00:28:23.610
BRYAN SMITH: It's
a great question,

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.690
and people ask it a lot.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.310
Dale Tallon made a
lot of those moves,

00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:30.000
and he got fired shortly
after Rocky came on board.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.880
He did something,
just a business

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.490
decision that was terrible.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:38.500
It's in the book, cost
the team millions.

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:42.510
And he just-- he had a
decent eye for talent,

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:45.090
but he didn't know
what he was doing.

00:28:45.090 --> 00:28:50.880
Any more, General Manager has to
be a really shrewd businessman.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.860
Rock's answer would be-- and
McDonough's and everyone else--

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.260
is that we had stars before.

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.810
We had a lot of
stars, great players,

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:01.780
and we were in last
place every year.

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.120
So it's hard to say.

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.760
I definitely don't
believe they would

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:14.730
have been the kind
of cup contenders

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:22.620
that they were because part
of what took that corps

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:26.130
and made it into that--
you remember that first cup

00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:30.390
team was so deep
with great players.

00:29:30.390 --> 00:29:31.500
Dustin Byfuglien, right?

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.380
I mean, the Buff, Big Buff.

00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.790
And what attracted
those players,

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:39.240
though, was sellout
crowds every night

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:42.360
and brand new locker
rooms and a new charter

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:45.510
jet and big salaries.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.210
Maybe overpaying
for some players.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:52.890
So I really do believe
it wouldn't have played

00:29:52.890 --> 00:29:55.110
out anywhere near the same.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.770
They probably would have
had a little blip maybe up.

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:03.690
But as you know, it
shot up and sustained.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:06.700
It's a long time, 10 years,
11 years, to be on the top.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:08.670
They're struggling now.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.100
So yeah.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:13.179
It's a great question, though.

00:30:13.179 --> 00:30:14.470
DAVE LANGERT: Go ahead, please.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.432
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:30:15.432 --> 00:30:16.140
I'm just curious.

00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:20.340
I mean, much of this has
been about how many negatives

00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:22.680
that Rocky has pulled
from Bill and his family.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.080
Is there anything that he
mentioned that he did take away

00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:29.400
as a positive that he attributes
some of his success to as well?

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.700
BRYAN SMITH: From his family?

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:31.230
Yeah.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:32.320
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:34.600
It's a great question.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.700
A lot of people--

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:37.470
all the people I
talked to say Rocky

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:40.410
is a lot more like
his grandfather.

00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:45.630
His grandfather was
a tough SOB, but he

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:50.580
wasn't like Bill, sort of just
belligerent to be belligerent

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:55.470
just because he kind
of got off on it.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:31:00.420
Arthur was-- at the end,
it was all about business.

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:04.500
And Arthur actually
admired Rocky

00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:07.710
because he saw Rocky
was standing up

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:10.380
to Bill when no one else would.

00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:16.440
And so rocky definitely says he
took those lessons from Arthur,

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:17.720
mostly.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.250
And we get into
this a little bit.

00:31:20.250 --> 00:31:24.000
Rocky's mom is kind of
a shadow figure, right?

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.130
I mean, he had a mom.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:27.660
And she was terrific.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.010
She was terrific, Joan.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:32.490
She died young of breast cancer.

00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:33.990
And she was the
only other person

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:35.880
who could put a check on Bill.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.700
And she was compassionate.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.290
She was fun.

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.000
She invited Rocky's
friends over.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.255
And Rocky took a lot,
I think, from her.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:49.950
That's where I think--

00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:52.050
it's like how, after
all these tough guys,

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:57.270
does Rocky turn out to be this
kind of really super great guy,

00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:59.160
tough but good guy?

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.430
And I think she had a lot to
do with that in the family.

00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:06.000
So I would say those
two influences for sure.

00:32:09.270 --> 00:32:12.990
DAVE LANGERT: So what do
you think the future holds

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:16.230
for the Wirtz Corporation?

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.670
Rocky has a son, Danny.

00:32:17.670 --> 00:32:19.980
He's an interesting
character in the book.

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.910
Do you think he'll ultimately
take over the corporation?

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:26.730
BRYAN SMITH: Well, it is
an interesting question

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:32.130
for all you Blackhawks fans,
what is going to happen.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:35.110
First of all, Danny
is a good guy.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:36.480
He's a super smart guy.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.880
Sorry-- he's not a Peter.

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:45.180
He's a smart guy
who would never be

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:50.460
in the grudge business in the
way that Peter and Bill were.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.410
And he is an interesting story.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.630
Oop, did I lose--?

00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:57.960
When he was a young guy,
he was like rebel guy.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.050
He moved to London.

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:00.810
He was in the music business.

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:06.269
Colored hair, leather,
the whole thing.

00:33:06.269 --> 00:33:07.560
And I think he got a nose ring.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.060
And Rocky put the
foot down there.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.960
It's like, OK, you can
keep the nose ring,

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.992
but I'm taking the car.

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:15.700
One or the other.

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.207
And so he took
the nose ring out.

00:33:21.296 --> 00:33:24.000
And that gets back to
the business piece of it.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.610
So Danny grew up in
like Google times,

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:36.090
very tech savvy, very immersed
in tech and the emerging

00:33:36.090 --> 00:33:37.680
digital music.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:42.030
And so he's really--

00:33:42.030 --> 00:33:42.999
he'd be great.

00:33:42.999 --> 00:33:44.040
He's poised to take over.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.560
And he's running, essentially,
the liquor side now.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:52.110
But that succession plan of
Arthur's ended with Rocky.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:55.857
So it's kind of
up in the air now.

00:33:55.857 --> 00:33:57.690
I think Rocky would
love Peter to take over,

00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:58.980
and Peter would want to do it.

00:33:58.980 --> 00:34:00.060
I mean-- Peter.

00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:00.570
Danny.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:04.452
But we don't know.

00:34:04.452 --> 00:34:05.910
We'll have to see
how it plays out.

00:34:05.910 --> 00:34:07.660
I think it may wind
up in court, actually.

00:34:11.124 --> 00:34:12.790
DAVE LANGERT: One
thing that struck me--

00:34:12.790 --> 00:34:16.920
you kind of brought it to mind
when you were discussing just

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.005
how Rocky borrowed
a lot from Arthur.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:26.250
My impression reading the book
is that Bill and Rocky both ran

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.679
the organization and
the Blackhawks the way

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.750
they viewed Arthur
would want it to be run.

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.929
And they just had
completely different views

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.684
as to what Arthur
would really like.

00:34:36.684 --> 00:34:38.850
And maybe it's the way that
he interacted with them,

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.453
but what are your
thoughts on that?

00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:42.869
BRYAN SMITH: Anyway, we've
only got a couple minutes left,

00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:43.452
so we're good.

00:34:43.452 --> 00:34:44.469
We're good.

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:47.739
By all means, just shout out
a question if you have it.

00:34:47.739 --> 00:34:49.239
But yeah.

00:34:49.239 --> 00:34:51.404
Yeah, for sure.

00:34:54.250 --> 00:34:57.510
I think that's what
made Bill so bitter

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:01.530
was being rules from the
grave, as Rocky put it,

00:35:01.530 --> 00:35:03.570
by his father, Arthur.

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:07.740
He just couldn't
stand it that there

00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:11.250
was nothing he could do to keep
the team out of Rocky's hands.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:17.800
And Bill planted these
stories in the paper.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:21.810
And so did Peter, kind
of spoke coyly when

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:23.820
people would say, well,
who's going to take over

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:25.140
when you die, Bill?

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:26.440
Well, we don't know.

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.650
We don't really talk about that.

00:35:28.650 --> 00:35:31.500
And Peter would say things
like, well, I don't know,

00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.525
but I would be
honored, of course.

00:35:35.777 --> 00:35:38.110
And I love the team and I've
been with them for a while,

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:39.330
and I'd be great.

00:35:39.330 --> 00:35:42.390
DAVE LANGERT: But we don't know.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.270
BRYAN SMITH: And Rocky told
me, he's like, oh my god.

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:47.340
He said he would
read that, he'd go

00:35:47.340 --> 00:35:52.350
that's the one thing we talked
about was the succession plan.

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.990
Everybody knew it.

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.740
It was no mystery.

00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.460
And as hard as Bill
and Peter tried--

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:00.660
and they tried everything.

00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:01.920
Lawyers.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:06.270
They looked for any
loophole crack they could

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:08.080
find in that succession plan.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:10.240
They just couldn't do it.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.285
And I think it drove Bill crazy.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.210
And I think that's
part of why he just--

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:18.960
I mean, can you
imagine doing that?

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:23.500
Like I'm sorry, I don't
mean to be political,

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.370
but can you imagine taking
a team, just because

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:30.720
of your personal feelings and
hurts, a franchise, beloved,

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.270
and just wrecking it,
just letting it go?

00:36:33.270 --> 00:36:34.860
And actually there's
one other thing.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:38.490
And it's interesting
for Hawks fans to know,

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:40.540
and it hadn't come out.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.600
I hadn't known.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.870
Bill had dementia
in the last days.

00:36:47.870 --> 00:36:52.870
It was escalating, and he
was still running the team.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.380
So a lot of his
decisions were informed

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:57.760
by this escalating dementia.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.780
And there's an
anecdote in the book,

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.850
and it was really super sad.

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:06.300
Bill knew Chicago
like a taxi driver,

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.570
and he was supposed to be
at a board meeting downtown.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.911
And he called in.

00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:14.410
He was half an hour late and
he called--and he's never late,

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:16.170
and he called and
he said, I'm lost.

00:37:16.170 --> 00:37:19.050
I don't know where
the meeting is.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:22.620
And whoever answered the phone
said, well, where are you?

00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:25.290
And he said Joliet, I think.

00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:27.610
He was supposed to be
downtown in the Loop.

00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:32.250
And yet he's still ran the team.

00:37:32.250 --> 00:37:35.550
And Rocky covered for him.

00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:39.690
The family tried to not let it
out that this was happening.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.680
And that's kind of a
weird thing to know.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.800
It gets back to you
asked, what happened?

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.080
Bill wasn't perfect.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:53.070
But in his day, he was
a great business man.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:56.700
But toward the end he was
just making crazy decisions,

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.960
like I think they were going to
put a Walmart near the family

00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.280
farm out there.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.640
And so he's like, yeah, buy
a bunch of shares in Walmart

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.850
so I can get on the
board and give 'em hell.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:12.810
It's like, OK.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:14.370
OK, Dad.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:15.620
And they wouldn't do it.

00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:18.660
So anyway.

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:22.440
DAVE LANGERT: Well, on that note
I think we can conclude this.

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.300
We have a video of Blackhawks
players reading the book

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.420
that we'll close off on.

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:31.001
There are copies
available in the back.

00:38:31.001 --> 00:38:32.750
BRYAN SMITH: Makes a
great Christmas gift.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.070
DAVE LANGERT: Yep.

00:38:33.070 --> 00:38:35.737
And it's also available on
Amazon and other bookstores.

00:38:35.737 --> 00:38:37.020
BRYAN SMITH: Yes, indeed.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:37.560
DAVE LANGERT: Thank you.

00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:38.190
BRYAN SMITH: Thank you.

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:38.923
It was fun.

00:38:38.923 --> 00:38:39.909
Thanks, you guys.
