00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.700
Now, let's discuss some of
the details of viruses.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.760
First, let's take a look
at the structure of virus.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.630
A virus infects a program by
modifying the program code.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.140
That is, the virus code has
to be physically inserted

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.900
into the program file.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.300
Logically, when
the infected program runs,

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.180
the virus' codes run first,
then the original program will run, so

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.410
that the user will not suspect that
the program has been infected.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.760
And then at the end,

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.680
there could some virus code that
does clean up to avoid detection.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.659
If you look at the infected program,

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.310
the first line controls that the virus
program will always run first.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.950
It is critically important to put
this control in the first line

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.560
of the infected program, because this
is the only way to guarantee that

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.840
the virus code will always be run
whenever the program executes.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.969
It is also important to put
a marker in the infected program.

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.953
Such as putting a special flag in the
second line of the infected program to

00:00:57.953 --> 00:01:01.630
indicate whether the program has
been infected by the virus or not.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.019
Otherwise a program can
be repeatedly infected.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.310
When the virus code is run, it typically
first finds other programs to infect.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.230
Of course, it will check whether
a program has been infected already

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.220
by looking at the special flag.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.900
In addition to infecting other programs,
the virus code can also perform other

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.780
malicious activities on the system,
such as stealing valuable documents.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.350
After performing the malicious
actions the virus will then

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.890
transfer the control to
the original program so

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.730
that the normal work can be performed in
such a way the user would not notice.

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.870
The virus code can also perform other
actions in order to avoid detection.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.490
For example, because the virus code is
physically inserted into the original

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.580
program file the file size of the
original program obviously increases.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.145
And this can be a tell tale sign
that a program has been infected.

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:57.505
Therefore, in order to avoid detection,

00:01:57.505 --> 00:02:01.745
the virus code can compress the infected
program so that the file size

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:05.715
is the same as the size of
the program before it is infected.
