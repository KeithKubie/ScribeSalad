00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.970
consider that your game might be being
played on a Android device with a notch

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980
played on a Android device with a notch
 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.370
played on a Android device with a notch
so we've added a bunch of api's best

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380
so we've added a bunch of api's best
 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.110
so we've added a bunch of api's best
practices online and actually some

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120
practices online and actually some
 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.310
practices online and actually some
developer tools where you can simulate

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320
developer tools where you can simulate
 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.530
developer tools where you can simulate
notches on a device so I recommend that

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540
notches on a device so I recommend that
 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.150
notches on a device so I recommend that
you take a look at how your game is

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160
you take a look at how your game is
 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.710
you take a look at how your game is
running on a notch device and make sure

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720
running on a notch device and make sure
 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.840
running on a notch device and make sure
that the UI is not being cut off or

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850
that the UI is not being cut off or
 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.699
that the UI is not being cut off or
there's other rendering issues there

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709
there's other rendering issues there
 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.949
there's other rendering issues there
happening there notifications

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
happening there notifications
 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.960
happening there notifications
notification channels are now compulsory

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970
notification channels are now compulsory
 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.390
notification channels are now compulsory
as of API level 26 so you'll need to

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400
as of API level 26 so you'll need to
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.280
as of API level 26 so you'll need to
specify a specific channel for each of

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290
specify a specific channel for each of
 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.500
specify a specific channel for each of
one of your notifications and basically

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510
one of your notifications and basically
 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.050
one of your notifications and basically
what this lets users do is activate or

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060
what this lets users do is activate or
 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.970
what this lets users do is activate or
deactivate certain channels that they

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980
deactivate certain channels that they
 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.670
deactivate certain channels that they
maybe care about and also they can

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680
maybe care about and also they can
 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.890
maybe care about and also they can
customize the behavior of each one of

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900
customize the behavior of each one of
 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.990
customize the behavior of each one of
the notification channels so really what

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000
the notification channels so really what
 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.059
the notification channels so really what
this means for you guys is to think

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069
this means for you guys is to think
 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:51.650
this means for you guys is to think
about what kind of channels you're

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660
about what kind of channels you're
 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.590
about what kind of channels you're
putting your notifications in and not

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600
putting your notifications in and not
 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.809
putting your notifications in and not
spamming the user and kind of being

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819
spamming the user and kind of being
 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.250
spamming the user and kind of being
aware that people might be turning

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260
aware that people might be turning
 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.830
aware that people might be turning
things on and off as they upgrade to

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840
things on and off as they upgrade to

biggest ass we've been getting from

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:01.710
biggest ass we've been getting from
 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.010
biggest ass we've been getting from
users on Chromebooks is they want to

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020
users on Chromebooks is they want to
 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.610
users on Chromebooks is they want to
play games on it

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620
play games on it
 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:07.430
play games on it
and Google's putting a huge amount of

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440
and Google's putting a huge amount of
 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.020
and Google's putting a huge amount of
effort into kind of building out the

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030
effort into kind of building out the
 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.750
effort into kind of building out the
Chrome OS ecosystem so again kind of

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:11.760
Chrome OS ecosystem so again kind of
 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.010
Chrome OS ecosystem so again kind of
going back to building a high quality

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020
going back to building a high quality
 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.350
going back to building a high quality
experience you might have users that are

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360
experience you might have users that are
 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.850
experience you might have users that are
playing on Chromebooks and should be

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860
playing on Chromebooks and should be
 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.040
playing on Chromebooks and should be
aware that they could be playing on

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050
aware that they could be playing on
 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.930
aware that they could be playing on
Chromebooks so this is a kind of a huge

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940
Chromebooks so this is a kind of a huge
 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.930
Chromebooks so this is a kind of a huge
new area of Android that presents a huge

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:23.940
new area of Android that presents a huge
 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.840
new area of Android that presents a huge
opportunity to collect more users and

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850
opportunity to collect more users and
 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:29.390
opportunity to collect more users and
also play it in a way that for your game

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400
also play it in a way that for your game
 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.600
also play it in a way that for your game
for specific your gameplay design might

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:32.610
for specific your gameplay design might
 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:34.360
for specific your gameplay design might
actually be a much better way to play it

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370
actually be a much better way to play it
 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.149

might be some giant ugly black bars

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800
might be some giant ugly black bars
 

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.579

dynamic resizing is the default so when

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:36.990
dynamic resizing is the default so when
 

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:39.110
dynamic resizing is the default so when
you launch any kind of Android app it's

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120
you launch any kind of Android app it's
 

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.550
you launch any kind of Android app it's
in a window that can be dynamically

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:40.560
in a window that can be dynamically
 

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.059
in a window that can be dynamically
resized fortunately in the game world we

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:44.069
resized fortunately in the game world we
 

00:08:44.069 --> 00:08:45.319
resized fortunately in the game world we
don't really deal with dynamic resizing

00:08:45.319 --> 00:08:45.329
don't really deal with dynamic resizing
 

00:08:45.329 --> 00:08:47.059
don't really deal with dynamic resizing
and a lot of game engines don't handle

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:47.069
and a lot of game engines don't handle
 

00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:47.600
and a lot of game engines don't handle
that very well

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:47.610
that very well
 

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.269
that very well
so consider maybe disabling dynamic

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279
so consider maybe disabling dynamic
 

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:52.740
so consider maybe disabling dynamic
resizing or just locking into fullscreen

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:52.750
resizing or just locking into fullscreen
 

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.570
resizing or just locking into fullscreen
and then kind of obviously the biggest

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:54.580
and then kind of obviously the biggest
 

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:55.920
and then kind of obviously the biggest
difference is now you've got a keyboard

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:55.930
difference is now you've got a keyboard
 

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:58.020

in the case of the pixel book attached

00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:58.030
in the case of the pixel book attached
 

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.240
in the case of the pixel book attached
to the device and as we see more and

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:00.250
to the device and as we see more and
 

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:01.770
to the device and as we see more and
more games kind of blurring the line

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:01.780
more games kind of blurring the line
 

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:04.080
more games kind of blurring the line
between you know consoles and PCs you've

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.090

thing it's not listed here is that you
 

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.850
thing it's not listed here is that you
know a lot of mobile devices are ARM

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:26.860
know a lot of mobile devices are ARM
 

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.980
know a lot of mobile devices are ARM
based and a lot of developers don't ship

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:28.990
based and a lot of developers don't ship
 

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:31.350
based and a lot of developers don't ship
an x86 version a lot of Chromebooks are

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360
an x86 version a lot of Chromebooks are
 

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.110
an x86 version a lot of Chromebooks are
x86 based so you should be aware that

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.120
x86 based so you should be aware that
 

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.190
x86 based so you should be aware that
you might see some performance

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:35.200
you might see some performance
 

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.550
you might see some performance
degradation due to the translation that

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:38.560
degradation due to the translation that
 

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.920
degradation due to the translation that
happens when you try to do an arm so an

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:40.930
happens when you try to do an arm so an
 

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.530
happens when you try to do an arm so an
arm apk will run on an x86 through

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:43.540
arm apk will run on an x86 through
 

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.960
arm apk will run on an x86 through
Houdini it's a translation layer but

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:45.970
Houdini it's a translation layer but
 

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.190
Houdini it's a translation layer but
you'll kind of get that overhead there

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200
you'll kind of get that overhead there
 

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.920
you'll kind of get that overhead there
so if you can ship an x86 version you

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:49.930
so if you can ship an x86 version you
 

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.190
so if you can ship an x86 version you
should definitely take it and do that

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200
 
 

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.460
 
so vainglory is a mobile for example

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:55.470
so vainglory is a mobile for example

developed by super evil Megacorp they

00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240
developed by super evil Megacorp they
 

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.680

their keyboard skill bindings and item
 

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.120
their keyboard skill bindings and item
usage and they still left the

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:06.130
usage and they still left the
 

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.980
usage and they still left the
touchscreen controls in and they

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:07.990
touchscreen controls in and they
 

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.270
touchscreen controls in and they
actually told me they found an

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:09.280
actually told me they found an
 

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.620
actually told me they found an
interesting kind of hybrid approach

use cases for this that will hopefully
make debugging and profiling and

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:24.130
make debugging and profiling and
 

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:27.329
make debugging and profiling and
optimizing for Android much easier so

00:13:27.329 --> 00:13:27.339
optimizing for Android much easier so
 

00:13:27.339 --> 00:13:30.240
optimizing for Android much easier so
the first here as you can see that we've

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.250
the first here as you can see that we've
 

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.400
the first here as you can see that we've
highlighted this this thread and I don't

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:32.410
highlighted this this thread and I don't
 

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.660
highlighted this this thread and I don't
know if you can see if there's some red

00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:33.670
know if you can see if there's some red
 

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:36.060
know if you can see if there's some red
red frames right there so they kind of

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:36.070
red frames right there so they kind of
 

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:38.400
red frames right there so they kind of
indicate that those are slow frames so

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:38.410
indicate that those are slow frames so
 

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.980
indicate that those are slow frames so
you can dig in and kind of see maybe

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:40.990
you can dig in and kind of see maybe
 

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.629
you can dig in and kind of see maybe
outside of your game why something might

00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639
outside of your game why something might
 

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:46.800
outside of your game why something might
be causing those slow frames and here

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:46.810
be causing those slow frames and here
 

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:48.090
be causing those slow frames and here
you can actually see on this we've

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:48.100
you can actually see on this we've
 

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.800
you can actually see on this we've
highlighted this thread you can see it's

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:49.810
highlighted this thread you can see it's
 

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:51.420
highlighted this thread you can see it's
jumping across the different CPU cores

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:51.430
jumping across the different CPU cores
 

00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:53.790
jumping across the different CPU cores
which could be causing some performance

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:53.800
which could be causing some performance
 

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.650
which could be causing some performance
impact so you might consider setting

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:55.660
impact so you might consider setting
 

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.050
impact so you might consider setting
thread affinity for that specific thread

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:58.060
thread affinity for that specific thread
 

00:13:58.060 --> 00:14:03.180
thread affinity for that specific thread
to kind of stay on one core and here we

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:03.190
to kind of stay on one core and here we
 

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:04.470
to kind of stay on one core and here we
can see that this is a very very

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480
can see that this is a very very
 

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.840
can see that this is a very very
terrible frame it's taking a long time

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:06.850
terrible frame it's taking a long time
 

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:08.910
terrible frame it's taking a long time
but now inside a new studio you'll be

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920
but now inside a new studio you'll be
 

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:11.069
but now inside a new studio you'll be
able to dig in and figure out why it's

00:14:11.069 --> 00:14:11.079
able to dig in and figure out why it's
 

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:12.900

right is your game and then in the

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:47.680
right is your game and then in the
 

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.230
right is your game and then in the
middle is kind of your script window and

00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:49.240
middle is kind of your script window and
 

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.120
middle is kind of your script window and
as you play through the game like you

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:51.130
as you play through the game like you
 

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:53.010
as you play through the game like you
would normally it's writing a test

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:53.020
would normally it's writing a test
 

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:54.720
would normally it's writing a test
script for you so it's trying to do all

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:54.730
script for you so it's trying to do all
 

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.420
script for you so it's trying to do all
the things that you do on true doing and

00:16:59.420 --> 00:16:59.430
the things that you do on true doing and
 

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.920
the things that you do on true doing and
basically what you can do is you can

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:01.930
basically what you can do is you can
 

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:03.840
basically what you can do is you can
write out this entire script you can

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:03.850
write out this entire script you can
 

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.340
write out this entire script you can
tell it to do things like click on

00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:05.350
tell it to do things like click on
 

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:09.090
tell it to do things like click on
buttons assert that player models it

00:17:09.090 --> 00:17:09.100
buttons assert that player models it
 

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:11.699
buttons assert that player models it
should be there are there move things up

00:17:11.699 --> 00:17:11.709
should be there are there move things up
 

00:17:11.709 --> 00:17:13.110
should be there are there move things up
and down they see anything that you

00:17:13.110 --> 00:17:13.120
and down they see anything that you
 

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.929
and down they see anything that you
could do playing the game air test can

00:17:15.929 --> 00:17:15.939
could do playing the game air test can
 

00:17:15.939 --> 00:17:18.420
could do playing the game air test can
can also emulate it and then what you do

00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:18.430
can also emulate it and then what you do
 

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:20.850
can also emulate it and then what you do
is you run the test and it actually

00:17:20.850 --> 00:17:20.860
is you run the test and it actually
 

00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:23.610
is you run the test and it actually
plays to your game each step gives you

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:23.620
plays to your game each step gives you
 

00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:28.140
plays to your game each step gives you
all the output and for each step in the

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:28.150
all the output and for each step in the
 

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.910
all the output and for each step in the
test after it's done it'll give you a

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:29.920
test after it's done it'll give you a
 

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.890
test after it's done it'll give you a
report here we'll see in a second that

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:31.900
report here we'll see in a second that
 

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.050
report here we'll see in a second that
shows you the results of all those steps

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:34.060
shows you the results of all those steps
 

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.390
shows you the results of all those steps
so it'll show you what steps failed if

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400
so it'll show you what steps failed if
 

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.030
so it'll show you what steps failed if
there's any warnings or errors it'll

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:39.040
there's any warnings or errors it'll
 

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.940
there's any warnings or errors it'll
give you a log of all the screenshots of

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:44.950
give you a log of all the screenshots of
 

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:46.649
give you a log of all the screenshots of
all of the different steps

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:46.659
all of the different steps
 

00:17:46.659 --> 00:17:48.180
all of the different steps
so it's really useful to kind of maybe

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:48.190
so it's really useful to kind of maybe
 

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:50.700
so it's really useful to kind of maybe
do this for things like first time user

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:50.710
do this for things like first time user
 

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:52.680
do this for things like first time user
experience or a tutorial level or just

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:52.690
experience or a tutorial level or just
 

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.289
experience or a tutorial level or just
other kinds of boilerplate areas of your

00:17:55.289 --> 00:17:55.299
other kinds of boilerplate areas of your
 

00:17:55.299 --> 00:17:57.419
other kinds of boilerplate areas of your
gameplay that you might test at one

00:17:57.419 --> 00:17:57.429
gameplay that you might test at one
 

00:17:57.429 --> 00:18:00.989
gameplay that you might test at one
point and everything works fine you go

00:18:00.989 --> 00:18:00.999
point and everything works fine you go
 

00:18:00.999 --> 00:18:02.549
point and everything works fine you go
and you do a bunch more changes for a

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559
and you do a bunch more changes for a
 

00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:04.049
and you do a bunch more changes for a
couple more weeks and new features and

00:18:04.049 --> 00:18:04.059
couple more weeks and new features and
 

00:18:04.059 --> 00:18:05.849
couple more weeks and new features and
then you go back and everything's broken

00:18:05.849 --> 00:18:05.859
then you go back and everything's broken
 

00:18:05.859 --> 00:18:08.249
then you go back and everything's broken
so this is a great way of kind of

00:18:08.249 --> 00:18:08.259
so this is a great way of kind of
 

00:18:08.259 --> 00:18:10.440
so this is a great way of kind of
writing these tests and automating the

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:10.450
writing these tests and automating the
 

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.940
writing these tests and automating the
whole process that you don't have to do

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:11.950
whole process that you don't have to do
 

00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:14.700
whole process that you don't have to do
it over and over and over again and kind

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:14.710
it over and over and over again and kind
 

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.009
it over and over and over again and kind
of underlying err test here is there's

00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:17.019
of underlying err test here is there's
 

00:18:17.019 --> 00:18:19.109
of underlying err test here is there's
two two frameworks at work there's air

00:18:19.109 --> 00:18:19.119
two two frameworks at work there's air
 

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:20.999
two two frameworks at work there's air
test which is using image recognition

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:21.009
test which is using image recognition
 

00:18:21.009 --> 00:18:22.799
test which is using image recognition
just looking at the pixels on the screen

00:18:22.799 --> 00:18:22.809
just looking at the pixels on the screen
 

00:18:22.809 --> 00:18:25.589
just looking at the pixels on the screen
and then if you want more integrated

00:18:25.589 --> 00:18:25.599
and then if you want more integrated
 

00:18:25.599 --> 00:18:27.599
and then if you want more integrated
testing or more kind of complex test

00:18:27.599 --> 00:18:27.609
testing or more kind of complex test
 

00:18:27.609 --> 00:18:29.999
testing or more kind of complex test
cases you can integrate pocos which is

00:18:29.999 --> 00:18:30.009
cases you can integrate pocos which is
 

00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:33.359
cases you can integrate pocos which is
basically it exposes the UI and object

00:18:33.359 --> 00:18:33.369
basically it exposes the UI and object
 

00:18:33.369 --> 00:18:36.149
basically it exposes the UI and object
hierarchy inside your game and there's

00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159
hierarchy inside your game and there's
 

00:18:36.159 --> 00:18:39.450
hierarchy inside your game and there's
plug-ins for poco for unity Koko's and

plug-ins for poco for unity Koko's and
 

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.930
plug-ins for poco for unity Koko's and
other custom game engines so you kinda

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:42.940
other custom game engines so you kinda
 

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.700
other custom game engines so you kinda
have a - two flavors you can use depend

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:44.710
have a - two flavors you can use depend
 

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.649
have a - two flavors you can use depend
on how deep you want to integrate this

00:18:46.649 --> 00:18:46.659
on how deep you want to integrate this
 

00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:49.320

exciting and I think this is like one of
the biggest challenges for indie game

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:17.920
the biggest challenges for indie game
 

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.530
the biggest challenges for indie game
developers is that you don't have a lot

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:19.540
developers is that you don't have a lot
 

00:20:19.540 --> 00:20:20.850
developers is that you don't have a lot
of resources to test your game you're

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:20.860
of resources to test your game you're
 

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:22.470
of resources to test your game you're
trying to build a game not necessarily

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480
trying to build a game not necessarily
 

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.420
trying to build a game not necessarily
tested so being able to set up these
