00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
So the other day, I was eating lunch by myself

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.580
when this happened:

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.680
Hi.  You're eating by yourself?

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:07.580
Yeah.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.960
Nobody else is sitting here?

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:09.520
Uh, no.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.680
Man, you know, I was fired today.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.140
From WB and it's really tough on me.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.040
Oh, I'm sorry--

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.960
But actually, I think I'm #blessed

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.400
because I can finally have enough time

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.640
to open up that brewery.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.580
And as he was talking to me, I kind of wanted to politely

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.640
ask him to go away.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.280
Because he was interrupting this quiet time

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.420
that I had set aside for myself.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.940
But I knew that he had approached me to ask me out

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.960
and I didn't want to discourage that, you know?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.120
Like it takes a lot of balls to ask somebody out.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.500
So I was like: okay, you know what?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.580
I'll just hang in there until he gets to that point.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.160
Then I'll politely tell him I'm in a relationship but

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.340
I'm flattered.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.040
So who's the lucky guy?

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.580
Uh, his name is Brad.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.760
You know how I know you're not lying to me?

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.160
Because you knew his name like that!

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.460
Ahahahaha!

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.060
What?

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.760
Do I even need to explain how weird this is?

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.320
And of course, once the shock went away,

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.120
I thought of all the ways I could have responded.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.540
So tell me, is this how you normally ask women out?

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.760
Yeah.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.720
And you said you know how I know you're not lying.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.300
Does this mean you've asked women this exact phrase

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.280
before and you've noticed discrepancies in their answers or...?

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.180
Duh.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.600
Would you self-identify as a douche bagel?

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.400
Uh, yeah.  I'm aware I'm a douche.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.960
Okay.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.420
I could have had an Oscar-winning moment.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.900
Ahahaha!

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.240
No!

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.940
You want to know how to ask somebody out?

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:50.040
You go up to them and you say oh I'm so sorry

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.160
to interrupt what appears to be your alone time

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.880
but I saw you and I thought you were very attractive

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.380
and I would like to get to know you better.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.840
Would you like to go out for a drink sometime?

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.020
You don't say: who's the lucky guy?

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.620
You don't say: you know how I know you're not lying?

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:27.200
Those are rude and inconsiderate things to say.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.320
Or I could have listened to my instinct

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.940
and just spoke up.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.100
And if, I feel--

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.700
I'm sorry to, you know, I uhm.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.580
I'm really sorry I don't want to be rude but

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.280
this is like time that I've set aside to like be alone

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.200
and think and uh

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.260
I would just like to eat my lunch in silence please.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.720
Okay.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.800
Okay.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.300
Bye.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.020
Thank you.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.140
I don't know, it makes me think about all the times

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.120
we bend over backwards to try to make someone

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.340
feel more comfortable even though they're the ones

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.760
making us feel uncomfortable.  Do you know what I mean?

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.800
Like, do you notice that in your every day life?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.460
Do you expend a lot of energy trying to make

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.320
life easier for everyone else?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.700
Even if it infringes upon yourself?

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.280
Like, I'm sure some of us have to do this right?

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.040
I'd like to say thank you to Audible for sponsoring

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.880
today's episode.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.920
As someone requested, I do it as a very deadpan Russian man.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.420
So here it goes.  *ahem*

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.340
I'd like to thank Audible for sponsoring today's episode.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.080

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.000
Right now I listen to Steven King's Insomnia.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.660
Because I cannot sleep.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.960
