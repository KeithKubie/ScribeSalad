Narrator:
THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:10.677
HAS BEEN HUNTING FOR PARTICLES

00:00:10.677 --> 00:00:13.279
SINCE 2009.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.515 line:0%
AS YOU CAN SEE, THERE'S A HUGE
AMOUNT OF STUFF DOWN HERE.

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.684 line:0%
THERE'S BIG SYSTEMS --
COOLING, VENTILATION,

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:20.887
CRYOGENICS, ET CETERA.

00:00:20.887 --> 00:00:24.724
AND THIS STUFF NEEDS A BIT
OF PERIODIC TENDER, LOVING CARE.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.460
Narrator:
WITH OVER 4,000 MILES OF CABLING

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.497
AND 100,000 PROCESSOR CORES,
THE LHC IS

00:00:31.497 --> 00:00:34.867
ONE OF THE MOST COMPLICATED
MACHINES IN THE WORLD.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.337
Lamont:
WE NEED VERY POWERFUL MAGNETS

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:40.339
TO BEND THE BEAM
AROUND IN A CIRCLE.

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.642
SO, BASICALLY, THESE ARE
SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETS.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:44.577
THEY'RE COOLED
WITH SUPERFLUID HELIUM

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.446
AT 1.9 "K."

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:49.215
THE FACT THAT THIS
ACTUALLY WORKS AT ALL IS

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.485
A REAL TESTAMENT
TO AN AWFUL LOT OF HARD WORK,

00:00:52.485 --> 00:00:55.622
MODERN TECHNOLOGY, PLANNING,

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:59.793
PRECISION ON A COMPLETELY
REMARKABLE SCALE.

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:03.996
Charlton: I COME INTO THE CAVERN
HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN YEAR,

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:06.165
AND EVERY TIME I WALK IN,
MY JAW STILL DROPS A LITTLE BIT

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:07.233
WHEN I SEE ATLAS.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.435
IT'S REALLY --
WE BUILT THIS THING.

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:11.971
WE REALLY BUILT THIS THING.

00:01:11.971 --> 00:01:14.039
Narrator: DAVE CHARLTON RUNS
THE CLEVERLY NAMED

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.875
"A" TOROIDAL
LARGE HADRON COLLIDER APPARATUS,

00:01:16.875 --> 00:01:19.279
KNOWN AS ATLAS.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:21.180
IT'S THE LARGEST
PARTICLE DETECTOR

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.216
ON THE LHC CIRCUIT.

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.318 line:0%
THE COLLISIONS TAKE PLACE

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.885 line:0%
RIGHT IN THE CENTER
OF THE EXPERIMENT,

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:30.022 line:0%
ABOUT 30 METERS AWAY
FROM WHERE WE'RE STANDING.

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:32.424
Narrator: ATLAS HAS SEVEN
DIFFERENT DETECTING SYSTEMS

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:36.162
ARRANGED IN LAYERS
AROUND THE COLLISION POINT.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.131
THEY'RE
STRATEGICALLY POSITIONED

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:39.999
TO CAPTURE ANY EVIDENCE
OF PARTICLES

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:41.267
THAT HAVE BEEN PRODUCED.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:45.070
THERE'S ANOTHER MASSIVE DETECTOR
ON THE LHC CIRCUIT,

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.674
THE COMPACT MUON SOLENOID,

00:01:48.674 --> 00:01:50.810
KNOWN AS CMS.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.948
IT'S RUN BY ITALIAN PHYSICIST
TIZIANO CAMPORESI.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:02:01.554
TIZIANO'S MACHINE, CMS, IS
VERY SIMILAR TO DAVE'S.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:04.423
BUT ATLAS IS SLIGHTLY BIGGER.

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:05.625
Charlton:
LOOK AT THE SIZE OF IT.

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:07.493
AS YOU CAN SEE,
IT'S REALLY A HUGE EXPERIMENT --

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:10.963
25 METERS HIGH, 45 METERS LONG.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:13.600
Narrator: THESE DETECTORS ARE
PURPOSEFULLY DESIGNED

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.304
TO DO THE SAME THING
IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS.

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.040
Camporesi: YOU COULD SAY
IT IS AN OVERSIZED CAMERA,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.843
SOMETHING LIKE
A 100-MEGAPIXEL CAMERA.

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:26.746
Charlton:
NOWADAYS, A DIGITAL CAMERA
MIGHT BE 25 MEGAPIXELS,

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.447
25 MILLION CHANNELS.

00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:32.985
BUT WE'RE ABLE TO READ OUT
OUR 100 MILLION CHANNELS

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.288
40 MILLION TIMES A SECOND.

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:38.024
Narrator: THE IDEA IS
THAT NEW PARTICLES WILL BE SEEN

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.126
BY BOTH DETECTORS INDEPENDENTLY.

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:43.996
IT CAN HELP ENSURE
THEIR FINDINGS ARE VALID.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:47.566
BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP BOTH TEAMS
FROM WANTING TO BE FIRST

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.602
TO MAKE A DISCOVERY.
