00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.440
Hey what's up guys?

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.600
So there's some crazy rumors

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.740
floating around the internet about

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.380
different amazing things you can do with Etch-a-Sketches

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.380
and I wanted to know if that's true or not.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.300
So I got Lincoln and Dan here with me from "What's inside" and we're going to bust these things open

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.300
and we're going to bust these things open and

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.300
extract the contents and see what we can do with them because you asked for it

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.720
and see what we can do with them because you asked for it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.900
I'm Lincoln and this is Dan from the channel called "What's inside".

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.680
You may have seen our channel. We cut stuff open to see what's inside of things

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.180
And we decided that we wanted to cut open an Etch-a-Sketch

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.500
because people asked us for it.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.760
We actually cut open one of these already

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.200
and we found a fine silver material inside here

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.540
so we're gonna go experiment with this and find out what we can make it do and not do.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.680
And you guys;

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.940
I'm going to be free-reigning my workshop here

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.660
to cut these things open and show your viewers exactly what it looks like.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.040
Now this metallic powder looks really interesting, and it's hard to tell exactly what it is.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.180
I looked it up on the internet, and the common belief is that it's Aluminum powder

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.160
Now I mixed these powders together in a ratio of 1:3,

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.160
which should be an ideal ratio for this kind of composition.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.420
But, it's not gonna be able to light off with a match, or a barbeque igniter.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.120
We're gonna have to use something quite a bit hotter

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.200
like a regular garden sparkler.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.140
Now theoretically, if we touch the lit sparkler right in to the centre of this pile

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.120
It should, like, ignite and turn into a big ball of flames and fire and all kinds of awesomeness.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.840
So let's see if that really happens or not.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.960
Now I can not get this to light up, even with a sparkler

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.020
but, what's really interesting is if you look closely down at the pile

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.240
you can actually see white bubbles and balls starting to pop up out of the metal

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.280
and, from the smell in the air and how badly this smells I'm pretty sure that those are

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.520
little Styrofoam balls.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.040
Okay, so none of these are working I've tried four different ratios and four different compositions

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.680
and we can't get any of them to even make so much as a spark

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.220
Now that does look pretty cool, but even with all that heat and all that fire power

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.440
this thing is not even so much as making a spark.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.000
So if this isn't going to light off of the blow torch and sparklers

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.080
I'm pretty sure that there really is no way we are going to make this thing work with Etch-A-Sketch powder.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.440
But I'm not going to let you go home empty handed - I do have a backup plan and a whole bag of aluminium

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.840
so let's go upstairs to my table where I can show you the real way to make thermite.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:13.000
I got a bag of powdered aluminium off the internet, and I've got this bag of rust powder

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.920
and we're going to need to mix them together in a 1:3 ratio.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.680
So we're going to start of with a pretty small batch.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.160
So lets do 15g of aluminium power and then another 50g of the rust powder.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.120
So our total weight should be 65g, and that should be just about perfect.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.020
Grant: Alright, here we go...

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.800
[Blow torch]

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.600
[Fire crackling]

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.320
Lincoln: Coool!

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.360
Grant: First thing I'm going to do is just pluck this off a little bit

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.240
Grant: Look at that!

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:08.820
Lincoln: Woah...

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.020
Dan: There's a hole in there...

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.300
Grant: Yeah, it just totally melted that concrete, didn't it?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.800
Grant: Yeah, There's a couple more little bubbles. Wow...

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.020
Dan: It's just amazing to me how long it stayed hot afterward.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.500
Dan: Is it still hot?

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.380
Grant: Yeah it's still warm, you wanna feel it?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.980
Dan: [Laughs] It's been about 15 minutes.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.980
Lincoln: Oh yeah! Dad, hold this!

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.740
Dan: ...Oh, man.

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.280
Grant: Yeah.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.060
Dan: It's a little toasty.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.180
Lincoln: ...hold this...

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.840
Dan: What does it look like inside of it?

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.480
Grant: Here we go...

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.720
Lincoln: What!?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.320
Grant: Look at that.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.520
Lincoln: Look at those little bubbles!

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.720
Dan: They've got little balls. Are those hot at all?

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.580
Lincoln: Look how heavy this is. Feel this.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.980
Dan: Nice little craters...like a little meteorite.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.060
Dan: It DOES look like a meteorite!

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.760
Grant: Yeah.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.500
Grant: We just made a meteorite!

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.820
Dan: Ooh! It's hot!

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.360
We have just created iron...from rust.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.420
Dan: Wow...

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.920
Grant: Sweet.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.920
Dan: That's actually really fascinating.

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:02.000
Grant: 'Kay, here we go!

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.000
[Torch]

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:12.820
[Fire crackling]

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:13.720
Dan: Did it get you?

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.780
Grant: There's burning glass. I'm sorry I kind of screwed up your shot.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.240
Grant: Man, check this out!

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.000
Grant: Feel that, on the back.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.140
Grant: This has been about--what? 10 minutes since we set that off?

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.020
Dan: Whoa...Yeah.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.800
Grant: And that is still very, very warm.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.520
Grant: Like, you can't even hold your hand on it--

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:29.920
--without pulling it away.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.520
Grant: Look at this! The glass is melted! Look at that!

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.400
Grant: That is actually-- (Dan: Whoa...)

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.100
Grant: That is all liquid--

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.960
Lincoln: That's marshmallow!

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.420
Grant: Yeah, that's marshmallow goop...

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:39.960
Grant: But, look at that! That is a piece of glass,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.860
Grant: and it's welded straight to the concrete!

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.500
[Laughing]

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.500
Dan: That was epic. I mean look at this one! (Grant: Oh my gosh!)

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:46.740
Dan: Like, here's a piece of glass and on the bottom...

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.740
Grant: Yes! It's all encrusted with iron.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.220
Grant: Wow! Check out the back! It looks kind of like a geode.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:52.340
Grant: ...A crystal geode.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.840
Dan: It does.

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.240
Grant: Look at that...right there.

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.360
Dan: Make your own geodes.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.220
Alright so, guys; we tried our best.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.400
But we just just could not make thermite out of Etch-a-Sketch powder.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.140
We used quite a bit of powder, we did a lot of different experiments...

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.520
And uh...maybe we just couldn't figure it out.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.420
Maybe one of you is a little bit smarter than us.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.360
But we thought to finish off this video,

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.680
we're gonna give these Etch-a-Sketches a proper sendoff

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.920
and we're gonna put this powder to good use, even though we couldn't get it to work.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.920
We brought some extras.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.000
This is definitely gonna be dangerous.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.460
I like to call this the Etch-a-Sketch tower of doom.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.320
Grant: Alright, I'm thinking this is all the leftover thermite I've got.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.000
Let's just dump that down in there.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.780
...That's  a good pile.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.380
Lincoln: What about THAT one?

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.800
Then we got this stuff that actually came from the Etch-a-Sketch.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.600
We're gonna do an honorary thermite burning here with that one.

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:54.400
This cannot be a safe or good idea.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.880
And then just to top it all off...

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.020
I've got a glass full of thermite.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.020
We're gonna set that right in the middle.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.540
Lincoln: Oh my gosh! This is gonna be crazy!

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.200
And let's see what happens!

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.320
Dan: Ohh, this is so dangerous.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.120
Alright, everybody run away!

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.200
[Torch]

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.160
Fire in the hole!

[Fire crackling]

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.400

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.540
[Fire whooshing]

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.340
[Lincoln screams]

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.860
Whoa!

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.980
Look at that!

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:39.000
Here's my carbon dioxide fire extinguisher that we made dry ice cream with.

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.160
Wow!

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.980
[Laughs]

00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.660
That's pretty hot stuff.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.580
Hold on, hold on, hold on... (Whoa!)

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.920
Oh, nevermind. Okay, well...

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:13.100
That fire was AWESOME!

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.840
It was HUUUGE!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.840
It was so mindblowing! Like, this project was so much bigger than I thought

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.080
it was going to be! And I should have known that because we've been watching

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.700
Grant Thompson's videos for years. And if you guys haven't subscribed to his channel,

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:28.320
go subscribe, watch some of the videos, 'cause there are some other, crazy things on there.

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.680
Nice Dan, I appreciate that.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.940
And make sure you go check out the What's Inside channel as well!

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:34.020
Because they filmed a whole separate video on the Etch-a-Sketch

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.020
that compliments this one really well.

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:39.140
It's really cool! You get to see how an Etch-a-Sketch works and what's inside it.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.140
So thanks again for coming out, you guys!

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.140
Yeah, I had fun. We should do this again!

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.480
This was an awesome collaboration! You guys are awesome!

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.160
And looking forward to doing something again with you guys in the future.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.640
Alright, thanks for watching, you guys! We appreciate your support!

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.980
And we'll see you again in the next video. Talk to you then!

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.180
Hey, what's up guys?

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.040
I made this video because YOU asked for it!

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.800
And I'm taking more requests right now.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.500
So, what do you wanna see me do next?

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.220
Put your wackiest ideas in the comments and let's see

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:03.980
what kind of fun we can have with the next video!

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.000
I'll see you there.
