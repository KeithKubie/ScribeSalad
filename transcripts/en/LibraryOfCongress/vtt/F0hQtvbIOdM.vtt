&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.080
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So I'm John
Fenn, the Head of Research

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.890
in Programs at the
American Folklife Center.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.750
We're here on the Coolidge
Stage with the Fairfield Four,

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.030
and I'm going to ask you guys
each to introduce yourselves

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.920
and say how long you've
been singing with the group.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.860
We'll start with you, sir.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.160
Yeah.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.460
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: My
name is Leveret Allison.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.120
I've been singing with
the Fairfield Four

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.640
for about eight years.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.140
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.700
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: My name is
Bobbye Sherrell, and I started

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.970
with the group, I think, 2011.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.480
So that would be seven --

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.450
six and a half, seven
years ago member.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.750
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.050
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
My name is Larrice Byrd.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.360
I've been singing with
the group eight years.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.500
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: And
I'm Joe Thompson.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.880
I've been off and on with the
group just about all my life.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.010
But this group, we've been
together about eight years.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.290
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay, and
this is the third generation?

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.590
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Right.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.890
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Correct.

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.830
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Now so
the group has been active

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.210
as an entity -- I don't know
what other word to use --

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.640
for about 95 years, right?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.940
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: That's correct.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.250
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So what
brought all of you to the group?

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.940
What pulled you into
it, this guy over here?

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.120
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
Yeah, this guy here.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.420
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Well,
a lot of the other guys

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.110
from the second generation, they
started passing on, you know.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:39.780
So I was part of it, generation
two, so when it got down to me,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.530
and I'm about the last one
living -- myself and Robert --

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.070
so they asked them could
I keep the group going?

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.910
So they give me their blessing.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:56.900
So I called Leveret, and I
saw Byrd, and I said, "Well,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.440
now we need a tenor singer."

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.350
So Leveret and I, we were
racking our brains trying

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.230
to find a tenor singer,
somebody that was dependable

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.370
and could do -- keep
the old tradition going.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.720
And one day I saw
Bobbye at the store,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.900
and I said, "Thank you, Jesus.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.510
There's my tenor
singer right there."

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.500
And we've been here ever since.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.470
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So who
brought you into the group?

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.620
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Back -- this
-- Sam did most of it then,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.080
but Robert saw me the
last time, and I think one

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.920
of the -- James Hill passed.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.790
And then Robert called me
and asked me would I come in.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.350
That's when I came
and stayed this time.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.730
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Does anyone
know the origin of the name

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.240
of the group, Fairfield Four?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.430
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: It
started in South Nashville.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.430
The name of the church was the
old Fairfield Baptist Church,

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.440
and the group started
right there.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.740
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay,

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.890
and as we learned earlier
today during the concert,

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.690
started out as a trio.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:03.990
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Right.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.410
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Sometimes
it grows past a quartet.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.420
So is the name Fairfield
Four just kind

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.040
of an average number of members?

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.340
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes,

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.550
I've seen the group
up to seven members.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.190
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Seven members?

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.490
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Mm-hmm.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.540
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And so
are they doing seven-part

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.840
harmony there?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.610
What's -- how are they
splitting that up when --

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.910
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Well,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.530
I think what happens is
they're constantly --

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.510
if somebody gets sick, they're
finding someone to replace them

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.110
for a certain time or period.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.010
And then when they -- the other
person gets back on his feet,

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.200
they -- the other guy did
so well that they decide

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.500
to keep him in the group.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.800
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.600
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
And then we're --

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.040
you know, we're the youngest --

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.870
probably the youngest group
of the Fairfield Four.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.230
And while -- since they're
up in age, you know,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.720
there are some days
your knees don't move --

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.700
work like they should, and
they can't go on the gig.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.680
So you know what I'm saying?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.980
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
So someone else --

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.280
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: It
was good to have a spare.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.580
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
Oh, that's fantastic.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.820
Now I want to ask each of you --

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.210
and maybe we'll start
with Mr. Thompson --

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.890
when did you feel that
you were a bass singer?

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.760
Like when did you find each of
your voices, because you have

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.060
such beautiful harmony?

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.160
When did you know?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.820
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: I was
the baritone singer

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.230
in the other part --

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.530
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.830
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: -- and when
Dickey [assumed spelling]

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.580
passed, couldn't find a
good bass singer nowhere.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.770
So I just said, "Well,
heck, I'll try it."

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.150
And so I didn't quite
know all of the stuff.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.770
It was thanks to Mr. Byrd
here, Brother Bobbye there,

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.590
they've been coaching me on some

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.820
of those notes that
I need to hit.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.640
So [inaudible] got
me going pretty good.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.610
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay,
what about you, Byrd?

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:50.910
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: Now, you know,

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.170
after you grow past your
childhood and teenage years,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.630
your voice changes anyway.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.910
So I got to the point
where I was an adult --

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.780
a young adult, and my
voice ended up here.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.630
I noticed I couldn't hit
a lot of the high notes

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.910
that the tenor singers sing,
so I just got comfortable

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.790
in this area singing baritone.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.540
And that's where I'm
really comfortable now.

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.610
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay,
so you find your fit?

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:16.910
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
Yes, found my fit,

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.560
and I stayed in that box.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.390
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: I guess I've
been a tenor singer all my life,

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.280
really, either a high
tenor or a mid-tenor.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.230
And so my range is --
really hasn't changed.

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.350
It's gotten stronger
over the years, oh yeah.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:39.750
So to say the least, I'm
tenor -- been tenor, still is.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.050
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
And what about you?

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.580
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: I've also
always been classified myself

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.510
as a tenor singer
and lead singer.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:54.970
And that's where I've
mostly been all my life.

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.970
And that's where I've stayed.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.990
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So singing,
music, has it been part

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.700
of your lives growing up?

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.290
Is -- in this tradition?

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:06.590
Multiple musics?

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:10.300
Let's hear a little about
musical background for everyone.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:14.520
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: We're
all similar backgrounds.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.170
[Inaudible] the same,
we was all brought

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.220
up in church, singing families.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.220
And so it was real easy
for us to get together.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.780
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
Speak in the mic.

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:28.290
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.680
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: Well, now I'm --

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:30.980
these guys are from Tennessee.

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.280
I'm from South Florida.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.580
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:34.880
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: And
it's -- South Florida is --

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.110
I grew up in an area -- I
mean, South Florida is just

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:40.950
like a melting pot, there's so
many different nationalities

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:43.850
and stuff, because I
remember in elementary school,

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.870
you had a Chinese,
Spanish, Mexican,

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.030
just everything, blacks, whites.

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:52.130
So I got used to hearing --

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:53.950
and then, the radio
played everything.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.310
It wasn't just one
type of music.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.890
And I'm really a
musician by trade.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:03.150
They pulled me in as a vocalist,
but I'm more of a musician.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.690
But I love it, and I'm --

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.010
like I said, growing up,
I experienced it all.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:16.540
So I became comfortable
singing or playing,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.620
dealing with all
types of music, so.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.610
Oh, here's one other thing
about the four of us,

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:24.990
we all grew up in a
similar-type home.

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.410
After talking with each
other, meeting these guys,

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.190
our parents were in church,

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:32.700
and we heard gospel
music all the time.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.390
So we were exposed to stuff
beyond our age, you know,

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:40.310
listening to their music --
listening to our parents' music.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:41.610
So I guess --

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:42.910
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So
it was all around?

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.210
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yeah, I
guess the gift was just passed

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:48.350
on to us from our parents.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.560
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And then
are there younger generations

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.880
that you all are working
with to pull in --

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.180
maybe not into the group,

00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:56.590
because you're not
ready to be done, right?

00:07:56.590 --> 00:08:01.240
But pulling into the tradition,
into that brace of music?

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.540
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
Believe it or not,

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.840
we don't see a lot of that.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.290
I'll let Bobbye take
-- talk about that.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.620
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell:
Yeah, well --

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.910
and it is becoming a lost art.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:13.530
People do -- after they hear us
sing, a lot of young people come

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:19.440
to us and maybe ask us about
how long we've been singing,

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.950
but it hasn't gotten to a
point where they're picking

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.200
up the style yet, the
acapella, traditional style.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.820
But there are some young
singers, and they are picking

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.380
up our vocal controls.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.290
They're listening to us
as if they are curious

00:08:32.290 --> 00:08:35.750
about how we make [inaudible],
and how we change a chord

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.050
from maybe [inaudible].

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:39.100
But as far as backing

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.090
and getting behind
this traditional style,

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.950
it's almost a lost art.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:50.510
But it's in demand, though, so
I don't understand why people --

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:52.540
you know, they want to
hear it, but it seems

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.770
like nobody's interested
in learning how to --

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.170
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Maybe
they're too intimidated.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.650
I mean, because to your point of
how you do some of the chords,

00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.550
and just listening
to the interaction

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:06.450
of your voices earlier, I'm
curious if you could talk

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.620
about how you come up with
some of the arrangements.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:09.920
What's the process?

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.480
What are you listening
to or listening for?

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.520
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: I
think it has to be --

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.820
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: Need a mic.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.020
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: I
think you have to be in --

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.400
we've listened to this.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.100
The four of us, like we come up
in this, you know, and we got --

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.400
kind of got away from it.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.980
Especially Joe and I listened to
the Fairfield Four growing up.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:35.260
And we got to the music,
and the acapella style kind

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.980
of went away.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:40.500
But like -- we were just always
kind of familiar with it,

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:42.260
but never just really did it.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.890
So like Joe had, but I hadn't.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.130
And so but like I love it.

00:09:47.130 --> 00:09:49.940
And the younger people
today, I see some seem

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.240
like they're interested in it.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.940
I don't know if they're
going to do it or not.

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.240
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
Well, let's hope.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.800
And I mean, because
I'm hearing the heavy,

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.280
heavy gospel tradition, but
I'm also hearing some other

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.670
influences in some of your
arrangements and in some

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:04.970
of your vocal harmonies.

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:07.240
Can anyone speak to where
you're picking that up

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.540
or how that's coming in?

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.190
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Well, you
know, we're an acapella group,

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:13.030
so we don't have music.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.910
So we have to create the music.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:17.100
So you know, and
we have a little --

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.100
I have a little musical theory.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.010
So we have to put that
information together

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.700
and try to create music.

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:27.150
Of course, you know, the
bass singer keeps the rhythm,

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.190
the bump, keep the pulse.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.890
And then we try to concentrate
on fitting those chords

00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.310
in our voices that's
missing, you know,

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.720
so we try to create
vocal singing

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.750
and vocal music at
the same time.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.870
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Now what --
maybe we can talk a little bit

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:48.140
about the place, Nashville.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.360
It's -- so it's home
to three of you.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.960
And now do you live there?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.260
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yeah.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.560
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So
you guys are still --

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.860
I mean, because the band --

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.730
the group has been a
Nashville-based from day one.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.030
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: Right.

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:00.330
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: How has the --

00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:02.010
and Nashville is known
as a musical center

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.900
for couple different
kinds of music.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.200
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Exactly.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.500
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: But how has

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.980
that environment influenced
the development of the group

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.610
over the past 90-odd years?

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.610
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: You know,
I think seems like to me

00:11:14.610 --> 00:11:19.560
that the Fairfield Four sound
was developed in the early '20s,

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.770
and we haven't let it go.

00:11:22.770 --> 00:11:24.970
It's still a Fairfield
Four sound.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.770
And I think our -- what
we were always trying

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:30.950
to do is just continue to
hold that tradition as just --

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.920
like the second generation,
they sounded

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.540
like the first generation.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.900
And maybe the first
generation sounded more

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:43.270
like the [inaudible] or
that similar, combination.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.700
That -- what they
found then in the '20s,

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.790
we're still holding onto that.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.090
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.990
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: But as
far as the industry itself,

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.890
we learned a lot about the fact

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.260
that Nashville is
a music center.

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.390
You know, we go in studios,
and we learn how to sing,

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:01.740
and what to do, and
when to do it.

00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:04.450
I think that's been
a big thing with us.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:06.720
You know, there's a
million singers out here,

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.710
but sometimes you
can overdo this,

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:10.810
or not do enough here and there.

00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:13.080
And so being in a music center,
that really does help us.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:16.090
We see the professionals --
other professionals, you know.

00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:17.940
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And you've
recorded with some of them

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:19.240
and performed with some of them.

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.540
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
And we pick up stuff.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:21.840
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So there's a
lot of interaction there, huh?

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.140
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
Yes, great interaction.

00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:27.610
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay, now
earlier I mentioned to you

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:31.590
that back in 1940
on this very stage,

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:33.880
the Golden Gate Quartet
did a version

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.430
of "Noah" that you did today.

00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:41.040
And so this stage is carrying
this song in many, many ways.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.200
What other kinds of important
moments have you experienced

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.590
in performing in
the past eight years

00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:49.890
as the current configuration?

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:51.240
What are some highlights?

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.580
Some places you've performed

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.270
that you just stepped
away and said, "Wow"?

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.660
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
Well, I remember --

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:04.570
personally I remember in --
we went to Konya, Turkey,

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.100
and that festival
consisted of artists

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.810
from all around the world.

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.180
So they had -- we
represented the United States

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:13.940
as African American music.

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:15.880
But you know, you
had Persian music --

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.310
you had every music from
all around the world.

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:24.590
And I learned a lot just from
listening to that experience.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.950
You had -- it sounded like -- I
forget the type of music it was,

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.030
but they did -- you
know how he sings low?

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.330
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Mm-hmm.

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:33.630
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: They
were about twice as low,

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.750
and it was like a chant.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:42.110
It was a bunch of [inaudible],
and they sung a chant.

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:43.840
And I had never seen
that before.

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.140
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Wow.

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.440
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: But
that's one of the things

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.740
that stuck out with me --

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.040
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Great
experience, yeah --

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.340
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: -- my travels.

00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:51.640
Experience, yes.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.940
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: -- through
your music to be able to travel

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.240
around and experience
this other stuff.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.540
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes.

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:56.840
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Anyone else
have any moments that stand

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.490
out from your time
with the group that --

00:14:00.490 --> 00:14:04.160
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: I can
remember how maybe the first two

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.740
or three folk festivals we've
done, and the style of music

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:12.950
that they was doing, and I
was grabbing ahold of it.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.610
And then when we did our version
of our gospel, and they seemed

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:21.450
to be amazed, as if we were
sharing some type of a legacy

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:26.160
between us and the people
that played folk music.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.370
So I mean, kind of
like I felt like --

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:34.310
I felt in-place rather than out
of place once we got started.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:37.840
And we was responding to them
just like they responded to us.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.070
It was an interaction thing,
and I like that feeling,

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:43.570
because when you think about
folk festivals or folk music,

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:46.440
you think about banjos
and upright basses.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:51.450
But then when we set stage and
got on, it was the same type

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:56.270
of inner vibe that they got
from us as we got from them.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.900
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Bringing
another living tradition

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.200
to the stage --

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.500
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: Yes.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.950
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: -- and
getting that interaction.

00:15:03.950 --> 00:15:05.250
Fantastic.

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:08.930
Now -- so the group
has been awarded --

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:14.420
was awarded an NEA National
Heritage Fellowship in 1989;

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.260
three Grammys, as you mentioned;

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:19.060
a bunch of other accolades,
Gospel Hall of Fame.

00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:25.670
How does that make you feel as
part of this longer tradition

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.530
of the Fairfield Four?

00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.810
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: I
feel truly blessed --

00:15:30.810 --> 00:15:32.110
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
Yes, that's the word.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:36.200
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: -- to
be able to do what we do.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:42.530
And we try to keep
God in our midst.

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.990
This is one of the things that
I think that has helped each one

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.750
of us to just stay together
and love one another.

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:54.080
And when you love one another,
and you feel the same, you know,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:58.870
and our voices just go
along with what we feel.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.190
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yeah,
I think that's a good word.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:05.670
We do feel blessed, because
we didn't do anything special

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:10.830
to deserve this spot in this
-- you know, in this time.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.700
So we feel like we've been
picked out to be blessed.

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.770
And we really appreciate it.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.480
Try to give God all the
glory and all the praise.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.780
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Amen.

00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:23.080
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: We
believe he's the reason.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.380
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Amen.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.680
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
In other words,

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:27.100
we don't take any of the credit.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:28.400
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.250
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
We give it all to Him.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:33.390
As long as you put Him first,

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:37.620
you've got to be
going -- do good.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.320
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Now how
often do you perform a year?

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.480
You guys on the road
constantly, or?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.280
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: Believe
it or not, not constantly.

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.400
You know, it seems to work

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.510
out as it's not hurting
us physically.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:56.230
We're in and out of
concerts and appearances,

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:57.530
seems to be just enough

00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.480
to handle our standards
of age and stuff.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:01.780
You know what I mean?

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.550
When it's time to get
some rest, we're off.

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:06.750
And when it's time to get up and
go, then the boots get filled.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:11.550
So once again, it's by faith
the things that's happening,

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.730
even our work, and our
performances, and now being put

00:17:14.730 --> 00:17:20.400
on a platform to sing the
Word and to send that message.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.160
Seems like even today
that it was like --

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.720
it was just in the nick
of time that we was here

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.330
to give them what they wanted,
and they gave us what we wanted.

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:33.870
So it's not -- it's
not by accident.

00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:36.720
Seems like it's already
predestined what we need

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.480
to be doing, and how we do it,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:42.530
and how people accept
us and we accept them.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.010
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Yeah, it
seemed to me out in the audience

00:17:45.010 --> 00:17:49.030
that you all are having
a good time up here.

00:17:49.030 --> 00:17:50.330
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell:
Without a doubt.

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:51.630
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: We do.

00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.930
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: We do.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.230
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And you were
also giving that and getting

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:55.530
that from the audience.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.830
Is that --

00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:58.130
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:59.430
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Yes.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:00.730
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And it seems
like that's somehow connected

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:02.030
into the gospel tradition, too.

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:03.330
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: Yes, yes, it is.

00:18:03.330 --> 00:18:04.630
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
Where gospel happens

00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:05.930
in the house of worship --

00:18:05.930 --> 00:18:07.250
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell:
At the church, yeah.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:10.970
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Yeah, it's
part of a larger engagement

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:14.480
with the audience, with
God, with your beliefs.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.260
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Right.

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.430
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And you
bring that to the stage, too.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.730
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell:
That's our intention.

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:21.570
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
Our full intention,

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.000
to bring people to God.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.320
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
Well, you've --

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:31.150
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: We feel
if we can get one person

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:34.100
to turn their life toward
God, you know, we feel --

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:37.970
we're pleased with what
we do, because this is --

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.080
Jesus left a whole
multitude of people and went

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:42.770
across the water to get one.

00:18:42.770 --> 00:18:45.530
So if we can save one, we feel

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.900
like we're pleased
with what we do.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.430
This is why we enjoy what we do.

00:18:52.430 --> 00:18:53.730
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
And I'm guessing

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:55.970
that you're still
singing in churches?

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.270
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Oh, yes.

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.570
Oh, yes.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:18:59.870
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
Anywhere we can,

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:02.030
we always try to
bring the church.

00:19:02.030 --> 00:19:05.630
We're going to bring the church,
I don't care where we sing.

00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:07.370
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Yeah, I mean,
again, that's what struck me

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:11.360
from just our hour with you on
this stage as a performance.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:13.950
It wasn't just a stage concert.

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:15.890
You were in habiting --

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:17.190
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: Right.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:18.490
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: -- where
you want to be with the music.

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:19.790
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: This
is what we're all about.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.600
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: And it's
strange that you say that,

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.540
because we even do
that when we rehearse.

00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.840
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:27.140
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: When we --

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.300
we rehearse as if we're
out here doing some things.

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.400
And it makes it easier.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.170
We stop and correct
ourselves as we go.

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:37.440
But the whole thing about it is
how we present ourselves before

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:41.650
people, even in between
the songs,

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:44.040
what we're saying,
and how we say it.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.260
Not being offensive, but
we're being ourselves.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:49.570
And so we practice it.

00:19:49.570 --> 00:19:54.990
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: We -- the
Bible says, "If I be lifted up,

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.070
I'll draw them in," so we're
just making a presentation.

00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.870
You'll be surprised at
the people who don't know

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:05.050
about the Lord as their savior.

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:09.840
So we make the presentation,
and he'll do the drawing.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.290
You know, we can't do it.

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:13.200
So we just try to
share the Lord Jesus

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.040
with everyone we
come in contact with.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.150
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And you bring
that into the studio, too.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.450
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes.

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:21.750
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: I mean,
just having listened --

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.050
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: Same thing.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:24.350
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: -- to
the recordings over time.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:26.220
So for you, it's all part of
the whole what you're engaged

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.150
with as Fairfield Four.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.400
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes.

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.810
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So
we talked about --

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:35.850
a little bit about the younger
generation, but what do you see

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:37.570
as the future of
the Fairfield Four?

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:41.090
What are you guys up to next?

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.390
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: Well --

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:43.690
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: More CDs.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:44.990
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: More CDs.

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:46.290
More of the grind.

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:47.590
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
It's time for another CD,

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.300
but I guess we --
believe it or not,

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.370
we've talked bout
the next generation.

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:54.670
And we can't see it.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.820
I'm pretty sure the guys
didn't see us coming in.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.330
So we kind of like --

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.740
Bobbye made a great comment
that we just leave it up --

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.040
let the Lord handle it.

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.610
See, he always seems to find --

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.970
to put the right
people in place,

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.090
and that's how it's
been all along.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.450
It's hard to just go find
exactly what you need

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:13.980
to keep it going, so --

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:16.440
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: And it's
funny Brother Byrd said that,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.560
because I didn't
know he could sing.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.370
And -- all I saw him was
playing his music, you know.

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:25.080
And my wife was in
church one day,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:29.320
and we heard this choral
singing, and we were trying

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.680
to find out who was
singing the lead.

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.050
Nobody's mouth was moving.

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:37.680
And my wife -- we
peeking around everybody.

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.830
And I stood up, and it was Byrd.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.000
I said, "Baby, that
boy can sing!

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.560
Listen to him!"

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.170
So it was not hard to
just bring him on in

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.280
because we was close anyway.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.190
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So once
you heard his voice, you --

00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:55.490
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Yeah,

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.520
when I heard his voice I
said, "Okay, that's him."

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.600
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Now do any
of you have a favorite song

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.170
to perform, whether
you're in church,

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:06.070
or onstage, or in the studio?

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:09.980
Something that you
just -- is a go-to?

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:11.590
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
It's hard to --

00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:12.890
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: It's hard.

00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:15.810
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: --
pick up a favorite song

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:17.940
when you've been
singing as long --

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:20.880
especially as long as Joe and I.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.800
It's hard to do that, you
know, because I like all kinds

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.270
of music and all kinds of songs.

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:29.630
And just to pick one
favorite, I don't --

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.090
huh-uh, I can't really do that.

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.230
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: I
have one favorite.

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:38.360
In my church, I open up
service just about every Sunday.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:42.990
And it's "Jesus Keep
Me Near the Cross."

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:47.180
That has been closer to
me than any of the others.

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:50.900
And I don't know, I just
-- my pastor's wife says,

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.940
"Deacon Thompson, I believe
that's your favorite song,

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.940
because you sing
that all the time."

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.630
I say, "Yes, ma'am.

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.750
I do."

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:03.080
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Is there a
song that maybe has traveled

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.070
through all three generations
of the Fairfield Four

00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.690
that you would -- anyone
would identify as a --

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:11.440
I mean, there's a
Fairfield Four sound,

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.250
but is there a song
that maybe has --

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.530
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: Yes,
that "Dig a Little Deeper."

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.510
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: And that "Don't
Let Nobody Turn You Around."

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:19.960
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: And "Don't
Let Nobody Turn You Around."

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.260
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay.

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.810
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: I grew up
listening to those two songs

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.110
from the Fairfield Four.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:26.410
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And now you --

00:23:26.410 --> 00:23:27.710
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
That's the sound.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.010
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: -- now
you perform those songs.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:30.500
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
Right, right.

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:32.240
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Yeah,
that's pretty amazing to me

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:36.160
that that -- again, that sort
of generational rejuvenation

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.390
and joy that comes
through the performance.

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:44.670
I definitely heard it.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.990
I heard that.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.290
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: Okay.

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.110
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So you said
you enjoy all kinds of music,

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:52.800
and those of you who
identify as musicians --

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.930
although, I think
you're all musicians --

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:56.230
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
I even hear music

00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:58.560
that I don't understand
what they're saying,

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.170
different language,
but something

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:03.400
about the music just seems
to just grab hold to you.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.770
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And do
you try to bring those ideas

00:24:07.770 --> 00:24:09.300
into what you're doing?

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.930
I mean, you're carrying on a
tradition, but you're also --

00:24:11.930 --> 00:24:13.230
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
You do it unconsciously.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:14.530
You do it unconsciously,
you know,

00:24:14.530 --> 00:24:16.720
because if you hear something
that you really like,

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.890
it's hard to just get -- throw
it out of your mind like.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:24.260
So you can easily do it
unconsciously, bring in an idea.

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.080
I'm a rhythm guy, and I just
-- I hear stuff, and I just --

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.250
you have to ring
it in, you know.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:33.630
Try to squeeze it in -- get
it in, make it fit somewhere.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:36.660
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And it seems
like to me that's also part

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.810
of the larger tradition
of gospel,

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.530
which incorporates a whole bunch

00:24:42.530 --> 00:24:45.130
of different musical
influences and ideas --

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:46.430
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Exactly.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:49.400
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: -- but always
toward a goal or a purpose, too,

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.240
given where the tradition
comes from.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.540
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes, yes.

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:56.040
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And that
resonates with your experiences?

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.340
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.640
Yes, it does.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.010
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Excellent.

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:03.100
Now I have to ask about "O,
Brother, Where Art Thou?"

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.650
Because you brought
it up onstage.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:12.290
And so who was in -- who
appeared in the movie?

00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:13.590
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: None of us.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:14.890
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson:
Neither one of us.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.190
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Okay,
I didn't think so.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.150
But how -- so how do you
carry that mantle, too?

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:23.000
I mean, the Fairfield Four is
known as being in that movie.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.490
And they were in the movie, but
it was the previous generation.

00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.860
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
Exact -- second generation.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.160
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: But
we still got the sound.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.580
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Maybe they
need to do like a reboot

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.980
of the movie and
have you guys --

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.890
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
That would be good.

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.190
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: Yeah.

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:38.490
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
That would be great.

00:25:38.490 --> 00:25:39.810
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Because your
version of that song, I mean,

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:43.660
was so wonderful, too.

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:50.550
So did you learn that as growing
up with the Fairfield Four?

00:25:50.550 --> 00:25:52.660
Or did you kind of
bring that in --

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:55.300
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yeah, we
decided to sing that song --

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.130
learn it and sing it because
there's so many people

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:02.470
that identify with the
Fairfield Four in that movie.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.840
So -- and we're the
Fairfield Four.

00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:06.400
We have to --

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:08.050
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: You have
a responsibility, of sorts.

00:26:08.050 --> 00:26:11.370
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yeah,
some type of responsibility to.

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:13.760
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And so when
you go about learning a tune

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.060
like that -- so that
might have --

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:20.430
that was a new one for you four
-- you listen to the recordings,

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.730
you -- how do you go

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.140
about learning a new
song, a new arrangement?

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:25.440
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: Listen to it.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.660
And then when we
listen to a song,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.020
each one of us know our parts.

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.740
We can hear our part.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.040
You know, the bass -- it's easy
to pick out the bass singer.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.340
It's the bottom note.

00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.450
And the top note is
the -- so it's --

00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.810
and we have to feel
our -- find ours.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:41.110
Bobbye and I have to find ours.

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.410
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: The middle.

00:26:42.410 --> 00:26:43.710
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
Middle section, yes.

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.270
But it's fairly easy since
we've been doing it a while.

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:48.820
You know, we can hear
what's going on in there.

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:51.650
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So you all
can just lock in to harmonies

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.230
and parts with each other --

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.530
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell:
and even that song,

00:26:55.530 --> 00:27:01.060
we put our own twist
on it, on the end.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.380
So we added a little
something of ours,

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.010
but that makes it
Fairfield Four.

00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.600
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: Got
to be Fairfield Four.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.900
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
It's got to be.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:16.450
So let's see, what else don't
we know about the Fairfield Four

00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:20.340
and the legacy, in even
like the current generation?

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:24.700
You know, what -- what
should people know?

00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.530
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Well,
I'll start this one off.

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:30.290
Well, I'm more of
a musician myself.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.310
These guys gave me a chance
to sing, and I love doing it.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:38.510
But my background is pretty much
the rhythm sections in a band.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:40.000
And that's where I started.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.260
I started playing in church
where I was a little boy.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:48.890
And my parents -- my
mother was at a type church

00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:51.140
that they called a Sanctified
church back in those days.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.750
And they didn't have
a whole band,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:56.590
but you could always
usually hear a snare drum

00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.410
and a tambourine always beating.

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:03.470
Okay, you would hear a guitar
here and there and organs here

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:04.770
and there at these --

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:07.640
they called them
Sanctified Holiness churches.

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.210
There was a man in
this one church

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:13.550
that just weared [sic]
out -- a guitar out.

00:28:13.550 --> 00:28:16.460
And once I heard that, I just
fell in love with the guitar.

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.600
And of course, I got
one soon after that.

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.350
My mother made me --
she made me promise

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:24.210
that if she bought one,
I'd learn to play it.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:25.960
And I did learn to play it.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.950
So that's where I got
started, and it's stuck

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:30.010
with me all these
years, playing --

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:31.310
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
And you're still --

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.030
are you working on music
outside of the Fairfield Four?

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:34.570
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes, I
play organ for two churches,

00:28:34.570 --> 00:28:40.420
so that's what I'm doing
when I'm not out here.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:41.910
In Nashville.

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.210
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: You're busy.

00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:44.510
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: Yeah, I'm busy.

00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.030
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Now, and --
well, you bring up a good point,

00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.060
though, about -- and
it came up earlier.

00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:51.360
There is no band.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.660
You are the band.

00:28:52.660 --> 00:28:53.960
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.260
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And
the rhythmic component is

00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.560
so crucial.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:57.860
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Yes.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.160
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And
I was hearing a lot

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.460
of interesting sort of
syncopations and rhythmic stuff

00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.800
across the vocal parts.

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:06.590
And that's -- I mean, that's
something you have to work on.

00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:07.890
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
You have to work on it.

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.810
It's not as easy as it seems.

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:11.110
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: No.

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:12.410
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: No.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.350
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Thanks to
Brother Bobbye for that.

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.330
He keeps us all in check.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:19.210
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: He keeps
the rhythms moving around?

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:20.510
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Oh, yes, yes.

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:22.000
He's one of us.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.300
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: Well,

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:24.600
some people think this
is real easy to do.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.530
It's not.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.440
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: They
haven't tried, huh?

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.740
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: Right.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.950
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: No, I mean,
you all make it look so easy,

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.440
but that's because you're --

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.930
like you said, you've been
doing it your whole lives

00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:37.830
in some form or another.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:39.180
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: Yes.

00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:40.820
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: But it
does take the practice.

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:42.630
So you guys are rehearsing
and --

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:43.930
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Right.

00:29:43.930 --> 00:29:45.570
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: -- continuing
to sing in church, and --

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:47.280
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: And
when you love one another

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.550
as we love each other, it's easy

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:54.120
to get stuff pretty
well together,

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:57.220
because we don't get
angry with each other.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.780
You know, of one
makes a mistake --

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:02.620
and Brother Bobbye can
catch us right quick.

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.920
And you know, he tells us, "Hey,

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:07.220
you need to do such-and-such
thing right here."

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.560
"Okay, show it to me."

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:15.480
And that's how we gel
together, one in unity.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.930
We are all four in unity,
and we try to keep God

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:21.970
in our midst, as
our main chorus.

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:24.160
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: So
are you wanting to know

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.910
about the other guys'
backgrounds?

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:29.210
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Yeah.

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:30.510
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: Go ahead.

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.820
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: Background?

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:34.820
Brother Joe kind
of started it off.

00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:41.010
We all just about got the same
kind of growing up, families.

00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.010
My brother was a singer.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.450
Had an uncle that was a singer.

00:30:45.450 --> 00:30:47.240
My mother was a singer.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.840
And it just stayed with me.

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:54.130
I started singing when I was
about five or six years old.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:55.760
And at the age of
12, I was singing

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:59.440
with my uncle's gospel
group as a lead singer.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:03.390
And I just kept on and on
there, just always been in me.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:04.690
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: And this was

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:05.990
in Nashville -- the
Nashville area?

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.290
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
In Nashville, yeah.

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:10.560
That's where I was born and
raised, in Nashville, right.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:13.330
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: What
about your background?

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:16.070
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: I
myself, yeah, I started early.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:19.470
My mother, she was a
choir leader and director.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:23.610
And she had me sing -- she
had us -- there was 12 of us,

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:25.690
so she had all of us brothers

00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:27.260
and sisters singing
at an early age.

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.670
I think I was five years old
when I started singing --

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.400
five and six at church.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.800
And picking up instruments
from the junior high.

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:39.950
I was in the band, and
one thing led to another.

00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:42.540
I started singing some
other secular music.

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:47.430
And I got lost somewhere,
but love brought me back.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:50.530
I got back in church, and now
I'm a praise and worship leader

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:55.220
at my church, and do the male
chorus, and the mass choir

00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:56.850
when we're not here doing this.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:32:03.200
So I'm -- I think I -- I got
lost, like we all do sometimes,

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.220
but then I got found again.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:11.220
So the purpose that He had for
me is, I just had to settle down

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:13.180
and let Him have His way.

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.230
And I'm grateful.

00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:17.770
The opportunities
and the chances

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:21.020
that we have together
as the four of us.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.370
They're like brothers to
me, and we work like a unit.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:26.670
So --

00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.970
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: We are a unit.

00:32:27.970 --> 00:32:29.270
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell:
Yeah, and right now,

00:32:29.270 --> 00:32:31.560
what you're saying
is -- well, what --

00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.730
my background is right
here, what you see.

00:32:34.730 --> 00:32:37.520
It just took a while to get
it together, but this is it.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.940
This is just -- this is
what it molded out to be.

00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:43.230
and I'm grateful
for Fairfield Four.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:46.710
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: So I want
to ask about the arrangement

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.350
of "Amazing Grace," as you
bring up lost and found,

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:54.740
because that arrangement, it
wasn't one I've heard before.

00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.150
I mean, it was amazing.

00:32:58.150 --> 00:32:59.450
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: Thank you.

00:32:59.450 --> 00:33:00.750
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: But so yeah,

00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:02.050
did you all work
that arrangement out?

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:03.350
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.: We did.

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:04.650
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: We did.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:05.950
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: What --

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.250
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: We did.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.550
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: What was
driving that arrangement?

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.850
What was the inspiration?

00:33:09.850 --> 00:33:11.150
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: We
had church on our mind.

00:33:11.150 --> 00:33:13.670
It was -- I think somebody
requested that song that we do.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:15.350
And we were sitting down
one day in rehearsal --

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:16.650
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Right.

00:33:16.650 --> 00:33:17.980
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: -- and we
just took our time and just --

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.850
we all went to church
that night.

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:24.590
And we just slowed it down and
just actually told a story.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:29.610
And I think if the truth be
known, tears came upon my eyes,

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:33.470
because the way we
did it, you had to --

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:37.490
we had to think about the song
-- more than just singing it

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:39.170
but telling the story.

00:33:39.170 --> 00:33:41.330
And things flashing
back in your mind.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:45.900
And it is amazing --
His grace is amazing.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.140
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Yeah, that
was a moving arrangement.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.090
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: Yeah, so
we give all the credit for that

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:54.360
because all of us had a
thumb and a finger in that.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:56.150
But that's Fairfield
Four for you.

00:33:56.150 --> 00:33:57.450
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison:
Yeah, that's just us.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:58.750
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd,
Sr.: And we look back

00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:00.980
on our lives in this group.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.440
You know, this group
of guys right here,

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.840
we never would have come
together as a group.

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.970
We were all doing
different things completely,

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:12.350
going other ways.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.900
But here we are, look.

00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:15.200
And it's working just fine.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.500
It's great.

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.090
A good relationship --
good working relationship,

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.390
and it's just working fine.

00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:24.940
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: I'm pointing
up because it's nobody but God.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.240
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
There's nothing else,

00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.540
huh, to explain it?

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:28.840
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: He's got
-- He put us all together.

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.550
Not we ourselves -- God did.

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.040
That's the way we feel about it.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:35.310
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Well, I want
to thank you for taking the time

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.090
to do this interview here.

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:40.950
Any final thoughts
on performing here

00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:43.950
on the Coolidge Stage, or --

00:34:43.950 --> 00:34:45.250
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell: Well,
we want to thank you all

00:34:45.250 --> 00:34:47.200
for having us, and
the interview.

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.210
It's still a learning
experience for me,

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:53.970
and what you're bringing
is even helping us more.

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:55.270
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Well --

00:34:55.270 --> 00:34:56.570
&gt;&gt; Bobbye Sherrell:
We're still growing.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:57.870
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III:
That's humbling.

00:34:57.870 --> 00:34:59.170
&gt;&gt; Leveret Allison: And
we want to thank you

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:00.470
for doing this interview.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.970
It was an honor for us to
be here and to do this.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.270
&gt;&gt; Larrice Byrd, Sr.:
And we pray that we --

00:35:04.270 --> 00:35:06.110
this interview and our singing

00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:10.230
and praises help somebody
else along the way, find --

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:11.530
&gt;&gt; Joe Thompson: Amen, amen.

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:12.930
&gt;&gt; John Fenn III: Well, it
was definitely a great gift,

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.520
so thank you very much.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.890
&gt;&gt; All: Thank you.

00:35:16.890 --> 00:35:20.540
