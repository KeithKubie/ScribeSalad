00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.911
- Hey, come on in.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:15.915
(cheerful 80's pop synth music)

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.252
Yeah, Push &amp; Believe.

00:00:19.252 --> 00:00:20.487
You got it.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.756 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've been busy doing
these interviews,

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:24.457
got a lot of shows going on.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:25.892
- [Sean] Right.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:26.693 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Brody] We're both getting
ready for a Half Hour.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:27.894
- [Sean] Yes, we are.

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:29.062 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- [Brody] I know we're
pressed for time.

00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:32.265 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
I have to iron my shirt,
if you don't mind.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.336
- You know, a lot of people
don't realize the stress

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:37.404
of wrinkly clothing.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:38.905
- [Brody] No!

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:40.874
Woah, it's hot, it's a
little hot, but not where

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.142
it needs to be.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.710
We're gonna add
some steam to it.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.446
So you're from New Orleans.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.747
- Yes I am.

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:48.448
- [Brody] Were you
there for Katrina?

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:49.416
- I was.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:50.950
- What did you do, take cover?

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.951
- I was at a bar, and the
bar said it was going to

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.253
stay open all night.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.588 align:start size:88% position:13%
It was a "Fuck Hurricane
Katrina" party.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:56.856
- Are you serious?

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:57.690
- Yeah, I'm dead serious.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.192
- I, okay.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:00.627 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We were hanging out, we
were drinking pitchers of PBR

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.563 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then they started
walking in sheets of plywood

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:04.664 align:start size:88% position:13%
and they started
boarding up the windows.

00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:05.932
- It's getting serious.

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.133
- And they're like,
"You should probably

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:07.934
"get the fuck out of
here," and you're like,

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:09.469
"Well, now I'm wasted."

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:11.304
- Right, now they want you
to drunk drive on the 10.

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:12.305
- But, you know what, I did.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:13.239
- Really?

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.407
- [Sean] And just hauled ass

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.575 align:start size:84% position:16%
to Baton Rouge.
- And you made it out?

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:16.643 align:start size:88% position:13%
Did you leave your
belongings back at home?

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:18.011 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I got the essentials,
and got the.

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.648 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Toothbrush, toothpaste,
floss, hair gel.

00:01:21.648 --> 00:01:23.249
- Come on, one more.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.717
- Exfoliant.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:26.219
- Exfoliant, you
got it, nailed it.

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:27.921
- You gotta get rid of
the dead skin cells.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.989 align:start position:0%
- You gotta exfoliate when
you're running from a hurricane.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.724
- You ever see Emeril
around New Orleans?

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:32.826
- Nah, he doesn't live there?

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:33.760
- He doesn't live there?

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.561
- Nah, he doesn't live there.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:35.495
- But he's from there!

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:36.162
- Nah, he's not from there.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:36.996
- Bam!

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.264
Bam!
- Yeah!

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:40.100
- You know, Sean, I
know a lot about you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.204
and I've done some extra
research and you're into

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.906
oral, anal action?

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.174
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.642
- Can you expound on
that a little bit?

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.579
- There's something
about going there,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.449 align:start size:88% position:13%
going to the most
disgusting, yet sense...

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:57.550
People don't realize,
the butthole's where

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:58.518
all the nerves are.

00:01:58.518 --> 00:01:59.786
- Yeah, male and female.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.054
- Yeah.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.456
And if you really like
someone, you go there.

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:06.426
- Are you talking digits,
are you talking tongue?

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:07.927
- I recommend all.

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:09.195
- Wow.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.364
- Go all 11 digits, you
know what I mean by 11.

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.266
- Woah, hello, take
it to another level,

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.168
you got it.
- Exactly.

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:17.737 align:start size:94% position:6%
And then, you know, if you
really like the person,

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:18.671
then you go tongue.

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:19.606
You have to really be into them.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:22.375
- So tongue is after that.

00:02:22.375 --> 00:02:23.443
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:24.277
- Really?

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.512
- Absolutely.

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.580 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I thought, I have
anal energies as well.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.782
And I would personally,

00:02:29.782 --> 00:02:31.151
if you asked me,
- Go tongue first,

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.385
and then that?

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:33.953
- Yeah, I would spread
cheek, and then I would

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.322
go in tongue, moisturize.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.458
- You might be a
Renaissance man.

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.094
- So just about done with this.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.763
Wrinkle free, you got it.

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:45.431
More than happy to
take care of you.

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:46.266
- [Sean] Would you?

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:47.100
- Yeah!

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.801
- I didn't want to ask.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.136
- I'll get it, I'll get it,

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:51.404
no problem.
- Thank you.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.672
Because this thing
is just, I mean.

00:02:52.672 --> 00:02:54.140 align:start size:81% position:19%
- We're just gonna
get right here.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.875 align:start size:97% position:3%
You know, this is what
comedians do for each other

00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:59.145 align:start size:97% position:3%
when you go out on the road,
one guy's in the shower,

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:00.813
another guy's getting
ready and it's like,

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:01.915
you gotta work together.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:03.149
- You got to.

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:04.884
- So listen, we're here
in Boston, we're doing

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:08.188

Stevens, Sean Patton,

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.523
ironed shirts, positivity.

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:12.559
New Orleans, L.A.

Yes!

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.795 line:0%
Push &amp; Believe, you got it.

00:03:15.795 --> 00:03:16.963 line:0%
Anal energies.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:20.967

Twitter, we're there too.

00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:32.145
Tell everybody.

We're in this together.

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:36.616
