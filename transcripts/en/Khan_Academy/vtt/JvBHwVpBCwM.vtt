00:00:00.209 --> 00:00:03.726
- [Sal] This timeline
here covers 200,000 years,

00:00:03.726 --> 00:00:08.190
from 200,000 years into
the past, to the present.

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:10.616
And just to get a sense
of the scale of this,

00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:12.486
if we were to go 2,000 years ago

00:00:12.486 --> 00:00:15.258
to the time of the Roman Empire,

00:00:15.258 --> 00:00:18.554
that would be roughly
here on the timeline.

00:00:18.554 --> 00:00:20.432
If I were to say, when
were the pyramids built?

00:00:20.432 --> 00:00:23.653
That would be roughly
there on the timeline.

00:00:23.653 --> 00:00:27.447
So by human standards this is
a very long period of time.

00:00:27.447 --> 00:00:30.567
And I didn't choose this
time span arbitrarily.

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:33.538
200,000 years is about how long we believe

00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:37.584
anatomically modern humans
have been on our planet,

00:00:37.584 --> 00:00:40.917
our sub-species of Homo sapiens sapiens.

00:00:41.913 --> 00:00:44.429
Now the reason why I
show these stone tools

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:48.596
is because the ages, the
periods, of modern humanity,

00:00:50.137 --> 00:00:51.552
or even pre-modern humanity,

00:00:51.552 --> 00:00:53.552
are named after the types of tools

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:55.854
that have been found
in archaeological digs.

00:00:55.854 --> 00:00:59.867
So most of even pre-human,
or near pre-human,

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:01.967
and human history,

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:06.134
has been the Paleolithic
period, or old stone age.

00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:10.341
Paleo, paleo for old,

00:01:11.432 --> 00:01:14.432
lithic coming from lithos for stone.

00:01:15.805 --> 00:01:17.055
So Paleolithic.

00:01:17.891 --> 00:01:21.930
The old stone age is the
great bulk of human history.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.430
And there's also a Mesolithic

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.847
that comes about 15,000, 20,000 years ago.

00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:29.628
But then around 10,000 years ago,

00:01:29.628 --> 00:01:33.209
the stones have a much more
polished appearance to them.

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:34.542
Things like this.

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:37.640
And so that period from
about 10,000 years,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.966
starting with about 10,000, 15,000 years,

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.754
depending on what part
of the world you look at,

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:44.792
is referred to as the Neolithic period.

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:45.625
Neolithic,

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.426
referring to new stone.

00:01:49.716 --> 00:01:52.475
And on top of this timeline,

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:53.933
I have also shown what's happening

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:55.933
at a very large scale, climactically,

00:01:55.933 --> 00:01:57.731
on the Earth.

00:01:57.731 --> 00:02:00.525
So these blue periods are ice ages,

00:02:00.525 --> 00:02:02.107
and these reddish orange periods

00:02:02.107 --> 00:02:04.628
are the periods in between ice ages.

00:02:04.628 --> 00:02:06.876
And so you can see the last ice age ended

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:09.293
roughly 15,000 years ago,

00:02:09.293 --> 00:02:12.543
and it began roughly 110,000 years ago.

00:02:13.844 --> 00:02:15.562
Now I'm giving you all this context

00:02:15.562 --> 00:02:18.370
about these Paleolithic,
Neolithic, and the ice ages,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.946
because we're gonna talk about probably

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.948
the most important series of events,

00:02:23.948 --> 00:02:27.283
or innovation, in all of human history.

00:02:27.283 --> 00:02:30.080
And that is agriculture.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.080
Agriculture.

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.763
For most of human history,

00:02:34.763 --> 00:02:36.911
over this Paleolithic period,

00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:38.580
over most of this timeline

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.880
going up until about
10,000 or 15,000 years ago,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.298
our ancestors were hunter gatherers.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.900
They would have to chase the
game wherever it might be,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.729
they couldn't settle down in one place.

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:51.071
Maybe there were a few that were near

00:02:51.071 --> 00:02:54.574
some sources of fish where
they might be able to do

00:02:54.574 --> 00:02:56.197
some basic fishing.

00:02:56.197 --> 00:02:58.026
But they would have
done hunting like this.

00:02:58.026 --> 00:02:59.195
They would have done gathering,

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:00.945
which means getting berries or mushrooms

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:02.111
where they could find it.

00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:04.611
It probably was eating a
lot of things like insects,

00:03:04.611 --> 00:03:07.952
and that is most of human history.

00:03:07.952 --> 00:03:11.535
But then around 10,000
or 15,000 years ago,

00:03:12.742 --> 00:03:15.575
we have the advent of human beings

00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:19.274
taking nature into their own hands.

00:03:19.274 --> 00:03:21.026
Instead of saying, let's
just follow the game

00:03:21.026 --> 00:03:23.516
wherever the game might migrate to,

00:03:23.516 --> 00:03:26.193
let's actually domesticate these animals.

00:03:26.193 --> 00:03:27.991
Let's take some of them,
start breeding them

00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:30.364
so they're more suitable
for human consumption,

00:03:30.364 --> 00:03:33.249
so that they are easier to
raise, maybe more robust,

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:35.830
and we will breed them,

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.365
and we will raise them for milk, for meat.

00:03:39.365 --> 00:03:42.080
We also started to domesticate plants.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.663
Instead of saying, okay let's just gather

00:03:43.663 --> 00:03:45.914
those berries there where
it happens to emerge,

00:03:45.914 --> 00:03:48.662
oh let's actually start to plant things.

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:52.164
And on a very predictable
way, be able to harvest them,

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:54.253
and so be able to have a
more predictable food supply.

00:03:54.253 --> 00:03:56.836
Both of these things allowed human beings

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.602
to have a higher population density,

00:03:58.602 --> 00:04:02.477
to start to settle down, to
have a more sedentary life.

00:04:02.477 --> 00:04:05.226
And this is a huge, huge, huge deal.

00:04:05.226 --> 00:04:06.649
Just to get a sense.

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:08.935
We believe that the carrying capacity

00:04:08.935 --> 00:04:10.185
for the planet,

00:04:11.067 --> 00:04:13.443
for human beings as hunter gatherers,

00:04:13.443 --> 00:04:15.193
is 10 million people.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:19.733
And that is what we estimate
the world population was

00:04:19.733 --> 00:04:23.321
around the time of the last
ice age, or shortly afterwards.

00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:27.417
And that's because a tribe
of 100 hunter gatherers

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:30.500
is going to need 50 square kilometers

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.044
to 100 square kilometers

00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:36.080
to hunt and gather from,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.252
or actually 500, from some
of the estimates I've seen.

00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:42.250
And it might seem like a lot of area

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.952
that you would need to
hunt and gather from,

00:04:43.952 --> 00:04:45.200
but imagine that you and your family

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.948
had to go live in the woods now.

00:04:46.948 --> 00:04:49.108
How much food could you actually find?

00:04:49.108 --> 00:04:51.925
You'd have to walk
miles and miles per day,

00:04:51.925 --> 00:04:53.549
if you're trying to hunt,

00:04:53.549 --> 00:04:56.095
you'd have to walk miles and miles per day

00:04:56.095 --> 00:05:00.873
to get whatever wild grains
or berries, or whatever,

00:05:00.873 --> 00:05:03.581
or mushrooms, or whatever, or insects,

00:05:03.581 --> 00:05:05.330
that you might consume.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.537
But then with the advent of agriculture

00:05:07.537 --> 00:05:11.838
it allowed for a much, much
higher density population.

00:05:11.838 --> 00:05:15.505
In fact, going from the
birth of agriculture,

00:05:15.505 --> 00:05:17.638
which happens in the Neolithic period,

00:05:17.638 --> 00:05:21.563
the dawn of agriculture coincides
with the Neolithic period,

00:05:21.563 --> 00:05:23.936
they're often used
somewhat interchangeably.

00:05:23.936 --> 00:05:27.531
Going from that period
10,000, 15,000 years ago,

00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:29.369
to the time of ancient Rome,

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:32.165
so we're on the order of 10,000 years,

00:05:32.165 --> 00:05:35.367
the world population
with agriculture exploded

00:05:35.367 --> 00:05:39.450
from 10 million to roughly 250 million.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:40.700
And that's 25x.

00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:44.568
And we know that from the
time of Rome 'til now,

00:05:44.568 --> 00:05:46.866
another 2,000 years with agriculture,

00:05:46.866 --> 00:05:49.789
our population has gone up 28x,

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:53.082
it's growing exponentially,
to seven billion.

00:05:53.082 --> 00:05:54.840
And there's no way that we could have had

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.391
this level of density

00:05:56.391 --> 00:05:58.058
without agriculture.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.479
Now a key question is,

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:03.730
is why did agriculture emerge right then?

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.325
Well one theory is is,
well it seems to be only,

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.399
and I'll say only in quotes,

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:12.901
only a few thousand years
after the end of the ice age.

00:06:12.901 --> 00:06:15.445
Maybe you had positive climate change,

00:06:15.445 --> 00:06:17.211
at least from a human point of view,

00:06:17.211 --> 00:06:20.628
that allowed land to support agriculture.

00:06:23.385 --> 00:06:25.392
That seems like a reasonable theory.

00:06:25.392 --> 00:06:27.112
Although you might say,
well we've had other periods

00:06:27.112 --> 00:06:28.610
where we didn't have an ice age,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.366
how come we see no evidence
of agriculture then?

00:06:31.366 --> 00:06:35.405
And one counterargument or
explanation I've heard for that

00:06:35.405 --> 00:06:37.901
is, anatomically modern humans

00:06:37.901 --> 00:06:40.899
started to emerge around
200,000 years ago,

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:43.874
but that doesn't mean
that the way they thought,

00:06:43.874 --> 00:06:46.702
or that their brains were
the same as modern humans.

00:06:46.702 --> 00:06:49.536
And so maybe in this
period the human brain

00:06:49.536 --> 00:06:52.369
just wasn't capable of performing,

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.751
or thinking of agriculture.

00:06:55.751 --> 00:06:57.793
Other theories are is
that the human population

00:06:57.793 --> 00:07:01.550
through hunter gathering
kept increasing over time,

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.425
and it was right after the last ice age

00:07:03.425 --> 00:07:05.466
that you really got close to this

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:08.423
critical mass of population,

00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:12.100
at which point, for every
extra human to be born,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.888
another human would not be able to live,

00:07:14.888 --> 00:07:16.096
or not be able to be born,

00:07:16.096 --> 00:07:17.556
because there was a fixed supply of food

00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:19.888
as hunter gatherers.

00:07:19.888 --> 00:07:21.996
And so you could say out of necessity,

00:07:21.996 --> 00:07:24.202
maybe a tribe here or
a little group there,

00:07:24.202 --> 00:07:26.993
started to say hey, well
what if we started to

00:07:26.993 --> 00:07:28.998
domesticate some of this cattle?

00:07:28.998 --> 00:07:30.698
Or if we started to plant crops?

00:07:30.698 --> 00:07:33.199
All of a sudden they would
start to have a higher density

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.654
and their population could increase.

00:07:34.654 --> 00:07:36.408
And not only would they
be able to survive,

00:07:36.408 --> 00:07:39.382
but they could also be very dominant

00:07:39.382 --> 00:07:41.181
in things like conflict.

00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:42.803
Once you start having agriculture,

00:07:42.803 --> 00:07:44.263
and as agriculture advances,

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:46.894
as I mentioned, these people
could be more sedentary.

00:07:46.894 --> 00:07:48.765
They wouldn't have to move around.

00:07:48.765 --> 00:07:51.927
They wouldn't have to move
around all of the time.

00:07:51.927 --> 00:07:54.011
That allows them to

00:07:54.011 --> 00:07:56.970
create even defensive structures.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.634
You could have specialization,

00:07:58.634 --> 00:08:02.483
where not everyone is
having to worry about,

00:08:02.483 --> 00:08:04.333
specialization,

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:07.918
not everyone is having to worry
about food all of the time.

00:08:07.918 --> 00:08:09.960
And so you could develop warriors,

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.594
you could have technology
developing, especially weapons,

00:08:13.594 --> 00:08:16.174
and so not only would
that tribe or that group

00:08:16.174 --> 00:08:17.882
be able to get higher density,

00:08:17.882 --> 00:08:19.917
but they would be able
to defend their property.

00:08:19.917 --> 00:08:21.790
In fact they would
probably care a lot more

00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:23.038
about property,

00:08:23.038 --> 00:08:24.786
because they use it to farm,

00:08:24.786 --> 00:08:26.079
versus hunter gatherers

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:28.039
might just view that as their territory

00:08:28.039 --> 00:08:29.334
that they wander over

00:08:29.334 --> 00:08:31.747
in order to find food.

00:08:31.747 --> 00:08:36.715
Now whatever the actual cause
of the birth of agriculture,

00:08:36.715 --> 00:08:40.715
it has had profound
implications on our society.

00:08:41.961 --> 00:08:46.010
You would not have had
the birth of city-states,

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.635
without agriculture.

00:08:47.635 --> 00:08:50.592
City-states had high density populations.

00:08:50.592 --> 00:08:53.134
They could not have been
supported with hunter gathering.

00:08:53.134 --> 00:08:56.142
You could not have had the
development of technology,

00:08:56.142 --> 00:08:57.851
which, people needed more time,

00:08:57.851 --> 00:09:01.175
you needed specialization,
in order to have that.

00:09:01.175 --> 00:09:03.811
It's, I would say, fair to say,

00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.937
we wouldn't even have our modern,

00:09:06.937 --> 00:09:09.473
our modern civilization
would not have been possible

00:09:09.473 --> 00:09:11.057
without agriculture.

00:09:11.057 --> 00:09:13.350
I would not be making this
video to you right now.

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:14.599
In fact most of us wouldn't even have been

00:09:14.599 --> 00:09:15.941
around on the planet

00:09:15.941 --> 00:09:17.897
because the planet wouldn't
have been able to support

00:09:17.897 --> 00:09:20.558
our really immensely large population

00:09:20.558 --> 00:09:24.725
without not only agriculture,
but an ever advancing,

00:09:26.221 --> 00:09:29.070
technologically advancing agriculture.

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:30.820
So it might seem like a small thing.

00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.487
You go from hunter
gatherer to agriculture,

00:09:32.487 --> 00:09:34.942
but it's been one of the
most, maybe the most profound,

00:09:34.942 --> 00:09:37.326
well it's probably up there
with language and writing,

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:39.702
things that have defined

00:09:39.702 --> 00:09:41.995
what makes humans humans.

00:09:41.995 --> 00:09:46.162
And to get a sense of where
this agriculture was born,

00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:50.709
here's the various regions that we believe

00:09:50.709 --> 00:09:52.675
agriculture emerged from.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:56.128
The Levant right over here
in the eastern Mediterranean,

00:09:56.128 --> 00:09:57.506
modern day Middle East,

00:09:57.506 --> 00:10:00.644
Syria, Israel, Palestine, Iraq,

00:10:00.644 --> 00:10:02.288
southeastern Turkey,

00:10:02.288 --> 00:10:04.005
this is one of the areas where we think

00:10:04.005 --> 00:10:05.602
agriculture first emerged

00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:09.185
on the order of 10,000
to 15,000 years ago.

00:10:10.028 --> 00:10:12.578
We believe rice came from China.

00:10:12.578 --> 00:10:16.961
I've seen estimates anywhere
from 6,000 to 13,000 years ago.

00:10:16.961 --> 00:10:19.677
You have the potato and other crops

00:10:19.677 --> 00:10:22.266
coming from the Andes
thousands of years ago,

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:24.315
and this is just a sample of the areas

00:10:24.315 --> 00:10:25.987
where we see agriculture,

00:10:25.987 --> 00:10:29.976
both domestication of crops
and animals first emerging.

00:10:29.976 --> 00:10:31.312
And what's interesting is,

00:10:31.312 --> 00:10:33.268
over time we're likely
to discover other places

00:10:33.268 --> 00:10:35.265
as we have more archaeological digs

00:10:35.265 --> 00:10:36.760
and we find more fossil evidence of

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:40.148
ancient agriculture and ancient peoples.

00:10:40.148 --> 00:10:43.108
And even the time frame where
we believe this happened,

00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:46.026
the 10,000, 12,000, 15,000 years ago,

00:10:46.026 --> 00:10:47.983
that's likely to maybe
move back a little bit

00:10:47.983 --> 00:10:51.773
as we discover older and older evidence.

00:10:51.773 --> 00:10:52.990
So I'll leave you there,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:54.829
but the big takeaway is

00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:56.998
most of human history

00:10:56.998 --> 00:10:59.372
we were not only making rough stones

00:10:59.372 --> 00:11:01.083
for our weapons and our tools,

00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:03.215
but we were chasing animals
wherever we could find 'em.

00:11:03.215 --> 00:11:05.297
We didn't have predictable food sources.

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:08.297
We were gathering fruits and grains,

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:11.685
and insects wherever we could

00:11:11.685 --> 00:11:12.985
to support our families,

00:11:12.985 --> 00:11:15.907
and there was a limit on how
many humans could be around.

00:11:15.907 --> 00:11:19.283
But shortly after the end of
the ice age, it all changed.

00:11:19.283 --> 00:11:21.004
You had a population explosion,

00:11:21.004 --> 00:11:24.337
and we think that is due to agriculture.
