00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.040
There are aspects to all of us that, if they
were exposed to a harsh or unsympathetic critic,

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.450
would result in severe humiliation and mockery.
From close up, we are, none of us, reliably

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:24.140
impressive. We get agitated, fretful, cantankerous
and panicky. Under the pressure of events,

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.380
we shout, slam doors and let out screams (or
wails). We have episodes of absurd clumsiness,

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.149
we bump into doors, trip and drop things down
our front. We're worried pretty much all the

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.390
time: about how others see us, about where
our careers are going, and about everything

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.800
important that we have forgotten to do in
our lives. We long for love, but are unthinking

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.719
and insensitive around those close to us.
We are gauche in our efforts to seduce and

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:55.780
pitiful in our requests for attention. Our
bodies have a range of shameful habits and

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.379
vulnerabilities. We are, from certain angles,
truly embarrassing propositions.

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.910
All this we struggle to hide. The inner idiot
is carefully monitored and ruthlessly gagged.

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:13.500
We have learnt from our earliest years that
the only priority around vulnerability is

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.190
to disguise it completely. We strive remorselessly
to look composed, to erase the evidence of

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.990
our silliness and to try to appear a great
deal more 'normal' than we know we are.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.940
We are understandably very focused on the
downsides of vulnerability. What is far less

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.640
well-recognised is vulnerability's occasional
very significant and profound upsides.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.400
There are moments when the revelation of weakness,
far from being a catastrophe, is the only

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.409
possible route to connection and respect.
At points we may dare to explain, with rare

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.140
frankness, that we are afraid, that we are
sometimes bad and that we have done many silly

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.250
things. And rather than appalling our companions,
these revelations may serve to endear us to

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.009
them, humanising us in their eyes, and letting
them feel that their own vulnerabilities have

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.600
echoes in the lives of others. Together, we
realise that the definition of what is normal

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.220
has missed out on key aspects of our mutual
reality.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.760
In other words, vulnerability can be a bedrock
of friendship, friendship properly understood

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.570
not just, or primarily, as a process of admiration
but as an exchange of sympathy and consolation

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.470
for the troublesome business of being alive.
There can, of course, be unfortunate ways

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.470
of handling vulnerability: when we do so in
the form of an aggressive demand that others

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.560
rescue us, or when our frailties lack boundaries,
or when we are close to rage and hysteria

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.490
rather than melancholy and grief.
Good vulnerability doesn't expect another

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:54.860
person to solve our difficulties; we let them
see a tricky part of who we are, simply in

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.750
the hope that they will be emboldened to feel
more at ease with their own, less dignified

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.580
sides. Good vulnerability is fundamentally
generous: it takes the first step at disclosure

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.710
so as to render it safe for others to unburden
themselves and disclose something of their

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:17.350
hidden selves in turn. It is a gift in the
form of a risk taken for someone else.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.410
Furthermore, displays of vulnerability have
a curious way of signalling that we are, despite

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.600
the embarrassing avowals, far from fundamentally
ridiculous or pitiful. We are, rather, strong

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:35.020
enough to be weak; to let our silliness, our
idiocy, our anger and our sadness show, confident

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.980
that these do not have to be the final verdicts
on who we are. We proceed with a bold sense

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.040
that despite the lack of surface evidence,
everyone is in the end as wounded, aggrieved,

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.750
worried and damaged as we are and that we
are not therefore, through our disclosures,

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.810
casting ourselves out of the clan for good:
we are simply reconfirming our essential membership

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.721
of the human race.
It is something of a minor tragedy that we

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:06.710
should spend so much of our lives striving
to hide our weakness when it is in fact only

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.400
upon the dignified sharing of vulnerability
that true friendship and love

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.720
can arise.
