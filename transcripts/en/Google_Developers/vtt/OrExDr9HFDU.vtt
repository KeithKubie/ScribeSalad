JOSE ALCERRECA: Welcome to
this video about the access

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.130
management API.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.792
I'm Jose Alcerreca, and
I'm here with Nick Johnson.

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:14.500
NICK JOHNSON: Hi.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.379
I am machine that
turns copy into code.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.284
And I write the AdSense app
for iPhone here at Google.

00:00:19.284 --> 00:00:20.950
JOSE ALCERRECA: Thanks
for coming, Nick.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.729
First of all, can you
show us a demo of the app?

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:24.520
NICK JOHNSON: Sure.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.660
So if we start here
on the overview page

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.260
that you'll see when
you open the app,

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.330
you have key values
for the important time

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.960
spans with deltas against
appropriate comparisons.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.180
Tap one of these and go through,
see other important metrics

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.100
for the same time period,
as well as a graph.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.050
Tapping the other
metrics, you can

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.960
see those displayed as well.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.870
If we put this in landscape
you can swipe again and also

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.290
hold a single
simulated, in this case,

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.230
finger down to examine
a value, or two fingers

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.310
if you want to
compare two values.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.320
So if I go back to
the side menu here,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.710
you can see we also
have the majority

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.050
of the reports from
the AdSense homepage.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.150
So if I select one of
these entirely at random--

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.612
I'll go with countries--
you can see a bar graph

00:01:21.612 --> 00:01:23.570
of your performance across
different countries.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.710
We can go into landscape
to examine a value.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:36.400
Or if you want to see this data
as a pie chart, just swipe this

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.280
and you get a nice
transformation.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.660
JOSE ALCERRECA: Wow.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.940
NICK JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.750
Yeah.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.940
Here, you can tap
for a landscape

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.500
to go through the same thing.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.540
JOSE ALCERRECA: Great.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.040
OK.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.560
So you're obviously using
the AdSense Management API.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.780
But are you using the Google
Client Libraries for this?

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.530
NICK JOHNSON: Yes.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.490
I'm using the Google
Client Library

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.929
for Objective C for
all of the requests.

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:00.720
JOSE ALCERRECA: OK.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.000
And I know for each page
you just use one request

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.355
or you just make one request.

00:02:07.355 --> 00:02:07.520
NICK JOHNSON: Yes.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.630
That's correct.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.169
JOSE ALCERRECA:
How do you do that?

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.970
NICK JOHNSON: Well,
actually, as an example,

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.820
if we go back to the overview
here, what you could do is

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.950
you could request this entire
time span as individual days

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.640
and then I add all
the numbers together.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.389
But you don't want to
do that, because you

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:23.630
can suffer rounding errors.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.170
The API will only return you
with accuracy down to the cent

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.310
or down to the
penny, in this case.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.410
So you want to use the
total of each report

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.680
for each one of these values.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.569
So that's a total
of eight values.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.360
What we do is we collect
all these together

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.280
into a batch, which allows
us to basically take

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.430
a list of requests and get
a list of responses back.

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.400
Objective C Client
Library has support

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.762
for several different
kinds of call backs.

00:02:52.762 --> 00:02:54.470
And in Objective C,
you can use something

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.300
called a block, which is
essentially a closure.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.500
So every single value that
comes back, our call back gets

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.770
called, updates the data.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.100
And then the batch
query has a nice feature

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.860
where you can set
an additional block

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.214
to be called right at the end,
which then updates the display.

00:03:12.214 --> 00:03:13.130
JOSE ALCERRECA: Great.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.200
Are you also using
the cache layer?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.230
NICK JOHNSON: Yes.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.380
Another benefit of
using adjacent API

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.740
is that each
request and response

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.350
is essentially a string-- so
a very simple key value cache.

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.350
JOSE ALCERRECA: You
actually store the response?

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.000
NICK JOHNSON: Yes.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.791
JOSE ALCERRECA: OK.

00:03:29.791 --> 00:03:30.870
That's cool.

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.900
All right.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.720
So when developers start
coding for the management

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.200
API for any APIs at Google, they
have to readjust to the project

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.090
first.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.370
For iOS, what are the options?

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.140
Because you have install
application, web application.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.410
NICK JOHNSON: It's the web
application and service

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.370
count on option.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.400
And you have to go with
an installed application.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.890
Just a regular other
installed application

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.740
will work just fine.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.820
But for extra security, you
can use the iOS specific option

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.450
that's available there as well.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:04.770
JOSE ALCERRECA: OK.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.270
Great.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.970
And what about performance?

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.450
Do you have to do anything
special to imporve it?

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.830
NICK JOHNSON: Batching
is the main thing.

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.770
An improved
performance means you

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.790
don't have to worry so
much about synchronization.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.399
And happily, just about
everything else we

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.485
need is provided by
the Client Library

00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:27.230
by Core Animation in iOS itself
and excellent open source

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:28.989
library called
NimbusKit, which we use.

00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:29.780
JOSE ALCERRECA: OK.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:30.660
That's great.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.430
OK.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.096
Thank you very much
for your time, Nick,

00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:34.960
and congrats on an awesome job.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:35.640
NICK JOHNSON: Thank
you very much.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.431
JOSE ALCERRECA: OK.

00:04:36.431 --> 00:04:37.900
See you later.
