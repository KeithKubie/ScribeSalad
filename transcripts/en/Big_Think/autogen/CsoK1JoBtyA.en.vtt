one of the reasons why computer security
is so hard is because you have to get

is so hard is because you have to get
 

00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:07.730
is so hard is because you have to get
absolutely everything right in order to

absolutely everything right in order to
 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.380

to use to count votes

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700
to use to count votes
 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.030
to use to count votes
and so it's not that there's not a

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040
and so it's not that there's not a
 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.949
and so it's not that there's not a
monoculture where every single voting's

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959
monoculture where every single voting's
 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.470

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.979
determined on the state-by-state basis
so you have 50 different state

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989
so you have 50 different state

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560
somebody could have replaced the code
 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.670
somebody could have replaced the code
hacked in and made it count in a

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680
hacked in and made it count in a
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.440
hacked in and made it count in a
slightly skewed way in a very skewed way

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450
slightly skewed way in a very skewed way
 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.210
slightly skewed way in a very skewed way
you really have no way of telling so

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220
you really have no way of telling so
 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.280
you really have no way of telling so
that technology is bad people pretty

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290
that technology is bad people pretty
 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.960
that technology is bad people pretty
much know that technology is bad and

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970
much know that technology is bad and
 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.729
much know that technology is bad and
it's being phased out so no one is

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739
it's being phased out so no one is
 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.440
it's being phased out so no one is
trying to buy more of these machines at

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450
trying to buy more of these machines at
 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.610
trying to buy more of these machines at
this point and they're no longer being

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620
this point and they're no longer being
 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.770
this point and they're no longer being
manufactured so we're trending in a good

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780
manufactured so we're trending in a good
 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.410
manufactured so we're trending in a good
direction as far as that's concerned a

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420
direction as far as that's concerned a
 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.970
direction as far as that's concerned a
different kind of machine are the

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980
different kind of machine are the
 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.309
different kind of machine are the
optical scanning machines where you fill

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319
optical scanning machines where you fill
 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:45.449
optical scanning machines where you fill
out it's kind of like a scantron form

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459
out it's kind of like a scantron form
 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.280
out it's kind of like a scantron form
from elementary school where you fill

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290
from elementary school where you fill
 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.990
from elementary school where you fill
out the multiple-choice questions on the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000
out the multiple-choice questions on the
 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.940
out the multiple-choice questions on the
form and then the form is read

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950
form and then the form is read
 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.250
form and then the form is read
electronically and now the program

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260
electronically and now the program
 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.410
electronically and now the program
that's doing the reading has all the

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420
that's doing the reading has all the
 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.759
that's doing the reading has all the
problems of the system that I talked

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769
problems of the system that I talked
 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.030
problems of the system that I talked
about before where it is software that's

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040
about before where it is software that's
 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.949
about before where it is software that's
scanning and counting and could be buggy

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959
scanning and counting and could be buggy
 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.229
scanning and counting and could be buggy
could be corrupted by somebody who's

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239
could be corrupted by somebody who's
 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.120
could be corrupted by somebody who's
hacking in but you still have that paper

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130
hacking in but you still have that paper
 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:08.160
hacking in but you still have that paper
record so you can go back after the fact

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170
record so you can go back after the fact
 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.339
record so you can go back after the fact
and audit to confirm that the report

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349
and audit to confirm that the report
 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:12.870
and audit to confirm that the report
that the amount the total that was

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880
that the amount the total that was
 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.089
that the amount the total that was
reported was actually the correct and so

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099
reported was actually the correct and so
 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.460
reported was actually the correct and so
that that post-facto auditing capability

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470
that that post-facto auditing capability
 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.920
that that post-facto auditing capability
is really important most states use this

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930
is really important most states use this
 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.500
is really important most states use this
technology now some states have in place

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510
technology now some states have in place
 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.360
technology now some states have in place
an automatic auditing process so

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370
an automatic auditing process so
 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.190
an automatic auditing process so
independent of whether any candidate

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200
independent of whether any candidate
 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.770
independent of whether any candidate
asks for an audit they go and pick some

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780
asks for an audit they go and pick some
 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.690
asks for an audit they go and pick some
number of the voting districts and some

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700
number of the voting districts and some
 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.040
number of the voting districts and some
number of the ballots and they check to

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050
number of the ballots and they check to
 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.870
number of the ballots and they check to
make sure that the counting process was

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880
make sure that the counting process was
 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.060
make sure that the counting process was
correct I think probably the level of

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070
correct I think probably the level of
 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.530
correct I think probably the level of
auditing isn't sufficient there needs to

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540
auditing isn't sufficient there needs to
 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.420
auditing isn't sufficient there needs to
be broader auditing and more random

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430
be broader auditing and more random
 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.250
be broader auditing and more random
auditing going on but it's definitely a

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260
auditing going on but it's definitely a
 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.560
auditing going on but it's definitely a
step in the right direction the

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570
step in the right direction the
 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.240
step in the right direction the
principle the people in this who work in

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250
principle the people in this who work in
 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.650
principle the people in this who work in
this area talk about is they want to

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660
this area talk about is they want to
 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.690
this area talk about is they want to
make sure that they can guarantee the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700
make sure that they can guarantee the
 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.540
make sure that they can guarantee the
results are correct even if a nefarious

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550
results are correct even if a nefarious
 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.950
results are correct even if a nefarious
person wrote the code that did the

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960
person wrote the code that did the
 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.010
person wrote the code that did the
counting so it has to work even if the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020
counting so it has to work even if the
 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.790
counting so it has to work even if the
software was completely buggy and this

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800
software was completely buggy and this
 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.720
software was completely buggy and this
optical scanning reading technology

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730
optical scanning reading technology
 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.640
optical scanning reading technology
satisfies that characteristic because

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650
satisfies that characteristic because
 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.100
satisfies that characteristic because
even if the code that that does the if

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110
even if the code that that does the if
 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.070
even if the code that that does the if
it the counting of the scantron form is

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080
it the counting of the scantron form is
 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.290
it the counting of the scantron form is
buggy they can go look at the physical

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300
buggy they can go look at the physical
 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.790
buggy they can go look at the physical
forms and figure out that there was a

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800
forms and figure out that there was a
 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.160
forms and figure out that there was a
mistake and corrected using different

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170
mistake and corrected using different
 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.720
mistake and corrected using different
software so there's an audibility

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730
software so there's an audibility
 

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.480
software so there's an audibility
capability that exists in that that kind

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490
capability that exists in that that kind
 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.520
capability that exists in that that kind
of technology that doesn't exist if you

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530
of technology that doesn't exist if you
 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.010
of technology that doesn't exist if you
have no paper trail so I think at this

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020
have no paper trail so I think at this
 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.900
have no paper trail so I think at this
point we kind of know how to do it from

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:24.910
point we kind of know how to do it from
 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.340
point we kind of know how to do it from
a tactical point of view and the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350
a tactical point of view and the
 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.290
a tactical point of view and the
question is getting the states all to

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300
question is getting the states all to
 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.490
question is getting the states all to
shift to that new kind of technology

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500
shift to that new kind of technology
 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:38.300
shift to that new kind of technology
