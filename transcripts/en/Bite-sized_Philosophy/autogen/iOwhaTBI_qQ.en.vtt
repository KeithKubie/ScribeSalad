00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.260
might be wondering what a beam is and a
mote is a dust speck and a beam is a

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270
mote is a dust speck and a beam is a
 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.470
mote is a dust speck and a beam is a
very large piece of lumber and so the

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480
very large piece of lumber and so the
 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.679
very large piece of lumber and so the
issue is not so much the blindness of

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
issue is not so much the blindness of
 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.290
issue is not so much the blindness of
others even though there's as much

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300
others even though there's as much
 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.639
others even though there's as much
blindness among others as there is as

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
blindness among others as there is as
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.510
blindness among others as there is as
there is for you but the issue here the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520
there is for you but the issue here the
 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.330
there is for you but the issue here the
advice here the description here is you

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340
advice here the description here is you
 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.470
advice here the description here is you
should be concerned about what's

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
should be concerned about what's
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.560
should be concerned about what's
interfering with your own vision first

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570
interfering with your own vision first
 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.610
interfering with your own vision first
and you should leave other people the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620
and you should leave other people the
 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889
and you should leave other people the
hell alone in relationship to that and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
hell alone in relationship to that and
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.690
hell alone in relationship to that and
so if you're a mode of being in the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
so if you're a mode of being in the
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.060
so if you're a mode of being in the
world is if you would just act better

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070
world is if you would just act better
 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.290
world is if you would just act better
things would improve for me or if you

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
things would improve for me or if you
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.389
things would improve for me or if you
identify the evil and the catastrophe is

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
identify the evil and the catastrophe is
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.970
identify the evil and the catastrophe is
something that's outside that someone

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980
something that's outside that someone
 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.470
something that's outside that someone
else needs to fix or that someone's

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480
else needs to fix or that someone's
 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.240
else needs to fix or that someone's
response someone else is responsible for

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
response someone else is responsible for
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:15.380
response someone else is responsible for
then then you're not going to fix that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
then then you're not going to fix that
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.289
then then you're not going to fix that
and you're going to remain blind to the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299
and you're going to remain blind to the
 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.609
and you're going to remain blind to the
things that you're doing and not doing

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
things that you're doing and not doing
 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.550
things that you're doing and not doing
that make things not go well and so it's

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560
that make things not go well and so it's
 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.080
that make things not go well and so it's
just better to think

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090
just better to think
 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.539
just better to think
alright I'm probably blind in many many

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549
alright I'm probably blind in many many
 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.240
alright I'm probably blind in many many
ways and maybe there are some ways that

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
ways and maybe there are some ways that
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.100
ways and maybe there are some ways that
I could rectify that because it's highly

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110
I could rectify that because it's highly
 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.749
I could rectify that because it's highly
probable that you're blind in all sorts

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
probable that you're blind in all sorts
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.940
probable that you're blind in all sorts
of ways I mean it's in fact it's

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950
of ways I mean it's in fact it's
 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.120
of ways I mean it's in fact it's
virtually certain and so it's just more

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130
virtually certain and so it's just more
 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.960
virtually certain and so it's just more
useful to think how is it that I'm wrong

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970
useful to think how is it that I'm wrong
 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.789
useful to think how is it that I'm wrong
in this situation I'll tell you

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799
in this situation I'll tell you
 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.800
in this situation I'll tell you
something that I learned to do when I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
something that I learned to do when I
 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.630
something that I learned to do when I
was arguing with my wife which happened

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640
was arguing with my wife which happened
 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.990
was arguing with my wife which happened
quite frequently because when you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000
quite frequently because when you
 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.609
quite frequently because when you
actually communicate with people you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
actually communicate with people you
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.080
actually communicate with people you
find out that there's many things that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090
find out that there's many things that
 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.030
find out that there's many things that
you don't agree on and that's because

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040
you don't agree on and that's because
 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.530
you don't agree on and that's because
you're actually different creatures and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
you're actually different creatures and
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.569
you're actually different creatures and
so if you're actually going to have a

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579
so if you're actually going to have a
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.039
so if you're actually going to have a
truthful conversation then you're going

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049
truthful conversation then you're going
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.469
truthful conversation then you're going
to find out that you don't see things

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
to find out that you don't see things
 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.240
to find out that you don't see things
the same way and then you can either

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250
the same way and then you can either
 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.160
the same way and then you can either
pretend that that's not the case and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170
pretend that that's not the case and
 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.529
pretend that that's not the case and
gloss over it and then end up in a 30

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
gloss over it and then end up in a 30
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.330
gloss over it and then end up in a 30
year silent war or you can

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340
year silent war or you can
 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.699
year silent war or you can
or you can have the damn fight when you

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709
or you can have the damn fight when you
 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.930
or you can have the damn fight when you
need to have it and see if you could

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940
need to have it and see if you could
 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.410
need to have it and see if you could
straighten it out so now and then we'd

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420
straighten it out so now and then we'd
 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.000
straighten it out so now and then we'd
get in a situation where we were at

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010
get in a situation where we were at
 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.910
get in a situation where we were at
loggerheads we couldn't move and you

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920
loggerheads we couldn't move and you
 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.309
loggerheads we couldn't move and you
know it would spiral up into hate speech

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319
know it would spiral up into hate speech
 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.470
know it would spiral up into hate speech
let's say cuz yeah

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480
let's say cuz yeah
 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.210
let's say cuz yeah
everyone laughs because they know they

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220
everyone laughs because they know they
 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.070
everyone laughs because they know they
manifest plenty of hate speech towards

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080
manifest plenty of hate speech towards
 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.070
manifest plenty of hate speech towards
those they love so one of the things we

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080
those they love so one of the things we
 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.039
those they love so one of the things we
learned to do was when we hit an impasse

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049
learned to do was when we hit an impasse
 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.670
learned to do was when we hit an impasse
was to separate and to go our own ways

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680
was to separate and to go our own ways
 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.280
was to separate and to go our own ways
and to go sit and think okay look we're

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290
and to go sit and think okay look we're
 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.880
and to go sit and think okay look we're
at this unpleasant situation we can't

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890
at this unpleasant situation we can't
 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.800
at this unpleasant situation we can't
figure out how to move forward I'd

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810
figure out how to move forward I'd
 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.170
figure out how to move forward I'd
always think of course it's her fault

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180
always think of course it's her fault
 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.550
always think of course it's her fault
obviously it's her fault least 95

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560
obviously it's her fault least 95
 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.300
obviously it's her fault least 95
percent but maybe there was something I

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310
percent but maybe there was something I
 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.270
percent but maybe there was something I
did that contributed like 5 percent to

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280
did that contributed like 5 percent to
 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.960
did that contributed like 5 percent to
it and so I would sit and think and ask

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970
it and so I would sit and think and ask
 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.839
it and so I would sit and think and ask
myself a question which was is there

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849
myself a question which was is there
 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:12.490
myself a question which was is there
anything I did in the last six months

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500
anything I did in the last six months
 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.460
anything I did in the last six months
that increased the probability that this

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470
that increased the probability that this
 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.650
that increased the probability that this
impasse would manifest itself and I'll

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660
impasse would manifest itself and I'll
 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.599
impasse would manifest itself and I'll
tell you you have no idea how fast your

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609
tell you you have no idea how fast your
 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:21.009
tell you you have no idea how fast your
mind will generate an answer to a

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019
mind will generate an answer to a
 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.110
mind will generate an answer to a
question like that because there's

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120
question like that because there's
 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.059
question like that because there's
undoubtedly some idiotic thing that you

00:03:25.059 --> 00:03:25.069
undoubtedly some idiotic thing that you
 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:27.309
undoubtedly some idiotic thing that you
did that you know that you remember that

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319
did that you know that you remember that
 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.720
did that you know that you remember that
increase the probability that you're

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730
increase the probability that you're
 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.280
increase the probability that you're
going to have your hands around the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290
going to have your hands around the
 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.870
going to have your hands around the
throat of the person that you love and

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880
throat of the person that you love and
 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.990
throat of the person that you love and
then you can go tell them that and then

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000
then you can go tell them that and then
 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.970
then you can go tell them that and then
you can have a conversation especially

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
you can have a conversation especially
 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.890
you can have a conversation especially
if they do the same thing say look you

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900
if they do the same thing say look you
 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.410
if they do the same thing say look you
know here's how I'm an idiot in this

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420
know here's how I'm an idiot in this
 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.319
know here's how I'm an idiot in this
situation now the person says well yeah

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329
situation now the person says well yeah
 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.479
situation now the person says well yeah
