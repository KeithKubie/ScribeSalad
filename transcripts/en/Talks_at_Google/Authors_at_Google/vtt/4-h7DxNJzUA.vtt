[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:09.270
RACHEL O'MEARA: Hi, everybody.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:10.110
I'm Rachel O'Meara.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.840
I'm based here in San Francisco.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:17.570
I'm really excited to be hosting
our speaker today, Carter Cast.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.370
A little bit about Carter, he's
here to talk about his book,

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.500
"The Right and Wrong Stuff."

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.890
And Carter just came
in from Chicago.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.740
He is a professor at
Northwestern University

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.630
in the Kellogg
School of Management.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.850
He is a active teacher in the
entrepreneurship and business

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.700
school courses there,
which is great.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.810
He's also an established
business veteran and a venture

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:43.450
capitalist.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.459
So Carter started his career
at PepsiCo and derailed.

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:51.750
So we're going to hear more
about that, I think, today.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.670
I love that word, derailed.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.310
And landed on his
feet, obviously.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.990
He also was the chief
marketing officer, or founder,

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:02.890
of Blue Nile.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.590
So if you actually
remember that company

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.760
from the days of
the heyday, I do,

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.310
then he was one of those
integral people from there,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.290
and worked with
DoubleClick as they

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.050
were active with Blue Nile.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.600
And also worked as the
CEO of Walmart.com.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.770
So a lot of experience.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.350
We're super excited
to hear about what

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.280
he's going to share
today about careers,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.590
and derailing, and
getting back on track.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.170
So please welcome Carter Cast.

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.040
CARTER CAST: Thank you.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.750
Thank you.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.120
So one of the
questions I get is,

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.070
why would you write
a book about failure?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.620
So let me tell you.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.925
What piqued my interest in
this topic was I had a--

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:50.650
I lost touch with an old boss.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.300
And he was super fancy, the
right schools, and super smart.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.010
And I lost touch with him.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.820
And about 10 years after
the last time we'd met,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.310
I called him up and I asked
him, how is your wife?

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.060
How are your kids?

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.100
And then I said,
how's your career?

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.180
What are you doing?

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.340
And there was this
disappointment in his voice

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.410
when he talked about his career.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.560
And he hadn't reached the
expected level of achievement

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.950
that I thought he would and
that, probably, other people

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.760
thought, too.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.610
So we hung up the phone.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.510
And I literally wrote
on a sticky note,

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.870
what impedes the progress
of talented people?

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.410
And I stuck it on my
wall at Northwestern.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.050
And then I decided it
was such a-- it's sort

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.360
of a provocative
question for me that I

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.100
asked the dean of
the business school

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.430
if I could take a quarter off
from teaching and just research

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.690
and see, are there certain
behavioral traits, or skill

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.140
gaps, certain
themes, that account

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.550
for people that are good, not
achieving their expected level

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.180
of development?

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.530
And so what I found
is, there are.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.200
And then I flipped
the topic on its head.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.090
And I looked at, what do high
performers that don't derail--

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.120
what do they got?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.920
What's the right stuff?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.340
And so one of the
major ways I did this--

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.100
I interviewed 100 people
who got fired or demoted.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.470
I talked to a lot of coaches,
HR, VPs, executive recruiters,

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.940
CEOs.

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.840
But I also mined 360
research databases.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.500
So I looked at thousands
and thousands of 360s,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.910
and teased out the difference
between people in the top 10%.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.320
People that were the top 10% in
managerial effectiveness, what

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.500
was their competency
profile set versus people

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.500
that were rated in the top
and the bottom quartile?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.170
And I found that there's these
very specific competencies

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.950
they have.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.990
What's kind of cool is,
it's not like they're

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:48.340
good at everything.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.260
There's only a couple of things
that these people are good at,

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.980
but they're good at these
things consistently.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.270
I I'll get into those.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.030
OK?

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.220
So what I thought
we'd do here is

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.130
I will go on and talk
for about 30 minutes.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.010
And I'm going to go over
these five reasons I found

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.480
that people run into trouble.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.180
And then we'll take a
break and have questions.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.870
And then for the last
10 or 15 minutes,

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.010
I'll talk about the right
stuff, what people that do well,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.450
what these competencies are.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.380
OK?

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.062
So we're going to look at
both sides of the question.

00:04:22.062 --> 00:04:24.270
We're going to look at why
do talented people derail?

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.270
But also, what do high
performers do very specifically

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.630
that's different?

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.610
So first of all, this
is not a niche topic.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.474
1/2 to 2/3 of us will
have a derailment event.

00:04:36.474 --> 00:04:37.890
Either we'll get
demoted or fired.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:38.389
I did.

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.395
So I'll talk about
that very honestly.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.400
Let me talk about definitions.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.200
When I talk about
derailment, I'm

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.970
talking about people
who didn't reach

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.380
the expected level
of achievement

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.470
by the HR department
or by their boss.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.050
So they're not
people-- by the way,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.180
this is not a
personal derailment.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.540
I did not look in
this dataset at people

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.670
that derailed because they
loved living in Boulder,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.128
and they wanted to
stay in Boulder,

00:05:04.128 --> 00:05:05.790
so they didn't take a move.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.356
Or they are triathletes,
and they wanted to work out,

00:05:08.356 --> 00:05:10.230
and they only wanted to
work 20 hours a week,

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.420
or they had to take
care of their kids

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.220
and they worked
three days a week.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.190
If they made personal
decisions that accounted for a,

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.710
quote unquote, "derailment,"
that was their decision.

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.680
I'm looking here at people
that wanted the brass ring

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.140
and were working their
tail off and didn't get it.

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:26.310
What happens?

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:27.480
OK?

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.270
The second caveat
to this is I found,

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.220
looking at all this
research for three years,

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.980
that organizations
are complicit.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.500
They move people too quickly.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.920
They ignore bad
behavior if the person

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.780
is hitting their numbers.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.730
And they don't require superiors
to develop subordinates

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.590
like they used to.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:53.040
You could say maybe part
of that's the gig economy,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.020
but the problem is, as
a result, employees--

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.360
us, we, aren't getting
the feedback we

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.280
need in most organizations.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.440
So I think it's wonderful
that you do events

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.810
like this so you can hear
from a wide variety of people.

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.950
So here are the five reasons I
found over, and over, and over,

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:14.910
in the research.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.230
To make this more palatable
and a little less jarring--

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.987
instead of saying, oh, I suffer
from interpersonal issues,

00:06:22.987 --> 00:06:24.570
you could say, oh,
I have a little bit

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.730
of Captain Fantastic in me.

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:32.400
So I created these archetypes to
make the topic less difficult.

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.860
So here's the first reason.

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.270
This is Captain Fantastic.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.730
This is the fellow who
bruises you on his quest

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.080
for the holy grail
of the corner office.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.010
He's ego-driven,
he's dismissive,

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.840
he's got poor listening skills.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.580
I, Me, Mine is his mantra.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.210
And we've all experienced him.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:55.120
And he usually does well
because he's a self-promoter,

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.950
but then he hits a
wall at a certain point

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.440
because he gets in
a complex assignment

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.200
where he needs the
enlistment of other people,

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.880
and they don't want
to work with him.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.350
And eventually,
you'll see that he

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:07.630
was moved to special
projects, and then

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.390
from there, six weeks later,
he's no longer in the building.

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:12.110
We know this guy.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.910
So he has a relational
issues, overly ambitious,

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:17.740
driven by ego.

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.790
Now, let's say you're
not this person.

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.100
There's another aspect of
this interpersonal issues

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.960
I want you to-- maybe you
should pay attention to.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:32.380
So this woman named Karen Horney
was a clinical psychiatrist

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.060
in the '40s and '50s.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.770
And she did a lot
of work with people

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.520
that have everyday neuroses.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:42.130
She found that we have three
tendencies under pressure.

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:45.180
We do three things
that self-sabotage.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.880
She said we either
move away from people

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:52.350
when times are difficult.
We distance ourselves,

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:57.920
we're skeptics, we're cautious,
we move against people,

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.910
we're combative, or
we move towards people

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.770
by being ingratiating.

00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:05.390
So that's Karen Horney.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:08.960
So Robert and Joyce
Hogan took her work

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.510
and developed the Hogan
Development System,

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.730
which is a very
powerful tool that

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.100
looks at a whole
variety of things

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.210
from goals, to potential,
to derailment propensities.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:23.450
And they took her
work and they found

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:27.860
these 11 specific
behavioral traits

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.740
that happen to all of us.

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.429
Under pressure, we
do one of 11 things.

00:08:34.429 --> 00:08:37.220
We will-- you see that first
block, excitable, skeptic,

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.000
cautious?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.710
That is the moving away
from the Karen Horney found.

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:45.680
Then, that next block
is the moving against,

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.680
by being mischievous, or
arrogant, or melodramatic.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.210
And then the last
block is moving

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:53.230
towards by being ingratiating.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:56.380
All of us do at least
one of these things

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.120
I've taken this test.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.830
I had two.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:00.850
My sister's taken it.

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:02.440
She had a couple.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.210
We created this Zell Fellows--

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:09.750
Sam Zell-- we created
a program at Kellogg,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.102
and we take high
potential entrepreneurs

00:09:12.102 --> 00:09:13.810
and we put them in
this boot camp program

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:15.370
called Zell Scholars.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.670
And we make all of the
Zell Scholars take this.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:20.650
And all of them have
some of these tendencies

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.010
because we're human.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:23.170
We're going to have some.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.930
The question is, do
you understand your own

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:29.180
so that they don't hurt you?

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:34.720
So there is a recent Harvard
Business Review article,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.160
two weeks ago.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.690
Eurich, E-U-R-I-C-H. She
did this meta analysis

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:42.627
on self-awareness.

00:09:42.627 --> 00:09:43.460
You ought to get it.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.700
It's a great article.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.120
And she said there's two
types of self-awareness.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.700
Internal self-awareness--
do we understand ourselves?

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.900
Do we understand our
motives, and our weaknesses,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.930
our strengths, our
vulnerabilities?

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:55.900
And there's external
self-awareness.

00:09:55.900 --> 00:09:58.170
Do we understand how we
are viewed by other people?

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:03.870
And she said that 10 to 15%
of us have self-awareness.

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:09.750
10 to 15% of us, 85 to 90%
of us lack self-awareness.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.330
So the Hogan is a
great way to understand

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:15.420
where you might have some of
these interpersonal areas that

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.070
are holding you back.

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:19.200
Here's a guy.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:22.740
Right about this time,
this guy derailed.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:27.090
This is me, right
about 29 or 30,

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.540
and I was called
into my boss's office

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:32.880
during my annual
performance review.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.669
He told me I was insubordinate.

00:10:34.669 --> 00:10:35.460
I was at Frito-Lay.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.470
I was a senior
marketing manager.

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.760
He said, you're insubordinate.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.320
You don't take my
direction well.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.430
You're recalcitrant.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:42.590
I had to look that up.

00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.220
I wasn't quite sure
what that mean.

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.650
And I want you off my team.

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:48.870
And I said, Mike--

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:51.620
I'll call him Mike because
that was his name, Mike.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.490
Mike, are you firing me?

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:57.570
And he said, not technically,
but good luck finding somebody

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:00.340
who wants you in their group.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.110
And so I took two weeks off.

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:05.660
And I talked to my dad.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.340
I said, dad, what do I do?

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:09.230
Can you believe this guy?

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.730
And he said, well,
your mother and I

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:13.850
are amazed you've made it
seven years in a corporation.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:15.994
So he wasn't much help.

00:11:15.994 --> 00:11:18.410
So I decided to go back to
Frito-Lay because I didn't want

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:21.170
to end on that kind of a note.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.340
And I came back and found
that I had this reputation

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.790
for being difficult to manage.

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:29.510
And I finally
found this guy that

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:31.190
would take me in his group.

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.000
He's a Canadian.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.950
He had just moved
from Canada, so he

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.990
didn't know my reputation.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:39.670
And he took me in,
and he helped me.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.990
But what happened was
I took this Hogan.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.350
And I had these two traits that
if I would have known about

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.570
and would have been able
to manage more effectively,

00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:51.750
I probably wouldn't have run
into this trouble with my boss.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.782
This trait of leisurely is--

00:11:53.782 --> 00:11:54.990
it's a weird word, leisurely.

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:57.930
It's basically when the
heavy hand of authority

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:01.710
pushes on you, you tend
to sort of blow it off.

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:03.990
I may or I may not
follow the direction

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:07.900
that my boss is suggesting.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.210
And mischievous, in
my case, which is,

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.770
let's throw a grenade in this
meeting just to liven it up.

00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.940
And so these traits I
had served me poorly

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.630
with a bureaucratic system
and a heavy-handed boss,

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:24.030
and I derailed.

00:12:24.030 --> 00:12:26.740
And my point in sharing
this story with you

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.300
is, if I would have
understood this about myself,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:31.150
I think I could
have reined this in.

00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:34.840
Once I understood this
about myself, that trait--

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.090
those traits-- I
still have them.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.250
I still have the tendency,
but they don't come out

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.890
to play as much because
I'm aware of them,

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.660
and I'm aware of certain
situations that stoke them.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:49.420
So that is the first
one, Captain Fantastic.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.535
Even if you aren't
that cat, that's

00:12:51.535 --> 00:12:55.450
this arrogant and ego-driven,
you still probably

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:58.090
have one of those
11 Hogan traits

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.410
that you've got
to watch out for.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:06.870
So there's a good book
called "Why CEOs Fail"

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:10.770
buy Dotlich and Cairo,
C-A-I-R-O, and in that,

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.610
they take the 11 Hogan
traits, and they list specific

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:18.050
questions you can ask yourself
to see if you have any of them.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.080
And you will.

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.170
So it's the devil you know here.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.330
Second reason people fail.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.570
That first one, by the
way, is more in men,

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:29.924
and it's often as you get to
be higher and higher level,

00:13:29.924 --> 00:13:31.590
you stop listening
to people because you

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:33.480
think you have the answers.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.810
And you start
thinking that you know

00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.810
it and you don't seek feedback
from the front line who always

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:41.185
have the answers,
because they're

00:13:41.185 --> 00:13:42.610
closest to the customer.

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:44.580
The second one is
the solo flyer.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:48.120
This happens, usually,
pretty early in careers.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.670
What happens is you get a
strong individual contributor,

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.830
they get promoted,
and they still

00:13:52.830 --> 00:13:55.940
try to do all the
work themselves.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.100
So they micromanage.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.490
They usually fail to
develop their team.

00:14:02.490 --> 00:14:06.990
They hand out tasks, but they
don't develop the people.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.930
Lominger Limited is a company
that does talent management.

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.400
Lominger.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.080
They were just bought
by Korn Ferry recently.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.980
Lominger looks at 67
managerial competencies.

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.720
It's a lot.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:20.340
Most companies look at about 10.

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:20.910
They have 10.

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:22.740
I don't know how
many Google has.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:29.040
But 67th of 67 in terms of
managerial effectiveness,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.340
developing others.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.780
It's the lowest rated
trait by managers.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.640
So the chances are
pretty good that you

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.560
aren't going to
be developed well,

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.992
and so you have
to do it yourself.

00:14:42.992 --> 00:14:44.950
The other thing that was
interesting in looking

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:46.783
at this-- because you
get the micromanaging.

00:14:46.783 --> 00:14:48.640
You have to learn to let go.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.740
Actually, Linda Hill,
this professor at Harvard

00:14:50.740 --> 00:14:53.290
said, getting promoted
into management from being

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:55.150
an individual
contributor is literally

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.190
a transformation of identity.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:01.090
We have to learn to go
from doing to enabling.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:01.780
And it's hard.

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:05.650
When you're good at doing, it's
hard to let go of the doing.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:08.990
So this third one that
was interesting to me,

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.320
Linda Hill also found.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:14.350
She wrote this book called
"Becoming a Manager."

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.600
She followed 20 managers
around who just got promoted.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.365
And she saw-- like
ethnographic research.

00:15:19.365 --> 00:15:20.740
She kind of followed
them around,

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:23.950
took notes like Jane Goodall
did in "Gorillas in the Mist,"

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.150
watching.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:29.170
And she said that one of the
things managers did poorly

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.240
was they didn't
realize that it's

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.522
one thing for me to manage you.

00:15:33.522 --> 00:15:35.230
And it's one thing
for me-- another thing

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.420
for me to manage
this team, here.

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.640
But at least half
my time as a manager

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.680
should be enabling
this team to be

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.470
effective by building
bridges to other functions

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.300
where we have dependencies.

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:49.830
And so she calls that
managing context.

00:15:49.830 --> 00:15:52.770
Are you managing the context
surrounding your team?

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.210
Are you building bridges?

00:15:54.210 --> 00:15:57.270
So I asked people, if you
list your key initiatives

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:00.290
that you're working on,
and then you listed next

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:04.205
to them, the people that
you have dependencies on,

00:16:04.205 --> 00:16:06.330
and then you list next to
them, what's your contact

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:07.972
strategy with those people?

00:16:07.972 --> 00:16:09.180
Are you taking them to lunch?

00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:10.740
Are you taking them to coffee?

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:12.900
When's the last time you
interacted with them?

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:16.170
You've got to be managing the
context because, obviously,

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.340
business is a team sport.

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.970
So we have all these
dependencies cross-functionally

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:22.310
that we rely on.

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:24.450
Solo flyer doesn't
understand that yet.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:33.920
So the third reason for
derailment is Version 1.0.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.040
And this one's
sort of terrifying.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.500
This happens a lot mid-career.

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.080
You get complacent in your job.

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.730
You're good at your job.

00:16:42.730 --> 00:16:46.420
And you kind of dial
down your curiosity.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.020
And you don't stay up to
speed on cryptocurrency.

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:53.440
And you aren't quite sure how
AI might apply to your customer

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.000
service business.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.500
You don't understand
what Audible's

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.810
doing to disrupt the
subscription model,

00:16:58.810 --> 00:17:00.280
to disrupt the publishing model.

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:03.340
You just don't stay
current, and you become

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.069
this fossilized dinosaur guy.

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:07.839
That's Version 1.0.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.050
So he suffers from
changing circumstances,

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.859
lack of adaptability, a lot of
times, to technological change.

00:17:14.859 --> 00:17:16.810
But sometimes, it's
another kind of change.

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.240
He's not adaptable to
getting a new boss.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.859
When I derailed, I was doing
really well with my old boss,

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:25.450
and he was a very
empowering boss.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.240
When I got the new boss
who was more participative,

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.306
I had organ
rejection, and I lost.

00:17:32.306 --> 00:17:32.930
He didn't lose.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.360
I lost.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.570
So that's the first one.

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.860
Then the other one is just
making sure you stay curious.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:43.030
So I asked people that
might suffer from this,

00:17:43.030 --> 00:17:45.970
how well are you honing
your discovery skills?

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:52.440
This is based on work from
Clayton Christensen of Harvard.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:56.610
He looked at executives that
have either delivery skills--

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:59.250
he found they kind of neatly
break out into delivery skills

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.600
and discovery skills.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.450
Delivery skills are like
analyzing, executing,

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.150
communicating, aligning.

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.680
And discovery skills
are these five.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:16.920
So how well-- he also found
that people that are innovative

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:22.510
have a ratio of 6:1 on questions
asked to statements made.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.210
So they ask a lot of
questions, a lot of "what if"

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.070
and "how might we" questions.

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:28.849
They also observe customers.

00:18:28.849 --> 00:18:29.890
They go out in the field.

00:18:29.890 --> 00:18:31.306
They go out in the
market and they

00:18:31.306 --> 00:18:35.020
watch customers interact with
the product to understand,

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:36.520
what problems are they facing?

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.320
What kind of work-arounds
are they doing?

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.180
How can they
improve the product?

00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:41.934
One time, I spent some time--

00:18:41.934 --> 00:18:44.350
I teach this class that's all
about this stuff, called New

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.420
Venture Discovery at Kellogg.

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:48.550
You might know
the shoe Allbirds?

00:18:48.550 --> 00:18:50.290
That came out of my class.

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:52.600
That was a student
in my class that

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.790
invented the shoe in our class.

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:55.931
We build prototypes.

00:18:55.931 --> 00:18:56.930
We go out in the market.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.950
We test these rough
prototypes, digital prototypes.

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:02.350
Then we build
physical prototypes,

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.240
kind of [INAUDIBLE] research.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.850
Tim Brown developed
Allbirds doing a lot

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:08.530
of this observational research.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.040
One time, I was
with this guy who

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:14.210
was the product manager
on an adult diaper brand.

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:16.844
We were doing some
research with him.

00:19:16.844 --> 00:19:18.760
And I said, well, what's
it like to-- how long

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:19.490
have you been on the business?

00:19:19.490 --> 00:19:20.750
He said, four years.

00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:23.380
I said, what's it like
to wear the diapers?

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:25.390
And he said, well,
I'm not incontinent.

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.619
And I said, I know, but
if you put on the diapers

00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:30.160
and then you pee in them, what's
it like when you walk around

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.180
with that on?

00:19:31.180 --> 00:19:33.110
And he said, well,
I've never done that.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.180
And I said, how
do you understand

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:35.929
what your customer is
going through if you

00:19:35.929 --> 00:19:37.210
aren't wearing the product?

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.870
So discovery research is
being out in the shoes

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:43.150
of the customer and seeing
what they experience.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:45.580
It's also experimenting.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.199
I know Google is
very good at this,

00:19:47.199 --> 00:19:48.490
and Amazon's very good at this.

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:50.680
Bezos once said,
I haven't failed.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.290
I've just found 1,000
things that don't work.

00:19:53.290 --> 00:19:54.760
This is A/B testing.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.714
This is building
rough prototypes

00:19:56.714 --> 00:19:58.630
and getting them out in
the hands of customers

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.930
and watching them interact
with them, experimenting.

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:04.120
Also, another aspect
of discovery skills

00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.480
that Version 1.0 could
use is networking,

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:10.630
really establishing a
strong set of relationships

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:15.130
with people that have
diverse backgrounds that

00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:17.320
can help you problem solve.

00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:19.450
So really working on
your networking skills

00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:21.500
is very important.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.960
And then the big--

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.290
the Mac Daddy of them all
is associational thinking,

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:30.310
your ability to
synthesize diverse inputs.

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.600
The example people give
is George Mestral walking

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.510
his sheep dog in the Alps,
and then he comes home

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:40.902
and he picks the burrs out of
the dog, and he comes up with--

00:20:40.902 --> 00:20:41.610
AUDIENCE: Velcro.

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.770
CARTER CAST: Velcro, yeah.

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:44.920
Associational thinking.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.350
Einstein said creativity
is nothing more

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.400
than combinatorial play.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:55.020
So Version 1.0 lacks this
discovery orientation,

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.820
and it's hurting
its effectiveness.

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:00.600
The fourth reason I found
that people derail is

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.090
this archetype-- is
the One Trick Pony.

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:05.940
This is someone who is very
competent at one thing,

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.470
but they haven't broadened.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.710
So maybe it's a controller
who would love to be the CFO,

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:13.770
but she knows accounting.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:16.620
She got us off QuickBooks
in our start-up,

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:20.630
she's great with audits,
but she doesn't understand.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.270
She doesn't have any
exposure to forecasting,

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.150
or to capital asset
management, to long range

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:27.560
strategic planning.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.180
And she's not going
to get the CFO

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:32.540
job that she'd like because
she hasn't broadened enough.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.810
So this is a derailer that
hits us a lot of times

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:36.320
in mid-career, too.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.900
We've gone narrowly up
a path, which is smart,

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.930
because we've become an
expert, but at some point,

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.000
we have to start
broadening our skill-set

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.400
and our experience
set if we want

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.310
to be able to keep rising
up through the organization.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:53.760
This person suffers from
over-dependence on one skill.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.130
So they're sort of
lopsided, and they haven't

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:58.020
broadened their skill-set.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.330
They also may have a
key skill deficiency

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.830
in an area that's really
important to the business.

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:09.460
So for example, if you're
at Electronic Arts--

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.400
it's a local business.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.490
If you're at EA, like I was,
what do you have to know?

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.390
No matter what department you're
in, you have to know what?

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:20.906
Something about what?

00:22:20.906 --> 00:22:21.720
AUDIENCE: Games.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.640
CARTER CAST: You have
to understand game play.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.330
You have to understand
how a great game is made,

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:29.580
how you can make a game
addictive in 50 strokes,

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.800
is what they say at EA.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:36.180
If you're at Frito-Lay,
you have to understand

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.850
sales and distribution,
because that company

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:42.180
is built around 25,000
route sales people putting

00:22:42.180 --> 00:22:44.240
the product everywhere.

00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:45.490
You've got to understand that.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:48.940
She could have a key skill
deficiency in an area that's

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:50.110
important to the business.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:55.320
And she hasn't had
enough experiences

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.410
that give her the ability
to see the big picture

00:22:58.410 --> 00:23:00.810
and solve complex
problems by understanding

00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.515
the role different functions
play in an organization.

00:23:03.515 --> 00:23:05.640
So let's say I had this
One Trick Pony in my group,

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.550
and I'm at Walmart.

00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:12.540
And this is the feedback she's
gotten, and I'm mentoring her.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.050
I might do something like this.

00:23:14.050 --> 00:23:16.890
Now, is my only wonky
slide, so forgive me.

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.180
It's my one business
wonky slide.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:20.350
So let's look at this.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:21.267
I might say, Gail--

00:23:21.267 --> 00:23:22.350
let's say her name's Gail.

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:26.700
Gail, let's lay out the
critical path of Walmart.

00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.050
What's the critical path?

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:30.480
The critical path are
the key activities

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:34.240
in any company that add
value to the customer.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.310
OK?

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:37.440
What are the key
activities at Walmart?

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:42.480
We would write down
sourcing, merchandising, ops,

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.300
and store operations.

00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:47.880
Then, we would say,
within those areas, what

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.490
are the critical
things we do that we

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:52.920
got to be good at to win?

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.800
And we would write down
supplier negotiation,

00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.400
because you got to negotiate
for EDLP, every day low price.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.090
Assortment planning,
good, better,

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:04.300
best for the assortment, right?

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:08.000
Making sure you're in
stock on the products.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.290
Under logistics, inbound and
outbound warehouse management.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:13.850
What's the inventory
software that

00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:15.391
allows the product
to flow in and out

00:24:15.391 --> 00:24:17.180
of these big warehouses?

00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:19.280
And inside the store,
two critical areas

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:23.910
are planograms, merchandising
action [INAUDIBLE],,

00:24:23.910 --> 00:24:28.260
and managing the 700 people that
are inside of a supercenter.

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:30.150
So those might be
six of the things

00:24:30.150 --> 00:24:34.082
we write down that are critical
path activities at Walmart.

00:24:34.082 --> 00:24:37.610
And I'd say, Gail, do you
understand these activities?

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:38.895
No.

00:24:38.895 --> 00:24:43.280
Let's say, she's a controller
who wants to become the CFO.

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.690
I'd say, well, how
about we set up time.

00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:48.710
A day.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.200
A day with somebody who's
an expert in each one

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.200
of these places in the company.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:56.540
Bet they'd love to have you tag
along and watch them for a day.

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.400
So in the next two months--

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.400
we're going to take six
days in the next two months

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.750
for you to get exposure
with a store manager

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:09.590
on how they manage labor,
understanding the planogram

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:14.190
philosophy around how we
merchandise inside of a store,

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:16.650
get inside of a warehouse
and understand inventory

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.180
controls and management.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:23.160
I guarantee you, after
she has those experiences,

00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:27.030
there's nobody that's going
to say she's non-strategic

00:25:27.030 --> 00:25:29.430
because she's going to
understand the company

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.670
and the critical path of
activities that create value

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:33.900
to the customer.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:37.200
So I would ask you guys
a rhetorical question.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.870
What are the critical
path activities at Google?

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.420
And do you understand them?

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.184
Regardless of what
function you're in,

00:25:44.184 --> 00:25:46.350
whether you're an engineer
or you're in sales, sales

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:49.560
and marketing, do you
understand the key activities

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:52.950
that Google does to create
differentiation in the market?

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:57.200
And if you don't, talk to
people who have a nice purview.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.760
List those key
activities down and just

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.280
start familiarizing yourself
with those areas that

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.830
are outside of your
function so you broaden

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.750
your view on the business.

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:12.540
This is a very, very
solvable derailment area.

00:26:12.540 --> 00:26:14.730
Captain Fantastic is
tougher because that's

00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:16.740
a behavioral issue, right?

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:19.500
That person is going to
probably have to have a 2 by 4

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:23.310
upside the head before he
realizes that his ego run amok

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:25.550
is not going to serve him well.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:28.080
This one, you can fix.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:30.510
So the last one, and then
we'll take a little break

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.000
and we'll talk about
some of these--

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.550
this is the Whirling Dervish.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:39.000
This person doesn't
deliver on promises.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.280
Usually, it's a very creatively
minded person whose eyes

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.410
are bigger than their stomach.

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:49.310
They take on too much
they usually have

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.480
poor organizational skills.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.740
They don't have a system.

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.780
They should probably
read David Allen's book,

00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.510
"Getting Things Done."

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:01.115
They have trouble prioritizing,
what are the key activities

00:27:01.115 --> 00:27:02.740
that I should really
focus on that move

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.770
the needle, the high
leverage activities?

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.570
And which are the
ones I can blow off?

00:27:06.570 --> 00:27:09.020
Because we can never get
all of our stuff done.

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.990
So they need to prioritize
their A, Bs, and Cs,

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:14.350
and hit the A's hard,
probably ignore the C's.

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.630
They probably don't
understand process management.

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.580
If you ask them to
look at their projects

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.010
and do a Gantt chart
on them, they probably

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.720
wouldn't be able to
go cradle to grave,

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.260
what are the key activities
and how long they take.

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.330
So they might say
to the boss, yeah,

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.130
I can get that done by June.

00:27:30.130 --> 00:27:30.777
No, no, no.

00:27:30.777 --> 00:27:32.860
We're not going to get FDA
approval on the product

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:36.334
till May, then we got
to order packaging film,

00:27:36.334 --> 00:27:38.500
we got to move the product
through the supply chain.

00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.570
By the time it goes on shelf,
it's going to be December,

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:41.260
not June.

00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:44.730
They don't understand
the critical path.

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:47.740
And often, they're
pleasers who can't say no.

00:27:47.740 --> 00:27:51.150
And this is another one
of my derailment areas.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:55.350
I overextend by saying
yes to too many things.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.450
So a good trick there is--

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:02.970
first of all, I love the book,
"The Power of a Positive No."

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:05.310
That's by a guy named
William Ury, who

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.130
wrote, "Getting to Yes,"
the book on negotiations.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.260
He's a Harvard professor.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:12.500
He says, in "The Power
of a Positive No,"

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.370
remember when you
say no to something,

00:28:14.370 --> 00:28:17.520
you're saying yes to something
else that's important to you.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:20.400
So I might be saying yes to
my kids, dinner with my kids

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.090
and my wife.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:24.480
I might be saying yes to a
workout for my stiff neck.

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.370
So that's one thing I always
remember as a reformed pleaser.

00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.880
Another one is, Adam Grant
talked about this in his book,

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.840
"Give and Take."

00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:36.840
He talks about the
five minute favor.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.300
Maybe you say no,
but you spiff them.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:42.872
You help somebody out so
it's not a cold, harsh no.

00:28:42.872 --> 00:28:44.080
I'll give an example of this.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:47.580
I was just asked
to go to Seattle

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:53.150
to give a presentation to high
potential Kellogg prospects.

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.830
And I'm in the middle
of this book tour,

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.822
and I'm teaching two classes,
and I'm a venture capitalist.

00:28:57.822 --> 00:28:58.530
I don't have ti--

00:28:58.530 --> 00:28:59.630
I didn't have time.

00:28:59.630 --> 00:29:02.270
But I told the
director of admissions,

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.670
I can't fly out to
Seattle from Chicago.

00:29:04.670 --> 00:29:07.310
But if you tell me the
three or four or five

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:10.594
people that you meet there
that are entrepreneurial,

00:29:10.594 --> 00:29:12.260
I'll call them, and
I'll try to convince

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:13.802
them to come to Kellogg.

00:29:13.802 --> 00:29:15.260
So instead of a
two day commitment,

00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:17.910
I turned it into three
or four hour commitment.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.670
So it's like a
five minute favor.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:27.020
So these are the five.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:32.630
Captain Fantastic,
ego-driven, doesn't listen.

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:34.550
What Saint Francis
of Assisi said,

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:37.280
seek to understand
before being understood.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.015
Doesn't get that.

00:29:39.015 --> 00:29:39.890
Interpersonal issues.

00:29:39.890 --> 00:29:42.080
But remember, you might
not be a Captain Fantastic,

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.040
and you might still have one
of those derailment traits

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.120
that Hogan has in
those 11 descriptors.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.530
Doesn't build and lead teams.

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:54.370
That's often
earlier in a career.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:56.170
Super good individual
contributor

00:29:56.170 --> 00:29:59.780
that gets a team and still
tries to do the work themselves.

00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.020
Version 1.0, which is that
problem with adaptability,

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.794
and often, a problem
with learning.

00:30:05.794 --> 00:30:07.460
I doubt that's going
to affect you guys,

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.050
because you're
probably very curious.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:12.450
But staying curious and not
getting set in your ways

00:30:12.450 --> 00:30:16.070
is definitely a derailer
for most people.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:18.050
Being narrow, that
One Trick Pony,

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.480
going up in a vertical
way instead of

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.970
taking lateral moves
to get more experience

00:30:22.970 --> 00:30:24.620
or raising your
hand to be on a task

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:27.590
force to gain your
exposure into other areas.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.210
And then the Whirling
Dervish, which

00:30:29.210 --> 00:30:31.250
has trouble
delivering on promises

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:33.920
because they overextend.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.810
So maybe we stop there.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.480
These are the five
things I found

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.170
in three years of research
that cause talented people

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.764
to derail.

00:30:43.764 --> 00:30:44.680
RACHEL O'MEARA: Great.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.070
So we're going to pause
here for questions.

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.162
We'll take some questions and
I'll let you speak in the mic.

00:30:52.162 --> 00:30:53.620
Anyone have a
question top of mind?

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:57.350
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for being here.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.516
CARTER CAST: You're welcome.

00:30:58.516 --> 00:31:01.152
AUDIENCE: Of the five common
reasons for derailment,

00:31:01.152 --> 00:31:02.360
what's the distribution like?

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.609
Which ones are more common
than others in the research

00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:05.180
that you see?

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.830
CARTER CAST: Very good.

00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:12.500
Two of them affect more
people than the other three.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:15.560
And they are Version 1.0.

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.410
I think that with the rate of
change that we live in, if you

00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:19.070
don't--

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:21.590
if you shut your
eyes, things change.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:26.120
It's staying curious,
learning agility.

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.670
Learning agility is,
are you open-minded?

00:31:28.670 --> 00:31:29.900
Are you reflective?

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.810
After you do something, do
you reflect on how it went?

00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:36.690
Do you seek feedback
constant-- on a regular basis?

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:39.770
Do you have those discovery
skills to go out in the market,

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:43.820
and watch your customer,
and talk to your suppliers,

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.560
look at the competition?

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.460
So that is probably
the single biggest,

00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:53.480
along with interpersonal
issues, that are usually

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.210
driven by lack of
empathy and lack

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.630
of understanding the other
person's perspective.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:32:00.590
Now, here's a caveat.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:01.910
On my website--

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:05.070
I built this website and I put
my derailment assessment on it.

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.070
So if you go on
CarterCast.com, I

00:32:07.070 --> 00:32:09.170
think it's backslash
resources, you'll

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.350
see this assessment you can
take to see which of these five

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:14.090
you might suffer from.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:17.469
The number one
self-reported reason,

00:32:17.469 --> 00:32:19.010
everyone is saying
they feel like a--

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.682
not everyone.

00:32:19.682 --> 00:32:21.140
There's a lot of
people saying they

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.940
feel like a Whirling Dervish.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:27.590
So my theory on
that is we're being

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:32.600
deluged with Tweets,
and texts, and emails,

00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.517
and social media messages.

00:32:34.517 --> 00:32:37.100
I think everyone just feels like
a Whirling Dervish right now,

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.210
period.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:40.740
So that is the
highest self-reported,

00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.890
but the research-- and
it was really rigorous.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.640
It's those two I mentioned.

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.600
AUDIENCE: I have a--

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:48.560
RACHEL O'MEARA: Oh, hold on.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.518
Let me get you the mic.

00:32:49.518 --> 00:32:52.070
AUDIENCE: OK, OK.

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.620
Thanks.

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.320
I have a quick follow-up on
that which is, how much of them

00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.110
are unique to a
particular archetype

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.370
versus a mix of a few?

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.692
Because I see bits of
myself in a few of them.

00:33:01.692 --> 00:33:02.400
CARTER CAST: Yes.

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.300
That's a really good question.

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:07.490
A lot of times, different
stages of your career,

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:10.280
you'll flirt with
different ones of these.

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:15.490
So I was told I was a One Trick
Pony when I didn't understand

00:33:15.490 --> 00:33:17.110
PepsiCo very well.

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:20.552
And they said you're
not strategic.

00:33:20.552 --> 00:33:22.010
You're good at
getting things done,

00:33:22.010 --> 00:33:25.130
but you don't really have
a good sense of strategy.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:27.280
Well, I was 30, you know?

00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.470
I was going to learn
that over time.

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:33.260
So the Captain
Fantastic is a tendency

00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:35.110
I have with bosses
that micromanage

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:39.310
me that's very bad, that I
learned about mid-career.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:43.000
I'm worried, now, about
Version 1.0 because of the rate

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.900
of change in technology.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.330
And I worry about
Whirling Dervish

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.460
now because I'm overextended.

00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:51.190
So I think it's natural
to feel like there's

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.100
bits and pieces of these.

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:56.350
In the book, I actually have--

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.760
this is more like a field guide.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.070
I lay out the derailer
and then I spend

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:02.150
a lot of time on remedies.

00:34:02.150 --> 00:34:06.040
So you'll find different pieces
of derailers that affect you,

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:08.650
and you'll find certain
remedies that might help you.

00:34:08.650 --> 00:34:10.480
But I think it's
natural to feel like you

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.310
have pieces of
different ones of them,

00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:15.770
especially if you
look over time.

00:34:15.770 --> 00:34:18.920
You might have felt like earlier
on you, you're a solo flyer,

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.010
but then you became
a good manager.

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:23.109
And then another
one will bother you

00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:24.400
at a later time in your career.

00:34:30.304 --> 00:34:32.429
AUDIENCE: This might be
jumping ahead a little bit,

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:35.320
but I'm wondering, how many
of the successful people

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.469
that you talked to had derailed?

00:34:37.469 --> 00:34:39.459
Is that a common thing
that people who end up

00:34:39.459 --> 00:34:40.750
being successful also derailed?

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.150
CARTER CAST: I'm so
glad you asked that.

00:34:42.150 --> 00:34:44.025
How many of these
successful people derailed?

00:34:44.025 --> 00:34:45.306
So here's what's interesting.

00:34:45.306 --> 00:34:47.139
We get all these speakers
coming to Kellogg,

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:48.805
and I'm sure you get
all these speakers,

00:34:48.805 --> 00:34:51.719
and they tell these up
and to the right stories.

00:34:51.719 --> 00:34:54.750
And it's just horseshit.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:58.870
People run into career
trouble all the time.

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:01.410
And so my whole intent
of writing this book--

00:35:01.410 --> 00:35:03.380
I mean, I'm a VC and a teacher.

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:05.399
This is just a labor of love.

00:35:05.399 --> 00:35:07.440
I just feel like these
conversations aren't being

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.690
had enough inside of companies.

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:11.802
The boss should be sitting
down with a subordinate

00:35:11.802 --> 00:35:13.260
and they should be
working together

00:35:13.260 --> 00:35:17.400
on a development plan that
pinpoints some of these areas

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:21.600
and unlocks someone's
potential by addressing them.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:23.940
It just isn't happening enough.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:27.180
Talented people run into
this stuff all the time.

00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:31.890
This is nothing to be ashamed
of, having one of these.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:32.530
We're human.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.350
We're going to have
some weaknesses

00:35:34.350 --> 00:35:35.820
and some vulnerabilities.

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:39.240
The point is, and I'll point
out this in the next section,

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:44.340
people that do well are
on top of their own shit.

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:46.470
They see their own
derailment areas,

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.210
they see their own
vulnerabilities,

00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:50.100
and they either
work around them,

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:52.020
or they find someone
who complements

00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.510
them who can help them in
the area that they're weak.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:56.880
So don't take away,
by any stretch

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:00.130
of the imagination, that
people that are really talented

00:36:00.130 --> 00:36:01.500
don't go through this.

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:02.760
Here's what happened.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:03.930
I talked to all the people--

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:07.180
I talked 100 people who
got fired or derailed.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.770
80% of them recovered.

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:13.260
And those who recovered,
not surprisingly,

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.890
were the ones that accepted
the feedback, that incorporated

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:21.000
that this was on me to fix.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:21.630
So sad.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:23.310
Some of the people
that I talked to that

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:25.350
had gone on and derailed--

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:27.454
like, one guy I
talked to three times

00:36:27.454 --> 00:36:28.620
in a row for the same thing.

00:36:31.830 --> 00:36:34.580
He kept taking the feedback
and blaming it on--

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.400
the organization was like
this, my boss was like this.

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:38.390
And I just was--

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:40.850
my heart went out to him.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.970
But I was a researcher, so
my job wasn't to play coach.

00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:46.340
It was to continue asking
him questions to see

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.110
what he was doing about this.

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:51.050
And I don't know if he's going
to have an event, this one

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:52.040
particular fellow.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.710
At some point, he
was going to realize,

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:58.560
this is on me to fix versus
projecting it on somebody else.

00:37:00.307 --> 00:37:02.390
You want me to go into the
next section and then--

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:03.110
RACHEL O'MEARA: Yeah, let's
go into the next section.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:04.400
CARTER CAST: I think you're
going to like this next section

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.500
because it's the happy stuff.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:09.200
RACHEL O'MEARA: Good, yay.

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.130
CARTER CAST: OK.

00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:11.840
So this will be a
shorter section.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.550
So flipping it on its
head and saying, people

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:17.350
that are considered
to be superstars

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:21.490
in their organization,
what do they look like?

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:24.240
Are there any specific
behavioral traits

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:27.600
or competencies they have
that make them do so well?

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:29.800
So I found out that
there's a couple of things.

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:34.520
One is, they are self-aware.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.460
B, they understand
their motive structure.

00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.650
And then two, they have
two specific competencies

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:41.990
that matter a lot.

00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:44.480
So self-aware.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:46.650
What do I mean by that?

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:50.410
They are closer to those
who rate them in 360s.

00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:52.690
If they say on a scale
of 1 to 5, they're a 4

00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.520
in analytical
thinking, the chances

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.800
are the people rating
them say they're 4, too.

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.560
They don't say they're 4 and
everybody else says they're 2.

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:02.170
They have an accurate
self-conception.

00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:04.300
People with inaccurate
self-conception--

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.940
I looked at hundreds
of thousands of 360s.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:09.730
People with inaccurate
self-conceptions

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.550
derailed six times
more frequently

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:18.970
than those who were accurate
in their rating in 360s.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:20.250
Wow.

00:38:20.250 --> 00:38:24.400
That is based on Korn
Ferry 360 research.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:28.840
Secondly, they put themselves
in the right context

00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.660
because they understand
their motives.

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:38.340
So if I asked you, what's
going on in this picture?

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.390
What might you say?

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:42.630
Anybody?

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:45.249
What's going on in this picture?

00:38:45.249 --> 00:38:46.698
AUDIENCE: Maybe research?

00:38:46.698 --> 00:38:48.554
Looking at something?

00:38:48.554 --> 00:38:49.970
CARTER CAST: So
let's say you say,

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:56.546
well, Beth and Joe are
working together in a lab

00:38:56.546 --> 00:38:58.170
and they've worked
together five years.

00:38:58.170 --> 00:38:59.795
They have a great
working relationship.

00:38:59.795 --> 00:39:01.950
They really enjoy
working with each other.

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.620
You would show an
affiliation motive.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:06.780
That's the lens you're
looking through.

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:08.280
Let's say you looked
at this picture

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.040
and you said, yep, Joe's
mansplaining, yet again.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.300
There he goes.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.440
That's a power motive.

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:15.864
You're interpreting it in
terms of a power dynamic.

00:39:15.864 --> 00:39:17.280
Let's say you look
at it and said,

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.590
they're this close to
solving the Zik-- to finding

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.330
the formula for the Zika virus.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:23.720
That's the achievement motive.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.540
So this guy named David
McClelland from Harvard said,

00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:29.762
motives are bare because
values are easier.

00:39:29.762 --> 00:39:31.220
Values are what's
important to you.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.761
So if I asked you,
what do you value?

00:39:32.761 --> 00:39:35.180
You probably-- you'd
be able to answer it.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.630
Maybe give you a minute or two,
but you could probably say,

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:41.510
I value intellectual learning.

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.590
I value my family.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.560
But if I said, what drives you?

00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:46.520
What are your motives?

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.060
It's like, ooh,
that's subconscious.

00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.380
It's trickier.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:51.620
So to try to get at
motives, McClelland

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:55.820
did this picture story exercise
which the Hay Group has created

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:58.610
into a assessment
tool where you have

00:39:58.610 --> 00:40:03.290
to interpret a bunch of stories,
write down what you see,

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:06.110
and then a psychologist marks
it up and tells you what

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:08.240
your motive profile looks like.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.220
So McClelland says, motives are
critical because they drive us.

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:15.770
So we want to be in a position
that maps to our motive

00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:16.420
structure.

00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:18.500
And he said, there's
an achievement drive

00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.330
we have to beat a standard.

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:22.940
I bet a lot of you guys have
a high achievement drive.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.210
There is an affiliation motive
to have close relationships

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:27.890
and love teamwork.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:31.020
And then there's a power motive
to wield influence and enjoy

00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.330
status.

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:35.450
So then I asked the people
from the Hay Group that

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.450
worked with McClelland,
do different positions

00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:40.300
have different
motive structures?

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:41.660
And she said, oh, yeah.

00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:42.860
I said, what does a--

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:45.322
what does a corporate
CEO look like?

00:40:45.322 --> 00:40:46.280
What do you guys think?

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.200
What do you that'll look
like on achievement?

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.730
Pretty high?

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.550
What about affiliation?

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:53.915
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:57.654
CARTER CAST: Power?

00:40:57.654 --> 00:40:59.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:01.819
CARTER CAST: There you go.

00:41:01.819 --> 00:41:02.610
What do you think--

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:04.770
I said, does an entrepreneurial
CEO look the same

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.630
as a corporate CEO?

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:07.680
You're shaking your head.

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.060
What do you think an
entrepreneurial CEO looks

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:09.866
like on?

00:41:09.866 --> 00:41:11.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.190
CARTER CAST: Good job.

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:14.870
Absolutely right.

00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:16.850
I said, what does a
good PM look like?

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:19.140
And she says, oh,
they're the decathletes.

00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:22.160
PMs, they got to be
good at a lot of stuff.

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:25.709
They've got a be achievement
to land the plane.

00:41:25.709 --> 00:41:28.250
They've got to be affiliation
to get people that don't report

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:29.870
to them to work well with them.

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:31.832
They've got to be good
on power because people

00:41:31.832 --> 00:41:33.290
that don't report
to them, they got

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.990
to cajole them into getting
their jobs done, too.

00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:37.790
They get paid a lot
because they're really

00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:40.490
talented across all
three of these motives.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:41.620
So I took the test.

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:42.890
Here was little Carter.

00:41:46.050 --> 00:41:48.330
Super high in achievement drive.

00:41:48.330 --> 00:41:50.220
Every picture I
interpreted was, they're

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.040
accomplishing something.

00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:53.260
High in affiliation.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:54.640
So I used "we" a lot.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.410
We're doing this.

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:56.820
They are doing this.

00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.340
And very, very low in power.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.520
And so the woman,
the psychologist that

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:04.200
did my assessment,
said, what was

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:07.950
it like to be a CEO of a
multibillion dollar company

00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:11.550
when you have such low power
drive compared to typical CEOs?

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.750
And you know what I said?

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.220
I didn't like the job.

00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:17.410
I was in the wrong job.

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:23.770
When I was president, I was
back in Brisbane, California,

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.950
just down the road, here,
and working with the software

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.570
developers, and
working with the mar--

00:42:28.570 --> 00:42:30.910
we're developing the
product and I loved it.

00:42:30.910 --> 00:42:32.710
Then, I got promoted
to be the CEO,

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:35.260
and my job was to
work with analysts.

00:42:35.260 --> 00:42:41.350
It was to deal with class
action lawsuits, legal issues.

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:46.540
All of a sudden, to
influence groups of people,

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.640
and I would have rather
been back working

00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:51.650
on the product with a team.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.920
So people in there
with the right stuff,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.480
they put themselves in
the right work context.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.122
They understand
their motivators.

00:43:02.122 --> 00:43:04.580
And they're self-aware about
their strengths and weaknesses

00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:06.830
and vulnerabilities,
so they put themselves

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:09.410
in jobs that give them energy.

00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:13.390
And I can tell you
firsthand, that what I do now

00:43:13.390 --> 00:43:16.090
as a venture capitalist
and a teacher

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.400
fits my motives structure
a lot better than C--

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.860
I don't get paid as much,
but it fits my motive--

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:22.420
I'm much happier.

00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.450
So in the book, I
list these motives.

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.180
And I added two more
after talking to Dan Pink

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.710
and doing some more research.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.390
Dan Pink wrote "Drive."

00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:34.210
He says, Carter, you
got to add autonomy,

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:38.020
wanting to have
discretion over your work.

00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.550
And you got to add
purpose, right?

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.770
Mission, driven, some people
are just very mission driven.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.394
They want to work in
Cleantech, or they

00:43:43.394 --> 00:43:46.700
want to work in education,
or health care reform.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:50.130
So in the book, I take each
of these five motives--

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:51.880
and here, I just gave
you a sample of two,

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.890
but I ask eight questions
around each of these areas.

00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:59.320
So for example, I'm
very driven by autonomy.

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:03.810
I do my best work when I have
freedom to run with my ideas.

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:08.320
I would rather struggle with
the answer than be told it.

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:13.370
So if you think that you might
question your motive structure,

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:15.110
in the book I have
eight questions

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:17.690
in each of these five
areas to really think

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:21.950
about that might help you
understand what drives you,

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:25.010
and is the position you're
in appealing to your motive

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:26.030
profile?

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:29.220
Because people with
the right stuff,

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.110
they put themselves
in the right positions

00:44:31.110 --> 00:44:32.790
to succeed because
they naturally

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.310
work where they have energy.

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:38.130
AUDIENCE: Because I'm similar to
you as achievement is important

00:44:38.130 --> 00:44:39.089
to me, power isn't.

00:44:39.089 --> 00:44:41.130
But normally, when you
see a lot of these things,

00:44:41.130 --> 00:44:44.610
they're just together as getting
to the top and being the best.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:45.360
CARTER CAST: Yeah.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:52.510
So achievement is, you want
to be scored on your work.

00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:58.250
You want to be able to see the
results in your contribution.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:01.430
Power is, you want to wield
influence over others,

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:03.060
and you enjoy the status.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.770
So if I look at power up here,
I enjoy running clubs and--

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:09.790
I've never run a damn thing
in my life until I was a CEO.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:14.960
But growing up, I was
never a leader like that.

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.460
It just wasn't something I did.

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:21.890
I was always swimming,
or in clubs that

00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:25.010
were about self-betterment.

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:27.150
So they're very different.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:29.120
They feel like one
might lead to the other.

00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.970
Achievement might lead
to power, but the motive

00:45:31.970 --> 00:45:35.690
itself is pure in that,
if you like achievement,

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:37.970
it's really about you
wanting to measure yourself

00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:41.020
against the standard
and beat it.

00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:44.200
So here's a last big thought.

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:48.870
I told you there are two
competencies that matter a lot.

00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:50.110
OK, look at this.

00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:51.510
So most organizations
have, what?

00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:52.830
10 competencies.

00:45:52.830 --> 00:45:56.790
Some have 8, some have
12, but the average is 10.

00:45:56.790 --> 00:45:58.820
If you're only good--

00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:04.090
if you're only rated
in the top quartile

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:07.770
in managerial effectiveness, in
build strong relationships, one

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:11.760
competency, the
chances are 12% you're

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.520
in the 90th percentile
of your company

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.980
in managerial effectiveness.

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.480
If you only have
one and it's drive

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:24.605
for results, if that's the only
competency you have out of 10,

00:46:24.605 --> 00:46:26.730
and that's the one that
you're in the top quartile,

00:46:26.730 --> 00:46:28.230
the chances are 14%.

00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:30.870
You're in the 90th
percentile in your company

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.610
in managerial effectiveness.

00:46:32.610 --> 00:46:36.570
But look what happens when
you have the two of them.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.990
Builds strong relationships
and drives for results,

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:41.760
the chances are 72--

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:44.634
you don't have to have any
of the other 8, on average.

00:46:44.634 --> 00:46:46.050
If you have those
two, the chances

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:48.360
are 72% that you're
in the top, you're

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.700
in the 90th percentile in
managerial effectiveness.

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:52.920
Makes sense, doesn't it?

00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.270
You build strong relationships.

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.310
You build bridges with
other departments.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.520
You seek to understand
before being understood.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:00.780
You're empathetic.

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:04.110
You understand the other
departments' objectives,

00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:05.170
and then they end up--

00:47:05.170 --> 00:47:06.150
reciprocity.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.420
They end up wanting to help you.

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:13.240
You build bridges, and
you drive for completion.

00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:16.080
If you add to those
two, being self-aware,

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.270
so you put yourselves
in the right positions

00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:21.270
given your gifts,
that's the right stuff.

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:24.470
That's the formula, right there.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:27.710
So capable people
derail because they

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:30.800
don't have a good understanding
of their blind spots and skill

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.160
gaps.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:38.290
And people with the right
stuff seek constant feedback

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:40.300
so they can improve.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:43.160
And they're more self-aware,
so they can manage around

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.940
their vulnerabilities
and put themselves

00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:48.400
in the right positions
given their strengths.

00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.470
That's it.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:51.400
That's it.

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.669
With that, we can talk.

00:47:53.669 --> 00:47:55.960
RACHEL O'MEARA: Yeah, so
we'll open it up to questions.

00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:56.459
Thank you.

00:47:56.459 --> 00:47:57.416
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:57.416 --> 00:48:00.519
CARTER CAST: Thank you.

00:48:00.519 --> 00:48:02.060
RACHEL O'MEARA: All
right, questions.

00:48:04.332 --> 00:48:06.040
CARTER CAST: Does that
surprise you guys,

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.910
to see that you have
all these competencies

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:12.400
and there's only a couple
that really, really matter?

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:13.870
It made me feel better.

00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:15.160
Like, wow.

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.259
Really focus on these two areas.

00:48:17.259 --> 00:48:18.134
RACHEL O'MEARA: Yeah.

00:48:23.762 --> 00:48:25.220
AUDIENCE: What do
you think, having

00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:28.160
gone through this process and
written this book, looking back

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.170
at your previous
career you really

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:33.440
wish you would have known
in your 30s, in your 20s?

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.470
CARTER CAST: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:38.900
So can I write on a white board?

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.306
RACHEL O'MEARA: Yeah, go for it.

00:48:40.306 --> 00:48:41.180
We can bring it over.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.940
CARTER CAST: There we go.

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:47.799
So this is the back
of the brontosaurus.

00:48:52.437 --> 00:48:54.270
Let's say you're at a
company that's mature.

00:48:58.090 --> 00:49:01.750
This is size of company,
and this is time.

00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:04.900
This is the growth stage.

00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.390
This is the scale stage.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:13.440
This is the startup phase.

00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:14.885
And this is the incubate stage.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.410
This is probably where
you're getting funding.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:23.320
You're starting the
idea, so you need

00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.480
to have a certain
skill-set here, right?

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.030
You've got to have that
associational thinking,

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:32.230
you've got to be out in the
market and finding the need,

00:49:32.230 --> 00:49:34.990
finding the job to be
done, creating the idea.

00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:38.126
You have to be optimistic, you
have to be resilient as hell

00:49:38.126 --> 00:49:40.000
because everyone says
no to you all the time.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.374
You have to be a
good salesperson

00:49:41.374 --> 00:49:44.140
to get people to work with
you and to convince people

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.354
to loan you money.

00:49:45.354 --> 00:49:47.020
Then, you start up,
and all of a sudden,

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.820
you start needing to
have some good selling

00:49:48.820 --> 00:49:51.090
skills, some good
marketing skills,

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.310
you got to raise capital.

00:49:53.310 --> 00:49:55.560
Scale, you've got to get
processes and procedures

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.160
in place to be able to scale.

00:49:57.160 --> 00:50:00.660
And you have to understand
organizational design.

00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:03.270
You have to figure out
product iteration and product

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:04.230
extension.

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:07.080
Here, you have to understand
partnerships, business

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.836
development, you're going
into international markets.

00:50:09.836 --> 00:50:11.460
What's the next
version of the product?

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.140
How do you keep it alive?

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:14.040
And then boom.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:16.710
You're talking about complex--

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.320
being effective in a
complex organization,

00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:26.820
cost management, how to
reinvigorate a brand.

00:50:26.820 --> 00:50:29.520
I'm on the board of Kellogg
company, the cereal company.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:31.720
How do you reinvigorate
that brand?

00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:36.900
So these stages-- here's what
I wish I would have known.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:42.130
I played here, 11 years at
PepsiCo, $50 billion company.

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:44.850
And I was always butting up
against my own derailment

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:46.680
tendencies.

00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:51.030
Then I went here, to Electronic
Arts, when it was 600 million.

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:52.200
And now, it's what?

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.450
It's mark caps,
like, 30 billion.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:57.660
And I felt much more natural
because it was chaotic,

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:01.170
and it appealed more to my
enjoyment of that speed.

00:51:01.170 --> 00:51:03.450
Then I went down
here with two guys

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:07.530
and started Blue Nile, before
it got Series A funding.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:12.670
And I realized that I loved
this state, right in here.

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:14.960
So one thing I wish
I would have known

00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:19.390
is I should have slid down
that brontosaurus sooner,

00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:21.460
and gotten into these
environments that

00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:27.850
are more for me, better fit
my own personality profile.

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:29.560
This was fun.

00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:31.220
This was really fun.

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.890
This was torturous for
me with my personality,

00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:37.170
just with my natural
motive structure.

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:42.290
So understanding not only the
industry you want to play in,

00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.940
and not only the function
you want to play in,

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:52.645
but where in the stage of the
company do you want to play?

00:51:52.645 --> 00:51:53.520
RACHEL O'MEARA: Yeah.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.650
Well, I had a question about--

00:51:55.650 --> 00:51:58.660
so knowing that you were the
CEO of Walmart and a mature part

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:02.250
and thinking it wasn't for
you, when did you know that,

00:52:02.250 --> 00:52:04.590
and what was your
strategy there?

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:06.840
CARTER CAST: There specifically,
something happened.

00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:08.474
So I went to Walmart--

00:52:08.474 --> 00:52:10.890
We did Blue Nile, then I went
to Walmart when it was here.

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:12.777
There were 30 of us starting it.

00:52:12.777 --> 00:52:14.860
And it was crazy, and we
made a bunch of mistakes,

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.540
and it was chaotic,
and it was fun.

00:52:16.540 --> 00:52:21.240
And then we got up into
here, and I was the CEO.

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:26.460
And then they wanted to move
me to get trained under someone

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:30.300
to be the CEO for Sam's Club.

00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.220
That was my next move.

00:52:32.220 --> 00:52:35.020
And I had a good review.

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:36.240
And I drove home.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.006
I had a condo in Bentonville
and lived out here.

00:52:39.006 --> 00:52:40.380
And I drove back,
and I realized,

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:42.180
I don't have any
energy right now.

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:44.190
What's going on?

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:49.340
Why am I not thrilled
with this big opportunity?

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:52.810
And I realized that
I didn't think of it

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:56.770
in the terms of motive structure
like I just talked about today.

00:52:56.770 --> 00:52:58.532
Something was not right for me.

00:52:58.532 --> 00:53:00.490
And it was because I
would have been playing up

00:53:00.490 --> 00:53:03.410
in here again at Sam's Club.

00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:05.130
And I liked playing in here.

00:53:05.130 --> 00:53:08.190
So what I did naturally
was I left the company

00:53:08.190 --> 00:53:12.770
and I went back to another
early stage startup up again.

00:53:12.770 --> 00:53:16.160
I'm not saying
anything evaluative

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:18.860
about being in a mature company.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:20.947
It wasn't right for me
given my personality.

00:53:20.947 --> 00:53:23.030
That's what I'm saying,
not that this is-- there's

00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:25.310
many wonderful jobs up here.

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:26.502
It just wasn't for me.

00:53:26.502 --> 00:53:28.960
RACHEL O'MEARA: I think we have
time for one more question.

00:53:31.825 --> 00:53:33.280
We got one more?

00:53:36.625 --> 00:53:39.000
AUDIENCE: You talk a lot about
personal skills and things

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.350
like that, but then
you talked about

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.349
how your reactions were
with different managers,

00:53:42.349 --> 00:53:44.520
so how important
do you think having

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:47.730
an effective and strong
manager is in career growth

00:53:47.730 --> 00:53:51.720
and being able to
correct yourself as well?

00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:52.830
CARTER CAST: Yeah, I was--

00:53:52.830 --> 00:53:54.871
I can tell you, the guy's
name was Stephen Quinn,

00:53:54.871 --> 00:53:56.180
the Canadian.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:58.221
I brought him to Walmart.

00:53:58.221 --> 00:54:00.720
Once I got to Walmart, he became
the chief marketing officer

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.160
of Walmart.

00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:07.440
Because he was such a wonderful
manager, he saved my career.

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:09.420
It's so important, I
can hardly express it.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.740
Let's say you have
a bad one, though.

00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:12.823
Let's say you're under
somebody who's ineffective,

00:54:12.823 --> 00:54:15.330
or they're a Captain Fantastic
and they don't give--

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:17.087
it's really important--
people say well,

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.420
it's important to have a mentor.

00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:19.420
It's important to have--

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:21.660
I don't think of
it as one mentor.

00:54:21.660 --> 00:54:24.720
I think of it as, you want
to plug into smart people

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.910
different places of
your organization

00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:30.780
to learn from them, but also to
have safe haven if you need it.

00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.880
I was out in a job out here.

00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.530
I had to drive to
Pleasanton every day,

00:54:34.530 --> 00:54:38.340
before the Bart
came through, and I

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:42.040
was under a boss
that was ineffective.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:46.620
And I ended up finding
safe haven-- for somebody

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:50.310
who had been a informal mentor,
I said, this isn't working out.

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:52.050
And he goes, come join my group.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:54.360
So I think what
you want to do is

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.940
you want to have multiple
people you can count on,

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:00.270
not one Obi-Wan Kenobi mentor.

00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:03.540
But a bunch of people
in different departments

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:05.370
that you can say,
hey, can I buy a cup

00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:08.520
of coffee and can you help me
reason through this problem

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.270
I'm facing?

00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:12.090
And the chances are
pretty good you'll

00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:15.750
find safe haven with somebody
when there's a re-org

00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:17.520
or something, and
you'll be able to take

00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:19.680
advantage of that relationship.

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:21.840
And it's actually
fulfilling for them, too,

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.560
if a smart person like
you would want me.

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.360
You'd seek me out for my advice.

00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:29.400
So I wouldn't hesitate.

00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:32.190
I think when people put
this moniker of mentor,

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.302
it sounds so heavy, like
there's this obligation.

00:55:35.302 --> 00:55:36.510
I don't think of it that way.

00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:40.560
I think of having five or six
different counselors that you

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.889
can just go to now and again.

00:55:42.889 --> 00:55:43.805
RACHEL O'MEARA: Great.

00:55:43.805 --> 00:55:44.915
So I think we're out of time.

00:55:44.915 --> 00:55:45.250
CARTER CAST: OK.

00:55:45.250 --> 00:55:46.250
RACHEL O'MEARA: Thank
you so much, Carter Cast.

00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.830
CARTER CAST: Thank you guys.

00:55:46.830 --> 00:55:47.130
RACHEL O'MEARA: Thank you.

00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:47.430
CARTER CAST: This was fun.

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.930
Thanks.

00:55:47.930 --> 00:55:50.780
[APPLAUSE]
