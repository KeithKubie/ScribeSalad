00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.770
PROFESSOR: Hi, welcome
back to the 14.01

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.360
problem solving videos.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.300
Today we're going to work
on p-set 1 problem

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.980
number 3 from Fall 2010.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.160
And we're going to work
through all four

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.540
parts of this problem.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.120
But to start off I'm just going
to read through part A.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.230
Consider the market
for apple juice.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.120
In this market the supply curve
is given by quantity

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.500
supplied equals 10 pj minus 5
pa, and the demand curve is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.390
given by quantity demanded
equals 100 minus 15 pj plus 10

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.590
pt, where j denotes apple juice,
a denotes apples, and t

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.110
denotes tea.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.019
Part A asks us to assume
that pa is fixed at $1

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.100
and pt equals 5.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.900
We need to calculate the
equilibrium price and quantity

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.160
in the apple juice market.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.500
So to start off this problem,
I wrote down both the supply

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.120
and the demand functions.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.580
But before we get started with
the algebra, I wanted to come

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.530
over to this graph and I
wanted to think about

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.620
conceptually what we're
going to be doing.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.030
When we solve for an equilibrium
price and the

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.840
equilibrium quantity, all we're
doing is we're finding

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.050
the point at which the quantity
supplied and the

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.200
quantity demanded is equal.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.700
Looking at the graph, that point
is going to be right

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.940
here where the two
curves intersect.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:52.920
So this will be q star, our
equilibrium quantity, and this

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.020
will be p star, our
equilibrium price.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.160
So for part A we're just solving
for the equilibrium

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.560
price and quantity.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.690
And they try to trip you up on
this problem by throwing in

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.500
the price of apples and
the price of tea.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.340
But since they tell us what
these prices are initially,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.830
we're just going to plug
these into our supply

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.250
and our demand functions.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.760
And once we do that, we'll have
isolated the pj variable

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.770
and the q variable so we'll
be able to solve

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.320
through for this problem.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.620
So starting off with part A.
We're going to go ahead and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.590
we're going to set the quantity
supplied equal to the

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.680
quantity demanded.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.080
And so for my supply function,
I've already plugged in pa.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.010
And after plugging in pa I found
that 10 pj minus 5 is

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.620
the supply curve.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:51.960
And the demand curve is equal
to 150 minus 15 pj.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.460
Solving out for pj I find
that the equilibrium

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.200
price is equal to 6.2.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.300
And since I know this is an
equilibrium price I'm going to

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.400
go ahead and I'm going to
label this with a star.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.880
Solving through for the
equilibrium quantity all we

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.950
have to do is we have to take
this equilibrium price we

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.390
found and plug it back into
either the supply curve or the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.980
demand curve.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.500
I'm going to go ahead and I'm
going to plug it into the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.750
supply function.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.740
And that lets us solve for the
equilibrium quantity denoted

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.150
with the star.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.180
And that in this case is 57.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.220
So looking at our graph, the
equilibrium price and the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.820
equilibrium quantity, we
can now label them.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.370
We can label the price,
6.2, and the

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:53.170
equilibrium quantity 57.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.650
Let's go ahead and move on to
part B. Part B is going to be

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.430
the exact same scenario as we
started off with in part A,

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.600
only what we're going to do now
is we're going to shift

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.520
the supply curve by changing
the price of apples.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.050
Part B states, suppose that a
poor harvest season raises the

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.815
price of apples to
pa equals 2.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.700
Find the new equilibrium price
and quantity of apple juice

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.280
and draw a graph to illustrate
the answer.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.620
Now what's happening in this
scenario is that the demand

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.080
curve is completely
unaffected.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.960
The only thing that's
changing is our

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.350
supply curve is shifting.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.390
So when we look at our supply
curve we have to think about

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.030
conceptually what do
apples represent.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.000
Well they're an input
for the suppliers.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.090
It's something they have to use
to make the apple juice.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.980
And if the price of apples is
increasing then we intuitively

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.180
know that this quantity, or this
q star that they produce

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.240
before, it's going to be
more expensive for

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.680
them to produce it.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.800
And, in fact, it's going to
be more expensive for the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.510
suppliers to produce
any given quantity.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.240
So this means that the supply
curve for part B is shifting

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.580
up and to the left.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.980
I'm going to denote this by
labeling our new supply curve

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.050
sb for Part B.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.605
So for Part B all we're going
to do is we're going to plug

00:05:18.605 --> 00:05:20.460
in this new pa price.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.760
And then we're going to
do the same thing.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.570
We're going to set the quantity
supplied and the

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:24.990
quantity demanded equal.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.630
When we solve through for a new
supply curve we find that

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.220
10pj minus 10 is our
new supply curve.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:51.950
And we know that are demand
curve is going to be exactly

00:05:51.950 --> 00:06:01.650
the same as the scenario that we
started off with in Part A.

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.310
Solving through for the new
equilibrium price we find that

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:10.460
pj is going to be
equal to 6.4.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:18.650
I'm going to label this new
equilibrium price with a B.

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.830
And then we can take this
equilibrium price, we can plug

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.680
it back into either our
new supply curve

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.500
or our demand curve.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.800
And we can find that the
equilibrium quantity is going

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.630
to equal 54.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.520
And when we look at our graph we
can think about what these

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.490
quantities and these new
prices looks like.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:51.060
We can see that the quantity for
part B clearly should have

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.130
shifted down, and it did
drop from 57 to 54.

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.390
And we can see that the price
is higher than what

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:00.710
we started off with.

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:06.000
It rose from 6.2
now up to 6.4.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.010
So we can see that our intuition
that the supply

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.340
curve would shift up because
it's more expensive for

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.320
suppliers makes sense according
to both our algebra

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.570
and to our graph.

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.720
Let's go ahead and try part C.
Part C is going to be another

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.560
shift, but what's happening now
is this new shift is going

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.780
to affect the demand curve
not the supply curve.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:33.040
Part C states, suppose that pa
equals 1, but the price of tea

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.560
drops to pt equals 3.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:40.470
Find the new equilibrium price
and quantity of apple juice.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:45.120
So for this scenario now, our
pa is back to 1, like it

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.240
started off with in part one.

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:55.820
But now t is dropped
from five to three.

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.020
Now before we start, let's think
about what t actually

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.780
represents to the consumers
in this market.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.100
If I'm a consumer and I'm
debating what I want to drink

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:07.330
in the morning, one of my other
choices might be tea.

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.540
Now the price of tea drops,
then maybe I'll be less

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.640
willing to pay as much for the
apple juice because they can

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.340
just go out and get
the cheap tea now.

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.820
Looking at our graph, if the
consumer is less willing to

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.020
pay as much for each quantity
of apple juice as they were

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.120
before, this scenario means
that the demand curve has

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.160
shifted down.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.320
So, for example, the equilibrium
quantity that we

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.580
started off with an point A,
they used to be willing to pay

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:37.179
this much, now they would only
be willing to pay this much

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:41.230
for the same quantity because
tea is cheaper.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:44.110
Now we're going to be using the
same supply curve that we

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.880
started off with before.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.870
So in this scenario we're
looking to set supply and

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:52.470
demand equal and find this
new equilibrium point.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.330
When we go through and we
actually plug in the new pa

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.630
and the new pt, we're going to
find that the supply and the

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.880
demand functions.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:22.000
When we set them equal we're
going to set 10 pj minus 5

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:36.360
equal to 130 minus 15 pj.

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:39.640
Again we're going to solve
through for pj.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:43.190
And we're going to find that our
pjc for part C is going to

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:44.440
be equal to 5.4.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:50.000
And we're going to find that the
new equilibrium quantity,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.470
again either plugging back
into our supply curve or

00:09:52.470 --> 00:10:02.860
demand curve, is going
to be equal to 49.

00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.410
And when we think back to our
original part A, we found that

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.430
the price was 6.2.

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:13.030
Now the price dropped
down to 54 or 5.4.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:16.190
And what we see here, is that
we did see a price decrease,

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.840
or we could have predicted
a price decrease

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.480
according to our graph.

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.610
And we also find out the
quantity dropped from part A

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.670
in 57 now the 49.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:27.460
And according to our graph, we
would have predicted that

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.510
quantity would have
decreased as well.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:34.530
So the algebra and our
graph both match up.

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:38.180
Let's go ahead and move on to
part D. Now we're going to

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.980
look at the effect of a
government intervention on the

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.920
market for apple juice.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:49.640
Part D says, suppose that pa
equals 1 and pt equals 5 and

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.590
there's a price ceiling
on apple juice of

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.050
pj star equals 5.

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:57.470
What is the excess demand for
apple juice as a result?

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:01.480
Draw a graph to illustrate
your answer.

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.790
So now we're back to the
original scenario we started

00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:09.435
with in part A. We have the
price of apples is equal to 1.

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:15.600
And we're back to the price
of tea equal to five.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.270
And now the only thing that's
different in this scenario for

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:30.330
part D is that the government
said that these suppliers

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.820
can't charge any price
higher than 5.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.100
So let's go ahead and let's
think about what this looks

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.280
like conceptually on a graph.

00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.680
In this scenario we started
off with an

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.210
equilibrium price of 6.2.

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.810
If we were to have a case
where the government was

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:12.450
saying you could charge only as
much as 7 in the market for

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:15.160
apple juice, the suppliers
wouldn't even be affected.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:17.580
Because they would say, that
doesn't affect us, we're

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.400
charging 6.2.

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.170
That's too high.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.300
We're not going to have to
change anything we're doing.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:25.940
But in this scenario the
government is saying the most

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:27.940
you can charge is 5.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:40.670
Now at the price of 5, the
quantity supplied, or the

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:45.100
intersection of the price of
5 with the supply curve, is

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:53.420
going to lead to a qs that's
different than the quantity

00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:54.670
that's demanded.

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.880
And more specifically we're
going to find that too many

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.650
people are demanding the product
and there's not enough

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:03.810
being supplied in the market.

00:13:03.810 --> 00:13:06.430
This is what we're referring
to when we talk

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.340
about excess demand.

00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:12.140
We're talking about the space
between the quantity that's

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.650
supplied and the quantity
that's demanded.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:16.900
And that's what we're going
to be solving for.

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.650
So by plugging in the price cap
of 5 into both our supply

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.420
curve and our demand curve,
we'll be able to find the

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.710
difference between the amount
that's supplied and the amount

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:26.960
that's demanded.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:34.910
So plugging into our supply
curve we can find that the

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:45.010
quantity supplied is going
to be equal to 45.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:48.410
And plugging into our demand
curve we can find that the

00:13:48.410 --> 00:14:00.680
quantity demanded is going
to be equal to 75.

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.450
Now one of the biggest problems
that students run

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.440
into on this problem is they
think they're done when they

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:05.710
reach this point.

00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:08.150
All right, I found the quantity
supplied, I found the

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:09.780
quantity demanded, I know
they're different.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:11.120
I'm done.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.760
But really what you need to find
is exactly how different

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.630
the quantity supplied and the
quantity demanded is.

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.210
You need to find out how
many consumers are

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:20.460
left out of the market.

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.300
So our excess demand is the
difference between the

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.870
quantity supplied and the
quantity demanded.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.130
And that's going to be
30 in this case.

00:14:45.130 --> 00:14:48.270
So just to review what we did
in this problem, we started

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.770
off by setting a quantity
supplied and a quantity

00:14:51.770 --> 00:14:53.790
demanded equal to solve
for a basic

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.770
equilibrium price and quantity.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:58.150
We then looked at shifts in
supply and demand and looked

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:00.950
at how that affected the price
and quantity in a market.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.630
And finally, we ended with part
D with looking at the

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:05.570
effect of a government
intervention.

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:08.770
How does a price cap affect
how many people can get a

00:15:08.770 --> 00:15:11.140
product compared to how many
people want a product.
