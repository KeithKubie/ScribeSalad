00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.320
- [Voiceover] Let's say
we're having a birthday party

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.560
and these are the kids
at the birthday party.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.200
And all the kids, they have
a bunch of different ages,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.280
and what we are curious about is

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.822
how many kids of each age do we have?

00:00:12.822 --> 00:00:14.280
Well, to help think about that,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.120
we can draw what is called a line plot.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.430
And I've always viewed the
term line plot a bit confusing

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.860
because in my brain
you use a lot more dots

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.312
than you use lines, but let's
look at what a line plot is.

00:00:28.312 --> 00:00:31.480
So what I will do is I will draw,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.040
I guess this involves
a line right over here,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.560
I'll draw a line down here,

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.110
and then I'll create buckets
for each of the ages.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.820
So let's see, I have
students here from age three

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.360
all the way to age seven,

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.800
so I could say age three,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.460
age four, age five,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.740
age six, and age seven.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.690
I don't have to go to two, or
I don't have to go to eight.

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.170
There aren't any kids in those ages.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.660
Although, I could if I want.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.050
And then I look at, well, how many kids

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.822
do I have of each age?

00:01:02.822 --> 00:01:07.170
Well, I have one person

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.440
attending the party, Diya,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.030
she's age three.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.830
So I would put, I might put an X here,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.270
or I could put a dot here.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.630
Different line plots would
put different things here.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.630
But that shows me that I have,

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.470
this partier (chuckles) is
age three right over here.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.650
Now I have Imran, age five.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.600
So that's someone right over here

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.610
who'd be at age five.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.210
You could think of this
dot, this represents Imran,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.594
who's age five.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:38.441
Then you have Surya, who's also age five.

00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:43.160
He's also age five, so that
means we have a second person

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.540
at the party who is age five.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.070
So under age five, we now have two people.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.852
This is Imran and this is Surya.

00:01:49.852 --> 00:01:52.160
Then you have Jasper, who is six.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.180
So that's one person who is age six.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.194
Then you also have Vikram, who is age six.

00:01:58.194 --> 00:02:01.127
Whoops, let me do that in that same color.

00:02:01.127 --> 00:02:04.300
We also have Vikram, who is age six.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.320
So let's put him in the age six bucket.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.900
Then we have Luke, who is seven.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.339
Luke, who is seven.

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.490
So that would be a dot right over there.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.281
And then finally I have
Anya, who's also age six,

00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:22.760
who is also age six.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.850
So just like that, I was
able to take all of the data

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.980
that I have in this table,

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.540
and I'm able to put it on this line plot.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.510
And the reason why this
line plot is useful

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.070
is it helps us look at, well,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.020
how many of each age do we have?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.330
It might be a little bit more confusing

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.950
to just look at the table here

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.840
because when you look at the
line plot, it's very clear.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.660
Hey look, there's no one
here who is age four.

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.680
And look, we have the most
people who are age six.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.369
And if we asked ourselves a question,

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:54.020
if you didn't even have this.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.030
Actually, let me just even take it away.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.650
If we didn't even have that there,

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.820
if we didn't have the table
and we just had the line plot,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.380
and if someone said hey look, you know,

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.556
these are ages right over here.

00:03:04.556 --> 00:03:07.632
This has our ages in years old,

00:03:07.632 --> 00:03:11.490
and each dot represents a
student who's at the party.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:13.580
So based on this line plot,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.609
how many people are more
than five years old?

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.200
Well, you could look at
this and you could say,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.600
okay, more than five years old.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.690
That would be six years
old or seven years old.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.020
It's not showing anyone who's eight, nine,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.110
10, 11, and on, and on, and on, and on.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.800
So let's look at all the dots.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.400
Let's look at all the dots here

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.360
that are more than five years old.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.160
There are three six-year-olds

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.160
and there's one seven-year-old.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.530
So there are one, two, three, four people

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.190
who are old than five years old.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.630
You could go the other way around.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.532
You could say how many people
are less than five years old?

00:03:44.532 --> 00:03:45.560
Well then you could say, okay,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.730
less than five years old would be

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.940
either three years old or four years old.

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.960
And when you look at those dots,

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.520
you see there's only one dot.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.420
Only one person attending the party

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.470
is less than five years old.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.960
Hopefully, you found that interesting.
