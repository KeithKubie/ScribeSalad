00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
 In this video we will do some sample exercises 

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
 In this video we will do some sample exercises 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.750
 to solve equations. You will see that these equations 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.855
 require several steps, perhaps a little more than those, 

00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:09.710
 which we did in the previous video. 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.110
 Then we will solve a text task, 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.030
 where we will apply our skills to solve an equation. 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.640
 So here we have &lt;i&gt; 7 &lt;i&gt; &lt;i&gt; w &lt;/ i&gt; plus &lt;i&gt; 20 &lt;/ i&gt; minus &lt;i&gt; w &lt;/ i&gt; . 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.220
 Let's see if we can solve it. 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.870
 As usual, there are different ways to solve the problem. 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.210
 I will do it the way I feel most comfortable. 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.890
 What I will do is 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.610
 to make the endorsements. 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.950
 If I do the operations, I get &lt;i&gt; 7w &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.710
 then subtract &lt;i&gt; w &lt;/ i&gt; from them. 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.110
 Maybe I can somehow use &lt;i&gt; w &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.620
 So * 7 (w + 20) * I can write as * 7w + 7 times 20 *. 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.080
 Let us remember the properties of "distribution". 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.140
 This is * plus 140 *. 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.560
 And then we have this * minus w * is equal to &lt;i&gt; 5 &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.070
 I rewrote this part here. 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.970
 And I distributed &lt;i&gt; 7 &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.430
 And just as I said, we can unite - 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.030
 we can take &lt;i&gt; 7w &lt;/ i&gt; and extract &lt;i&gt; w &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.940
 So both will remain &lt;i&gt; 6w &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.640
 If I have &lt;i&gt; 7 &lt;/ i&gt; of something and drag &lt;i&gt; 1 &lt;/ i&gt; out of it 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.770
 I will remain &lt;i&gt; 6 &lt;/ i&gt; of the thing. 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:21.530
 So I got * 6w plus 140 * 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.410
 is equal to &lt;i&gt; 5 &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.470
 Now, I want to remove this &lt;i&gt; 140 &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.070
 Because in then I will get &lt;i&gt; 6w &lt;/ i&gt; equal to something 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.920
 and I can divide everything into &lt;i&gt; 6 &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.770
 To get rid of this &lt;i&gt; 140 &lt;/ i&gt;, I can pull &lt;i&gt; 140 &lt;/ i&gt; from both sides 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.030
 of the equation. 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.700
 And I'll do it in pink. 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.210
 Minus 140. 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.510
 Now just take &lt;i&gt; 140 &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.150
 on both sides of the equation. 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.450
 If something is equal to something else, the first * minus 140 * follows 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.390
 is equal to the second * minus 140 *. 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.130
 Whatever you do on one side, 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.470
 you have to do on the other side. 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.680
 The point here was to cut the left side. 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.370
 What is left on the left is &lt;i&gt; 6w &lt;/ i&gt;, which is equal 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.040
 * 5 minus 140 *. 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.160
 That is, &lt;i&gt; -135 &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.120
 Now we can divide the two sides of the &lt;i&gt; 6 &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.330
 which is like to multiply by &lt;i&gt; 1/6 &lt;/ i&gt;, 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.820
 hence, &lt;i&gt; w &lt;/ i&gt; is equal to &lt;i&gt; -135/6 &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.320
 Can we simplify this result? 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.580
 Let's see. 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.850
 This number is not divisible by &lt;i&gt; 2 &lt;/ i&gt; and does not appear 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.060
 be divisible by &lt;i&gt; 3 &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.000
 This means we have solved the task. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.030
 And now we can check our answer. 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.490
 Actually, let's check, because 

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:42.470
 this number is somewhat weird. Is that the answer? 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.640
 So we substitute in the initial equation: &lt;i&gt; 7 &lt;/ i&gt; times &lt;i&gt; -135/6 &lt;/ i&gt;, which is our solution 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.700
 for * w + 20 *. 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.810
 Instead of &lt;i&gt; 20 &lt;/ i&gt; I will write plus &lt;i&gt; 120/6 &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.690
 &lt;i&gt; 20 &lt;/ i&gt; and &lt;i&gt; 120/6 &lt;/ i&gt; are the same thing, right? 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.940
 Minus &lt;i&gt; w &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.360
 And &lt;i&gt; w &lt;/ i&gt; matches &lt;i&gt; -135/6 &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.970
 If we subtract a negative number we get it 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.630
 collecting his positive, right? 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.880
 And that's what's happening. 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:22.450
 This becomes &lt;i&gt; 7 &lt;/ i&gt; multiplied by ... see &lt;i&gt; -135 &lt;/ i&gt; plus &lt;i&gt; 120 &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:32.930
 is &lt;i&gt; -15/6 &lt;/ i&gt; plus &lt;i&gt; 135/6 &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.700
 Let's see what happens. 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.330
 Hence &lt;i&gt; 7 &lt;/ i&gt; multiplied by &lt;i&gt; 15 &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.260
 Let's do it. 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.830
 How much &lt;i&gt; 7 &lt;/ i&gt; times &lt;i&gt; 15 &lt;/ i&gt;? 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.780
 This is &lt;i&gt; 70 &lt;/ i&gt; plus &lt;i&gt; 35 &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:50.200
 That is, &lt;i&gt; -105/6 &lt;/ i&gt; 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.630
 Everything's OK here 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.780
 Plus 135/6 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.160
 What's happening? 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.090
 It remains &lt;i&gt; 30 &lt;/ i&gt; divided by &lt;i&gt; 6 &lt;/ i&gt;, which is equal to &lt;i&gt; 5 &lt;/ i&gt;. 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.560
 And that's exactly what must be equal. (According to the original equation) 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.930
 Our check is &lt;i&gt; 5 &lt;/ i&gt;, that is, &lt;i&gt; -135/6 &lt;/ i&gt; is the answer you are looking for. 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:10.630
 My sixth sense lured me. 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.480
 Our decision is right, even though we received it 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.230
 this strange result. 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.900
 Let's now look at this task. 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.769
 First, we have parentheses, the number 9 being exported to the front. 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.156
 In fact, we do not need these brackets. 

00:04:20.156 --> 00:04:21.220
 There are different ways to decide. 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.380
 We will probably do them in two ways. 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.200
 So the first way is to open the brackets, 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.020
 so I will not deal with the division of 9. 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.040
 So we open the braces and multiply: 9x minus 18 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.770
 is equal to 3x plus 3. 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.370
 Now we have to get some of the hikes together on one side of the equation. 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.830
 Let's collect them from the left. 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.000
 That is, we try to get rid of this 3x, which is on the right side. 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.960
 And the best way to remove it is to pull out 3x 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.820
 on the right. 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.100
 But if we take an action on the right, we have to 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:48.650
 we take it on the left too. 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.600
 So we take out 3x on both sides. 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.280
 On the left remains 9x minus 3x is equal to 6x, we rewrite 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.690
 minus 18, and on the right is equal to 3x plus 3 minus 3x. 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.800
 We cut from right 3x with -3x 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:06.670
 left 3 on the left side. 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.920
 There are now many ways to make a decision. 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.040
 It's a lot of fun - let's do it 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.040
 in the most common way. 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:20.220
 We can add 18 on both sides, thus -18 will be shortened 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:21.460
 on the left side of the equation. 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.410
 And there will be 6h, these two are getting shorter, eh 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.800
 equal to 3 plus 18, which is 21. 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.540
 By dividing the two sides into 6, we get for x that is equal to 21/6. 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.030
 or by dividing the numerator and the denominator into 3 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.060
 we get 7/2. 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.970
 And we're ready. 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.180
 As I said at the beginning, there is plenty 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.380
 ways to solve this problem. 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:50.460
 Let's do it another way - in orange. 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:56.900
 That is, we have 9 times x minus 2 is equal to 3x plus 3 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.520
 Okay, here I see a ninja and I see some threes. 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.600
 What happens if I divide both sides of the equation to 3? 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.400
 By dividing the whole country into three shares all 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.990
 positions in the equation of 3. 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.200
 What do we get? 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:16.120
 3 times x minus 2 is equal to x plus 1 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.240
 In this place, if I want, I can open the brackets. 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.390
 And I get 3x minus 6 equals x minus 1 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.720
 I could get x on both sides of the equation, so 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.560
 i will get 2x minus 6 equals 1 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.570
 You did remember that I took it out on both sides, and so on 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:36.210
 it disappeared from the right. 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.210
 I can add 6 on both sides of the equation. 

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.350
 I get 2x is early on 1 plus 6 which is 7. 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.060
 I divide the two sides to 2, from which it follows that x equals 7/2. 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.500
 I went through this method a little faster. 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.920
 But I really wanted to show you that while I was doing 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.650
 acceptable actions, the same answer will be obtained. 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.510
 And you can check if it is 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:00.500
 the right answer if you want. 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.150
 We now have a text task. 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.220
 Let's see if we can resolve it. 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.560
 Lydia inherits a certain amount of money, 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.460
 It divides them into five equal parts. 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:12.850
 Let us call with m the amount of money it gets. 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.910
 It divides them into five equal parts. 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:21.670
 Let's say, this is Lydia's money, 

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:26.790
 which she inherited. 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:28.910
 And which she divides into 5 parts. 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.350
 She invests 3 pieces of money in a bank account with high interest rates. 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.490
 How much do I invest in a bank account? 

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:45.520
 How much do I invest in a bank account? 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.330
 It divides the money into 5 parts and invests 3 of them 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.570
 into a bank account with high interest rates. 

00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:59.400
 So she takes her money, divides her into 5 parts 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.320
 This is each of its 5 parts. 

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.770
 She then invests 3 of these parts, or it can be said 

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:11.450
 takes 3/5 of her money and puts them on a high-interest bill. 

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.470
 which is increased by 10% of its value. 

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.630
 That is, it is the quantity it puts 

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.500
 actually put it in the bill. 

00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.830
 She invests the remainder of her heritage plus $ 500 

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.680
 on the commodity exchange. 

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.930
 And so 

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:28.710
 how much in this? 

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.900
 So she puts the rest of her heritage. 

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.659
 That is, she leaves 3/5 in a bank account with a high interest rate. 

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.140
 What is left? 

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.260
 It should be 2/5. 

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.280
 2/5 of her money is invested 

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.330
 on the commodity exchange, right? 

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:44.540
 If you collect 3/5 and 2/5, you will receive the entire amount 

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:46.070
 money she has inherited. 

00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:47.720
 But she has not put only 2/5. 

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.190
 She puts the remainder of the heritage, which is 2/5 m 

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:57.890
 plus $ 500 on the commodity exchange, but loses 20%. 

00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:00.620
 So ... that's how damp and how much 

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:02.250
 gets finally. 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:11.820
 That is, here is an investment, and here a Final Payout. 

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:18.910
 So, bank accounts add 10% of their value. 

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:24.910
 That is, it starts with 3/5 of the money they bring 

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.180
 another 10%. 

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:32.690
 Let's add them: plus 0.1 times the amount of money, 

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:34.010
 which she has invested. 

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.400
 that is 3/5 of her money. 

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.570
 That's how it's done. 

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:40.940
 Final payment is its initial investment plus 10% 

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.750
 of the initial amount invested in the bank. 

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:42.740
 She has a 10% birth rate. 

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.260
 It adds 10% of its value. 

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:52.580
 Now for the commodity exchange, it starts with 2/5 m plus 500, 

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.140
 but loses 20% of that money. 

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:07.760
 That is, it loses 0.2 times 2/5 plus 500. 

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.630
 This is the amount she lost on the stock exchange. 

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.410
 It loses 20 percent. 

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:16.060
 Finally, if these two accounts are completed, they say 

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.160
 with an equal amount of money in them, then 

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.950
 what is the amount she inherited? 

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:22.760
 That is, and this must be equal 

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:24.130
 and we are looking for a solution for m. 

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.100
 Let's do it. 

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:32.010
 We take 3/5 m plus, let's see this is the same 

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:33.840
 like 1/10, right? 

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.010
 Let me write it this way. 

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.180
 1/10 by 3/5 is 3/50. 

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:46.890
 Plus 3 / 50m is equal to - I just multiplied 1/10 with 3/5 

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:52.880
 is equal to 2 / 5m. I want to write it 

00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:06.110
 in the same color - in orange. is equal to 2/5 m plus 500 

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:10.520
 0.2 is the same as 1/5, right? 

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:16.070
 0.2 - let me write it here is equal to 20/100, 

00:11:16.070 --> 00:11:17.630
 which is equal to 1/5. 

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:20.620
 Let's transcribe here as 1/5. 

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:27.200
 So 2 / 5m plus 500 minus 1/5 times 2/5 plus 

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.380
 5 2/5 m plus 500. 

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.220
 This is a tricky task, but we will look at it step by step 

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:37.850
 and we will see that this is not so bad. 

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.600
 For example here, let's add 3/5 of something 

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.620
 plus 3/50 of something. 

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.290
 Okay, 3/5 of one thing is not like 30/50, right? 

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:48.630
 If we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 10. 

00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:49.630
 Now let's add it 

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:59.950
 30/50 plus 3/50 is 33/50 m is equal to let us be forgiven 

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.820
 2/5 m plus 500. 

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:10.360
 We open the brackets by multiplying to 1/5 and getting -2/25 m, 

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:15.630
 and then -1/5 multiplied by 500 is minus 100. 

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:18.040
 Let us forgive even more. 

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:25.090
 The left side is still 33/50 m equal to 

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:29.910
 and now we have these coefficients multiplied by m 

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:30.440
 here 

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.410
 These are our 'm' 

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:38.220
 It can be considered as 2/5 minus 2 / 25m. 

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.370
 so here's what they're saying: 

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.190
 I just pulled m in brackets. 

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.190
 So, we have 500 minus 100 

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.860
 That's 400. 

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:49.140
 Let's see. 

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.140
 2/5, if we multiply the numerator and the denominator by 5 

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.810
 this becomes 10/25. 

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.170
 No? 

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:06.130
 Thus the equation becomes: 33 / 50m = 

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:07.350
 10 minus 2. How much is this? 

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:13.560
 So, 8/25 plus 400. 

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.080
 We're almost ready. 

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.770
 We're almost ready. 

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:18.680
 Let's move m to the left 

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.520
 side of the equation. 

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:25.680
 So, take out 8 / 25m from each side. 

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:32.600
 So, take out 8 / 25m from each side. 

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.110
 I did it, and on my right there is no m. 

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:38.710
 The right side is equal to 400. 

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:44.140
 And so on the left we have 33/50 minus 8 divided by 25. 

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.810
 This is equal to 33 divided into 50 minus 8 divided by 25. 

00:13:49.810 --> 00:13:53.350
 8/25 is the same as minus 16 divided by 50, right? 

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.190
 I multiplied the numerator and the denominator by two. 

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.580
 m = 400. 

00:13:58.580 --> 00:13:59.535
 We're almost ready. 

00:13:59.535 --> 00:14:01.850
 This is a good job! 

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:03.440
 Here ... 

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:11.290
 So 33-16 is 17, right? 

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:17.000
 So we stay with 17/50 equals 400. 

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.450
 So we can multiply both sides 

00:14:19.450 --> 00:14:21.300
 with the opposite of 17/50, that is 

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:28.220
 50/17 multiplied by 50/17. 

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:32.460
 We delete them, and we get m equals, 

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:34.310
 let me get my calculator ... 

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:42.860
 me equal to 400 in 50 divided by 17 

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:55.380
 is equal to $ 1176.47 

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:58.490
 So much money had Lydia at first. 

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.550
 I hope you enjoyed this task. 

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.000
 I hope you enjoyed this task.
