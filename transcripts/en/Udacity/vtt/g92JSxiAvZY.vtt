00:00:00.366 --> 00:00:01.642
So letâ€™s now plug this in

00:00:01.823 --> 00:00:03.137
and see for the temperature of

00:00:03.275 --> 00:00:04.889
36 degrees

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:06.721
what our predicted failure is.

00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:07.674
The formula now is simple,

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.518
36 times b plus a,

00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:10.457
what do we get?
