Holho is a pyramid screen you put on your
smartphone or tablet to project holographic

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.259
images.

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.719
And scientists in Taipei have developed a
smart tooth sensor that monitors your oral

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.460
hygiene including flossing habits and smoking
and reports them to your dentist.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.480
Vsauce! Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.029
This is a living creature that looks like
a rock. It's completely immobile and it eats

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:34.219
by sucking in water and filtering out microorganisms.
It reproduces by throwing clouds of sperm

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:40.420
and eggs into the water to make more living
rock babies.&nbsp; So yeah.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.649
SmileDrive is gameifying driving. &nbsp;Volkswagen
and Google have combined to create a social

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.859
app that awards stickers for unlocking achievements
such as a 100 mile trip or passing someone

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.420
driving the same model car as you. It works
with any car and even has a feature called

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.030
SmileCast that creates a travelogue of pictures
and posts during your trip and collects them

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.750
on a single URL.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.470
The Online Electric Vehicle or OLEV seeks
to make public transportation cleaner for

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.750
the environment by using buses powered by
a power line installed under the road. The

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.320
battery is only used in emergency situations
with the high-efficiency onboard pickup device

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.710
using what they call segmentation control
technology that only powers those segments

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.170
of the line the vehicle at that time needs
to move. &nbsp;They're still working it make it

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.640
more efficient so they can make it commercially
available.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.530
Høvding is an airbag for bicyclists. &nbsp;Designed
as a master thesis at the University of Lund

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.060
in Sweden - the idea was to create a protective
device for adults who hate wearing helmets.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.300
It's worn as a collar around your neck that
can be stylishly hidden with a scarf but inflates

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.970
to protect the head in the event of an accident.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.000
Created at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems,
the deployable air land exploration robot

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.470
or DALER is a robot designed to fly and walk
on its wings. By using the wings on rough

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.879
terrain instead of legs the amount of mass
is minimized and the lighter weight allows

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.849
for greater flight performance. It has the
ability to move on different surfaces, climb

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.920
high obstacles, and navigate rough terrains.&nbsp;

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.370

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.549
A remote medical care robot is being developed
at Waseda University that will allow emergency

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.549
personnel to check for internal injuries before
the patient gets to the hospital. The device

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.310
can be attached to the patient while on the
way to the hospital and a doctor can control

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.659
it from a remote location. They're starting
with remote pregnancy check up and are hoping

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:44.689
to have it used in practical applications
within three years.&nbsp;

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:50.849
The Crabster CR200 is a six-legged underwater
robot developed by the Korean Institute of

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:56.069
Ocean Science and Technology. It was designed
to reach places that current propelled designs

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.769
can't because of strong currents, giving it
the ability to easily walk along the ocean

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:06.189
floor. It takes 4 people to operate and uses
the front legs that are equipped with manipulators

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:11.939
to grasp things similar to a real crab and
it can stay on the sea floor for days at a

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:12.230
time.&nbsp;

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.739
Enevo has come up with a way to make collecting
trash more efficient with a sensor that alerts

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.209
trash collectors when a dumpster is full - so
they're not wasting time and energy picking

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:27.069
up half dumpsters. It's called One-collect
and it uses real time fill level information

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.989
and advanced algorithms to calculate the best
route so companies are only collecting the

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.950
full containers each day. And it's said to
save 20-40% in costs.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:43.459
TVILight are developing intelligent street
lighting for up to 80% energy savings, 50%

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.959
maintenance cost reduction, lower carbon footprint
and a reduction in light pollution. &nbsp;Using

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.370
plug and play wireless sensors the lights
dim to pre-defined levels during off-peak

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.889
hours unless a human is detected and individual
lights can be remotely monitored and controlled.

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.139
They also adjust due to weather conditions
and return to normal operating mode in the

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.359
event of a system failure.

Animal Jewelry project to show the fashion
industry that fur is alive.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.510
German researchers successfully froze light
for a minute. Basically, they shot a laser

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.150
through a crystal which sent its atoms into
two states and then switched off the first

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:26.440
laser with a second beam and trapped the second
laser beam inside - stopping light. Got that?

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.030
And this is a huge step in building light-based
quantum memory.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.510
Scientists at Wake Forest University's Military
Research Center are developing a method to

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.290
print skin cells onto burn wounds. By taking
the healthy cells of a patient grown in an

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:46.340
incubator they're able to put them into an
empty cartridge and print them directly onto

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.840
the skin. A camera and laser is used to scan
the burn and create a 3D map of the wound

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.620
and the computer then tells the printer how
many and what type of skin cells are needed

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:02.060
to fill each area of the wound, where they
then become new skin cells.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.790
University of Michigan engineers have created
stretchable conductors using polyurethane

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.820
studded with gold nano particles. The material
conducts electricity even while stretched

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.280
and could be used in the future in flexible
electronics and gentler medical devices.&nbsp;

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.500
Finally, Crystals is an audio visual collaboration
using stop motion photography that captured

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.050
crystals growing under a microscope. And it
was made by artist Bruno Levy and DJ Kate

I'm gonna leave you with a robot displaying
animal like step reflexes.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.399
And as always — for watching.

[When the magic circle is thrown,
the small speaker array provides haptic feedback

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:20.559
as recoil for the attack
as well as when an enemy is destroyed.]

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:26.069
[Flicking the magic circle away (moving and submerging the finger) will 'throw' the magic circle.]

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.180
And other mind blowing stuff. So go do it
now.

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.810
Okay?

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:02.330
Go do it now.
