00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:07.260
We carried out about 18 months of research for the state National geographic drama

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.219
We had a team of researchers based in Britain working internationally

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:18.480
There's a huge amount of material on social Media. There's a huge amount of video material posted by the islamic State

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.410
there

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.410
Scarily Proficient and

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.999
Everything we've done in the drama stands on the shoulders of that research

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.919
Although the characters are kind of composites of a number of real people

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.209
Everything you see in the drama actually takes place

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.270
grows out of the research that we've carried out so although it goes under the banner of

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.599
A fictional drama because the characters are fictional

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.128
Every event you see depicted within it really took place

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.269
I think we've always felt that in an ideal world the show would be an entity antidote to simplistic thought so people could

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.530
Do as I said trying a different?

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.939
Understanding a deeper understanding of what might motivate young people to travel to Syria. I think part of the problem

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.939
Is there's a very unsophisticated?

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.799
view of the kind of guys from this country and elsewhere in the world who traveled to syria and around about

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.229
2014-2015 there's a tendency to just say well. They're clearly all insane

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.199
Joining some kind of death cult in the drama

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.229
We show that people go out for all different types of reasons

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.999
And it's not as simple as people might think that it's a far more complex

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:36.359
Situation and hopefully the drama gets inside in a way that documentaries can't drama is always engaged

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:44.189
with these difficult forces within society and and the state is just another example of that kind of

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.049
Attempt the islamic state has been responsible for a number of appalling atrocities

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:56.759
I don't think we do a service to the families of those who've suffered or to those who've been caught up in their bombing

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.689
outrages and survived with horrific injuries by simply suggesting

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:09.209
That the people involved in this organization are insane. It's our job as dramatists to hold a mirror up to society and to

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:14.429
Treat with these sometimes extremely difficult got subjects that are of current

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.480
importance and

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.100
I suppose our

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:26.040
objective here in trying to examine this this event which needs to be happening in in our world at the moment is to try to

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.730
Take a more

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.259
Nuanced view of it to get a little bit beyond the depiction of these people as insane or pSychotic

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.550
Because how are we ever going to combat it if we don't properly understand it
