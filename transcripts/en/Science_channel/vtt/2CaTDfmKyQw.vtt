USUALLY PRETTY HARMLESS,

00:00:04.767 --> 00:00:07.567

LET'S DART OVER
TO ALASSIO, ITALY,

00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:34.300
TO MEET GIACO, THE CREATOR
OF THIS DEADLY DART GUN.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.934
ME AND A BUNCH OF FRIENDS
WERE JOKING ABOUT, LIKE,

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:40.534
HOW FAST CAN A DART GO,

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:42.367
AND I WAS ACTUALLY THE ONE
IN THE CORNER,

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:46.501
LIKE, REALLY SERIOUSLY THINKING
ABOUT TESTING IT.

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:48.767
THE FIRST TIME I SHOT IT
WAS WAY MORE POWERFUL

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:50.133
THAN I EXPECTED, ACTUALLY.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:52.267
I NEVER FOUND THE DART ANYWHERE.

00:00:52.267 --> 00:00:55.434
I THINK IT EXPLODED SOMEWHERE.

Narrator: HOW'S GIACO'S CANNON
CAUSING CHAOS?

00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:04.834
THE DART EXITS THE GUN AT AN
ASTONISHING 1,800 MILES PER HOUR

00:01:04.834 --> 00:01:07.734
OR 2,900 KILOMETERS PER HOUR.

00:01:07.734 --> 00:01:10.534
THAT'S TWICE THE SPEED OF SOUND.

00:01:10.534 --> 00:01:13.400
Pampena: EVEN THOUGH THE DART
IS VERY LIGHT,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.100
TRAVELING AT SUCH A HIGH SPEED

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.901
MEANS IT HAS
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY --

00:01:17.901 --> 00:01:19.634
340 JOULES.

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:22.033
THAT HAPPENS TO BE A QUARTER
THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:25.334
OF A RIFLE SHOT.

00:01:25.334 --> 00:01:27.534
Giaco: THIS IS MY CANNON.

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:30.334
THE POWER COMES
FROM COMPRESSED AIR

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:32.634
THAT I STORE IN THIS TANK.

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:35.767
THEN I PUT MY DART IN IT.

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:38.868
WHEN I'M READY,
I PRESS THE BOTTOM, AND...

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:39.801

TO GET THESE DARTS UP TO SPEED,
GIACO IS USING THE POWER

00:01:48.267 --> 00:01:50.934
OF A REPURPOSED OXYGEN TANK,

00:01:50.934 --> 00:01:55.334
WHICH HAS GAS PRESSURIZED
AT 400 POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH,

00:01:55.334 --> 00:01:59.767
WHICH IS 27 TIMES THE PRESSURE
OF NORMAL AIR.

00:01:59.767 --> 00:02:01.467
WHEN GIACO OPENS THE VALVE,

00:02:01.467 --> 00:02:03.701
THE HIGH-PRESSURE AIR
INSIDE THE TANK

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:06.901
WANTS TO EQUALIZE WITH
THE LOWER-PRESSURE AIR OUTSIDE,

00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:09.734
AND THE ONLY WAY IT CAN DO THAT
IS PUSH THE DART OUT

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:11.501
AND KEEP ON MOVING.

THAT'S MEANT FOR KIDS,
