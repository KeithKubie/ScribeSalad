00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.500
We generally think that philosophers should be proud of their big brains, and be fans of thinking

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:22.720
self-reflection and rational analysis. But there's one philosopher, born in France in 1533, who had a refreshingly different take.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.000
Michel de Montaigne was an intellectual who spent his writing life

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.900
knocking the arrogance of intellectuals. In his great masterpiece, the 'Essays', he comes across as relentlessly wise and intelligent

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:42.300
— but also as constantly modest and keen to debunk the pretensions of learning. Not least, he's extremely funny,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.600
reminding his readers: 'to learn that we have said or done a stupid thing is nothing, we must learn a more

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.100
ample and important lesson: that we are but blockheads... (or, as he put it) On the highest throne in the world,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.240
we are seated, still, upon our arses.'

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.600
Montaigne was a child of the Renaissance and the ancient philosophers popular in Montaigne's day

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.400
believed that our powers of reason could afford us a happiness and greatness denied to other creatures.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.440
Reason was a sophisticated, almost divine, tool offering us mastery over the world and ourselves.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.380
That was the line taken by philosophers like Cicero.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.340
But this characterization of human reason enraged Montaigne. After hanging out with academics and philosophers, he wrote,

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.660
"In practice, thousands of little women in their villages have lived more gentle, more equable and more constant lives than [Cicero].

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.980
His point wasn't that human beings can't reason at all,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.360
simply that they tend to be far too arrogant about the limits of their brains. As he wrote,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:49.440
"Our life consists partly in madness, partly in wisdom. Whoever writes about it merely respectfully and by rule leaves more than half of it behind."

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.800
Perhaps the most obvious example of our madness is the struggle of living within a human body.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.620
Our bodies smell, ache, sag, pulse, throb and age (whatever the desires of our minds).

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.800
Montaigne was the world's first and possibly only philosopher

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.080
to talk at length about impotence, which seemed to him a prime example of how crazy and fragile our minds are.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.500
Montaigne had a friend

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.140
who'd grown impotent with a woman he particularly liked.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.900
Montaigne didn't blame the penis. The problem was the mind, the oppressive notion that we had complete control over our bodies, and the horror of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.360
departing from this theoretical normality. The solution, Montaigne said, was to redraw our sense of what's normal.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.600
By accepting a loss of command over the penis as a harmless common possibility in lovemaking

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.100
one could preempt its occurrence — as the stricken man eventually discovered. In bed with a woman, he learnt to,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.600
"Admit beforehand that he was subject to this infirmity and spoke openly about it,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.700
so relieving the tensions within his soul. By bearing the malady as something to be expected,

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.780
his sense of constriction grew less and weighed less heavily upon him."

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.180
Montaigne's frankness allows the tensions in the reader's own soul to be relieved.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.400
A man who failed with his girlfriend could regain his forces

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:09.540
and soothe the anxieties of his beloved by accepting that his impotence belonged to a broad realm of sexual mishaps, neither very rare nor very peculiar.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.200
Montaigne was equally frank about limitations of his intellect (and of its usefulness).

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.740
Academia was deeply prestigious in Montaigne's day, as in our own.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.760
Yet, although Montaigne was an excellent scholar, he hated pedantry in academia.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:29.060
He only wanted to learn things that were useful and relentlessly attacked academics for being out of touch.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:36.300
"If man were wise, he would gauge the true worth of anything by its usefulness and appropriateness to his life," he said.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.520
Only that which makes us feel better maybe worth understanding.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.760
In this vein, Montaigne mocked books that were difficult to read.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:49.600
He admitted to his readers that he found Plato more than a little boring — and that he just wanted to have fun with books:

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:56.160
"I'm not prepared to bash my brains out for anything, not even for learning's sake however precious it may be.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.800
From books all I seek is to get myself some pleasure by an honorable pastime...

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:03.500
If I come across some difficult passages in my reading

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.960
I don't bite my nails over them: after making a charge or two I let them be... If one book tires me

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.980
I just take up another." He could be pretty caustic about incomprehensible philosophers.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.800
"Difficulty is a coin which the learned conjure with so as not to reveal the vanity of their studies

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.480
and which human stupidity is keen to accept in payment."

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.300
Montaigne observed how an intimidating scholarly culture

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.300
has made all of us study other people's books way before we study our own minds. And yet, as he put it:

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.220
"We are richer than we think, each one of us."

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.400
Montaigne is refreshing because he describes a life

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:45.640
which is recognizably like our own and yet inspiring still — he is a very human ideal.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.200
We may all arrived at wise ideas if we cease to think of ourselves

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:57.520
as unsuited to the task just because we aren't two thousand years old, or aren't interested in the topics of Plato's dialogues or have a so-called ordinary life.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.300
Montaigne reassures us: "You can attach the whole of moral philosophy to a commonplace private life

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.600
just as well as to one with richer stuff."

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:13.500
In Montaigne's redrawn portrait of the adequate, semi-rational human being, it's possible to speak no Greek

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:19.780
change one's mind after a meal, get bored with a book, be impotent and know pretty much none of the Ancient philosophers.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:25.940
A virtuous ordinary life, striving for wisdom but never far from folly, is achievement enough.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.200
Montaigne remains the great, readable intellectual with whom we can laugh at intellectuals

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:36.200
and pretensions of many kinds. He was a breath of fresh air in the cloistered, unworldly,

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.600
snobbish corridors of the academia of the 16th century — and because academia has, sadly,

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.400
not changed very much, he continues to be an inspiration and a solace to all of us who feel routinely

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:53.620
oppressed and patronized by the pedantry and arrogance of so-called clever people.
