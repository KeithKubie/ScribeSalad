00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.480
&gt;&gt; Monica Enqvist: And
now to the important part,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.170
introducing Jenny Rogneby,
the new queen Nordic Noir.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.510
Swedish fiction is among the
most translated in the world.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.600
Crime writers such as Stieg
Larsson, Camilla Lackberg

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.460
and Henning Mankell has helped --

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.600
have helped attract
international readers.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.330
And now Jenny Rogneby
is helping us too.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.460
Her book, Leona, The Dye is
Cast, was a best seller in Sweden

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.130
and has been sold to
13 different countries.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:49.020
And it has already been sold to
Hollywood with the film rights.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.460
And what is interesting
with Jenny is

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.100
that she really knows
what she's writing about.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.110
She has a degree in Criminology
and has worked professionally

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.520
as a criminal investigator

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.530
in the Stockholm City Police
Department for seven years.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:10.730
Inspired by her work, she moved
to Malta and started writing

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.410
and formed the character of Leona,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.650
a criminal investigator whose
actions challenged social norms.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.530
A crime gripping novel about one
woman's wish to shed her past

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.190
through any means possible, and
I really mean any means possible.

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.650
And I have just finished
the book myself

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.180
and it was really hard
to take a break.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.720
I just wanted to continue
reading it, and especially

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.070
because Leona is immediately put
on the case of 7-year-old girl

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.100
who robs a bank without
saying a word.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.270 position:56%
This is a book with a lot of
unexpected twists, and that suggests

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.540
that we really never know
who we are working with

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.390
and what lies underneath
the surface.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.640
And I will let you hear more
about the book and of course

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.220
about Jenny from herself.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.320
And I just want to
mention one more thing.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.500
I know that some of you might
already read the first book,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.200
and I can tell you that she
already have written two more books

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.150
about Leona, but not yet
translated into English.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.660
So with that, of course we
welcome to come to also Sweden

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.740
if you can't wait for
the translated version.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.890
I promise to have the
Swedish lessons there.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.680
So with that, please help me

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.510
and welcome Jenny, the
author behind Leona.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.500
[ Applause ]

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.360
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Thank you so
much for that great presentation.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.720
I want to thank the
Washington Convention Center,

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.630
the National Book Festival
and the Library of Congress

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.630
for inviting me to
this marvelous event.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.510
And I -- I also want to thank all
of you who came to see me today.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.590
It's a great honor and
a privilege to be here.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.450
When I arrived here yesterday,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.480
someone asked me, where
are you from?

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.250
That might seem to be an
easy question to answer.

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.560
But for me, it's been harder
and harder to answer it.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.150
I can't be sure what -- what
people mean when they ask me this.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.060
Did the person mean
where I was born?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.670
Or maybe where I lived
most part of my life?

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.630
Where I grew up?

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.180
Or maybe where I live now?

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.080
In my case, that is all
different places, so it depends.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.580
Maybe the real question should
be, does it really matter?

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.290
But I know we all want to
understand and know more

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.760
and understand what's
in front of us.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.440
So I'm going to tell you my story.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.710
I will tell you a bit
about me and my journey

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.760
and what formed me as an author.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.270
And I'll tell you about
my book, Serious Leona.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.040
And I will tell -- also will
read a short part of the book.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.980
Then I will be glad to answer
some if you have some questions.

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.450
Yes, so I'm Swedish.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.180
I grew up in Sweden and I've
lived most of my life there.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.780
I don't know how much
you know about Sweden.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:59.930
Maybe you know the singing
group, ABBA or Volvo or IKEA.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.060
Or maybe you know some of our most
famous authors, Stieg Larsson or --

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.050
and David Lagercrantz who
wrote the Millennium Series.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.590
Or maybe you know Sweden because it
was the first country in the world

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.380
that banned physical
punishment for children.

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.840
Or maybe of our country's
hard work for gender equality.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.930
But I wasn't born in Sweden.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.620
I was born in Ethiopia,
and when I was 1-year-old,

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.630
I was given away for adoption.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.550
By biological father passed
away soon after I was born

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.870
and my mother was left
with two children.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:51.260
Times were hard there and she
wanted me to have a better life,

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.080
a better future than she
had and that you children

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.070
in Ethiopia had at that time.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:05.100
I was put on a plane for
12 hours from Addis Abeba,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.920
which is the capital of Ethiopia
with a stewardess checking

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.600
on me every now and then.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.950
And I arrived to my
new parents in Sweden.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.230
I grew in the north of Sweden,
in a small town called Boden.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.380
By that time, Boden was
Sweden's largest military city.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:34.200
And my both parents
worked in the Army.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.710
Luckily I arrived in the
middle of the summer.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:43.280
If you've ever been to Sweden in
the winter time, I think you know

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.790
and understand what I mean.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:50.730
The summertime in -- in the
north of Sweden is beautiful

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:57.270
with the green forests, the
rivers and the midnight sun.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:03.330
But when the winter came, it was
dark, I mean really, really dark.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.540
The sun rises around
11 AM and sets at noon.

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:16.250
The only thing that lights up is
the snow, and there was a lot of it

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.060
and cold, minus 30 degrees Celsius.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.880
That would be around minus 22
degrees Fahrenheit I believe.

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:29.000
That was nothing unusual
in the winter time.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.950
And all the children
did winter sports.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:38.910
We were skiing, skating,
snowboarding, you name it.

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:42.020
I wasn't dreaming about
being an author.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.900 position:56%
Actually, it wasn't even in my mind.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:50.320
When I was a child, I wanted
to be a figure skater.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.640
I saw them on television.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.160
They were dancing and
they were doing pirouettes

00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.160
on the -- on the ice.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:04.000
And I -- I practiced outside
the river from where I lived

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and there was really thick ice
there from October until May.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.690
And I think I got really good at
it, but there was a big problem.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:17.620
It was so cold.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:20.480
I was freezing up there.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:25.180
And I remember my mother
trying to keep me warm.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.090
And I -- She rubbed her --

00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:33.890
she rubbed my brown hands
in between her pale hands.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:39.610
And she used to say to me that,
"Jenny, it's because you don't have

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.330
as thick blood as we have.

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:44.310
That's why you're so
cold all the time."

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.840
And she of course said
that with a lot of love.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.830
But I was so cold.

00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:56.350
Well, in the really
dark periods, I think --

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:01.280
I was thinking, I am not
made for this climate.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.750
But actually who is made for that?

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:07.630
I mean that's a crazy way to live.

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.010
But my mother still lives there.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:14.750
She loves it, so -- Anyway,
figure skating just wasn't for me.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.680 position:56%
But I was really different up there.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.700
I looked different with my
dark skin and my afro hair.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:27.670
And by that time, there
were almost no foreigners

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.670
at all in the north of Sweden.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:34.820
As a child, you know, you
always want to fit in,

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.800
but for me, it was impossible.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.230
But I think being different,
even though it wasn't easy,

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:48.750
it also made me -- it made
me -- I think I got --

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:52.790
I got the opportunity and I took
the chance to do different things

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:56.830
in life because I couldn't
fit in anyways, so I could --

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:02.030
I could go my own way
instead and I did.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:08.160
So I didn't want to -- to go
my parent's path to the Army.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.120
I wanted then to be a dancer since
I couldn't be a figure skater.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.420
It was too cold.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.370
So dancing was better.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:17.870
It was indoors, so it was warm.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:23.600
And so I moved from Boden to
Stockholm and educated myself

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.830
at the Ballet Academy and the
music school in Stockholm.

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.790
And I became a musical artist.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:35.650
I worked as a singer and
dancer for many years.

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:39.880
And one day, I got a
phone call saying that --

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.890
that the band I was a singer
in got a really big gig.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:51.010
We got the opportunity to be the
opening act for Michael Jackson.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:55.350
Of course, I felt someone
was joking with me.

00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:59.920
I mean, that's the phone call
that you don't get every day.

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.220
But it was true.

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:04.010
And after a few weeks,
I stand there --

00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:08.140
I was standing there in
Estonia on a really --

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.480
I mean there was a biggest
stage I have ever seen

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:18.990
and an outdoors arena, performing
in front of nearly 80,000 people.

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.880
It was of course amazing.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.430
But as you hear, there's nothing

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:27.090
about writing here
yet, but it's coming.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.710
But I was now living in --
in Stockholm, which is a --

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:33.360 position:56%
a lot bigger city than I grew up in.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.000
And the thing is, I started to
notice when I was walking to the --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.500
to the recording studio, I started
to notice the society around me.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:52.580 position:56%
I saw people on the streets having
all kinds of problems: drug addicts,

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.290
criminals, homeless people.

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:57.580
And I started to think about that.

00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:02.710
I mean, I was born in one of the
world's most poorest countries,

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:05.870
and I grew up in one of the
world's richest countries.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:10.520
So how come people were
living on the streets

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.340
and having all kinds of problems.

00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:15.980
I wanted to know more about that.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.780
So I started to study
at the university.

00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.700
I started with Sociology,
which is the scientific study

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:27.610
about society and social
interaction.

00:12:27.610 --> 00:12:33.130
And studied various
subjects within that field --

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:39.380
Psychology, Law, Social Work,
and I became very interested

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.780
in criminal behavior and crimes.

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:48.300
So I continued with that and
later became a criminologist.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.810
And that's how I got
into the crime field.

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:55.530
For seven years, I worked
as a criminal investigator

00:12:55.530 --> 00:12:59.690
at the Swedish Police
Department in Stockholm.

00:12:59.690 --> 00:13:02.350
I investigated everything
from thefts,

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:06.450
robberies, to rapes and murders.

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:10.090
And now we're getting
a little bit closer.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:14.750
Because all the hours I spent
on interrogating, questioning,

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:21.120 position:56%
interviewing victims, witnesses and
-- and suspects, collecting evidence

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.960
and putting together police
investigations, that gave me a lot

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:31.410
of inspiration and
ideas for crime fiction.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:36.230
I especially got an idea for
a certain character, Leona.

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:39.990
And that idea that
wouldn't leave me.

00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:44.720
And I felt like I just
had to write it down.

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:48.260
So I thought to myself,
wouldn't it be really amazing

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:51.330 position:56%
to have written a book in your life?

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:53.200
So that's why I did what I did.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.820
But I knew it was a -- a big task.

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:59.870
To write a book, it's
really a lot of work.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:04.420
And I wanted to give
it a fair chance.

00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:09.090
I heard so many people say, "I want
-- going to write a book and I want

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.120
to do that," and maybe they
start, but they never finish.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.510
So I took some time off from
work, actually one year.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:24.360
And just to be able to
-- to write the book.

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:31.070
And during that time, a full
year, I didn't have a salary.

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:35.370 position:56%
So I sold my apartment in Stockholm.

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:38.270
I sold all my furniture.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:42.980
I just kept a few memories,
and then I moved abroad

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.120
because I didn't want
anything to distract me.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:53.680
So I -- And okay -- I, to be
honest, I was a little bit tired

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.840
of the rainy Stockholm as well.

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.870
So, I wanted to be
somewhere where it was warm

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.550
and the climate was
better than Sweden.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:06.590
So, I moved to Malta, you know,

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:10.150
the small little island just
below Sicily in the middle

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:13.470
of the Mediterranean Sea?

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:20.310
And there I sat -- The good thing
about Malta, it's sunny, it's --

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.930
I mean, I could walk on the --

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:28.010
on the boardwalk and think about
my characters and my story.

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:33.270
So -- And being there made me
notice all the details better

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:37.770
of the setting in Stockholm
where my book is -- is set.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:43.560
So -- about the police work
and the rainy big city.

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:48.490
I sat there for one year
and I wrote this book there.

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:53.050
When I came back to
Sweden, I sent my script

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.200
to several publishing houses.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.600
I -- I didn't know anything
about the book industry.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.690
I had no contacts.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:06.440
I didn't know a publisher or
anything like that, so I --

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:11.200
I checked from the -- on the
publishing house's websites how

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.230
to do when you're sending a script,
and I did it just like they wanted.

00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:16.650
And then I waited.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.610
It said that they wanted three
months to read and get back to you.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:28.850
So I thought, okay I'll wait
probably summertime I will hear

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:32.010 position:56%
from them, if I will hear from them.

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.230
But after only a week,
I got a phone call.

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.480
And I remember that day.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.780
It was a quite busy day.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.760
I was back at my work then at the
police force because, you know,

00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.140
the free year that I
written the book was over,

00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.930
so I had to start working again.

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:51.710
And that day was quite busy.

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:54.660
I was on my way to
interrogate a suspect,

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:58.320
and also there had been a --

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.580
a salesperson calling me at
least two times that day.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:05.650
So, when my phone called
again, I thought it was him,

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:07.930
so I answered not very politely.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.510
I was like, yes, like,
what do you want now?

00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.960
And then he said he was
from a publishing company,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:18.290
and I literally fell off my chair.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:21.660
I had -- I had no idea they
were going to, you know,

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.240
call me and call me so quickly.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:30.730
And after a few hours, another --

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:35.550
another publishing company emailed
me and also wanted to meet me.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:37.580
I was really shocked.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:42.650
And I -- It continued like that

00:17:42.650 --> 00:17:49.490
until ten Swedish publishing houses
had shown interest in my script.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:53.940
All of a sudden, I was sitting in
meetings with different publishers

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.990 position:56%
and talking about my book and Leona.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:01.250
And I -- I could choose
who I wanted to work with.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.760
And the best thing about
this was that I understood

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.960
that I had written something that
wasn't only interesting for me,

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:13.950
that also interested other people.

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:17.600
They said that my script
was something different

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.270
from the ordinary crime
stories that they receive.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:25.680
I mean, they got -- they get
thousands of scripts every year.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.640
It was different they said
and was something fresh

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.820 position:56%
and something controversial as well.

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.160
The book became number one in
Sweden and it's now release

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:40.130
in 13 countries, and
the film rights are sold

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.830
to a production company
in Los Angeles.

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:46.380
And I have now quit my day job.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:51.240
I'm no longer working at
the police department.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.870
I'm now a fulltime author.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:58.940
And once -- once I quit my
job, I thought, "Why do I have

00:18:58.940 --> 00:19:00.390
to stay here in Stockholm?

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:02.460
It's raining during the winter."

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.770
So, I can write from anywhere.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:10.220
So now I live permanently in Malta.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:14.140
And I also have an
apartment in Barcelona.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:19.620
So you understand my writing
has changed my life completely.

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:23.510
I will tell you about Leona.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:26.880
She works at the same
place as I did.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:33.050
She's a woman, a mother, a police
officer that doesn't behave

00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:35.980
in a way that's expected of her.

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:38.590
She's different.

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:39.930
She's an antihero.

00:19:39.930 --> 00:19:45.950
And you will not be able to
predict what she's going to do.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:50.660
In my books about her, there's
a lot of twists and surprises

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:58.010
that might shock you, make
you angry, amazed, excited

00:19:58.010 --> 00:20:00.970
or maybe everything
at the same time.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:06.690
From an early age, Leona
knew she was different.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:11.040
Her parents didn't treat her well
because they thought she behaved

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.910
in a way that little
girls shouldn't behave.

00:20:14.910 --> 00:20:19.120
And they kept her away from
the rest of the family.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.990
In order to survive her childhood,
Leona discovered that she had

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:30.080
to act normal, behave
like everyone else.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.440 position:56%
She became an expert in observing
and imitating what other people did,

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.050
and she behaved just like them.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:43.020
She's got some troubles
with her emotional like

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:47.260
and that makes her
act in a cold way.

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.260
Throughout her life, she
struggled to be the perfect mother

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.980
to her two children, the
perfect wife to her husband

00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:58.760
and the perfect police
detective at work.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.740
But one day, she can't
do it anymore.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.970
When she's around 30/35 and
she's got the perfect life,

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.580
she starts to question it.

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.880
Is this it?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:13.670
Is this my life now?

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:17.150
She feels trapped in the
daily routines that her --

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.070
that has become her life.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.770
She can't pretend anymore and
she decides to break free.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:29.210
And from then on, she
lives by her own rules.

00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:34.020
And that takes her on a
really dangerous path,

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.270
dangerous for herself and
the people around her.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:41.530
On top of this, she is assigned

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:46.460
to investigate some
very unusual crimes.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:51.210
This first book in the series
starts off with a bank robbery,

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:56.240
but I want -- I've always wanted
to write about a bank robbery,

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.990
but I didn't want to describe it in
a way that -- that's described --

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:05.440 position:56%
usually described in -- in TV series
or literature where there's a lot

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:09.290
of young men running into
a bank with drawn weapons

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:12.520
and screaming and shooting
everywhere.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.480
No, I didn't want that.

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.430
I wanted the bank robber
to be a vulnerable person.

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:25.520
That's when I saw a
little girl in front of me.

00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:28.890
That image of a little girl walking

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.960
into a bank was really
strong in my head.

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:36.900
So that became the
first scene of the book.

00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:40.890
So there's a 7-year-old girl,
walks into a bank in broad daylight

00:22:40.890 --> 00:22:47.880
in the middle of Stockholm and
managed to get away with millions.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:53.310
And that's the first case
that Leona has to investigate.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:59.550
I'm going to read a few lines in
Swedish just so you get a feeling

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:01.920
of the language, the
original language.

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:06.110
And then I will read a
short part in English.

00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:10.160
And after that, I'll be glad
to answer some questions:

"No one hadn't noticed her yet.

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:44.930 position:56%
Slowly and silently, she crept along
the narrow entrance mat towards the

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.200
middle of the bank.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.170

The beats were too fast
and uneven to count.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:21.210
She had the teddy bear against
her chest as hard as she could.

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:24.950
The pounding felt softer then.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:30.450
The fluorescent were
harsh and bright compared

She squinted, just a few
more steps, right-left-right.

She stopped in the middle of the

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:54.700
She looked around in the room,
taking in the high counters,

the computers, the people in suits.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:13.900
I think the writing is wonderful.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.790
It's suspenseful, but I'm finding
as it goes on and the twist

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.020
and as it progresses, I'm
more uncomfortable with it.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.940
And why did you do it that way?

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.060
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Okay, well thank
you for reading as far as you read.

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:08.520
And -- Yeah, that's actually the
thing about my book and my series

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.340
that Leona is a very special
character, and like I said,

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:16.620
she doesn't behave the way
that's expected of her.

00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.750
And she wants to change
her life in --

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:23.520
so badly, she feels like
she doesn't have a choice.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.210
She has to do something,
and she does it in a way --

00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:29.510
It's difficult to -- to talk
about because I don't want

00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:32.330 position:56%
to spoil the reading for you, but --

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.840
So I think you're asking
if she's going to be nicer?

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.200
Yes, okay.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:44.140
How can I -- I can't -- I
can't tell you that because

00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:49.680
that would spoil everything
but -- but Leona is a person.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.280
And I think also because
she's a woman because you --

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:59.980
you read about men doing
all kinds of bad things.

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:05.050
But when it comes to a woman,
there seems to be different rules.

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:11.690
So I would like to -- Yeah, I would
like to let you think about what --

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:17.850 position:56%
what would you have thought about
the character if she had been a man?

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:20.040
Would you react the same way?

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:25.150
I would like the readers to
think about that when they read.

00:28:25.150 --> 00:28:28.930
So, yeah? Yes, another question?

00:28:28.930 --> 00:28:32.450
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm curious about
the process of translation.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.190
Did you translate your own book?

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:39.230 position:56%
And if not, did you have any control
over the result of the translation?

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:40.530
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yeah.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:44.300
Thank you for the question.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:48.180
The -- the first English
translation was actually

00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:49.650
for the Australian market.

00:28:49.650 --> 00:28:53.200
So it was first --
first the translated

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.420
to English and for Australia.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:01.020
And then when it was going to be --

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.710
going to be released here
in the states, there was --

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:10.420
there was another -- We went
through the -- the whole --

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:14.320
the whole script again -- the whole
book again and made some changes

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.160 position:56%
for the American -- American market.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:22.080
And yes, I was involved with that,
but I don't translate my own books.

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:26.830
I -- I speak English but I wouldn't
be able to write in -- in --

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:30.620
in English language, so yeah?

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.120
Yes?

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.920
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.860
I started downstairs in
the Children's section

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.290
for the author of Wonder.

00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:46.030
That makes me think,
what were your --

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:47.760
What did you read when
you were young?

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.970
And I mean like ten
and up -- ten and up.

00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:53.270
Ten --

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:54.570
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: What I
wanted -- Sorry, I didn't --

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:58.820
&gt;&gt; The books that you were
exposed to that you liked

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.020
when you were your
early teens that --

00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:04.320
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: I mean this --

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:14.550 position:56%
When I was child it was a lot of
Swedish authors, Pippi Longstocking.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.700
She's a strong female
character, so that was --

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:22.960
I think that was influential
for me, so --

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.530
But Astrid Lindgren who
wrote Pippi Longstocking --

00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:31.750
She wrote so many other great
stories that me and, yeah,

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:35.510
all Swedish child --
children are reading.

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:37.810
Yeah.

00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.060
Yes?

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:45.960
&gt;&gt; So to be honest, I was not
aware of your book or you,

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.970
but now I'm very interested.

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:54.070 position:56%
And I just googled you, and it's not
-- This book is not out in audible.

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.450
Is it coming out in audible?

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.500
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Oh it's not.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:03.270
Now -- I'll -- I'll have to talk
to my American publisher to --

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:05.400
to talk about -- to
-- to answer that.

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.000
I'm not sure.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.490
I hope so, maybe.

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:11.610
I don't know how things
are done here.

00:31:11.610 --> 00:31:14.440
If it goes well, maybe
they do an audio, but --

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.410
&gt;&gt; How long has it been out here?

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:20.740
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Since first of
-- first of August here, yeah.

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.040
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:24.030
&gt;&gt; Hi --

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.420
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Hi.

00:31:25.420 --> 00:31:30.110
&gt;&gt; -- So, first off, I have
Asperger's Syndrome and I'm used

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:34.940
to sort of reading
fictional characters in ways

00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:39.590
that now I can kind of tell are
being described around the edges

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.590
as having symptoms thereof.

00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:45.820
Obviously, the big ones,
especially in terms

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:50.260 position:56%
of Swedish fiction is Elizabeth from
The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:55.860
but was that ever your
intent with Leona?

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.260
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yeah,
that's a good question.

00:31:57.260 --> 00:32:03.540
I -- I -- She has -- she has some
-- some difficulties, and I --

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:09.820
I haven't given her a diagnosis
in the book, so that -- that --

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:14.890
I didn't want to do that,
so maybe it comes later on.

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:20.740
But she definitely
have some difficulties

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.920
with her emotional life.

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.530
You can -- you can see that
clearly when you read the books,

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:31.490
and that also makes her -- her
react in the way she -- she does.

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:35.570
So, if it was on purpose,
yes it was.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:36.970
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.270
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yeah.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:39.570
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:43.760
I -- I just wanted to let
you know I'm a big reader

00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.150
of female conscious --

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.450
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Sorry, I can't --

00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:53.130
&gt;&gt; -- female conscious [phonetic],
female mysteries and stuff.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:54.430
And I read [inaudible].

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:57.540
I read Sue Grafton.

00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.930
I read [inaudible].

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.280
I read a lot of female writers.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.470
And how would you liken your
character to the writers

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:11.120
that I've mentioned as far as
personality and stuff like that?

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:12.760
[Inaudible] comedy.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.430
Can you understand me?

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:17.670
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: I have
a little difficulty --

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:22.400
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, let me
be more clear, okay?

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:27.710
As I was saying, I love
reading mystery books, okay.

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:29.010
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Okay.

00:33:29.010 --> 00:33:31.000
&gt;&gt; And most of my characters
that are female --

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.300
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yes.

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.600
&gt;&gt; -- mystery.

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.660
And I've never read your book
before and I was just interested

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:41.230
on how you liken your
character to Stephanie Plum

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:46.080
and Janna Vanovich [Assumed
Spelling] books or Sue Grafton

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.030 position:56%
and all those other mystery writers?

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:55.610
Is she a comedian or is she --
I -- I know she has a dark past,

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:59.410
but what kind of character
would you define her as being?

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:02.470
You know what I mean?

00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.770
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: It -- How
-- how -- how Leona is --

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:07.520
how I would define her you mean?

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.470
&gt;&gt; Well what I'm saying is --

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:10.770
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Compared
to -- to other --

00:34:10.770 --> 00:34:15.220
&gt;&gt; She -- she has a dark
past, but is she a comedian?

00:34:15.220 --> 00:34:20.960
Is she -- You know -- you
understand what I'm saying?

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.540
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yeah, that
was a difficult question

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.850
to -- to compare her.

00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:29.300
I mean she's -- I would have
to say she is quite unique.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:30.600
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.560
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: It's difficult
to compare it to other --

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:37.790
to other because -- I mean I
wanted to challenge the norms

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:41.820
when I was writing the
character of Leona --

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:43.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.320
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: -- and so, she
is -- she is different from --

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:49.220
from any other character,
so it's difficult

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.300
for me to compare with others.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.420
&gt;&gt; I don't mean to compare,
but I was just interested based

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.160
on the fact that I love
reading mystery books.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.290
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:34:59.290 --> 00:35:01.490
But it's difficult.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:04.050
That was a tough question
you've given me here.

00:35:04.050 --> 00:35:05.350
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:09.390
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: I'll have
to think about that one.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:10.700
&gt;&gt; I'm very disappointed to learn

00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.600
that you don't have
an audio version.

00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:19.200
I -- I hope you'll urge your
publisher to have an audio version.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.640
I lost more than 50 pounds since I
discovered audio versions of books.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.390
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: That's
good, that's great.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:29.890
&gt;&gt; And that's all I listen
to now and I really would

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:31.190
like to listen to your book

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:33.260
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Okay, I will
pass that onto my publisher.

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.560
Thank you for that.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.730
Yeah. Great.

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.090
Yes?

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:42.100
&gt;&gt; I was wondering based on
your seven plus years of working

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.260
for the Stockholm Police, how --

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.610
how much your experience
with particular cut kinds

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:52.550
of crimes informs the crimes or the
other thoughts within your books?

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.420
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: I
think I used a lot --

00:35:54.420 --> 00:36:01.060
a lot of my knowledge and my own
-- I mean both from my education

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:06.490
and from my experience as an
investigator to the -- to my books.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.990
I mean, I'm not writing
about a certain --

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.080
certain investigation or a
certain case that I've --

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:17.940
I've investigated myself, but I
mean the everyday life at the --

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:25.310 position:56%
at the police station, the -- some
of the characters I could find in --

00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:27.690
in I mean my own work
and colleagues.

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:31.840
So -- And I mean of course,
I mean, I've been sitting

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:36.450
in those interrogations, and the
questioning rooms and everything

00:36:36.450 --> 00:36:39.460
and I've -- I've done
all the work myself,

00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.490
so it of course makes it easier
for me to write about it.

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:48.060
So, yeah, I probably wouldn't
have written this kind of story

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:52.970
if I didn't have that background
in working within the police force.

00:36:52.970 --> 00:36:54.410
Yes?

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:59.330
&gt;&gt; Can you talk about your personal
discipline and your risk taking

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:03.490
to take a year off of work and
go to Malta and write a book?

00:37:03.490 --> 00:37:04.790
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Sorry,
one more time.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.090
I can't hear you.

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:07.390
&gt;&gt; Just can you talk
about the motivation

00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:08.690
for you take a year off --

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:09.990
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yes

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:11.440 position:56%
&gt;&gt; -- I mean, a level of risk taking
and there's a level of discipline

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.370
to write a book within a year.

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:15.160
Can you talk about that process?

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.620
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yeah, yeah.

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:22.150
I mean, since I didn't work at
the same time as I was writing,

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:26.390
I could -- I had power on my own
time, and yes, you need a lot

00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:32.320
of discipline to -- to -- to write
and to get the whole book done,

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.510
because maybe in the beginning
you have a lot of ideas.

00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.680
You just want to -- to write it --

00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:39.670
write it down, but
you need structure.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:47.290
It's very -- I mean writing a --
a crime fiction story, you need --

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:52.340
you need to really -- I mean the
-- You need to have a schedule

00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:57.160
and you -- I usually
write a synopsis so I --

00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:01.280
so I write, like, three
or four pages with the --

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:06.420
with the whole story before I
start to write the actual book.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:09.090
So, that's how I do it.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:16.870 position:56%
And I write of course every day,
not at the same timeframe every day.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:21.050
Sometimes I work in the
morning, most of the time

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:23.360
in the evening and nighttime.

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.450
I'm an evening/night person.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:30.670
I don't get much done in
the morning, but yeah.

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:36.460
So -- I -- Just some days
are easier of course.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.950
Some days, it's really hard.

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:41.320
I mean I can sit a few
hours and just get two

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.790
or three lines on the paper.

00:38:43.790 --> 00:38:49.800
But on other -- other days, I
could write many pages, so, yeah.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.100
Yes?

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.480
&gt;&gt; Yes. Congratulations
on your success.

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:53.780
We're so happy that you're here.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.080
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Thank you.

00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:57.630
&gt;&gt; What has been your
greatest surprise or joy

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.390
in the process of publishing?

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:01.530
And what has been the
-- one of the challenges

00:39:01.530 --> 00:39:05.010
and the challenges
that you experienced?

00:39:05.010 --> 00:39:09.410
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: The
surprises -- I never --

00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:13.780
The biggest surprise is that
it's gone really this well.

00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:18.230
I mean, I couldn't
imagine standing here

00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:23.340
or I mean releasing a
book in so many countries.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.030
When I first started, I just --

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:28.590
My goal was to just
finish the first book.

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:31.160
I didn't have -- I mean I
didn't know whether it's going

00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.880
to be published or not.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.320
And now I -- I released
three books in Sweden.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:43.010
So -- so, yeah, and film rights
-- It was -- That's the --

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:46.680
that's the biggest surprise I
think that everything went so well.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.590
&gt;&gt; Good morgon.

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:51.600
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Good morgon.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.030
&gt;&gt; Being Swedish, I wonder how much

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:56.140
of the Swedish character
you have put in Leona.

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.440
It's like I always get questions

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:00.110
about how much coffee we
drink, you know, in the books.

00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:03.430
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: How much
-- Sorry, one more time.

00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:05.580
&gt;&gt; How much of a Swedish
character, like,

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:09.390
you know we are supposedly
reserved and, you know,

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:13.070
there's a lot of things that
Swedes are thought to be --

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:18.420
Have you used any of those
characters in creating Leona?

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:19.720
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: I mean --

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.500
I mean, she's very difficult
Swedish I think, Leona.

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:30.990
I mean -- I mean except
for the fact that I mean

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:34.770
that she wants another life, a
lot of people in Sweden is like --

00:40:34.770 --> 00:40:38.130
They -- they say to me now when
I moved outside of Sweden like,

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:40.240
yeah, oh, that's really nice.

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:43.420
So you took, you know, you
took the chance and you --

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:46.850
you moved outside to a
sunny island and writing.

00:40:46.850 --> 00:40:51.140
But most people in Sweden,
they are really struggling hard

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.060
and some people want
to do that, but --

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:58.250
And I think a lot of people don't
understand that they can as well.

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:01.340
They can follow their dreams.

00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.800
So in that sense, Leona
is a little bit different

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:09.930
because she takes actions as well.

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:14.300
&gt;&gt; Did you follow up about the
challenges and disappoints?

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.620
That was the second question.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.920
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Oh
yeah, yeah, sorry.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.410 position:56%
The challenges, oh my God, there are

00:41:18.410 --> 00:41:22.510
so many challenges
in writing a book.

00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:26.170 position:56%
The -- the biggest challenge -- It's
so much more work than I thought.

00:41:26.170 --> 00:41:30.940
I mean, maybe I was a little bit
naive and I -- I knew it was a --

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:34.750
a lot of work, but how much
work I didn't know that.

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:38.830
So that's -- that's the
challenge I think to --

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:42.140
to be able to finish a
story and then the storyline

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:44.800
and describe the dialogue.

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:47.310 position:56%
And there's so many parts in writing

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:53.250
that you don't know is difficult
before you actually start.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:42:01.530
So maybe it was good that I
didn't know that before, yeah.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:04.580
Okay, may -- We have,
okay one more question.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:06.970
&gt;&gt; My question is about --

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.460
-- Scandinavian detective --

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:14.760
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yes.

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.060
&gt;&gt; -- fiction in general?

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.840
It seems -- at least my knowledge
may be wrong, but my impression is

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.460
that crime rate in
Scandinavia is relatively low

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.850
or murder rate is relatively low,
and I -- I -- and yet, you know,

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:29.430
detective fiction or --

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.490
is very successful and there's
so many authors that are

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:36.840
at least successful here
and wondering why is that?

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:39.300
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yeah,
yeah, that's a good question.

00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:44.940
&gt;&gt; And secondly, I'm wondering
if any of these other authors

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.290
that we're aware from Sweden

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:52.210
and other Scandinavian countries
inspired you in any way?

00:42:52.210 --> 00:42:54.180
&gt;&gt; Jenny Rogneby: Yes,
very good question.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:57.820
I get that question a lot when
I'm outside of Sweden because --

00:42:57.820 --> 00:43:01.180
And the people are saying, are
there a lot of murderers walking

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:04.230
around in the streets in Sweden?

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:07.300
I think -- I mean we
had a long tradition

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.180
of crime fiction in Sweden.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.820
And in a way, I think that --

00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:16.930
I mean Sweden is a quiet,
calm and safe society.

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:22.950
And I think that in those
kind of places, you -- you --

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:28.420
you want some excitement
in some way, yeah.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.430
So -- Because I mean in --
in countries that where --

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:35.480
where there's a lot of
problems, I mean war,

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.440
crime stories isn't that big.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:38.740
I mean of course.

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.700
So, I think when you're
sitting there in your, you know,

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:43.940
your safe life, you want to read

00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:48.570
about something else that's
something, and you know --

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.290 position:56%
And also the -- the mystery I think.

00:43:51.290 --> 00:43:54.360
All of us want to read
something that --

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:59.900
that, you know, that you can
try -- you -- you know, you --

00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:02.980
you're trying to solve a
problem or solve a mystery.

00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.240
So -- But yeah, you're right.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.950
That's a good point actually, yeah.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.620
Okay, I think we're done.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:16.510
Thank you so much for all
the questions and thank you.

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:22.200
