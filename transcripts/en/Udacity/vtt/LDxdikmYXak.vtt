00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For this problem you're given six certificates.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The question is which ones would be useful to connect to udacity.com.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Assume that we know ku,ca, the public key of the certificate authority,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and for notation H is a hash function and E is RSA encryption.

00:00:17.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Check all that are useful to establish a secure session.
