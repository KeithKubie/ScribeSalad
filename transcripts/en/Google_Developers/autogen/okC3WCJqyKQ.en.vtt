feedback is key that's the right looking
 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.060
feedback is key that's the right looking
yeah yeah so how soon do you run those

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070
yeah yeah so how soon do you run those
 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.139
yeah yeah so how soon do you run those
tests on save or yep yeah so it karma is

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149
tests on save or yep yeah so it karma is
 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.970

pretty configurable but the typical

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980
pretty configurable but the typical
 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.510
pretty configurable but the typical
setup that we have is you you start

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520
setup that we have is you you start
 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.969
setup that we have is you you start
karma when you start developing and it

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979
karma when you start developing and it
 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.700
karma when you start developing and it
you can specify which which files it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710
you can specify which which files it
 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.160

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170
will watch it can even watch like coffee
 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.380
will watch it can even watch like coffee
script files for instance and it'll

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390
script files for instance and it'll
 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.990
script files for instance and it'll

however many browsers you want to open

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400
however many browsers you want to open
 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.670
however many browsers you want to open
up and and have it hook into and then it

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680
up and and have it hook into and then it
 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.920

will quickly give you the tests so just

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930
will quickly give you the tests so just
 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.840
will quickly give you the tests so just
for some idea of how this works in

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850
for some idea of how this works in
 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.810
for some idea of how this works in
practice we have something like 2400

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820
practice we have something like 2400
 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.310
practice we have something like 2400
tests with angular and we when your

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320
tests with angular and we when your
 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.749
tests with angular and we when your
wonder you're developing an angular you

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759
wonder you're developing an angular you
 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.580
wonder you're developing an angular you
know you might touch some certain part

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590
know you might touch some certain part
 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.950
know you might touch some certain part
of the framework that has kind of a wide

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960
of the framework that has kind of a wide
 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.990
of the framework that has kind of a wide
impact so you want to be able to run all

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000
impact so you want to be able to run all
 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.450
impact so you want to be able to run all
these tests very quickly so on each save

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460
these tests very quickly so on each save
 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.120
these tests very quickly so on each save
karma will run all of these like 2400

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130
karma will run all of these like 2400
 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.969
karma will run all of these like 2400
tests in just a couple seconds Wow yeah

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979
tests in just a couple seconds Wow yeah
 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.039
tests in just a couple seconds Wow yeah
so it's it's it's all about being fast

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049
so it's it's it's all about being fast
 

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.870
so it's it's it's all about being fast
and about getting immediate feedback so

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880
and about getting immediate feedback so
 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.789
and about getting immediate feedback so
you can immediately see kind of the

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799
you can immediately see kind of the
 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.100
you can immediately see kind of the
effects of your changes but you can also

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110
effects of your changes but you can also
 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:00.810
effects of your changes but you can also
integrate this into continuous

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820
integrate this into continuous
 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.179
integrate this into continuous
integration yep yeah exactly yes we also

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189
integration yep yeah exactly yes we also
 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.039
integration yep yeah exactly yes we also
run this on our continuous integration

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049
run this on our continuous integration
 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.679
run this on our continuous integration
server it has all sorts of kind of

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689
server it has all sorts of kind of
 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.020
server it has all sorts of kind of
plugins and hooks so you can get email

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030
plugins and hooks so you can get email
 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.790
plugins and hooks so you can get email
notifications you can

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800
notifications you can
 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.610
notifications you can
you know it does it does tap it does all

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620
you know it does it does tap it does all
 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.620
you know it does it does tap it does all
these sort of things we run it in in

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630
these sort of things we run it in in
 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.920
these sort of things we run it in in
like a Jenkins setup so it's it's very

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930
like a Jenkins setup so it's it's very
 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.990
like a Jenkins setup so it's it's very
versatile it's an excellent tool so you

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000
versatile it's an excellent tool so you
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.390
versatile it's an excellent tool so you
actually this is not linked and you

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400
actually this is not linked and you
 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.830
actually this is not linked and you
mentioned coffeescript in any way to

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840
mentioned coffeescript in any way to
 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.080
mentioned coffeescript in any way to
dart 2 i'm sorry to angular you can

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090
dart 2 i'm sorry to angular you can
 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.480
dart 2 i'm sorry to angular you can
actually write it with dart or other

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490
actually write it with dart or other
 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.730
actually write it with dart or other
right yep that's the idea the idea is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740
right yep that's the idea the idea is
 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.320
right yep that's the idea the idea is
that through a kind of a plug-in system

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330
that through a kind of a plug-in system
 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.750
that through a kind of a plug-in system
karma can automatically like recompile

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760
karma can automatically like recompile
 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.870
karma can automatically like recompile
or trans pile or it can do some small

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880
or trans pile or it can do some small
 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.550
or trans pile or it can do some small
subset of your sort of your build

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560

process to get your web app going and
 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.570
process to get your web app going and
then it'll it can quickly iterate

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580
then it'll it can quickly iterate
 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.790
then it'll it can quickly iterate
through and do these tests and these are

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800
through and do these tests and these are
 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.920
through and do these tests and these are
mostly unit tests right do you have

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930
mostly unit tests right do you have
 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.450
mostly unit tests right do you have
anything that goes beyond that that

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460
anything that goes beyond that that
 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.250
anything that goes beyond that that
could look like scenarios integration

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260
could look like scenarios integration
 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.200
could look like scenarios integration
tests or anything right so at the moment

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210
tests or anything right so at the moment
 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.150
tests or anything right so at the moment
we do have a kind of a scenario runner

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160
we do have a kind of a scenario runner
 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.050
we do have a kind of a scenario runner
for angular that works with Karma but

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060
for angular that works with Karma but
 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.220
for angular that works with Karma but
another another Googler julie has been

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230
another another Googler julie has been
 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.380
another another Googler julie has been
developing this new tool called

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390
developing this new tool called
 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.360
developing this new tool called
protractor and protractors an angular

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370
protractor and protractors an angular
 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.350
protractor and protractors an angular
specific I guess scenario runner but

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360
specific I guess scenario runner but
 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.840
specific I guess scenario runner but
it's it's very cool and I think you can

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850
it's it's very cool and I think you can
 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:20.910
it's it's very cool and I think you can
kind of take a look at it and you know

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920
kind of take a look at it and you know
 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.160
kind of take a look at it and you know
perhaps in the future will extend it so

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170
perhaps in the future will extend it so
 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.040
perhaps in the future will extend it so
it's a bit more general but for now it's

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050
it's a bit more general but for now it's
 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.060
it's a bit more general but for now it's
very cool if you're developing an

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070
very cool if you're developing an
 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.100
very cool if you're developing an
angular app and you want kind of a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110
angular app and you want kind of a
 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.110
angular app and you want kind of a
better end-to-end experience better end

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120
better end-to-end experience better end
 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.210
better end-to-end experience better end
end testing experience protractor is a

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220
end testing experience protractor is a
 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.479
end testing experience protractor is a
very cool project so one of the reasons

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489
very cool project so one of the reasons
 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.750
very cool project so one of the reasons
people one of the key features of

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760
people one of the key features of
 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.240
people one of the key features of
angular I suppose is the dependency

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250
angular I suppose is the dependency
 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.760
angular I suppose is the dependency
injections which makes it much more easy

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770
injections which makes it much more easy
 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.380
injections which makes it much more easy
to test so how do you go about testing

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390
to test so how do you go about testing
 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.540
to test so how do you go about testing
other languages and frameworks is it any

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550
other languages and frameworks is it any
 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.150
