00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.370
Signatures are typically
very easy to understand.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.040
And symmetry matching is very efficient.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.850
Therefore, symmetry based
approaches are widely used.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.310
On the other hand, every time a new
malware or a new attack method appears,

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:20.890
significant menu effort must be spent
in order to create new signatures.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.830
In addition, these approaches
can not detect zero-day attacks,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.381
because these attacks are new and
they do not have known signatures yet.
