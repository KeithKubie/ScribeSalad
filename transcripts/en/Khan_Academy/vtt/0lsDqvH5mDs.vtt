00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.913
- [Narrator] If five is
divided into pieces that are

00:00:02.913 --> 00:00:07.080
each one half of a whole,
how many pieces are there?

00:00:08.352 --> 00:00:09.633
And this would be the
equivalent of saying,

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:12.762
"What is five divided by 1/2?"

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.668
And they help us out with this visual.

00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:16.930
So pause this video and see if

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.827
you can figure out what that is.

00:00:18.827 --> 00:00:22.698
How many pieces would you
get if you divide five

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:26.531
into pieces that are
each one half of a whole?

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:30.005
All right, now let's work
through this together.

00:00:30.005 --> 00:00:33.556
So here on this number line
we go from zero to five,

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:36.193
and then notice they've
divided into pieces

00:00:36.193 --> 00:00:38.233
that are each a half of a whole.

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:40.920
This is one piece right over here.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.919
So how many of those halves,

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:45.337
so this right over here is one half,

00:00:45.337 --> 00:00:49.091
how many of those halves
does it take to make five?

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:53.133
Well, two halves make a whole,
and we have five wholes.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:57.060
So it's going to be five times two, or 10.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.065
And we see that right over here.

00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:02.179
One half, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.929
nine, 10 halves make five wholes.

00:01:06.897 --> 00:01:09.210
So this is going to be equal to 10.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.740
So five divided into pieces
of one half, or five wholes

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.907
divided into pieces of one half
would be equal to 10 pieces.

00:01:19.081 --> 00:01:21.528
Let's do another example.

00:01:21.528 --> 00:01:23.502
So we have a similar question here.

00:01:23.502 --> 00:01:24.455
Here we're asked,

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:26.657
"If three wholes are divided into pieces

00:01:26.657 --> 00:01:30.824
that are each 1/6 of a whole,
how many pieces are there?"

00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:35.092
Once again, pause this
video and think about it.

00:01:35.092 --> 00:01:38.117
Well, they really help
us out with this visual

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:39.220
because we have three wholes.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.483
This is one whole, two
whole, and then three wholes,

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:45.706
and then we have divided them into pieces

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:48.015
that are each 1/6 of a whole.

00:01:48.015 --> 00:01:50.098
This is a sixth right
over here, this is a sixth

00:01:50.098 --> 00:01:52.765
right over here, so each
of these are sixths.

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:57.634
And so, if we look at this,
we have six sixths in a whole,

00:01:57.634 --> 00:02:01.801
and so in three wholes we're
gonna have six, 12, 18 pieces.

00:02:02.707 --> 00:02:04.931
And you could literally
just count these up.

00:02:04.931 --> 00:02:06.471
But it makes sense.

00:02:06.471 --> 00:02:10.053
If you take three wholes and
you divide it into sixths,

00:02:10.053 --> 00:02:12.806
so this is a sixth right over here,

00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:16.828
each of these wholes are
going to be six sixths,

00:02:16.828 --> 00:02:18.851
so three wholes are going to be

00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:21.934
three times six sixths, or 18 sixths.

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:24.926
There you go.
