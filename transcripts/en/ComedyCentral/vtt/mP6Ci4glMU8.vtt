 - Hey, what's up everybody?

00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:03.770 align:start position:0%
  Welcome to Stupid
  Questions: Roast Edition.

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:04.604
 (imitating sizzling)

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:06.072 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:08.174 align:start position:0%
 I'm here with Nikki Glaser,
 Brian Moses, Coach Tea,

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:09.409
and Dom Irrera.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:10.943 size:84% position:42%
  - A lot of people
  don't know this.

00:00:10.976 --> 00:00:12.378
 We went to grade school, high
 school, and college together.

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:13.579
 - True

00:00:13.612 --> 00:00:15.948 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And to see you again,
it breaks my heart,

00:00:15.981 --> 00:00:17.183 size:88% position:44%
 I love you so much.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:18.684 size:88% position:44%
 - Dom, I appreciate
 that, I really do.

00:00:18.717 --> 00:00:21.154
 (rock music)

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.458 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 Here we're gonna play
 this little game.

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.160 line:0%
 It's a fill-in-the-blank game.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:29.962 line:0%
So Bruce Willis is a lousy what?

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:31.664
 - French kisser, and
 I'll tell you why.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:34.267 size:88% position:44%
 He does the thing with his
 tongue, the twirling thing.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.736 size:88% position:44%
 It just gets all my, I see
 where you stop it and relax

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:38.271
and just (beep) rub the tongue.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.539 size:88% position:44% line:0%
 - I would love to
 roast Bruce Willis.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:40.373 line:0%
 - Would you?

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:41.574 line:0%
- Yeah.

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:42.875 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - You said you
 don't like roasting.

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:43.976
 - No, I know, but I'm
 a fan of Bruce Willis,

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.244
 so I would like to...

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:46.079
 - What's your favorite
 Bruce Willis movie?

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:46.779
 - Look Who's Talking.

00:00:46.812 --> 00:00:47.613 size:84% position:42%
  - Really?

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:48.815
 - 100 percent.

00:00:48.848 --> 00:00:50.083 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 - If I was roasting
 Bruce Willis,

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:52.118 line:0%
 it's like those eyes
 are crystal blue.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.820 align:start position:0% line:0%
 I would just get kinda
 getting lost in your eyes now.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:54.654 line:0%
- Oh, thank you.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:55.955 line:0%
 - No problem.

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:56.923 size:88% position:44%
  - I don't think he
  makes eye contact.

00:00:56.956 --> 00:00:58.224 size:88% position:44%
 - Oh yeah, I've heard that.

00:00:58.257 --> 00:00:59.559 size:84% position:42%
  - I've heard that
  on set you can't.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.060
 So I think that's why.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.662 size:88% position:44%
  It's not that he's rude or
  he thinks he's above it,

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.230 size:84% position:42%
  he doesn't want people
  falling in love with him.

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:07.500
 Because then it can distract
 from the work he needs to do.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.768
- Just goes full Stevie Wonder.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.103
 What do you think his
 tomb stone would say?

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.838 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - "Why are you staring
 at me like that?"

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.308
- Maybe it'd say "Look
who's not talking now".

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.943 size:84% position:42%
  You know, because of the
  movie Look Who's Talking.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:17.777 size:88% position:44%
  All right.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.246
 (rock music)

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.350 size:88% position:44%
  What would you say is your
  most roastable attribute?

00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:26.853 align:start size:88% position:13%
- If I were roasting me,
I'd go after the fact

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:28.121 size:84% position:42%
  that I don't have an ass.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:28.955 size:88% position:44%
  (laughing)

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:29.789
- Okay.

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:31.257
- Yeah.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.525 size:84% position:42%
  - You would just, yeah
  that you're just assless.

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:33.459 size:88% position:44%
  - Yeah that I just
  have a long back,

00:01:33.492 --> 00:01:34.861
I think that that's a good one.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.629
 - I don't need an ass,
 to be honest with you.

00:01:36.662 --> 00:01:37.563
 - Thank you for saying that.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:38.598
 - Absolutely, and I mean that.

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.899
- I lost it in the war.

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.168
 - The thing about
 me, I'm so adorable.

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:43.736 size:84% position:42%
  - You really are.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.771
 - You know, with this whole
 puffy-faced closed-eyes look

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.240 size:88% position:44%
 that I'm going for.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.142 align:start position:0%
 I don't know what they
 could possibly say about me.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.578
 (rock music)

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:56.549 size:84% position:42%
  - Brian Moses, who is the
  referee of Roast Battle.

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:59.752 align:start position:0%
Do you have pre-battle,
pre-Roast Battle pump-up music?

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:00.586 size:84% position:42%
  - I'm a jazz guy.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.521
 - Interesting.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:03.322 size:84% position:42%
  - Yeah a lot of Coltrane.

00:02:03.355 --> 00:02:05.191 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Unity's smooth because
 it's so vicious.

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
 - I'm always listening to
 Taylor Swift because she is...

00:02:07.993 --> 00:02:10.296
 I like to think of myself as
 the Taylor Swift of comedy.

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:11.497 align:start size:88% position:13%
 A lot of people
 have called me that

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.032 size:88% position:44%
 because I've asked them to.

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:15.401 size:84% position:42% line:0%
  - I'm here with
  Coach Tea the DJ.

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:16.269 size:84% position:42%
  Here's a stupid question.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.770
- [Coach Tea] All right.

00:02:17.803 --> 00:02:19.906
 - What do you think, what's
 the dumbest song that you feel

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.909 align:start size:88% position:13%
 you've had to play
 during a roast battle?

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:26.012
 - I have an interesting role
 because whenever the comedians

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.447 align:start position:0%
  come out to battle, I'm
  always trying to make fun.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.949
- Yeah.

00:02:29.982 --> 00:02:31.884 size:88% position:44%
 - So one time there was a
 guy and he had a short arm.

00:02:31.917 --> 00:02:33.653
And so I played a song
that just kept repeating

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:35.321
"Put that hands up in the air".

00:02:35.354 --> 00:02:37.056 align:start position:0%
  And everyone's laughing
  because he literally can't

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.791 align:start size:88% position:13%
 because he's got a
 little miniature arm.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:41.227
 (rock music)

00:02:42.294 --> 00:02:43.596 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Have you ever
roasted someone so hard

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:45.531
 that you really felt
 guilty afterwards?

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:46.499 size:84% position:42%
  - No, no.

00:02:46.532 --> 00:02:47.466 size:88% position:44%
 - You just, doesn't matter?

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:48.768 size:88% position:44%
 - It usually happens to me.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:49.735 size:88% position:44%
  And they were like
  "Oh I feel guilty

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:51.003
 because I was so mean to you."

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:51.704 size:88% position:44%
  - We roasted Ann
  Coulter last time.

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:53.239 size:84% position:42%
  - Oh yes.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:56.676 size:84% position:42%
  - And I went really hard
  on her and it felt great.

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.344 size:84% position:42%
  I didn't have any
  regrets about it.

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:02.081 align:start position:0%
 So I never wanna say anything
 that's gonna make someone

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:03.983
feel terrible about who they are

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:06.252 size:84% position:42%
  unless they're a terrible
  person like Ann Coulter.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:07.820 size:88% position:44%
  And then it's like
  you need to know.

00:03:07.853 --> 00:03:09.155 size:84% position:42%
  I didn't have to
  hold back at all.

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:10.590 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Have you ever
roasted someone so hard

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:11.958
that you felt guilty afterwards?

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:13.759
- You know who Jack Palance is?

00:03:13.792 --> 00:03:15.328 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Jack, oh yeah of
 course, City Slickers.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.729
- He got mad at people.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:18.331
 I heard Chevy Chase did too.

00:03:18.364 --> 00:03:19.265
 - Why?

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:20.733 size:84% position:42%
  - But you can't, he goes.

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:23.002 align:start position:0%
 Somebody would say something,
 and he'd go "(beep) you".

00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:26.072 size:88% position:44%
  I don't think he got the
  theme of this whole thing.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.273
 It's a joke.

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:29.041 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Jack Palance, he's
 dead now, right?

00:03:29.074 --> 00:03:30.910 align:start size:88% position:13%
- He's either dead or
having a tremendous lull

00:03:30.943 --> 00:03:32.411
 in his career.

00:03:32.444 --> 00:03:33.646
 - Here's something, because
 I don't like to roast really,

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:35.214
 because I don't like
 to be mean, right?

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:37.650 align:start size:88% position:13%
And you're a really nice
guy, I can tell that.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:39.318
 But you're a part of
 this Roast Battle show

00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:41.053
where people are
slamming people.

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:44.257 align:start position:0%
So how do you get into your
place where you can just be mean

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.725
 just for a little bit?

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:48.461 align:start position:0%
 - I love it because I don't
 consider it to be mean.

00:03:48.494 --> 00:03:49.729
- Okay.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:50.796
- Because I don't think
anybody should ever have

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:52.331
power over you, period.

00:03:52.364 --> 00:03:54.734 align:start size:88% position:13%
 So when something
 actually agitates you,

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.535 align:start size:88% position:13%
 that's a moment in
 your life, and be like

00:03:56.568 --> 00:03:58.070 align:start position:0%
  "Why am I so
  uncomfortable with that?"

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:00.039
 - That was some Roast
 Battle Gandhi shit.

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.607 size:88% position:44%
  - (laughing) Yeah.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.077
 (rock music)
