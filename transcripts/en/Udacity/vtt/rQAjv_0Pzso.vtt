00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The plaintext is 387.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Recall that encryption involved raising a message to the power of e mod n

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and decryption involved raising a ciphertext to the power of d mod n.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And so to decrypt to ciphertext 903,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we just take it to the d power mod n and get 387,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which we can see in Python.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And, if we want to check our answer,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
we can encrypt 387 using a public key

00:00:27.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and we get 903--our ciphertext.
