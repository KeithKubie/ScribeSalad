00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.410
Problem 17: Michelle read a book
review and predicted that

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.790
the number of girls who will
like the book will be more

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.930
than twice the number of boys
who will like the book.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.065
So, she predicted that the girls
would be more than twice

00:00:17.065 --> 00:00:21.580
-- let me box it out -- more
than twice the number of boys

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.070
who will like the book.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.230
Which table shows data that
supports her prediction?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.670
So essentially, we just need
to find one of the tables

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.090
where the number of girls who
like the book, that's just

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.390
this column right here -- the
number who like the book --

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.480
should be more than twice
the number of boys.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.090
Let's see the girls here is
40, the boys here are 35,

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.130
there are more girls than boys,
but it's not more than

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.300
twice the boys.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.520
The boys are 35.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.130
Twice the boys would be 70, and
girls is definitely not

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.200
more than 70, so that's
not our answer.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.740
Let's just go here, well, here
the boys are more than the

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.540
girls, which definitely isn't
going to be the case.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.810
We need a situation where the
girls are more than twice the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:02.540
number of boys.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.629
So that's not our situation,
because the girls are actually

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.830
smaller than the boys here.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.320
Here we have 35 boys, if you
multiply that by 2, you would

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.580
get 70 boys.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.660
So twice the boys is 70.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.230
And we see that the girls, at
80, are more than twice the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.490
boys at 70.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.580
So that is our choice.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.100
The girls are more than
twice the boys.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.200
And if you look here, the boys
and girls are even, so the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.440
girls are definitely not more
than twice the boys.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.410
So we know definitely,
that B is our answer.

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:40.440
Go to the next page, Problem 18:
Anna has the letter tiles

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.690
below in a bag.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.780
It's very interesting, it just
happens to spell out

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.250
statistics.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.780
She reached in the bag,
and pulled out an S.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.090
She then put the tile
back in the bag.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.680
OK, so all of them are
still in the bag.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.830
If Anna randomly selects a tile
from the bag, what is the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.070
probability she will
select an S again?

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.170
So this is a trick question on
some level, because this first

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.050
part, that she reached in the
bag and pulled out an S and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.720
she then put the tile
back in the bag.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.930
That doesn't do anything!

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.990
The fact that she pulled out an
S, and then put it back in

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.520
the bag, that shouldn't change
what happens afterward.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.340
If she took out the S and kept
the S out, then this would be

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.780
a different type of problem.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.700
But since she took out the S
and put it back in, this is

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.060
almost useless information.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.450
We still have all of these
letters in the bag.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.300
It says if Anna randomly selects
a tile from the bag,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.580
what is the probability
she'll select an S?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.210
So all we have to say is, all
of these are in the bag, so

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.480
what are the possible
outcomes?

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:50.700
So there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10 possible outcomes.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.630
10 possible outcomes, so
that's going to be the

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.870
denominator for our
probability.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.760
And then, what are the outcomes
that satisfy our

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.280
conditions?

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.330
Or, what are the outcomes
where she selects an S?

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.170
She selects an S, so there's
1 S, 2 S, and 3 S's.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.310
There's 3 out of the 10
situations involve selecting

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.130
an S, so the answer is 3/10.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.700
And the reason why I said it's
a trick question, is because

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.550
they write statement which
really doesn't change the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.230
problem it all.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.190
She took out an S,
she put it back.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.050
If she said that she took out an
S, and then she did not put

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.690
it back in the bag, then you
would say, oh gee, then

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.300
there's only 9 tiles left; and
only two of them are S's, and

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.730
then you would have said 2/9.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.080
But since she did put the S back
in the bag, we could say,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.120
oh, there's 10 letters in the
bag, 3 of them are S's, so the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.340
answer is 3/10.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.780
Problem 19: The scatterplot
below shows the ages of some

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.350
children and the distance
each lives from school.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.670
So this is the ages, and
then this is the

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.090
distance in that axis.

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.520
Which statement best describes
the relation between age and

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.780
distance from the school?

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.890
Just looking at this, I really
don't see any relation, it

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.370
seems to be fairly random.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.725
Let's see what the statements
tell us.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.220
As age and increases, the

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.750
distance from school increases.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.649
No, not really, I mean,
that would look

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.899
something like this.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:28.330
So this is our age axis, this
is our distance axis, what A

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.830
is describing is as age
increases, the distance from

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.000
school increases.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.890
The data points should look
something like this.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.160
They should generally increase
-- distance should generally

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.870
increase as age increases.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.890
That's not what we see here,
I mean this really

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.180
kind of seems arbitrary.

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.970
It's not like this nice
upward trend.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.380
B, as age increases the

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.820
distance from school decreases.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.430
Well I don't even see a downward
trend either, what B

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.960
is describing, the data
would look like this.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.700
Where we have this
downward trend.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.810
I don't see that here, either.

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.830
C, as age increases,
the distance from

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.020
school remains constant.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.590
What C is describing
would have data

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.090
that looks like this.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.250
That regardless of age, the
distance from school

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.800
is about the same.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.770
I don't really see
that either.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.190
There's still a huge spread
of distances.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.840
And then D, there is no
relationship between the age

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.230
and distance from school.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.350
I'll go with that one because,
you could imagine, if I tried

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.530
to draw trend line, I could
draw something like that,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.630
maybe that makes it look
like there's a trend.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.460
But I just as easily could
have drawn that.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:31.350
And looks just is good to me.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.130
Or I just as easily could
have drawn that.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.170
None of these look like it
fits the data any better.

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.360
So, at least the answer that I
feel comfortable with is D.
