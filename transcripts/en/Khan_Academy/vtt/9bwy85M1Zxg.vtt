00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.410
Now that we've set up
our surface integral,

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.760
we can attempt to
parametrise the surface.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.970
And one way to think about
is we want our x and y

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.930
values to take on all of the
values inside of the unit

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.220
circle, what I'm shading
in right over here.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.920
And that our z values can be
a function of the y values.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.870
We can express this
equation right here,

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.180
z is equal to 2 minus y.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.220
And then we could figure
out how high above to go

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.180
to get our z value.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.080
And by doing that, we'll
be able to essentially get

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.594
to every point that
sits on our surface.

00:00:30.594 --> 00:00:33.010
And so first let's think about
how we can get every x in y

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.030
value inside of the unit circle.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.090
So let's just focus
on the xy plane.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.840
We're kind of rotated
around a little bit,

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.800
so it looks a little
bit more traditional.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.620
So this is my x-axis and then
my y-axis would look something

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.387
like that.

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:50.970
Let me draw it a
little bit different.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.132
This is my y-axis.

00:00:54.132 --> 00:00:55.590
And then if I were
to draw the unit

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.110
circle, some kind of the base
of this thing, or at least

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.670
where it intersects
the xy plane-- actually

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.220
this thing would
keep going down,

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.790
if I wanted to
draw the x squared

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:04.790
plus y squared equals 1.

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.010
But if I draw where it
intersects the xy plane,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.050
we get the unit circle.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.670
So let me just draw it.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.734
That's my best attempt
at drawing a unit circle.

00:01:14.734 --> 00:01:16.150
We get the unit
circle and we need

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.090
to think of using
parameters so that we

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.450
can get every x and
y-coordinate that's inside

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.502
of the unit circle.

00:01:21.502 --> 00:01:23.710
And to think about that,
I'll introduce one parameter

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.550
that's essentially the
angle with the x-axis.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.970
And I'll call that
parameter theta.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.870
So theta is the angle
with the x-axis.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.150
And so theta will
essentially sweep things

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.150
all the way around.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.880
So theta can go
between 0 and 2 pi.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.850
So theta will take on
values between 0 and 2 pi.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.960
And if we just fix the
radius at some point,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.850
say radius 1, that
would only give us

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.440
all of the points
on the unit circle.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.350
But we want all the
points inside of it too.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.730
So we need to vary
the radius as well.

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.650
So let's introduce
another parameter,

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.920
let's call it r,
that is the radius.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.280
So for any given r, if
we keep changing theta,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.299
we would essentially sweep
out a circle of that radius.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.090
And if you change radius
a little bit more,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.423
you'll sweep out another circle.

00:02:07.423 --> 00:02:10.144
And if you vary radius
between 0 and 1,

00:02:10.144 --> 00:02:11.560
you'll get all of
the circles that

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.840
will fill out this entire area.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.090
So the radius is going
to go between 0 and 1.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.590
Another way of thinking about
it is for any given theta,

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.530
if you keep varying
the radius, you'll

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.730
sweep out all of the
points on this line.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.460
And then as you
change theta, it'll

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.090
sweep out the entire circle.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.570
So either way you
think about it.

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.430
So with that, let's actually
define x and y in those terms.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.870
So we could say that x is equal
to-- so the x value whatever

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.709
r is, the x value is going
to be r cosine theta.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.250
It's going to be
that component, it's

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.230
going to be r cosine theta.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.900
And then the y component-- this
is just basic trigonometry-- is

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.870
going to be r sine theta.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.790
And then the z
component, we already

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.200
said z can be expressed
as a function of y.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.740
Right over here we can
rewrite this as z is equal to

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.990
2 minus y.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.920
That'll tell us how high to
go so we end up on that plane.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.480
So if z is equal to 2 minus
y and if y is r sine theta,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:25.366
we can rewrite z as being
equal to 2 minus r sine theta.

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:26.240
So there, we're done.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.614
That's our
parametrization, if we

00:03:27.614 --> 00:03:32.550
wanted to write this
as a position vector

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.500
with two parameters--
I'll call it lowercase s,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.840
it's already used r.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.100
Lowercase s, this
is our surface,

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.240
and it's going to be
parametrized with r and theta.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:51.920
We can write it as r cosine
theta i plus r sine of theta j

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:01.560
plus r plus 2 minus
r sine of theta k.
