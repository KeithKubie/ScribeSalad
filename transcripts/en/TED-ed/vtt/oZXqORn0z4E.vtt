00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Music)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Every movie you've ever seen,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
every TV show, every magazine,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
every time you surf the Internet,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
you're absorbing information,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a bit like a sponge absorbs water.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The words on the screen, the images,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the colors, the sounds, the angle of the camera,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
every detail is designed to make you think,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
act or feel a certain way.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Your brain is subconsciously decoding images and sounds,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and just by being alive today,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
by interacting with and reading all these different types of media,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you're already an expert

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
at decoding and understanding these hidden messages.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
A set of codes and conventions that work together

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to make you feel happy, angry, afraid, excited.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
To make you want to buy a particular product --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
a refreshing drink, a new phone.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
To style your hair a certain way.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
To cheer for the hero or boo the villain.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Welcome to the family tree of technical codes.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So what constitutes a code?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
First of all, it has to be recognized by all who read it.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Imagine a busy city where motorists don't know how to read the traffic signals.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We all have to know red equals stop,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
green means go, for the system to work.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Otherwise it would be chaos.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Secondly, codes are made meaningful by their context.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We can't fully interpret or decipher a code

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
until we see how it relates to other signs and symbols.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Look at these two intersecting lines.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Without any context, things around the code to help you understand or make meaning from it,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
it's hard to know exactly what these lines represent.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They could be a cross, symbolizing religion,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
an add sign, symbolizing a mathematical concept,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the letter T from the alphabet,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
or they could just be two lines intersecting.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
If we add a crescent moon shape,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and a circle with a line on it in front,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the two lines now have a context,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
a relationship to their surroundings,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and are magically revealed as the letter T.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
By adding additional information around the code,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
we've changed its context, and therefore given it a concrete meaning.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Let's meet the family.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Technical Codes, Senior has three sons:

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Symbolic Codes, Written Codes and Technical Codes, Junior.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Symbolic Codes has three sons:

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Symbolic Color, Symbolic Objects

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and Symbolic Animals.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
This branch of the family is all about representation.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Red represents hot

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
or stop or danger, depending on its context.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So if you see a red light above a yellow and a green light

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
on a pole above the road,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
you know by this context that the light represents stop.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Written Codes has three sons:

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
You and Only You, Buzzwords and Catchphrase.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
These guys are all about saying a lot with a little,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
or planting a word in your subconscious

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that triggers a response whenever you hear or read it.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Have you noticed how many times I've said the word "you?"

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
You should feel like it's directed specifically at you, and only you,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that it's addressing your needs and desire to learn about your world.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
If I tell you that all the cool, fresh and hip people are buying

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
a new drink or wearing a particular brand,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the buzzwords "new," "fresh" or "free"

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
make the product seem more interesting and appealing.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
If I wrap that product or idea in a simple phrase

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that's easy to remember and becomes part of your everyday speech,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
then every time you hear or say those few words,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
your brain connects them to the product.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So Just Do It, Think Different,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and Enjoy the power of the catchphrase.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And Technical Codes, Junior has three sons:

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Camera Angles, Framing and Lighting.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
For these boys, it's all about how the camera is placed,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
how objects, people and places are shot,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and what we see on screen -- or just as importantly, what we don't see.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
When the camera is placed high above the subject,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
it makes you look small, insignificant and powerless.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And the reverse is also true, when the camera is below.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So is this video trying to manipulate you to buy something?

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Yes, an idea.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The idea that understanding the relationship between technical codes

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and the role they play in shaping your understanding of the world around us

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
through the media we consume is fun and interesting.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Is it trying to make you feel a certain way?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Absolutely.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Every image, every word,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
has been carefully crafted to work together

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
to make you feel positive about the idea

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that you need to be educated to engage with what you read,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
watch and listen to in movies,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
TV shows, magazines

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and on the Internet.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
By understanding these codes,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and how they work together to subconsciously change the way you think,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
feel and act towards products and ideas,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
you'll be aware of these techniques

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and able to identify their impact on you.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
One of the most powerful advertising mediums in the world

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
is word of mouth.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000
If you've ever recommended a product or movie, a service, or even a video online,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
then you've played your part in passing the message.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So soak all this information up.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Recognize how the family tree of technical codes

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
works on you, and those around you, to make an impact

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Find excellent examples,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and spread the word.
