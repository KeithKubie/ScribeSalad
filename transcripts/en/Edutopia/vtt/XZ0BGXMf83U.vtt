00:00:01.716 --> 00:00:05.406
&gt;&gt;Robert Pronovost: Really trying to address
giving every student what they need,

00:00:05.406 --> 00:00:08.396
and giving them that
differentiated instruction is

00:00:08.396 --> 00:00:10.576
where the technology
really comes in handy.

00:00:10.906 --> 00:00:14.656
Not only are they getting immediate
feedback and they're able to move

00:00:14.656 --> 00:00:18.196
at their own pace, but then I'm
also able to support the students

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:19.976
who really need my support.

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:34.736
&gt;&gt;Today, what we are gonna talk
about is addition and subtraction.

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:41.446
If she gives away ten pencils, how
many pencils will Teresa have left?

00:00:42.106 --> 00:00:43.226
I want you to think about it.

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:46.056
Is this addition or
is this subtraction?

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:50.836
&gt;&gt;So today when we started in
math, we sat down on the rug

00:00:50.836 --> 00:00:53.256
and we were starting with
addition and subtraction.

00:00:53.796 --> 00:00:56.456
We practice identifying
clue words and knowing

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.046
if we need to add or subtract.

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:00.376
&gt;&gt;How do we know we're
doing addition?

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:04.406
&gt;&gt;Boy: Because you said "and
all" and that means all together.

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:07.966
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: Once I felt that
students really were getting back

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:09.786
into the rhythm with
addition and subtraction,

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:13.486
that's when I move
them on to computers.

00:01:13.596 --> 00:01:14.916
&gt;&gt;When you're at Planet Turtle,

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:17.906
you're doing your independent
practice.

00:01:18.466 --> 00:01:22.046
You need to practice at least
three games, and you'll need to get

00:01:22.046 --> 00:01:25.316
about eighty percent
correct in order to move

00:01:25.316 --> 00:01:29.576
on to Dream Box, or to the iPods.

00:01:29.896 --> 00:01:32.856
&gt;&gt;Planet Turtle is a program
that allows them to play games.

00:01:33.416 --> 00:01:36.386
In these games, they are
being asked math questions.

00:01:36.386 --> 00:01:39.976
Planet Turtle gives them immediate
feedback, whereas I would have

00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:42.296
to walk around the entire
room to give them feedback.

00:01:42.536 --> 00:01:45.376
By them getting their immediate
feedback through Planet Turtle,

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:48.926
I could grab some students who
really needed some support and work

00:01:48.926 --> 00:01:50.536
with them in a small group.

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:52.156
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: Please show me on yours--

00:01:52.156 --> 00:01:56.116
&gt;&gt;Girl: What is ten minus nine,
and then I know the answer,

00:01:56.256 --> 00:02:00.146
so I click, and you get a point.

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:02.426
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: For the students who
were practicing on their own,

00:02:02.896 --> 00:02:05.736
Planet Turtle was the way
to reinforce the addition

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:07.726
and subtraction that we
had practiced as a class.

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:11.056
Once they'd shown mastery in Planet
Turtle, they were able to move

00:02:11.056 --> 00:02:15.296
on to Dream Box, and Dream Box gave
them that individualized instruction

00:02:15.386 --> 00:02:20.266
at their own level, whereas Planet
Turtle was only providing a basic

00:02:20.296 --> 00:02:23.156
practice for the entire
class at the same level.

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:28.546
&gt;&gt;I encourage my students to use all
the tools that are available to them.

00:02:28.746 --> 00:02:31.206
One thing that we emphasize
in this class is

00:02:31.206 --> 00:02:34.776
that using computers is
not always the best tool.

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:37.236
Using your hands may not
always be the best tool.

00:02:37.546 --> 00:02:39.936
And so when I have some
students on Planet Turtle,

00:02:39.936 --> 00:02:42.096
they might be solving the
problem on their white board,

00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.146
or they might be counting
on their fingers,

00:02:44.506 --> 00:02:46.396
because that's the
best strategy for them.

00:02:46.576 --> 00:02:48.506
&gt;&gt;And our final answer would be?

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:49.766
&gt;&gt;All: Fourteen.

00:02:50.306 --> 00:02:52.316
&gt;&gt;My first two years
that I was teaching,

00:02:52.406 --> 00:02:54.926
I didn't have any technology
in my classroom.

00:02:55.096 --> 00:02:56.856
Not having access to those tools

00:02:56.856 --> 00:03:00.506
and knowing how valuable they could
be is what kind of drove me to reach

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:05.736
out to companies around, which led to
receiving a few computers from Apple,

00:03:05.736 --> 00:03:09.866
and then recently receiving a
large grant from Facebook as well.

00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:14.216
&gt;&gt;Girl: I wanna like practice a
little bit more, for I could get

00:03:14.426 --> 00:03:15.686
like so much better here.

00:03:15.686 --> 00:03:19.006
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: The iPod Touches
came to us through a SIG grant,

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:20.496
School Improvement Grant.

00:03:20.666 --> 00:03:23.276
Dream Box we started this year.

00:03:23.276 --> 00:03:25.586
We are just trying
out, on a trial basis,

00:03:25.586 --> 00:03:28.906
because most of the software we
use in this classroom I either get

00:03:29.076 --> 00:03:31.946
through beta testing
or through free trials.

00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:40.016
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: The iPod Touch might be
valuable at one time for students

00:03:40.016 --> 00:03:43.116
to practice a certain
strategy or game

00:03:43.846 --> 00:03:47.286
and then the MacBooks might
support them in another way

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:50.816
with their leveled reading or with
differentiated math instruction.

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:53.866
&gt;&gt;What number do we have in
the tens place right here?

00:03:54.316 --> 00:03:54.596
&gt;&gt;Boy: Four.

00:03:55.046 --> 00:03:57.916
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: Four, what
are we subtracting?

00:03:58.006 --> 00:03:58.166
&gt;&gt;Boy: One.

00:03:58.676 --> 00:04:01.976
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: One group of ten, four
groups of ten minus one group of ten.

00:04:02.356 --> 00:04:05.986
So let's see, four minus one.

00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:10.646
&gt;&gt;Boy: Three.

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.066
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: Okay, three.

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:18.706
&gt;&gt;Every six to eight weeks, we take
a benchmark exam, so I can compare

00:04:18.706 --> 00:04:20.006
where my students were
at the beginning

00:04:20.006 --> 00:04:22.356
of the year to where they are now.

00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:25.076
So I have seen some
great improvement.

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:27.956
I have data that shows that they're
improving at a much greater rate

00:04:28.556 --> 00:04:30.916
than my students had
in the past two years

00:04:30.916 --> 00:04:33.586
when I didn't have any
of these applications.

00:04:33.816 --> 00:04:37.726
&gt;&gt;We all start right here,
what number is this right here?

00:04:37.826 --> 00:04:38.516
&gt;&gt;All: One.

00:04:38.516 --> 00:04:41.586
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: One, what number
is in the bottom right here?

00:04:41.586 --> 00:04:41.886
&gt;&gt;Boy: Three.

00:04:41.886 --> 00:04:44.776
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: Three; is
there more on the top

00:04:44.886 --> 00:04:46.126
or is there more on the floor?

00:04:46.206 --> 00:04:47.246
&gt;&gt;All: More on the floor.

00:04:47.766 --> 00:04:50.016
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: More on the floor.

00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:51.236
&gt;&gt;All: Go next door.

00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:56.326
&gt;&gt;They are interacting in a much
more fun way than say, you know,

00:04:56.326 --> 00:04:59.596
answering questions and then just
saying, "Yes, you passed, no,

00:04:59.706 --> 00:05:01.126
you didn't, move on to the next one."

00:05:01.206 --> 00:05:03.666
It's just a lot more
engaging and exciting to them.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.546
&gt;&gt;Six. So now I'm gonna
take away three.

00:05:05.926 --> 00:05:07.396
One, two...

00:05:07.436 --> 00:05:08.326
&gt;&gt;Boy: Three.

00:05:08.326 --> 00:05:08.666
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: Three.

00:05:08.876 --> 00:05:12.126
&gt;&gt;Because they're games, they
are constantly being assessed.

00:05:12.296 --> 00:05:15.366
They need to pass this in order
to move to the next level.

00:05:15.816 --> 00:05:18.416
So while students feel
like, "Oh, I'm working.

00:05:18.416 --> 00:05:20.616
I got to the next level,"
truly that means

00:05:20.616 --> 00:05:22.016
that they've mastered this concept.

00:05:22.016 --> 00:05:23.816
They're moving on to
the next concept.

00:05:23.816 --> 00:05:25.706
It's just a new way of phrasing it.

00:05:25.706 --> 00:05:28.046
&gt;&gt;Girl: Five minus two.

00:05:28.276 --> 00:05:28.706
&gt;&gt;Girl: That's three.

00:05:28.706 --> 00:05:33.156
&gt;&gt;Girl: Yeah, We did
this-- I did this on my--

00:05:33.226 --> 00:05:35.796
&gt;&gt;Pronovost: Students could be
doing the same kind of practice

00:05:35.796 --> 00:05:38.336
on a worksheet, but if they're
doing it on a worksheet,

00:05:38.336 --> 00:05:39.876
they're going to get
very bored easily.

00:05:40.446 --> 00:05:43.606
They're going to want to know
what to do when they're done,

00:05:43.656 --> 00:05:47.466
because there's no built in levels
to move on to, so I wouldn't have

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:52.056
that time with the students who I
really feel need my time and support.
