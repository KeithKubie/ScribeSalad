[belch] HI.
I'M MARK GAGLIARDI,

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.372 line:0%
AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT ROBERT SMALLS.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.775 line:0%
[laughter]

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.577 line:0%
- WHEN ROBERT SMALLS
WAS 12 YEARS OLD,

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.347 line:0%
HIS FATHER, HENRY MCKEE,
THE PLANTATION OWNER,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.550
WAS LIKE, LISTEN, MY SON,

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:19.552
THAT I'M NOT ALLOWED
TO TELL ANYBODY IS MY SON

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:20.453
BUT REALLY,
YOU'RE MY SON.

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:24.323
YOU ARE SPECIALER
THAN THE OTHER SLAVES.

00:00:24.356 --> 00:00:27.794
BUT YOU KEEP GETTING
IN TROUBLE.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.797
WE THINK THAT THE BEST THING
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.699
IS IF WE SEND YOU
TO CHARLESTON.

00:00:33.732 --> 00:00:35.701
AND ROBERT SMALLS IS LIKE,
OH, I'M SORRY.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.503
YOU'RE MY [bleep] SLAVE OWNER

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:39.806
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEND ME
TO CHARLESTON

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.743
WHERE I CAN LEARN
AN ACTUAL BUSINESS TRADE?

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:47.413
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A GOOD IDEA.

00:00:47.446 --> 00:00:50.383
AND HE SPENT SEVEN YEARS
BEING A CREWMAN

00:00:50.416 --> 00:00:53.719
ONBOARD ALL OF THESE
DIFFERENT VESSELS

00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:55.288
THAT TRAVELED AROUND
THESE CHARLESTON WATERWAYS,

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:59.492
INCLUDING THE CONFEDERATE SHIP,
THE<i> PLANTER.</i>

00:00:59.525 --> 00:01:03.162 line:0%
AT THIS POINT,
THE CIVIL WAR HAS BROKEN OUT.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:04.530 line:0%
THE OFFICERS TURNED
TO ROBERT SMALLS

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.866 line:0%
AND THEY WERE LIKE,
LISTEN MAN.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.303
DON'T TELL ANYONE
WE'RE GOING TO GO ONSHORE.

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:13.439
KEEP AN EYE ON THE SHIP
WHILE WE'RE GONE.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.441
AND ROBERT SMALLS IS LIKE,
SURE MAN,

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:17.176
I [bleep] GOT THIS.

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:18.778
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME.

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:21.180
AND ROBERT SMALLS THOUGHT
TO HIMSELF,

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:24.417
THESE GUYS JUST WENT
TO GO GET SOME HOOKERS.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.552
THESE TWO OTHER GUYS,

00:01:26.585 --> 00:01:28.554
WHO AREN'T
THE GUYS GETTING HOOKERS,

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:30.590
ALSO WENT TO GET HOOKERS.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.492
I BASICALLY HAVE THIS SHIP
TO MYSELF.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.361
HE SAYS, HEY MAN.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.865
THIS IS THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
FOR US TO STEAL THIS SHIP

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:42.768
AND GET OVER
TO THE UNION SIDE.

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.537
HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.241
GO GET MY FAMILY
AND GO ROUND UP THE FAMILY

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.477
OF THE OTHER TWO SEAMEN
ON THIS VESSEL.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.680
AND I WILL BRING ALL OF US
TO FREEDOM.

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:57.250
[laughter]

00:01:57.283 --> 00:01:58.117
- MARK.
- WHAT?

00:01:58.151 --> 00:01:59.519
- REMEMBER AT
THE BEGINNING OF THIS

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:00.787
YOU SAID YOU WERE
NOT GOING TO--

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.490
- I PROMISED YOU I WAS NOT GOING
TO LAY ON MY STOMACH TONIGHT.

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:06.325
- AND WHAT HAPPENED?

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:07.026
- PROBABLY THIS.

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:09.695
I'M FIGHTING.
HERE I COME.

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:10.629
- CUE<i> EYE OF THE TIGER.</i>
- ALL RIGHT.

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:14.367
I ONLY DO THIS
IN HONOR OF ROBERT SMALLS.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.436
[groan] GOD DAMN IT,
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.741
ONCE ROBERT SMALLS
HAD TAKEN CONTROL OF THE SHIP,

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:23.076
SMALLS THOUGHT TO HIMSELF,

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:28.247
I'M STILL GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE
IT PAST FIVE CONFEDERATE FORTS.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.683
LUCKILY, I LOOK ENOUGH LIKE
THE CAPTAIN

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:33.352
WHEN I WEAR THE HAT
AND THIS JACKET.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:35.421
AND I HAVE
THE CONFEDERATE CODE BOOK,

00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:40.193
WHICH MEANS I KNOW
WHAT SIGNALS TO THROW

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.361
THAT WILL GET US
THROUGH THE HARBOR.

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:46.332
SO ROBERT SMALLS IS
PILOTING THE SHIP

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:47.934
PAST CONFEDERATE TROOPS.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:52.271
SO HE GOT TO THE FIRST ONE
AND WAS LIKE, TOOT-TOOT-TOOT.

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:56.409
AND THEY THOUGHT THERE'S A WHITE
GUY TRYING TO PASS THROUGH.

00:02:56.442 --> 00:02:58.611
LET'S JUST WAVE AT HIM.

00:02:58.644 --> 00:03:00.180
AND HE MADE IT THROUGH.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:04.317
[exhales]

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:05.318
[chuckle]

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.486
[exclaims]

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.487
ALL RIGHT.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.856
SO HE MADE IT THROUGH
FIVE CONFEDERATE SIGNALS

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:12.725
ALL THE WAY THROUGH
TO THE GATES OF FORT SUMTER.

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:15.828
NOT ONLY DID THE GUYS
AT FORT SUMTER SAY,

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:17.964
ALL RIGHT, LET'S LET
THE<i> PLANTER</i> THROUGH,

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:20.566
THE GUARD
AT FORT SUMTER SAID,

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.937
HEY, YOU GO KILL YOURSELVES
A COUPLE OF YANKEES.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:31.877
AND IT WAS ONLY AT DAWN
THAT THE CONFEDERATES REALIZE,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.681
HEY, MAYBE THIS ISN'T QUITE
ON THE LEVEL.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:38.985
AND THEY START LOBBING
CANNON FIRE

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:43.789 line:0%
AND AS HE IS BARRELING
TOWARD UNION FORCES,

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:45.424
HE THINKS, OH MY GOD.

00:03:45.457 --> 00:03:47.026
I'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING
TO MAKE SURE

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:48.728
THAT THESE UNION FORCES
DON'T THINK

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.430
I AM COMING TO CONFRONT THEM.

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:54.333
- ARE WE GONNA DO THIS THING
FROM THE FLOOR MAN, REALLY?

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:55.768
- I WANT YOU TO BE COMFORTABLE,
SO WE'LL DO IT WHEREVER.

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:59.438 line:0%
- I'LL DO IT FROM THE FLOOR.

00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:02.575 line:0%
AS HE IS BARRELING TOWARD
THESE UNION FORCES,

00:04:02.608 --> 00:04:03.909
SMALLS TURNS TO HIS WIFE
AND SAYS,

00:04:03.942 --> 00:04:06.345
I TOLD YOU TO BRING
A BED SHEET.

00:04:06.378 --> 00:04:07.713
DID YOU BRING A BED SHEET?

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.750
SHE'S LIKE, HONEY,
I BROUGHT US A BREAD SHEET.

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:12.652
- HEY MARK,
LET'S JUST HAVE SOME WATER.

00:04:12.685 --> 00:04:14.553
JUST TAKE A QUICK BREAK
AND JUST DRINK SOME WATER.

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.055
- ARE WE GETTING IN A FIGHT?

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:18.791
- NOT AT ALL.
- WHY--WHAT?

00:04:18.824 --> 00:04:20.026
- YOU'RE OKAY.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:22.662
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW,
BABY?

00:04:22.695 --> 00:04:24.463
- THE NEXT PART.

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:28.734
- HE HOISTED THE SHEET
AS A WHITE FLAG OF SURRENDER.

00:04:28.767 --> 00:04:33.339 line:0%
HE PULLS UP TO
THE<i> U.S.S. ONWARD</i> AND SAYS,

00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:36.676
HEY MAN,
I HUNG--I HEAR UNCLE ABE

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:37.843
COULD USE A TRANSPORT SHIP.

00:04:37.876 --> 00:04:40.746
THIS WAS A BIG DEAL.

00:04:40.779 --> 00:04:42.448
AND LINCOLN'S LIKE,
ALL RIGHT MAN.

00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:45.551
THAT'S GREAT.
HERE'S $1,500.

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:47.586
HEY, HERE'S A QUICK QUESTION.

00:04:47.619 --> 00:04:51.424
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU COULD GET
SOME [bleep] UNION GUYS

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:55.394
LIKE SOME--SOME--SOME
CELEBRI--SOME CELEBRITIES?

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:55.861
WHA--WHAT'S THE WORD
I'M LOOKING FOR?

00:04:55.894 --> 00:04:59.799
SOME CELEBRATEDS.

00:04:59.832 --> 00:05:00.966
WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR?
SOME, UM.

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.968
- MARK.

00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:05.504
- AH-BA-BA-BA-BA.
HOLD ON.

00:05:05.537 --> 00:05:09.342
[snorts]
NOT CELEBRITIES.

00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:10.209
SOME SOLDIERS.

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:16.749
HE WAS THE FIRST
TO ENLIST 5,000 BLACKS

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:17.983
IN THE UNION ARMY.

00:05:18.016 --> 00:05:21.354
SO THE END OF
THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:22.988
CIVIL WAR...
[slurred, indistinct speech]

00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:24.890
AND HE HAD
JUST ENOUGH MONEY.

00:05:24.923 --> 00:05:27.560
- WHAT?

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:30.796
- NOT ONLY DID ROBERT SMALLS
STEAL A BOAT

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:32.965
AND [bleep] GET HIS FREEDOM.

00:05:32.998 --> 00:05:37.536
NOT ONLY DID HE SERVE FIVE TERMS
AS A U.S. CONGRESSMAN.

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:41.440
AFTER THE WAR, ROBERT SMALLS
WENT INTO SOUTH CAROLINA

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:45.578
AND SAID, HEY,
SEE THAT HOUSE OVER THERE?

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:47.646
THAT'S THE HOUSE
I WANT TO BUY.

00:05:47.679 --> 00:05:48.714
WHICH HOUSE?

00:05:48.747 --> 00:05:50.082
THAT ONE.

00:05:50.115 --> 00:05:52.051
I'M GOING TO BUY
THE MCKEE HOUSE.

00:05:56.155 --> 00:05:59.091
THE LAST TIME THAT HE WAS
IN THAT HOUSE,

00:05:59.124 --> 00:06:02.595
HE WAS OWNED
BY ANOTHER PERSON.

00:06:02.628 --> 00:06:05.765
THIS TIME,
MOTHER[bleep] OWNED THE HOUSE.

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:09.869
- MARK.

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:12.104
- MM-HMM.

00:06:12.137 --> 00:06:13.706
- ROBERT SMALLS.

00:06:13.739 --> 00:06:15.441
- YEAH, MAN.

00:06:15.474 --> 00:06:17.043
- DO YOU LIKE HIM?
- I LOVE HIM.
