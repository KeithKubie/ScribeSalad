that's part of what made her kind of
 

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.990
that's part of what made her kind of
interesting because before she was just

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000
interesting because before she was just
 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.670
interesting because before she was just
like

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:50.680
like
 

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.949
like
bubblegum tea yaha you know and early on

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959
bubblegum tea yaha you know and early on
 

00:08:52.959 --> 00:08:55.859
bubblegum tea yaha you know and early on
but then she got like really interesting

00:08:55.859 --> 00:08:55.869
but then she got like really interesting
 

00:08:55.869 --> 00:08:57.449
but then she got like really interesting
and that she would be doing kind of this

00:08:57.449 --> 00:08:57.459
and that she would be doing kind of this
 

00:08:57.459 --> 00:08:59.460
and that she would be doing kind of this
stuff and she had like this science

00:08:59.460 --> 00:08:59.470
stuff and she had like this science
 

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.590
stuff and she had like this science
background and she was all about like

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600
background and she was all about like
 

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.480
background and she was all about like
the statistics and the numbers and she

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:03.490
the statistics and the numbers and she
 

00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.699
the statistics and the numbers and she
kind of got colder and colder but that

00:09:05.699 --> 00:09:05.709
kind of got colder and colder but that
 

00:09:05.709 --> 00:09:08.460
kind of got colder and colder but that
made her actually more interesting so to

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.470
made her actually more interesting so to
 

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:10.590
made her actually more interesting so to
be I'm not saying they can't still make

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:10.600
be I'm not saying they can't still make
 

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.989
be I'm not saying they can't still make
her interesting I'm wondering though if

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:12.999
her interesting I'm wondering though if
 

00:09:12.999 --> 00:09:15.269

they sort of have like a plan for her I
mean maybe they can just play up kind of

00:09:17.309 --> 00:09:17.319
mean maybe they can just play up kind of
 

00:09:17.319 --> 00:09:19.410
mean maybe they can just play up kind of
the science aspect you know it kinda

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:19.420
the science aspect you know it kinda
 

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.730
the science aspect you know it kinda
nerdy aspect is now because there were

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:20.740
nerdy aspect is now because there were
 

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:22.769
nerdy aspect is now because there were
some episodes like where she's with like

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:22.779
some episodes like where she's with like
 

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:24.449
some episodes like where she's with like

interesting cuz over the seasons she did
become more interest yeah you know and

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:39.730
become more interest yeah you know and
 

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.059
become more interest yeah you know and
not in a way of oh just give her count

00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:42.069
not in a way of oh just give her count
 

00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:43.799
not in a way of oh just give her count
what they do with boring characters just

00:09:43.799 --> 00:09:43.809
what they do with boring characters just
 

00:09:43.809 --> 00:09:46.859
what they do with boring characters just
give her a tragic backstory or yeah cry

00:09:46.859 --> 00:09:46.869
give her a tragic backstory or yeah cry
 

00:09:46.869 --> 00:09:48.419
give her a tragic backstory or yeah cry
a few times or something like that you

00:09:48.419 --> 00:09:48.429
a few times or something like that you
 

00:09:48.429 --> 00:09:51.359
a few times or something like that you
know and instant interest but no she was

00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:51.369
know and instant interest but no she was
 

00:09:51.369 --> 00:09:53.790
know and instant interest but no she was
actually like everything was calculating

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800
actually like everything was calculating
 

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:56.669
actually like everything was calculating
in a statistic and was mathematical and

00:09:56.669 --> 00:09:56.679
in a statistic and was mathematical and
 

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.530
in a statistic and was mathematical and
she was a scientist so it kind of made

00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:58.540
she was a scientist so it kind of made
 

00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:01.350
she was a scientist so it kind of made
sense and it she just seemed more cold

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360
sense and it she just seemed more cold
 

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.480
sense and it she just seemed more cold
but was doing it for the good of

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:03.490
but was doing it for the good of
 

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:06.210
but was doing it for the good of
everybody so is she actually became

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:06.220
everybody so is she actually became
 

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:08.519
everybody so is she actually became
really interesting like anytime she

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:08.529
really interesting like anytime she
 

00:10:08.529 --> 00:10:09.689
really interesting like anytime she
showed up on screen was kinda like

00:10:09.689 --> 00:10:09.699
showed up on screen was kinda like
 

00:10:09.699 --> 00:10:10.889
showed up on screen was kinda like
what's she up to

00:10:10.889 --> 00:10:10.899
what's she up to
 

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:14.069
what's she up to
yeah what sort of alternate plot here

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079
yeah what sort of alternate plot here
 

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:15.900
yeah what sort of alternate plot here
like that's how I always looked at it

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:15.910
like that's how I always looked at it
 

00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:18.030
like that's how I always looked at it
and I think that probably is whether or

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.040
and I think that probably is whether or
 

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.819
and I think that probably is whether or
not he was planned or not that's part of

00:10:20.819 --> 00:10:20.829
not he was planned or not that's part of
 

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:22.739
not he was planned or not that's part of
the fun of her starting out as kind of

00:10:22.739 --> 00:10:22.749
the fun of her starting out as kind of
 

00:10:22.749 --> 00:10:24.059
the fun of her starting out as kind of
just like you know the light-hearted
