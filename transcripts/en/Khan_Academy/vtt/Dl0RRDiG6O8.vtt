00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.491
- [Voiceover] So Kim, we've been talking

00:00:01.491 --> 00:00:03.176
about the run up to the Civil War.

00:00:03.176 --> 00:00:05.388
We talked about the Compromise of 1850,

00:00:05.388 --> 00:00:07.681
which angered a lot of anti-slavery

00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:09.801
and abolitionist folks in the North.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:13.252
As we get to the election of 1860,

00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:15.518
you have Abraham Lincoln

00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:16.531
getting elected.

00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:18.331
And a lot of folks view that as a bit

00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.558
of the final catalyst for the Civil War.

00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:22.493
What's happening?

00:00:22.493 --> 00:00:23.672
And is that accurate?

00:00:23.672 --> 00:00:25.665
- [Voiceover] So, Lincoln is elected

00:00:25.665 --> 00:00:28.254
as a Republican Party president.

00:00:28.254 --> 00:00:31.860
This is the first Republican
Party president, ever.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.280
And the real basis of the Republican Party

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.701
is an anti-slavery platform.

00:00:37.701 --> 00:00:40.360
They really don't want slavery

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.296
to extend into the Western territories

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:46.950
that have been acquired
through the Mexican War.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.635
So, they have been
making both an economic,

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:54.906
and to some extent, moral
argument against slavery.

00:00:54.906 --> 00:00:56.881
So, when Lincoln becomes president,

00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:59.922
the states of the South,
particularly the Deep South,

00:00:59.922 --> 00:01:04.438
or this Cotton Belt area,
whose entire economic system

00:01:04.438 --> 00:01:08.433
relies on slavery, they think
that they are under attack.

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:12.303
That Lincoln is going
to be coming for slavery

00:01:12.303 --> 00:01:14.979
as soon as he gets a chance, as president.

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:16.267
- [Voiceover] And we're talking about

00:01:16.267 --> 00:01:17.243
these states down here.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:19.393
This is Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,

00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:21.981
Alabama, Georgia, South
Carolina, and Florida.

00:01:21.981 --> 00:01:24.333
- [Voiceover] Right; so these are the real

00:01:24.333 --> 00:01:29.124
cotton states, where slavery
is highly entrenched.

00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:32.159
There, more than 50% of the population

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.528
is enslaved working on cotton plantations.

00:01:35.528 --> 00:01:37.970
And it's making the elite people,

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.529
elite whites in the South, very wealthy.

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:44.424
Cotton is just the
backbone of their economy.

00:01:44.424 --> 00:01:45.562
- [Voiceover] So what do they do?

00:01:45.562 --> 00:01:46.434
Lincoln gets elected.

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:48.458
This is November of 1860?

00:01:48.458 --> 00:01:49.688
- [Voiceover] That's right.

00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:51.245
- [Voiceover] So what do they do about it?

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:52.379
They're afraid.

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:53.734
- [Voiceover] They're afraid that Lincoln

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:56.164
is going to do something about slavery.

00:01:56.164 --> 00:02:01.121
So, over the course of this winter period,

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:05.050
this is in a period before we moved

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.284
the inauguration up to January,

00:02:07.284 --> 00:02:09.304
so it used to be that presidents

00:02:09.304 --> 00:02:11.600
would be elected in November

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.950
and not take office until March.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.052
- [Voiceover] Yeah, we have here,

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:16.352
this Lincoln gets elected in November,

00:02:16.352 --> 00:02:17.553
but then he doesn't get inaugurated

00:02:17.553 --> 00:02:18.649
until March, over here.

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:19.877
- [Voiceover] So there's this long,

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:21.900
lame duck period where everyone

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.870
knows that a new political party

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.819
is going to be in power, a new president

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.770
is in power, but he's not in office yet.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.290
- [Voiceover] And so
you have James Buchanan

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.986
sitting around; he's
still the president, but.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:36.177
- [Voiceover] But, yeah,
his days are numbered,

00:02:36.177 --> 00:02:38.419
and his power is pretty limited.

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.241
So, over the course of what they call this

00:02:40.241 --> 00:02:43.983
Secession Winter, the seven states

00:02:43.983 --> 00:02:46.363
of the Deep South get together

00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:50.565
and they secede from the
Union, one after another.

00:02:50.565 --> 00:02:52.825
And this includes South Carolina,

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:55.646
Mississippi, Florida, Alabama,

00:02:55.646 --> 00:02:58.070
Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.540
They secede from the Union,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.918
and they form what they call

00:03:00.918 --> 00:03:02.816
The Confederate States of America,

00:03:02.816 --> 00:03:05.725
which is, basically, almost exactly

00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:07.765
the same as The United States of America.

00:03:07.765 --> 00:03:10.246
Their constitution is based very

00:03:10.246 --> 00:03:12.301
closely on the US Constitution.

00:03:12.301 --> 00:03:16.422
But it guarantees the
existence of slavery.

00:03:16.422 --> 00:03:17.996
It explicitly says that slavery

00:03:17.996 --> 00:03:20.270
is allowed and protected forever.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.390
And they elect Jefferson
Davis as their president.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.902
- [Voiceover] So when they seceded,

00:03:26.902 --> 00:03:28.512
for them it was clearly about slavery.

00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:30.417
- [Voiceover] Right;
everything is about slavery.

00:03:30.417 --> 00:03:33.107
They are concerned that Lincoln

00:03:33.107 --> 00:03:35.063
is going to interfere with slavery.

00:03:35.063 --> 00:03:37.315
They are afraid that because slavery

00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:39.598
is being outlawed many other places

00:03:39.598 --> 00:03:43.279
in the world, particularly
in the Western Hemisphere,

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:46.630
that, one way or another,
slavery's days are numbered.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.308
And if they're going to
protect their livelihood

00:03:49.308 --> 00:03:52.070
as slave owners and as cotton planters,

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.087
they're going to have
to form their own nation

00:03:54.087 --> 00:03:56.304
to make sure that it's protected.

00:03:56.304 --> 00:03:57.999
- [Voiceover] And James Buchanan

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:00.197
is officially president when
all of this has happened.

00:04:00.197 --> 00:04:02.561
You have seven states
of the United States,

00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:05.286
I guess they're not so
united anymore, leaving.

00:04:05.286 --> 00:04:07.499
Is he just powerless to do anything?

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.702
- [Voiceover] Well, he tries a few things.

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:14.296
He was a very ineffective
president to begin with.

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.115
It's hard to be an effective president

00:04:16.115 --> 00:04:19.383
when Congress is so divided over issues.

00:04:19.383 --> 00:04:21.819
One thing that Congress actually does

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.432
before Lincoln is in office, and before

00:04:24.432 --> 00:04:26.270
these states officially secede,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.736
is they try what's called
the Crittenden Plan,

00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:32.896
proposed by John Crittenden of Kentucky,

00:04:32.896 --> 00:04:35.690
saying we will officially protect

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.884
slavery in the Constitution.

00:04:37.884 --> 00:04:39.904
We will say that you can't outlaw

00:04:39.904 --> 00:04:42.647
slavery in the South, and we'll even

00:04:42.647 --> 00:04:44.207
extend this Missouri Compromise

00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:46.111
line, which was sort of the official line

00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:47.348
between North and South,

00:04:47.348 --> 00:04:50.036
between free states and slave states,

00:04:50.036 --> 00:04:51.351
all the way to the Pacific.

00:04:51.351 --> 00:04:53.489
So, just so you know, Southern states,

00:04:53.489 --> 00:04:55.562
we'll make sure that we
won't get rid of slavery.

00:04:55.562 --> 00:04:57.086
- [Voiceover] So this
Crittenden Compromise,

00:04:57.086 --> 00:04:58.425
this was kind of a last ditch effort.

00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:00.152
Everyone's started to see
the writing on the wall.

00:05:00.152 --> 00:05:01.784
These seven states, especially,

00:05:01.784 --> 00:05:04.088
were very loose-in-the-socket.

00:05:04.088 --> 00:05:05.414
- [Voiceover] And this was a last ditch

00:05:05.414 --> 00:05:09.065
effort to keep them in the Union, perhaps.

00:05:09.065 --> 00:05:10.753
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
and I don't want to say

00:05:10.753 --> 00:05:13.672
it's too little too
late, but for the South,

00:05:13.672 --> 00:05:16.720
they have seen the writing on the wall.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.356
They have seen that this is going

00:05:18.356 --> 00:05:21.014
to be their only opportunity to secede.

00:05:21.014 --> 00:05:22.449
- [Voiceover] Lincoln got elected, and his

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.539
whole party is based
on being anti-slavery.

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:25.561
- [Voiceover] Right.

00:05:25.561 --> 00:05:28.129
So, they want to get out
while the getting is good.

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:29.406
So that they can make sure

00:05:29.406 --> 00:05:31.666
that slavery remains in their states.

00:05:31.666 --> 00:05:34.244
- [Voiceover] All right, so
during this lame duck period,

00:05:34.244 --> 00:05:37.449
the seven states, these Deep
South states, they secede.

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.495
Then Lincoln gets inaugurated.

00:05:39.495 --> 00:05:41.032
He is now president.

00:05:41.032 --> 00:05:43.668
And we're not really in the Civil War yet.

00:05:43.668 --> 00:05:45.328
- [Voiceover] No, in fact, Lincoln's

00:05:45.328 --> 00:05:48.567
inaugural address is very conciliatory.

00:05:50.237 --> 00:05:53.598
We think of Lincoln as
being a really great orator.

00:05:53.598 --> 00:05:57.929
And he certainly was, but
his first inaugural address,

00:05:57.929 --> 00:06:00.499
if you read it, is very much

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.962
a plea to the South,

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:07.053
saying hey, really, I'm not planning

00:06:07.053 --> 00:06:08.989
on outlawing slavery.

00:06:08.989 --> 00:06:11.506
So, the anti-slavery platform that Lincoln

00:06:11.506 --> 00:06:14.099
ascribes to is specifically about

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.746
not extending slavery to the West.

00:06:16.746 --> 00:06:19.483
So he's saying I'm not in favor

00:06:19.483 --> 00:06:22.097
of getting rid of slavery where it is,

00:06:22.097 --> 00:06:25.034
so there's no reason
for you all to secede.

00:06:25.034 --> 00:06:28.769
Come back, everything
will be situation normal.

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:29.972
- [Voiceover] And they don't.

00:06:29.972 --> 00:06:32.666
- [Voiceover] No, as I said,

00:06:32.666 --> 00:06:35.770
they've already seen

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.488
that this is their opportunity

00:06:37.488 --> 00:06:40.367
to make sure that slavery continues,

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:43.026
by creating their own nation.

00:06:43.026 --> 00:06:45.999
So, in the South, there are

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:48.463
a bunch of arsenals

00:06:48.463 --> 00:06:51.689
and forts that belong
to the United States;

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:56.433
and most of these are taken
over by the Confederacy

00:06:56.433 --> 00:06:58.403
when it becomes its own nation.

00:06:58.403 --> 00:06:59.998
- [Voiceover] This is a
picture of one right here.

00:06:59.998 --> 00:07:01.839
This is Sumter.

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.073
- [Voiceover] Right; so Fort Sumter

00:07:03.073 --> 00:07:05.669
is right in Charleston Harbor.

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:08.750
And this is a Union fort,
or a United States fort,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.828
that's holding out, basically.

00:07:10.828 --> 00:07:13.271
They're running out of supplies,

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:15.749
they have tried to have supplies brought

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:18.952
in to them before, which
have been repelled.

00:07:20.101 --> 00:07:21.422
- [Voiceover] They're holding out.

00:07:21.422 --> 00:07:23.960
They're well in Confederate territory,

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.647
but they're still controlled
by United States soldiers.

00:07:28.647 --> 00:07:31.216
- [Voiceover] Right; so, they do not

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:32.900
want to surrender this fort.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.420
Lincoln lets the Confederates, the Rebels,

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:40.929
know that he wants to resupply this fort.

00:07:43.038 --> 00:07:47.276
The Confederates instead
fire on Fort Sumter.

00:07:47.276 --> 00:07:50.861
They start lobbing artillery at it.

00:07:50.861 --> 00:07:55.435
Over the course of a day, they force

00:07:55.435 --> 00:07:59.913
the Union forces in Fort
Sumter to surrender.

00:07:59.913 --> 00:08:02.049
- [Voiceover] I guess this was the real

00:08:02.049 --> 00:08:04.299
matchstick for the war.

00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:05.854
But this wasn't the first tension.

00:08:05.854 --> 00:08:07.414
- [Voiceover] No; obviously this had been

00:08:07.414 --> 00:08:09.850
going on for some time.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:11.548
- [Voiceover] Even in Buchanan's

00:08:11.548 --> 00:08:13.882
lame duck period, there's
probably a little bit of tension.

00:08:13.882 --> 00:08:17.982
- [Voiceover] Yeah, if
you want to be expansive,

00:08:17.982 --> 00:08:20.425
you could say that this
tension is almost built into

00:08:20.425 --> 00:08:22.120
the Constitution when they don't--

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.607
- [Voiceover] (laughs)
- [Voiceover] (laughs)

00:08:23.607 --> 00:08:24.307
secede.

00:08:24.307 --> 00:08:25.428
- [Voiceover] You got that right.

00:08:25.428 --> 00:08:26.678
But especially, even post-secession

00:08:26.678 --> 00:08:28.096
of these first seven states,

00:08:28.096 --> 00:08:30.016
there are already some tensions,

00:08:30.016 --> 00:08:32.410
especially if they're
taking over these forts.

00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.320
Former United States soldiers are now

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.796
thinking about cutting off supplies

00:08:35.796 --> 00:08:39.009
to current United States soldiers.

00:08:39.009 --> 00:08:40.248
And then Fort Sumter, it sounds

00:08:40.248 --> 00:08:42.445
like this was definitely the straw

00:08:42.445 --> 00:08:44.275
that breaks the camel's back, so to speak.

00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:45.392
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
this is the tinder box.

00:08:45.392 --> 00:08:47.032
And I think it's maybe intended

00:08:47.032 --> 00:08:49.025
to be a tinder box on both sides.

00:08:49.025 --> 00:08:51.272
Because Lincoln wants to be sure

00:08:51.272 --> 00:08:53.142
that if there's going to be a war,

00:08:53.142 --> 00:08:55.516
the North isn't going
to fire the first shot.

00:08:55.516 --> 00:08:56.505
They want to make sure

00:08:56.505 --> 00:08:58.110
that this is the South's decision.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.890
It can be blamed on
them if it needs to be.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:02.190
- [Voiceover] This is a pattern you see

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.906
throughout history, is
that no one at least

00:09:04.906 --> 00:09:07.716
wants to, officially, be the
person to fire the first shot.

00:09:07.716 --> 00:09:09.070
They often look for a good reason

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.278
to fire the first shot because

00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:11.588
they want to get into war,

00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:13.747
but everyone wants

00:09:13.747 --> 00:09:14.818
to have the moral high ground.

00:09:14.818 --> 00:09:17.620
- [Voiceover] Right; and in the South,

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.401
they are looking to make sure

00:09:20.401 --> 00:09:23.386
that this is kind of a
morale building moment.

00:09:23.386 --> 00:09:25.824
When they fire on Fort Sumter,

00:09:25.824 --> 00:09:28.984
they're firing on a federal fort, right?

00:09:28.984 --> 00:09:30.069
- [Voiceover] Mm-hmm.

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:31.237
- [Voiceover] In any circumstances,

00:09:31.237 --> 00:09:32.765
that's going to bring on war.

00:09:32.765 --> 00:09:34.706
And they're hoping that if they can

00:09:34.706 --> 00:09:37.763
kind of get this fire started,

00:09:37.763 --> 00:09:39.992
then these four other slaveholding

00:09:39.992 --> 00:09:41.525
states, or actually eight other

00:09:41.525 --> 00:09:43.445
slaveholding states, in the South

00:09:43.445 --> 00:09:46.034
are going to join the effort.

00:09:46.034 --> 00:09:48.315
And that's pretty much
exactly what happens.

00:09:48.315 --> 00:09:50.805
So, after they fire on Fort Sumter,

00:09:50.805 --> 00:09:54.521
the fort is surrendered
to the Confederacy.

00:09:54.521 --> 00:09:57.962
Lincoln says, okay, you want
to start a war, we got a war.

00:09:57.962 --> 00:10:02.549
He calls for 75,000 troops,

00:10:02.549 --> 00:10:05.494
volunteers to put down the insurrection.

00:10:05.494 --> 00:10:08.889
He calls them for a 90-day service period,

00:10:08.889 --> 00:10:10.166
which tells you how long

00:10:10.166 --> 00:10:11.959
they thought this was gonna last.

00:10:11.959 --> 00:10:15.154
After Lincoln has asked for this army,

00:10:15.154 --> 00:10:19.236
four more slaveholding
states in the South secede.

00:10:19.236 --> 00:10:22.402
And that's Virginia, the
most important of these,

00:10:22.402 --> 00:10:25.307
it's gonna be the real
battleground of the Civil War.

00:10:25.307 --> 00:10:28.282
- [Voiceover] Today, we'd
consider that West Virginia

00:10:28.282 --> 00:10:30.515
and Virginia, but that
was Virginia back then.

00:10:30.515 --> 00:10:33.128
- [Voiceover] Right; Virginia, Arkansas,

00:10:33.128 --> 00:10:35.179
Tennessee, and North Carolina

00:10:35.179 --> 00:10:37.875
also join the Confederate
States of America.

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.620
And the war is on.

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.035
- [Voiceover] Fascinating.
