00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for coming today.
I'm pleased to have with us Hugh Raffles this

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.220
afternoon.
Hugh is a professor and Chair of Anthropology

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.720
at The New School.
And he's also the author of In Amazonia: A

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.310
Natural History for which
he received the Victor Turner Prize in Ethnographic

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.670
Writing.
And his work in general addresses human concepts

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.039
of nature and the
relationship between humans, animals, and

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.380
other non-humans.
And his most recent book is Insectopedia,

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.600
which a collection of 26
chapters one for each letter of the alphabet

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.180
in which he considers
insects and our cultural relation to them.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.510
Moving from cricket fighting in China to dances
with bees from insects

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.190
at 15,000 feet to fighting fruit flies.
He's written a very engaging exploration of

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.339
our relationship to the
physical world.

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:51.639
So please join me in welcoming Hugh Raffles.

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:52.639
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:55.260
Hugh Raffles: Thanks.
Thanks very much, Simon.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.619
It's great to be here.
I'm very happy to be inside Google.

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:04.210
It's really an interesting experience and
thank you very much for

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.439
bringing me here.
What I'm going to do is talk a little bit

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.909
about the book, tell you a
little bit about it.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.020
Then I'm going to read some -- a few sections
and then hopefully we'll

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:19.829
have time for some conversation afterwards.
So, um, as Simon said, this is a book about

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.840
 -- a book about insects and
about human relationships to insects.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.750
And it's very wide-ranging.
It covers -- it's historical.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.600
It goes back to the 15th century and before.
There's actually some -- it actually takes

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.179
us back to Aristotle in the
Western tradition.

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.729
But it also is based around -- it also has
quite a bit about field work

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.890
which I've done in different places.
I'm an anthropologist and I like to travel

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.049
and meet people in a whole
range the places.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.340
Then that's represented in the book.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.780
[pause]

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.560
And as I said I'm an anthropologist but I'm
not an entomologist.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.710
And when I started working on the book, I
actually didn't know very

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.170
much about insects at all.
I didn't pay them a lot of attention except

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.479
when they forced their way
into my life as they're inclined to do in

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.091
New York apartments, which is
what I live in.

00:02:04.091 --> 00:02:08.430
And I certainly didn't understand them.
They seemed completely mysterious, apart from

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.069
mosquitoes I didn't
really have much of an idea of even what they

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.040
wanted.
But insects are fascinating.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.760
And they took me over.
The more time I spent studying them, the more

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.599
 -- the more interested I
got in them.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.340
They're powerful; they're dangerous; they're
beautiful; mysterious;

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.720
they're difficult and much more.
And I discovered they're often at the center

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.940
of very fascinating
worlds.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.810
Worlds that wouldn't exist without them.
An insect collector that I met in Tokyo, a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.870
man called Daisaburo Okumoto,
told me that insect lovers are anarchists.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.260
And I think that he meant that he loved these
impossible, unmanageable

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.890
creature because they're impossible and unmanageable
not despite the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.440
fact that they are.
And I learned a lot from spending time with

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.860
people like him who'd
thought deeply about insects and about their

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.920
place in our lives.
Insects live in a completely different world

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.180
from us.
And it's one that we pay very little attention

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.150
to, but if we do start
to look, to listen, and to shift our sense

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.430
of scale, as many of the
people that I write about do, we enter a universe

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.760
that can dramatically
enrich the one that most of us normally occupy.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.810
And that's -- that's the theme that this book
starts with.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.730
It describes how scientists in the 1920s tried
to find out something

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.780
about the lives of insects who were invading
cotton crops in the U.S.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.049
South.
They sent up planes to see if they could -- to

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:30.400
see what they could find
out about insect migration.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.329
And as I'll try to describe in this passage,
they found a lot more than

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:35.329
they bargained for.

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:41.760
[READING]
"There are only a few flies and wasps in that

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.909
first trap at Tallulah,
but over the next five years, the researchers

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:49.379
flew more than 1300
sorties from the Louisiana airstrip and they

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.790
captured tens of thousands
more insects in altitudes ranging from 20

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.700
to 15,000 feet.
They generated a long series of charts and

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.210
tables, cataloging
individual insects as 700-named species, according

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.939
to the height at
which they were collected, the time of day,

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.549
the wind speed and
direction, the temperature, barometric pressure,

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.439
humidity, dew point,
and many other physical variables.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.209
They already knew something about long distance
dispersal.

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.220
They'd heard about butterflies and gnats,
water striders, leaf bugs,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.040
booklice and katydids sighted hundreds of
miles out on the open ocean.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.190
About the aphids that Captain William Perry
had encountered on ice

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.440
flows during his polar expedition of 1828,
and about those other aphids

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.410
that in 1925 made the 800-mile journey cross
the frigid, wind-swept

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.380
Bering Sea in just 24 hours.
Still, they were taken aback by the enormous

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.600
quantities of animals they
were discovering in the air above Louisiana

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.750
and unashamedly astonished
by the heights at which they found them.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.080
All of a sudden, it seems, the heavens had
opened.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.320
They estimated that at any given time of day
on any given day

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.670
throughout the year, the air column rising
from 50 to 14,000 feet above

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:02.330
one square mile of Louisiana countryside contained
an average of 25

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:06.640
million insects and perhaps as many as 36
million.

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.920
They found ladybugs at 6,000 feet during the
daytime; striped cucumber

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.690
beetles at 3,000 feet during the night.
They collected 3 scorpion flies at 5,000 feet;

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.410
31 fruit flies between
200 and 3,000; a fungus gnat at 7,000 feet,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.510
another at 10,000.
They trapped an anthrax-transmitting horsefly

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.170
at 200 feet and another
at 1,000.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.150
They caught wingless worker ants as high as
4,000 feet.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.310
And 16 species of parasitic wasps at altitudes
of up to 5,000 feet.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.310
At 15,000 feet, probably the highest elevation
at which any specimen

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.090
has ever been taken above the surface of the
earth, they wrote, they

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.310
trapped a ballooning spider.
A feat that reminded them that spiders are

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.930
thought to have navigated
the globe on the trade winds and led one of

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.490
them to write that the
younger-most spiders are more or less addicted

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.870
to this mode of
transportation.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.740
An image of excited little animals packing
their luggage that opened a

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.970
small eruption on the consensus around the
passivity of all this

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.120
airborne movement.
And led to a subsequent observation that ballooning

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:10.690
spiders not only
climb up to an exposed site -- a tree, twig,

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:14.810
or flower, for instance,
stand on tiptoe, raise their abdomen, test

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.190
the atmosphere, throw out
silk filaments and launch themselves into

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:22.420
a balloon or free, like
spread eagle, but that they also use their

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.610
bodies and their silk to
control their decent and the location of their

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.860
landing.
36 million little animals flying unseen above

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.050
one square mile of
countryside.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:36.130
The heavens opened.
The air column was a vault of insect-laden

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:42.070
air from which fell a
continuous rain.

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:47.430
So stop, if you're inside, go to a window,
throw it open and turn your

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.820
face to the sky.
All that empty space, the deep vastness of

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:56.210
the air, the heavens wide
above you, the sky is full of insects and

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:57.750
all of them are going
somewhere.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.450
Every day above and around us, their collective
voyage of billions of

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.220
beings."
Well, that's -- that's sense of -- sort of

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:11.140
sense of mystery about there
being worlds around us that we're not -- that

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.500
we're not at all familiar
with is one of the themes that continues through

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.030
the book.
But quite a lot of the book, as I said, is

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.000
based field research that
I've done in various places.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.970
And I spent a few of the most enjoyable weeks
that I had in writing in

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.800
book in Shanghai.
And one of my chapters -- one of the chapters

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.520
in here is about people
there who train and fight crickets and people

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.680
who have a deep knowledge
about crickets.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.050
Cricket fighting in China has a history that
goes back nearly a

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.620
thousand years and I go on to some detail
about this in the book.

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.930
And the part that I want to read you describes
some of what I learned

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.860
from a very experienced cricket trainer that
I met there, a man called

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.860
Master Fung, who was the director of a cricket
museum in Qi Bao which

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:58.330
is a suburb of Shanghai.
[Reading]

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.940
"All these crickets were collected here in
Qi Bao, says Master Fung.

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:06.050
Standing behind a table laden with hundreds
of great clay pots, each

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.550
containing one fighting male, and in some
cases, its female sex

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.150
partner.
Qi Bao's crickets are famous throughout East

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.910
Asia, he tells us, a
product of the township's rich soil.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.840
But since the fields here were built on in
the year 2000, crickets have

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.770
been harder to find.
Master Fung's two white-uniformed assistants

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.630
fill the insect's
miniature water bottles with pipettes and

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.810
we humans all drink
pleasantly a stringent tea made from his recipe

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.329
of seven medicinal
herbs.

00:08:34.329 --> 00:08:37.189
Master Fung's considerable presence, the prim
of his white canvas hat

00:08:37.189 --> 00:08:40.969
rakishly angled, his jade pendant and rings,
his intense gaze, his

00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:45.740
animated storytelling, his throaty laugh.
Michael, my translator, and I are drawn to

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.649
him immediately and hang on
his words.

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:52.149
Master Fung is a cricket master, confides
his assistant Miss Jao.

00:08:52.149 --> 00:08:55.910
He has 40-years' experience.
There is no one more [INAUDIBLE, knowledgeable

00:08:55.910 --> 00:09:01.269
about] crickets.
Twenty years ago, everyone tells us, before

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:04.840
the construction of the New
Shanghai gobbled up the landscape, in a time

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:08.410
when city neighborhoods
were patchworks of fields and houses, people

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.970
lived more intimately with
animal life.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:15.481
Many found companionship in cicadas or other
musical insects that they

00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:21.379
kept in bamboo cages and slim pocket boxes.
And young people, not just the middle-aged,

00:09:21.379 --> 00:09:26.360
played crickets, learning
how to recognize the three races and 72 personalities,

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.069
how to judge a
likely champion, how to train the fighters

00:09:29.069 --> 00:09:32.360
to their fullest potential.
How to use the pencil-thin brushes made of

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.170
yard grass or mouse whisker
to stimulate the insects jaws and provoke

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:40.079
them to combat.
They learned the rudiments of the three rudiments

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:44.300
around which every
cricket manual is structured: Judging, training,

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.540
and fighting.
When Master Fung and other experts tried to

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:52.019
instruct me in the
distinctions that allow them to judge a cricket's

00:09:52.019 --> 00:09:56.230
fighting potential,
they use a taxonomy that first appeared in

00:09:56.230 --> 00:10:01.080
Jia Shi-Dao's Book of Crickets,
a 900-year old manual of training and raising

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:06.220
crickets that's been
modified and supplemented but not overthrown

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:11.740
across the centuries.
The book outlines the fiercely complex system

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:14.490
for classifying crickets.
It brings request body color.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.990
Jia identifies and ranks four colors: Yellow,
red, black, and white.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:25.350
By contrast, most cricket experts I talked
to in Shanghai describe only

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.829
three colors: Yellow, green, and purple.
Yellow crickets are reputed to be the most

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:34.790
aggressive of the three but
not necessarily the best fighters, because

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.740
green insects, though
quieter, are more strategic and according

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:41.930
to the annual illustrated
list of cricket champions include a greater

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:46.920
number of generals.
Color is the first criterion by which crickets

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.839
are divided and it
confers an initial identity, that is held

00:10:50.839 --> 00:10:54.649
to correspond to differences
in behavior and character.

00:10:54.649 --> 00:10:57.680
Below these gross distinctions, however, is
the further set of division

00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:03.810
into individual personalities whose total
number is often put at 72.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.560
Below that, classification is based on an
agglomeration of numerous

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:12.350
physical variables, complex clusters of characters,
length, shape, and

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.009
color of the insect's legs and abdomen and
wings are all systematically

00:11:16.009 --> 00:11:21.220
passed, as is the shape of the head.
Current manuals might include seven or more

00:11:21.220 --> 00:11:26.509
possibilities and
differences in number, shape, color, and width

00:11:26.509 --> 00:11:29.540
of the fight lines that
run from front to back across the crown.

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:35.290
Experts -- experts also consider the energy
of the antennae, the shape

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.579
and color of the animal's eyebrows, which
should be opposite in color

00:11:38.579 --> 00:11:42.259
to the antennae.
The shape, color, translucence, and strength

00:11:42.259 --> 00:11:46.569
of the jaws, the shape and
size of the neck plate, the shape and resting

00:11:46.569 --> 00:11:50.920
angle of the forewings.
The sharpness of the tail tips, the hair on

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.629
the abdomen, the width of
the thorax and face, the thickness of the

00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:58.670
feet and the animal's overall
posture.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:02.160
The insect's skin must be dry, that is, it
must reflect light from

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:07.720
inside itself not from the surface.
It must also be delicate, like a baby's.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:12.180
The cricket's walk must be swift and easy.
It should not have a rolling gait.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.589
In general, strength is more important than
size.

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:22.209
The quality of the jaw is decisive.
Master Fung tells us that the trainer's task

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:26.010
is build on preexisting
natural virtues, to develop the animal's fighting

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.779
spirit.
This indispensable quality is revealed only

00:12:29.779 --> 00:12:31.519
at the moment the insect
enters the arena.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:35.540
Though a cricket might look like a champion
in all respects, though the

00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:39.180
judgment of its physical qualities may be
correct, it can still turn

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:44.399
out to lack spirit in competition.
This, he insists, is less a matter of individual

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:47.949
cricket's character
than a function of its care.

00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:50.200
It's the task of the trainer to buildup the
cricket's strength with

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:54.740
foods appropriate to its growth and individual
needs, to respond to its

00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.889
sicknesses, develop its physical skills, cultivate
its virtues,

00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:01.600
overcome its natural aversion to light, and
habituate it to new, alien

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.800
surroundings.
Fundamentally, says Master Fung, a trainer

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.040
must create the conditions
in which the insect can be happy.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.809
A cricket knows when it is loved and it knows
when it's well cared for.

00:13:12.809 --> 00:13:17.339
And it responds in kind with loyalty, courage,
obedience, and the signs

00:13:17.339 --> 00:13:22.579
of quiet contentment.
In practical terms, this as quid pro quo,

00:13:22.579 --> 00:13:26.709
because a happy cricket is
amenable to training and as its health, skill,

00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:30.170
and confidence increase
under the trainer's care, so too does its

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:35.420
fighting spirit.
And as he was explaining all this, describing

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.180
the sexual regiment he
provides, outlining the many symptoms of ill-health

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.660
that one must be
alert to, displaying the purified water, the

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.759
home-cooked foods, the
various parts, explaining that everything

00:13:46.759 --> 00:13:51.170
relies on communication and
that the yard grass is the bridge between

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:54.519
him and the insect, that in
other words, they understand each other in

00:13:54.519 --> 00:13:58.759
a language beyond language.
Master Fung removed the lid from one of his

00:13:58.759 --> 00:14:02.319
pots and in an emphatic
response to my increasingly unimaginative

00:14:02.319 --> 00:14:06.061
line of questioning, took his
yard grass straw and barked orders at the

00:14:06.061 --> 00:14:09.019
cricket as if it as soldier
-- this way, that way.

00:14:09.019 --> 00:14:14.019
This way, that way.
And the insect, to Michael's and my real astonishment,

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:17.709
responded
unhesitatingly turning left, right, left,

00:14:17.709 --> 00:14:21.329
right.
A routine of exercises that Master Fung eventually

00:14:21.329 --> 00:14:25.050
explained increases
the fighter's flexibility, makes him limber

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:29.199
and elastic, and shows that
man and insect understand each other through

00:14:29.199 --> 00:14:33.430
the language of command as
well as beyond it."

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:41.540
So a significant part of the book is -- involves,
um, as I said,

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:48.939
involves fieldwork in various places.
But an equally large part of the book is involved

00:14:48.939 --> 00:14:52.399
with trying to think
through the ways that we -- the ways that

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:56.619
humans think about insects
and the ways that insects enter our lives

00:14:56.619 --> 00:15:01.449
and enter our psyches in both
positive and negative ways.

00:15:01.449 --> 00:15:04.379
And one thing that struck me throughout working
on the book was how

00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:08.119
intense are the feelings that we have about
and around them.

00:15:08.119 --> 00:15:10.610
And as I said, many of these feelings are
positive: The beauty of

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:14.369
butterflies, the wonder of fireflies, the
sweet nostalgia that can

00:15:14.369 --> 00:15:18.680
overwhelm us with the sound of crickets or
cicadas but many are

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.999
negative.
And after I'd written a chapter about how

00:15:22.999 --> 00:15:26.480
amazing bees are,
particularly honeybees, I wrote this chapter,

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.649
which is a short chapter
I want to read to you which is called My Nightmares.

00:15:29.649 --> 00:15:40.509
[Reading]
"For a long time, I thought only of bees.

00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:44.829
They crowded out all the others and this book
became just for them.

00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:49.540
A book of bees and all their bee-ness.
All the physical capacities, all the behavioral

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.679
subtleties, all the
organizational mysteries, all the comradeship,

00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:57.470
all that golden beeswax
lighting up the ancient world, all that honey

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:01.619
sweetening Medieval
Europe, all those bees timeless templates

00:16:01.619 --> 00:16:04.860
for the most diverse human
projects and ideologies.

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:10.929
Bees took over.
But then a plague of winged ants invaded my

00:16:10.929 --> 00:16:14.089
living room.
And after they left, I began thinking of locusts

00:16:14.089 --> 00:16:16.699
and then beetles, all
those beetles.

00:16:16.699 --> 00:16:19.899
And then caddis flies, and crane flies, and
vinegar flies, and

00:16:19.899 --> 00:16:24.279
botflies, and dragonflies, and mayflies, and
houseflies, and so many

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:28.399
other flies.
Then one thing led to another and I came across

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:31.939
field crickets and Mole
crickets and Jerusalem crickets.

00:16:31.939 --> 00:16:35.790
And then my friend Jessie sent me a Weta from
New Zealand and then

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:40.139
the 17-year cicadas emerged in Ohio.
And I discovered the thrips and katydids,

00:16:40.139 --> 00:16:43.449
remembered the aphids on
California roses, and the summer wasps drowning

00:16:43.449 --> 00:16:45.290
in water-filled jam
jars.

00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:49.889
And then termites and hornets and earwigs
and scorpions and ladybugs

00:16:49.889 --> 00:16:54.970
and praying mantises all dry in packets in
garden supply stores.

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:57.019
And then there were the mosquitoes with long
legs and the mosquitoes

00:16:57.019 --> 00:17:01.319
with short legs and far too many butterflies
and moths of all kinds.

00:17:01.319 --> 00:17:05.360
And I remembered what we already know, that
insects are without number

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.130
and without end.
That in comparison we are no more than dust.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:14.120
And that this is not the worst of it.
There's the nightmare of the fecundity and

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.570
the nightmare of the
multitude.

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:18.459
There's the nightmare of uncontrolled bodies,
and the nightmare of

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:22.950
inside our bodies and all over our bodies.
There's the nightmare of unguarded orifices

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.220
and the nightmare of
vulnerable places.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.030
There's the nightmare of foreign bodies in
our bloodstream and the

00:17:28.030 --> 00:17:30.790
nightmare of foreign bodies in our ears and
our eyes and under the

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.651
surface of our skin.
There's the nightmare swarming and the nightmare

00:17:34.651 --> 00:17:37.550
of crawling.
There's the nightmare of burrowing and the

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.470
nightmare of being seen in
the dark.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.190
There's the nightmare of turning the overhead
light on just as the

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:45.640
carpet scatters.
There's the nightmare of beings without reason

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.180
and the nightmare of
being unable to communicate.

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:51.810
There's the nightmare of their being out to
get us.

00:17:51.810 --> 00:17:54.670
There's the nightmare of knowing, and the
nightmare of non-recognition.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:59.090
The nightmare of not seeing the face.
There's the nightmare of not having a face.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:04.950
There's the nightmare of too many limbs.
There's the nightmare of all this plus invisibility.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.900
There's the nightmare of being submerged and
the nightmare of being

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.570
overrun.
There's the nightmare of being invaded and

00:18:09.570 --> 00:18:11.520
the nightmare of being
alone.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:14.530
There's the nightmare of numbers, big and
small.

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:16.520
There's the nightmare of metamorphosis and
the nightmare of

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.680
persistence.
There's the nightmare of wetness and the nightmare

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.070
of dryness.
There's the nightmare of poison and the nightmare

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:25.920
of paralysis.
There's the nightmare of putting the shoe

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.610
on and of taking the shoe
off.

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:32.200
There's the slithering nightmare and the one
that walks backwards.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.090
There's the squirming nightmare and the squishing
nightmare.

00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:40.210
There's the nightmare of the unwelcome surprise.
There's the nightmare of the gigantic and

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.790
the nightmare of becoming.
There's the nightmare of being trapped in

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.540
the body of another with no
way out and no way back.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:48.980
There's the nightmare of abandonment.
And the nightmare of social death.

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.690
There's the nightmare of rejection.
There's the nightmare of the grotesque.

00:18:51.690 --> 00:18:55.760
There's the nightmare of real quick flight
and the nightmare of

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.300
classroom wings, there's the nightmare of
untangled hair.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:02.140
And the nightmare of the open mouth.
There's the nightmare of long, probing antennae

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:06.620
emerging from the
overflow hole in the bathroom sink or worse

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.990
the rim of the toilet.
There's the nightmare of huge blank eyes.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:13.020
There's the nightmare of randomness in the
unguarded moment.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:15.870
There's the nightmare of sitting down, the
nightmare of rolling over,

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:19.630
the nightmare of standing up.
There's the nightmare of the military that

00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:22.580
funds nearly all basic
research in insect science.

00:19:22.580 --> 00:19:25.670
The nightmare of probes into brains and razors
into eyes.

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.450
The nightmare that if any of this should reveal
the secrets of locusts

00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:31.980
swarming, of bees navigating or of ants foraging,
the seekers will

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:35.660
beget other seekers, the nightmares other
nightmare, the pupae other

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.160
pupae, insects born of micro implants, part-machine,
part-insect

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.430
insects.
Remote-controlled, weaponized, surveillance

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.050
insects.
Moths on a mission; beetles undercover.

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:51.090
Not to mention robotic insects mass produced,
mass deployed, mass

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:55.630
suicide nightmare insects.
These are the nightmares that dream of coming

00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:59.400
wars, of insect wars
without vulnerable central commands, forming

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:03.750
and dispersing congealing
and dissolving, de-centered, networked of

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:08.450
net war of network-centric
warfare, of no casualty wars, at least on

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:12.160
our team.
Dreams of Osama bin Laden somewhere in a cave.

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:15.700
These are the nightmares of invisible terrorists,
swarming without

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.550
number, invading intimate places and unguarded
moments.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.770
The nightmares of our age.
Nightmares of emergence, of a hive of evil,

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.000
a brood of bad people, a
super organism beyond individuals swarming

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.340
on their own initiative,
homing info on scattered locations on various

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.620
targets and then
dispersing only to form new swarms.

00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:38.040
The nightmare of language, the language of
bees, nightmare begets

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:42.730
nightmare, dreams beget dreams, terror begets
terror.

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:48.750
Where are the bees now?
Collapsing in their colonies, gliding through

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:52.160
their plastic mazes,
sniffing out explosives, sucking out that

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.170
sugar water, getting fat and
weak on corn syrup, locked in little boxes

00:20:56.170 --> 00:20:58.340
at airports, sticking out
their tongues on cue.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:02.500
Who knew the tiny critters are so smart, said
the journalist.

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:07.320
Fuzzy little sniffers.
Buzz, buzz, buzz, keeping us safe, helping

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.411
us sleep easy at night."
Thank you.

00:21:10.411 --> 00:21:11.411
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:23.490
So I'm happy to take any kinds of comments
or any kind of -- any kind

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:24.490
of conversation at all.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.490
[PAUSE]

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:26.490
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:49.250
&gt;&gt; So if I go to Shanghai, can I go to a cricket-fighting
arena?

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.250
Hugh Raffles: Could you say that again?

00:21:50.250 --> 00:21:53.620
&gt;&gt; If I were to go to Shanghai, could I go
to cricket battle arena and

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:54.970
wager on some crickets?

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.790
Hugh Raffles: If you went to Shanghai, could
you go to a cricket fight

00:21:57.790 --> 00:22:02.350
and bet on it?
If you knew the right people you could.

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:04.100
&gt;&gt; It is illegal like dog fighting?

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.940
Hugh Raffles: Yeah, you know, gambling is
illegal.

00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:11.820
So it's hard to go to a fight in which there's
gambling.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.440
But people might take you if you know people
who do that.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.620
But there are -- there is other cricket fighting.
There's some -- there's cricket fighting which

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:23.580
involves gambling but
people are also trying to promote cricket

00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:29.190
fighting without gambling
more as exhibition matches or to demonstrate

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:32.042
this sort of cultural
sophistication of it which, you know, as you

00:22:32.042 --> 00:22:36.420
can I hope from what I
read, it's a very developed, very -- it's

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.570
very elaborate knowledge
which is, and deep knowledge, which is connected

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:43.190
with it.
And so there are a lot of people who are trying

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.730
to encourage,
particularly encourage young people, to be

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:50.590
interested in that.
And to develop -- to develop their skills

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:53.950
in judging cricket -- and
judging crickets and raising them and training

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:58.280
them in a -- sort of in
a format which is the separate from the gambling

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.920
culture which has been
associated with it actually right from the

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.612
beginning.
I'm not sure how successful they're going

00:23:03.612 --> 00:23:06.691
to be at doing that but
they're quite serious about doing it.

00:23:06.691 --> 00:23:11.200
And it means that it's quite easy either to
see exhibition matches of

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:14.990
that kind or else you can go to markets, open
air markets, where people

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.710
sell crickets.
And people go, you know obviously people are

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:21.940
there buying crickets and
you can see crickets in that context.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:27.880
And people have -- people have put on cricket
fights there where

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:31.750
they're just trying to show the strength of
the crickets that they're

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.810
selling.
So, um, there's sort of like displaying those

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:36.170
crickets.
As you can imagine, that's kind of a risk

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.150
because if the cricket loses,
then, you know, its value is going to go down.

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:42.190
So there's a bit of a risk involved in that.

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:45.780
&gt;&gt; Are the crickets also used for agricultural
purposes or things

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:46.780
besides fighting?

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:50.260
Hugh Raffles: Not that I know of and not those
crickets.

00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:55.100
I think these crickets specifically are crickets
that are -- that

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.780
people train for fighting.
But there might be, it might be just something

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.220
that I don't know about.
Yeah.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:02.220
Thank you.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:09.640
[PAUSE]

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.250
&gt;&gt; What do you think we could tell the chefs
at Google to encourage

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.280
them to serve more insects?
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.290
Hugh Raffles: So what could the chefs at Google
learn?

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:21.200
Um, well you know, what can I say?
I'm vegan.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.630
So personally, I don't think -- we should
be telling them how to cook

00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:26.080
vegetables.
From what I can tell, they do that pretty

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.490
well already.
Yeah, quite a lot of people eat insects either

00:24:30.490 --> 00:24:36.010
as some -- either as a
special food and like a luxury food, those

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:42.100
are the people who I met.
People in Asia who collect grasshoppers and

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.460
they eat them and sell
them.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:50.160
But -- but generally, generally I've come
through reading this book --

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:53.781
reading this book -- from writing this book
to really like insects and

00:24:53.781 --> 00:24:56.220
include them in the list of thing -- I wasn't
really planning on eating

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:59.210
them anyway but now I really included them
in the list of foods that I

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:00.541
don't eat.
Thank you.

00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:06.180
&gt;&gt; Question from VC.
From San Francisco.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:14.040
Hi there, thanks for coming.
So just curious, when people talk about the

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.140
insect worlds, they often
talk about them as almost alien because things

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.660
can just be so different
at that level.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.030
Can you talk about maybe the most surprising
or interesting or

00:25:25.030 --> 00:25:30.060
unbelievable thing you've learned about any
particular insect in your

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:32.660
journey researching this book?

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:36.660
Hugh Raffles: Actually about the insect rather
than the relationship

00:25:36.660 --> 00:25:41.470
of the insect with a person?
I think actually the part that I read you

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:45.380
that you have spiders and --
we can call them insects for now, but the

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:50.650
spiders that actually will --
and these are flightless spiders, obviously

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:55.980
 -- that will or that have
circumnavigated the globe on the air currents

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.990
that to me was one of the
most amazing things.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:03.580
And in general that there are -- that large
numbers of insects are

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:07.110
constantly traveling in the upper -- well,
I don't know if it's the

00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:09.250
upper regions the earth's atmosphere, but
say between -- it's not.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.970
But say between 5 and 15,000 feet, you have
these large numbers of

00:26:12.970 --> 00:26:19.970
insects that are traveling in the air constantly.
And that they're doing it not -- not in any

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:23.680
sort of passive way, but --
on a certain extent, I guess some of them

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:24.800
would be doing it in a
passive way.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:27.170
But there's a lot of them who are doing it
in really quite an active

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:31.810
way.
There are -- they're leaving a place because

00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:34.550
they want to leave it,
they want to find a better habitat or they

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:39.870
want to find more resources.
And they get themselves taken up by the air,

00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:42.590
going into the air
currents, and then they can bring themselves

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:46.240
down at a certain point or
they have ways of getting themselves down

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:51.030
to the ground at a certain
point, and that to me was pretty mind blowing.

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:58.760
The invisibility of that.
And yet, yet its existence as a widespread

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:03.330
phenomenon.
In general, the -- it's something that continues

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:06.700
to fascinate me from
doing this book is just the, maybe the obvious

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:11.580
 -- the obvious thought
that insects live in an entirely different

00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:14.450
world from us.
Their senses are completely different.

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:19.320
There's probably a lot more synesthesia going
on, combination of senses

00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:25.500
than we have.
And they're obviously much more sophisticated

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:27.570
and much more sensitive
to touch, say.

00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.790
And they see in very, very different ways
from us.

00:27:31.790 --> 00:27:37.600
So it's not so -- after awhile of doing this,
I've come to think that

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.640
it's not just that they experience the world
in a different way but the

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.880
world that they move in is actually an entirely
different world from

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:46.860
the one that we live in.
So we tend to think of the world that we live

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.320
in as being the world
because we experience it in a certain way

00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.260
and we assume that it has
this objective reality that is the world.

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.900
But to -- to animals who live in a completely
different set, completely

00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.650
different time space, have a completely different
 -- sense of time from

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:05.750
us, completely different sense of space, and
whose relationship with

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:08.450
the world is entirely different, they are
actually for all intents and

00:28:08.450 --> 00:28:10.810
purposes, living in a completely different
world.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:14.480
And our paths interact, you know, and we meet
each other in all kinds

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.070
of circumstances, obviously, but we're meeting
across, almost like

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:22.680
across dimensions.
We're living simultaneously in entirely different

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:28.680
environments.
The things that we touch and the forces which

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:31.990
we're subjected to are
really entirely different to these, to these

00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:35.561
other beings.
And we are also obviously completely different

00:28:35.561 --> 00:28:39.870
to them we -- to a house
fly, we move at the glacial pace which is

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.630
which why it is so difficult
for us ever to swat one.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:47.600
They see us in completely different ways and
they sense the air in a

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.910
very different way.
So that is me which this sort of I guess ontological

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.590
differences have
been things which I've been thinking a lot

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:58.250
about in writing this book
and trying to get to grips with in some way.

00:28:58.250 --> 00:29:00.120
[PAUSE]

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:09.490
&gt;&gt; So I have a question.
So when you look at ants and stuff, they look

00:29:09.490 --> 00:29:12.330
like they're not
individuals -- they're not like part of one

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:17.900
body like blood cells, like
not every ant has a mind of its own but the

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:24.110
whole colony has a mind.
And do you think some kind of different dimension

00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:27.840
like you mentioned
that ants actually the whole organism is a

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.740
single organism instead of
each individual as a --

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:35.300
Hugh Raffles: Yeah, what the -- so, thinking
about ants, say, as super

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:37.890
organisms that -- so rather than working as
individuals but

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.760
collectively, they produce some kind of intelligence
collectively

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:44.960
rather than individually, yeah.
And a lot of people do think -- do think this

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.900
is the case that some of
these animals really operate on quite simple

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:52.870
algorithms individually
but when you put them together, then there's

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:58.280
 -- there's some sort of
synergy that produces some greater intelligence

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:01.820
 -- intelligence that is
greater than any individual that there's something

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.130
 -- and people
working in artificial intelligence have worked

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:07.060
along these principles
in making -- and people work making robots,

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:14.730
for instance.
I'm -- well, one -- let me give you one example

00:30:14.730 --> 00:30:19.870
of this that I find
kind of interesting which is work that a sound

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:25.880
artist called David Dunn
has done with -- he's -- he's recorded, a

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:31.220
few years ago, he recorded
the sounds of insects in ponds.

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.030
And so a community of water insects inside
a pond.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:36.760
And at first, when you listen to his recording
and I guess I should say

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.440
that first of all, I don't think anybody else
had ever done this before

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:43.220
which seems surprising.
But people have -- there's a very limited

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.840
set of insects that people
have actually done research on and very little

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:50.230
research has been done
on insect sound communication, even on insect

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:54.110
hearing.
Because he's a sound artist obviously this

00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:55.610
is what he's been interested
in.

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.850
So he's recorded the sound of insects in ponds
and when you listen to

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:05.070
it, at first -- at first you hear really a
lot of -- a lot of sort of

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:11.230
unconnected, disparate kind of noises or sounds.
A lot of clicking and a lot of buzzing this

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.250
sort of thing, whirring,
things that sound like static.

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.550
And after time as it builds up and it's probably
the way he's put the

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.840
recording together , but as it builds up , you
start to hear this very,

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:27.700
very complex -- very complex sort of polyrhythmic,
polyrhythmic sounds

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.020
emerging.
And that you get a sense -- this sense of

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:36.320
a very dense activity going
on.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:41.340
Now, as a musician, he interprets that as
this very high level of

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:45.570
communication that's happening.
He -- what he hears and it is -- he hears

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:49.620
the rhythms in it, he hears
this complex rhythmic activity going on, and

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:54.300
he hears some insects
responding to other insects.

00:31:54.300 --> 00:32:00.180
And he thinks of the pond itself as producing
some kind of -- or other

00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.060
community within the pond as producing some
sort of communicative

00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:11.360
intelligence which is happening within that.
You know, this, of course, is very speculative.

00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:14.480
I'm -- you know, having done this research,
I'm very sympathetic to

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.370
these ideas.
The part of it that makes me pause a little

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:21.020
is the assumption that's
often in there that individually these insects

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.810
aren't particularly
interesting or these beings aren't particularly

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:26.560
interesting, it's only
when they get together that something significant

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.850
emerges out of the
collective.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:31.090
So I like the idea that something significant
emerges out of the

00:32:31.090 --> 00:32:35.450
collective, but I'm less convinced that individually
there's nothing

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:38.500
going on.
And that they only have -- they only have

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.240
any significance when you put
them together.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:46.660
But there's -- there's certainly ways that
insects -- I guess we're

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:51.610
talking about social insects here in general.
Well, actually, I'll get back to that.

00:32:51.610 --> 00:32:55.210
But in terms of social insects that collectively,
they're able to

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:59.930
produce phenomenal things.
If you think of termite mounds or ants' nests

00:32:59.930 --> 00:33:04.340
or the kinds of decision
making processes that bees are able to go

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:09.200
through -- there is --
there's the ability to cooperate to produce

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:13.070
remarkable collective,
collective efforts.

00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:15.510
And there's just collective achievements that
they're able to do.

00:33:15.510 --> 00:33:18.990
And they're able to do it in general, say
within an individual hive or

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:23.270
an individual nest in a very cooperative way.
I mean generally they're able to reach consensus

00:33:23.270 --> 00:33:28.900
after what appears to
be a process of debate and discussion.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:34.260
But it seems also that there's a lot of communication
that goes on

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.260
between insects of different species either
communication that is to

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:44.170
warn other insects off and to, you know, sort
of defensive kinds of

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.271
communication.
Or there's also kinds of communication that

00:33:46.271 --> 00:33:50.420
goes on to coordinate
behavior amongst species.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:54.990
And the communications [INAUDIBLE] on through
vibration, through chemical

00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:59.990
connections, all kinds of things.
And it's been a scenario which there's been

00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:01.950
very little research, I
think.

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:06.310
But the parts fit -- that I've become quite
interested lately are the

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:10.730
ones that people, ones that have investigated
by people who haven't

00:34:10.730 --> 00:34:16.480
had -- haven't had biological training so
much but have -- have brought

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.349
ideas.
I mean particularly like David Dunn, who brought

00:34:18.349 --> 00:34:21.539
ideas from a different
domain, you know, as a musician.

00:34:21.539 --> 00:34:24.650
And he started to see -- started to see forms
of communication that

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:29.359
have not been visible to insect scientists
who've been really caught up

00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:34.419
in chemical communication and looking at chemical
cues from pheromones,

00:34:34.419 --> 00:34:37.589
allomones and these kinds of things.
Cheromones.

00:34:37.589 --> 00:34:40.559
That's really dominated the study of insect
communication for the last

00:34:40.559 --> 00:34:46.269
30 or 40 years probably.
And so it's interesting to me that people

00:34:46.269 --> 00:34:48.860
who come with very, very
different training, very, very different way

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:52.571
of thinking about it
they've started to be able to find new kinds,

00:34:52.571 --> 00:34:56.319
new kinds of interactions
that have just been outside the paradigm of

00:34:56.319 --> 00:35:01.740
investigation for the
last -- for the last period, anyway.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.720
Yeah.
Thank you.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:10.369
&gt;&gt; I know you spent quite a bit of time in
the tropics when you were

00:35:10.369 --> 00:35:13.770
writing an earlier book Amazonia and I was
wondering if you have

00:35:13.770 --> 00:35:17.599
impressions from the your memories there about
whether there's a

00:35:17.599 --> 00:35:21.549
different place in the world that insects
have in the tropics than in

00:35:21.549 --> 00:35:24.401
where we live in the temperate zone and whether
the relationships

00:35:24.401 --> 00:35:28.770
between human and insects seem markedly different
thinking back on it

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:29.770
in that way.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:32.150
Hugh Raffles: Yeah, that's a great question,
thank you.

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:36.089
He's asking whether or not in -- the first
research that I did was in

00:35:36.089 --> 00:35:39.480
Amazonia, in a small community at the mouth
of the Amazon.

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.460
And he's asking whether or not there's a different
kind of relationship

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.910
that people with have insects there than you
would find -- you would

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:52.670
find here and, um, in the tropics in general.
Well, one thing -- one thing that I've been

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:58.170
thinking about recently in
that respect -- is that I'm not sure whether

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:02.240
this answers the question
in the way that you'd want -- but people,

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.059
you know, I've been struck by
as I've been going around and talking to people

00:36:07.059 --> 00:36:11.130
about this book, that
one of the topics that comes again and again

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:14.690
is people's revulsion to
certain kind of insects, particularly to cockroaches.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:19.950
And people talk a lot about their instantaneous
 -- instantaneous

00:36:19.950 --> 00:36:22.609
reactions to just sort of lash out and crush
a roach.

00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:27.220
And I think this happens in -- I mean, I come
here from New York, but I

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.940
think it happens in California, too, but,
you know, there's this sort

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:34.819
of immediate response.
And part of that I -- I think is because of

00:36:34.819 --> 00:36:37.640
the ways in which we
control, control our living space and our

00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.460
determination to keep it as
free from -- as free from the kinds of beings

00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:45.250
that we don't want in
there as possible and just sort to manage

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:50.569
it in this very strict ways.
And when I was -- when I spent time in the

00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:53.940
Amazon, people had very
different relationship s, well, I'll say to

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:56.680
cockroaches, particularly
but to things coming into their living space

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.819
in general.
I mean unless they were animals which were

00:36:59.819 --> 00:37:04.240
actually going to cause them
personal, personal pain or other kinds of

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.299
problems, they really weren't
too bothered by them.

00:37:06.299 --> 00:37:09.230
And also when I was living there, I wasn't
bothered by them either.

00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:11.809
And partly that has to with the architecture
of the spaces.

00:37:11.809 --> 00:37:15.500
Space are much more open and they're much
more open to the elements as

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:21.690
well, at least the ones that I was in.
So -- and people aren't trying to control

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.470
what goes in and out in the
same kind of way.

00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:26.681
So, you know, if there was snakes came in
the house, you know,

00:37:26.681 --> 00:37:28.700
poisonous snakes, people were really bothered
by that.

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:32.500
When vampire bats came in the house at night,
people got very, very

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:35.680
worked up about that, which was I was kind
of grateful for.

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.420
And, you know, when there's mosquitoes at
certain times of the year,

00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.580
when you have like clouds of mosquitoes and
you can't even sit still

00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:46.390
because they're just biting you so badly,
then people took, you know,

00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:50.559
as much action as they could against them.
And what we would do is set smoke off, going

00:37:50.559 --> 00:37:55.880
in their houses to just
try to get rid of them, which actually was

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.460
almost as uncomfortable as
the mosquitoes themselves, right?

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.940
But roaches and things like that?
You know, they don't really do us any harm,

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.859
so nobody really was very
bothered by them.

00:38:03.859 --> 00:38:07.519
They just scuttled around and everybody just
ignored them.

00:38:07.519 --> 00:38:11.309
And so this is -- you know, I feel very strongly
this is a cultural

00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:15.040
reaction that we have to them.
It's not something that's hardwired as many

00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:18.089
people argue because of the
shape of them and the way they move and stuff

00:38:18.089 --> 00:38:19.770
like that.
There's plenty of places that you can go to

00:38:19.770 --> 00:38:24.019
where people don't respond
to them in this aggressive and negative way.

00:38:24.019 --> 00:38:27.579
And it's fairly easy to train yourself not
to do that.

00:38:27.579 --> 00:38:30.700
But, you know, spend a bit of time looking
at them, seeing how

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.080
interesting they are and trying to, I suppose,
if you got an interest

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:37.719
in it, trying to retain yourself not to respond
so immediately.

00:38:37.719 --> 00:38:45.170
&gt;&gt; So just one last question, which in reading
the book, a theme of

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:51.960
taxonomies keeps coming up and seeing the
world -- see the macro

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.369
through the micro and vice versa.
And I was wondering if you could just speak

00:38:55.369 --> 00:38:59.160
a little bit more about
that and that way of seeing insects and seeing

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:00.890
our sort of the world
around us.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:04.670
Hugh Raffles: Yeah, he's asking about taxonomy
in general and

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:08.570
relationship between large things and small
things and seeing -- seeing

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:12.099
large things out of looking closely at small
things.

00:39:12.099 --> 00:39:18.749
And -- I would say in terms of taxonomy one
thing that I think I've

00:39:18.749 --> 00:39:24.859
learned from the book is that we use the taxonomies
that we use the

00:39:24.859 --> 00:39:30.080
taxonomies that work for us.
So taxonomies seem to be -- I like to think

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.440
we use the taxonomies that
work for us.

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:38.390
Taxonomies are very -- are very instrumental.
So scientific taxonomy is a very useful thing

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:41.619
if you're trying to
understand evolutionary relationships.

00:39:41.619 --> 00:39:45.001
And so it's a very useful thing if you want
to understand -- if you

00:39:45.001 --> 00:39:49.119
want to say develop conservation programs
and this kind of thing.

00:39:49.119 --> 00:39:52.289
But if that's not really your interest, if
you're interested instead,

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:56.289
say, in training crickets to fight, then it's
not really much use to

00:39:56.289 --> 00:39:59.220
you to know that there are two species -- there
are two species of

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.660
crickets.
And that's really what you need to know and

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:04.522
then you want to protect
those crickets because this is their behavior

00:40:04.522 --> 00:40:06.239
and whatever.
It's much more useful to know that there are

00:40:06.239 --> 00:40:08.530
108 different -- I don't
know.

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:12.450
108 different races and 72 personalities.
And they have these different qualities, which

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:14.430
has no relationship --
you know, this is a classification system

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:18.380
which is actually more much
complicated than a Linnaean -- Linnaean classification

00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.790
system and has
no relation to it but is much more useful

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:25.950
if you're trying to train
crickets to fight or trying to judge crickets

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:30.200
to fight.
So -- and of course in other -- in many places,

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.329
people have
classification systems which rely on size.

00:40:33.329 --> 00:40:38.440
So they might classify things in a system
which would include insects.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.950
It might also include seashells or grains
of sand or other small things

00:40:41.950 --> 00:40:44.120
or say distant airplanes or something like
that.

00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:48.150
That might be -- could be a system of tiny
things that move or tiny

00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:51.950
things that don't move or whatever.
And it partly depends on what you're trying

00:40:51.950 --> 00:40:53.369
to get out of system, what
it's useful for.

00:40:53.369 --> 00:41:00.710
That tends to be how we organize the world.
But -- but the other part of your question

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:04.890
about finding large things
and small things, yeah.

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:08.940
I think this is -- this is a very helpful
way to look -- to look at

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:13.710
this book and to think about what I've been
trying to do.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:16.349
And again, I go back to tell you about somebody,
somebody who I talked

00:41:16.349 --> 00:41:19.690
to who had interesting ways of thinking about
this, which was a -- who

00:41:19.690 --> 00:41:24.010
was a -- somebody you might know, a neuroscientist,
a Japanese

00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:27.859
neuroscientist named Yoro Takeshi.
He's well-known in Japan for -- not just for

00:41:27.859 --> 00:41:31.099
his neuroscience, but
because he's written these popular books of

00:41:31.099 --> 00:41:33.789
social criticism about
Japanese society.

00:41:33.789 --> 00:41:39.289
And he's also an insect collector.
And he collects weevils and other kinds of

00:41:39.289 --> 00:41:46.069
beetles.
And he has -- he talked about people, he talks

00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:49.930
about people having
mushy eyes, and mushy is a Japanese word for

00:41:49.930 --> 00:41:51.359
insects.
There's actually another type of classification

00:41:51.359 --> 00:41:52.779
but it would include
insects.

00:41:52.779 --> 00:42:00.630
But it would spiders and all kinds of things.
And -- he's friends with Hayao Miyazaki, you

00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:04.579
know, the anime, the
filmmaker.

00:42:04.579 --> 00:42:09.990
And both of them were, um, obsessed with insects
as children and in

00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:14.069
Miyazaki's movies, you can see very clearly
his interest in insects.

00:42:14.069 --> 00:42:17.970
And it continues, if you think of something
like Nausicaa, and other

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:22.910
movies, there's very often these very positive
representations of

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:27.210
insects in them or insect-like beings, you
know?

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:33.390
And they both have argued that -- that these,
that insect eyes are

00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:36.930
something that you can develop from this close
attention to -- close

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.599
attention to insects and spending time with
them.

00:42:39.599 --> 00:42:42.720
And the kind of attention that you get from
really looking at something

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:49.249
very, very small and recognizing that for
that small thing, there's a

00:42:49.249 --> 00:42:53.749
tremendous amount of variation in the world.
So that even the category like insects itself

00:42:53.749 --> 00:42:58.280
just does -- well, this
might not be the way to put it, but something

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.829
like, you know, I want to
say something like does violence to the individual

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:04.450
insects involved but
that might not be quite, quite -- I mean they

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:06.339
would say that it
probably does more violence to us than to

00:43:06.339 --> 00:43:08.369
insects because we don't see
the variety.

00:43:08.369 --> 00:43:13.170
And a category like insects or like nature
those are so general that we

00:43:13.170 --> 00:43:18.019
lose that sense of the individuality of the
beings.

00:43:18.019 --> 00:43:23.039
And one of the things that Yoro said to me
was that for each insect --

00:43:23.039 --> 00:43:26.359
it's not just that every tree is different
but every leaf is different.

00:43:26.359 --> 00:43:30.200
And that if you can develop that kind of attention
to the -- to the

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:36.150
difference in the individuality of things,
then in his mind that can

00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:38.910
also extend to more of an appreciation for
the individuality and

00:43:38.910 --> 00:43:42.201
differences amongst people and more sort of
tolerance and respect for

00:43:42.201 --> 00:43:46.550
people that can you also have from your relationship
with insects but

00:43:46.550 --> 00:43:52.880
you can also see how the effects of more large
scale things say

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.049
something like climate change has effect on
tiny, tiny things too.

00:43:56.049 --> 00:43:59.549
If you're studying something as small as insects,
then you can see the

00:43:59.549 --> 00:44:02.869
effects of these large things on something
like an individual leaf

00:44:02.869 --> 00:44:06.519
rather than say just a forest and that will
give you more of a sense of --

00:44:06.519 --> 00:44:10.599
of the intensity of the effects and the breadth
of the effects as well.

00:44:10.599 --> 00:44:14.931
So that's one of the ways in which you start
to see the relationship

00:44:14.931 --> 00:44:17.539
between large and small.
For other people, of course, you know tiny,

00:44:17.539 --> 00:44:21.160
tiny things are the best
place to see a microcosm of the whole universe

00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:24.640
because it's in there
you see the tremendous detail.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.869
And I suppose like the wonders of mysteries
of all things in many ways

00:44:28.869 --> 00:44:31.339
right?
Because as you get smaller and smaller it

00:44:31.339 --> 00:44:34.220
becomes actually harder and
harder in many ways to explain things.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:41.089
You might say, well, it's all DNA or so whatever.
You might find the tiniest molecular unit

00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:44.670
can you find that will be the
formative unit but fundamentally that really

00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:47.349
doesn't explain very much
about the mechanics.

00:44:47.349 --> 00:44:51.690
