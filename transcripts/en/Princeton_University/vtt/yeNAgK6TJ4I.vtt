ANITA WOERNER ORTIZ: I'm proud 
to be part of a University

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.614
with such an extraordinary history

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:27.393
and I think women play 
an incredible role in that.

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:29.976
[UPBEAT MUSIC]

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.250
ALEXANDRA LEBENTHAL: I am a passionate 
and staunch supporter of women

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.610
in every way, shape and form.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.430
JENNIFER A. DANIELS: How can we 
make a change, how can we bring

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.200
people together to unite 
for our greater good?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.380
DIANE HASLING: My first real memory 
of Princeton is when I was 9.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.920
Our family came to a football 
game with my father,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.105
Class of 1952, and on to 
Campus Club after.

00:01:16.105 --> 00:01:19.200
The sense of camaraderie 
and community was amazing

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.141
and I decided I wanted 
to go to Princeton.

00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:23.836
The catch was 
Princeton was all male.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:27.420
Fast forward June 1969.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.580
My father's reading the PAW 
and he looks up and said,

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.997
guess what, Princeton just 
announced that they're

00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:35.350
going co-ed. You can apply.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.550
LETTA FRAZIER SNEED: I think 
that one of the most startling,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.360
eye-opening moments 
for me was not really

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.857
when I was here 
as an undergraduate.

00:01:42.857 --> 00:01:45.610
It was actually in 1993,

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.447
a couple of days 
before my graduation,

00:01:47.447 --> 00:01:50.020
when I did P-rade 
for the first time,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.230
and it was the first time that 
I saw the parade of classes

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.930
go by, which were all men 
except for the spouses,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.737
until it got to the 
years of co-education,

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:04.585
and it never really dawned 
on me in such an impactful way

00:02:04.585 --> 00:02:07.890
that co-education was very recent,

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.990
basically happened around 
the time that I was born,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:14.230
and so it was such a 
stunning visualization for me

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.230
just to see it in such a happy, 
celebratory way with P-rade.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.269
CAROL OBERTUBBESING: To be a woman at 
Princeton in 1969, September of '69,

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.500
was actually much more difficult

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.490
than I had imagined it to be.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.610
It was the midst of the Vietnam War,

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.430
the Civil Rights Movement, 
the beginning of the women's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.430
and the LGBTQ movements, 
so a lot was happening on campus

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.830
and in the world at large.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.800
MARSHA ROSENTHAL: Princeton 
launched into admitting women

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.420
in the spring of 1969 and 
there were a lot of structures

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.890
that didn't exist 
for women students,

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.560
so it was both a challenge 
and an opportunity.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.313
And I remember saying to my mother, 
I'm going to be a pioneer.

00:03:00.038 --> 00:03:04.310
GLADYS J. EPTING: Princeton 
opened me up to the world.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.570
I was from a small 
Southern town where,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.413
very poor high school 
and I was poor.

00:03:11.413 --> 00:03:14.300
And the girls in my 
high school were required

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.530
to take cooking and sewing, 
and the boys took shop

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.550
where they made a gun rack.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.980
As a female especially 
I sort of had to hide

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:23.840
that I was smart or couldn't,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.520
I was frustrated that I didn't 
have things I could learn,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.910
things to study.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.300
And then I got to Princeton.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:36.998
The day I got my admission, 
which was April 19, 1971,

00:03:36.998 --> 00:03:39.363
I counted that as my birthday.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.210
VICKI TAKEUCHI WYNNE: When I first 
got to Princeton, I had a chance

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.449
to hear the famous 
anthropologist Margaret Mead.

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:50.510
She was speaking to us women 
and she said to us,

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.800
you women have absolutely 
no business being here.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.920
And she continued, because these 
men don't have a clue

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.730
what to do with you.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.300
NANCY H. LIN: Being a woman 
at Princeton during 1973-77,

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.050
there was a sense being special, 
of doing something new,

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.780
of being a pioneer, of 
having young women in Princeton

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.320
where few women had gone before.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.151
NADIA LINDA CHIU HOLE: I was your 
first female chapel watchman,

00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:25.118
your first student sex ed 
counselor - as a virgin.

00:04:25.118 --> 00:04:30.118
ALIYE CELIK: I am proud to be 
the first woman to be accepted

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.550
to the School of Architecture.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.100
MARJORY GENGLER SMITH: I was a member 
of the first women's athletic team,

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.930
the women's tennis team.

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.560
JEAN TELLJOHANN: The first term when 
I was elected as a class officer,

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.600
all four of the elected officers 
of my class were women,

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.890
and that was a Princeton first.

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.097
TINA RAVITZ: I was elected to become 
the first female president

00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:52.410
of The American 
Whig-Cliosophic Society.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.600
JILL ROBIN BARON: During my junior year 
of Princeton I had the good fortune

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.880
of being part of a group 
of students and the only female

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.937
to interview former President 
Gerald Ford in Washington.

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:07.834
And during that interview 
I asked President Ford

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:12.640
if he foresaw a woman as 
president of the United States.

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.553
And believe it or not, I cannot 
remember what he said,

00:05:15.553 --> 00:05:19.378
but I'm sure he said that 
there would be a woman president.

00:05:19.378 --> 00:05:23.380
EVE LESSER: I think that being 
one of the few women on campus

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.570
at the time that I was there 
actually served me very well

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.780
in my future business 
career and provided me

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.150
with the benefit that 
I didn't at all appreciate

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.250
or understand at the 
time I was at Princeton.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.100
Namely, as I went off 
and worked on Wall Street,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.220
which was at a time that 
there were very few women,

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:47.670
I found that I could 
sit in a board room

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:52.490
addressing an all-male board 
and feel extremely comfortable

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.160
because I had already 
had that experience

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.782
of having to make my voice 
heard in an all-male precept.

00:05:59.782 --> 00:06:02.280
SUSAN KATZMANN HORNER: To be a woman at 
Princeton in the early- to mid-1980s

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.410
meant when you looked around 
there were two young men

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:06.870
for every one of you, 
but I knew the University

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:08.230
was headed in the right direction

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.210
in terms of gender equality 
because that ratio

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:12.830
actually was better 
than what had existed

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.940
just a few years 
before I had arrived.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.220
KIM GOODWIN: One of the reasons that 
I'm so proud of our alma mater

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.860
is that over the years 
Princeton has done so much

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.104
for students who are 
just like I was.

00:06:25.104 --> 00:06:29.200
Enabling them as first-gen and 
low-income students

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.540
to become who they 
were intended to be.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.440
SHARON FAIRLEY: Although I never 
thought about it at the time,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.420
in retrospect I'm almost 
certain that my admittance

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.410
to Princteon was a 
result of affirmative action.

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.620
I didn't realize how 
unusual it would be

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.070
to be a young black woman 
in this field of study.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.800
MICHELLE BEEMAN: I remember 
Sally Frank had brought her lawsuit

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.610
while we were on campus 
and challenging the all-male

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.040
eating clubs and so there 
was definitely a tone

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.010
of challenging the past 
and challenging history

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.280
of Princeton and the fact 
that we were one of the last

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.450
or the last Ivy to go co-ed maybe,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.658
so it was kind of interesting.

00:07:03.658 --> 00:07:08.310
It was also not a time 
where you saw GLBT people,

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.730
and I came out as a lesbian 
after leaving Princeton.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.580
I did not see women on campus, 
gay women on campus,

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:14.615
lesbians on campus.

00:07:14.615 --> 00:07:17.560
It was just something 
that we predated

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.420
I think that becoming 
part of the campus life.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.970
ANDRIA MIRABAL: To me what makes 
Princeton women special is the fact

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:27.560
that women have not 
necessarily been on this campus

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:30.470
that long but have 
found the right ways

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.480
to make themselves known.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.910
And that takes a lot of bravery

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.315
and I think it takes a lot 
of support from one another,

00:07:37.315 --> 00:07:41.770
so I see Princeton women 
really going above and beyond

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.800
in the support that 
they give one another

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.957
and the things that 
they do to celebrate

00:07:46.957 --> 00:07:50.440
being Princeton women, 
but also things that they,

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.010
again, challenge the University,

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.590
that we can still make strides

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.310
and improve on these situations.

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.574
So making Princeton 
a place that is equally

00:07:58.574 --> 00:08:00.793
for the women and men 
that are here.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.940
EVA LERNER-LAM: In Chinese culture 
there is this concept

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:08.560
of opportunity and challenge.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.963
Challenge and opportunity, 
it's yin and yang.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.281
Here at Princeton there were 
so many opportunities

00:08:15.281 --> 00:08:20.281
but even the challenges 
represented opportunities.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.420
PATRICIA GRAUE: I learned at Princeton 
to take advantage of opportunity,

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.480
to go after what I wanted, 
to not be afraid to fail,

00:08:31.303 --> 00:08:36.303
and to support others, 
both in moments of extreme joy

00:08:39.665 --> 00:08:42.213
as well as moments of challenge.

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:48.260
SONJA DUMAS: Princeton made me 
braver, more courageous.

00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:50.980
I had arrived at Princeton 
with a lot of bravery,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.670
with a lot of courage 
but it made me more so,

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:59.330
the way it enticed me 
to investigate, it forced me

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.730
to write better, to argue better, 
to prove my point

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.680
or disprove a point or whatever 
it was that I needed to do.

00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.940
That's what Princeton did for me 
and that's the courage,

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.110
and that's this confidence 
that I carry

00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:13.593
as I walk through the world.

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:17.630
JESSICA MELORE: At graduation 
I was very honored to receive

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.470
the Allen Macy Dulles award 
for the student

00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:22.161
representing Princeton's motto,

00:09:22.161 --> 00:09:26.049
Princeton in the nation's service 
and the service of humanity.

00:09:26.049 --> 00:09:28.280
But I think that 
an award like this

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.280
really speaks to Princeton's 
culture of service,

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.330
not only in encouraging students

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.920
from the moment that they enroll,

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.580
but also once they graduate,

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.640
the many programs that they offer.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.170
And I feel very honored to be part

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:51.760
of that tradition of service.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.440
MARY POTEAU-TRALIE: Princeton is a 
place in constant flux, paradoxically,

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.130
it's a place that doesn't 
change, and in that I mean

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.410
that it's a place that never 
loses its aspirational nature

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:04.030
of striving to raise us all up

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:06.400
through the best of 
what humanity offers.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.830
DONNA CAIN: We are in a time and 
we are always in a time

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:11.262
when we need strong female leaders,

00:10:11.262 --> 00:10:13.720
and there is no better 
place to breed women

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.270
of substance and strength 
than Princeton University.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:21.230
TINA MADISON WHITE: As an adult Princeton 
taught me that the greatest gift

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:24.232
we can bestow on 
others is to welcome

00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:27.237
and to know them 
for who they are.

00:10:27.237 --> 00:10:30.290
My fondest hope for the 
women of Princeton is that

00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:33.830
