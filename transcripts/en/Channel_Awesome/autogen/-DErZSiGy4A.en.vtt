more specifically the mechanical arm
 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.939
more specifically the mechanical arm
because most of the other elements were

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
because most of the other elements were
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.160

of the leather straps and stuff like
 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.250
of the leather straps and stuff like
that but the mechanical arm was

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260
that but the mechanical arm was
 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.170
that but the mechanical arm was
something that I had to kind of fashion

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180
something that I had to kind of fashion
 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.729
something that I had to kind of fashion
together using parts that I had lying

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739
together using parts that I had lying
 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.600
together using parts that I had lying
around the shop so let's take a look all

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610
around the shop so let's take a look all
 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.010
around the shop so let's take a look all
right so today we're gonna be building

right so today we're gonna be building
furiosa's arm the mechanical arm I'm

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370
furiosa's arm the mechanical arm I'm
 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.709
furiosa's arm the mechanical arm I'm
just gonna have to use kind of whatever

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
just gonna have to use kind of whatever
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.200

of my bits pieces of plastic I've got

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
of my bits pieces of plastic I've got
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.349
of my bits pieces of plastic I've got
tons of foam and little bits of you know

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
tons of foam and little bits of you know
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.270

alright we're just going to dive right
 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.260
alright we're just going to dive right
into it and see what happens

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:11.270
into it and see what happens
 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.789

here I'm just cutting some piece of
 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.790
here I'm just cutting some piece of
aluminum tube and plastic tubing to

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800
aluminum tube and plastic tubing to
 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.090
aluminum tube and plastic tubing to
basically create only hydraulic so that

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100
basically create only hydraulic so that
 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.220
basically create only hydraulic so that
when you camera move your arm could see

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230
when you camera move your arm could see
 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.620
when you camera move your arm could see
the piston and stuff like that moving in

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630
the piston and stuff like that moving in
 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:53.280
the piston and stuff like that moving in
and out

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290
 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.820

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830
piece on unscrew the entry right now is
 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.670
piece on unscrew the entry right now is
actually a scrap piece of from Iron Man

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470
mask that was left over from my
 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:49.479
mask that was left over from my
star-lord mask build that I did it

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489
star-lord mask build that I did it
 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.220
star-lord mask build that I did it
really was kind of an organic process of

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230
really was kind of an organic process of
 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:55.600
really was kind of an organic process of
just adding some Springs and different

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610
just adding some Springs and different
 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.759

hinges and stuff like that and screws
 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.890
hinges and stuff like that and screws
just to kind of see what worked nothing

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900
just to kind of see what worked nothing
 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.780
just to kind of see what worked nothing
was really set in stone when I just kind

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790
was really set in stone when I just kind
 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.430
was really set in stone when I just kind
of wait around and see what kind of give

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440
of wait around and see what kind of give
 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.710
of wait around and see what kind of give
it the most movement or what looked the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720
it the most movement or what looked the
 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.440
it the most movement or what looked the
best

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450
 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.100
the inside of the clamp pieces had to be

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110
the inside of the clamp pieces had to be
 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.850
the inside of the clamp pieces had to be
ground down and sort of sanded out

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860
ground down and sort of sanded out
 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.430
ground down and sort of sanded out
because it couldn't fit my fingers in

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440
because it couldn't fit my fingers in
 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.190
because it couldn't fit my fingers in
there with the glove I figured I wanted

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200
there with the glove I figured I wanted
 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.240
there with the glove I figured I wanted
to give it enough room

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250
to give it enough room
 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.590
to give it enough room
even though tailors hands are gonna be

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600
even though tailors hands are gonna be
 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.250
even though tailors hands are gonna be
much smaller that even with the glove on

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260
much smaller that even with the glove on
 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:43.910
much smaller that even with the glove on
I wanted to fit inside that that clamp

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920
 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.410
and see all the elements are starting to

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420
and see all the elements are starting to
 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.530
and see all the elements are starting to
come together all of the rods and the

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540
come together all of the rods and the
 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.020
come together all of the rods and the
tubing and stuff like that the bogus

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030
tubing and stuff like that the bogus
 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.570
tubing and stuff like that the bogus
hydraulics are we gonna have to cut down

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580
hydraulics are we gonna have to cut down
 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.820

I knew once I fitted it to Tamara but

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830
I knew once I fitted it to Tamara but
 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:02.030
I knew once I fitted it to Tamara but
that's why I left all those pieces long

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040
 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.100
that cylinder is actually from it was

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110
that cylinder is actually from it was
 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.490
that cylinder is actually from it was
like a hairdryer brush I bought it at

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500
like a hairdryer brush I bought it at
 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.080

in a movie and everything I knew exactly
I was gonna use that piece for it just

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960
I was gonna use that piece for it just
 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.100
I was gonna use that piece for it just
cut it up and add it to the fingers

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110
 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.379
awesome okay and then yeah stuck in

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389
awesome okay and then yeah stuck in

there and then maybe another actually a
 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:45.379
there and then maybe another actually a
piece here and another piece here yes

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389
piece here and another piece here yes
 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.270
