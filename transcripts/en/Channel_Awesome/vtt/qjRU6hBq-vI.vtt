00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:06.568
Hello. I'm the nostalgia critic. I remember it. So [you] don't have to and welcome to another edition of old versus new

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.889
This is where I take something old and nostalgic and compare it to a recent remake with that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.990
So let's take a look at what are the rings?

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.539
Becoming the holy Bible of Geekdom Lord of the rings by jrr

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.279
Tolkien has revolutionized the style of fantasy and given a whole new respect to the Genre

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.529
Many of us know about the Peter Jackson movies based on the books that came out between 2001 2003

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.949
But there was another version that came out in the 70s that a lot of people don't know about this was rubbish geese, Lord

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.790
Well consider both the critical and box-office disappointment. [bash]. Be slower rings offered a very different

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.769
Take on the classic story and has since then either been loved by fans or [-] tested by them

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.990
But isn't anything compared to the big-budget

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.690
Extravaganza of the Jackson movies now, technically speaking, this is all opinion based

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.220
But I have an online show which automatically means that my opinion is better than yours

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.680
Nananana, so let's take a look at Ralph's Bash [G] and Peter Jackson's

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.060
Now see how the [ralph] [Bakshi] film ends at the exact same point that the pierre Jackson film the two towers ends

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.659
I decided to include the two towers in this comparison as was the fellowship of the ring

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.080
But that said let's take a look at our main character frodo baggins

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.799
One of the things I love about the Jackson lore the rings movies is the casting

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:05.449
Everybody in these movies looks the part and I heard Elijah wood was going to play frodo

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.849
I thought it was the best casting since Keanu reeves played that mentally retarded boy and Bill [&amp;] Ted's Excellent adventure

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.699
[I] am an adventure turned out to be quite different

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.549
He was kind innocent and extremely bold

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.819
But maybe a little too vulnerable in the basket version photo is just [as] wide-eyed and curious

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.298
But he does fight back and can also stand up for [himself] not true

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.029
They [most] save Sam from gollum but the [basking] one seems to be a little tougher and in control I would put you down on

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.459
Command you to leap off a cliff or into a fire

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.310
and you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.839
Would do its makeup [like] here's what the black riders trying to attack

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.299
Fertile actually gets out his sword and does try to fight in the Jackson one. He just drops it

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.768
If you could Kindly stab yourself with that

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.858
I'd be most thankful or how about another encounter with the black riders even though he's sick and can barely stay awake

00:02:55.859 --> 00:03:00.689
He actually manages to make his way past the river and even intimidate [though]. Sorry

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.689
Sorry

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.689
By all the shire you shall have neither the ring nor

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.759
[made] the Jackson one just sort of passes out and let someone else carry him off

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.660
by the way

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:22.630
How does that work if the sword wound works its way to his heart he becomes one of the black writers?

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.770
Would I have you would have become like them one of the ring wraiths?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.560
Wouldn't that [be] a little um?

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.299
Awkward I mean, I don't think they look as a timid ad if a little guy in a cloak is running around

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.420
Yeah, maybe they just give him a desk job. I do eight Mondays

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.719
Even though I love Elijah wood is frodo the basking one

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.569
Just seemed a little stronger as well as closer to the book

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.050
No offense would the point goes to becky what do you know about it?

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600
nothing

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.189
but what about the supporting cast [the] little people who make it possible for the

00:04:01.219 --> 00:04:05.469
Other little people there's a lot to get through so let's take a gander

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.439
Now this one's really hard because the rest of the cast is sort of hit and miss

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.119
Sam in the Jackson film for example as a tough royal friend who will stick with Mr.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.049
Frodo through thick and thin don't you leave him Samwise Gamgee can I don't mean to while Sam and the Baskerville is

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.419
Not I mean good. God. What did they do to you Sam? [I]?

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.189
[really] don't know what went wrong with this character, but they fucked up when

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.070
Mr.. Brogan Mr.. Frodo. He's Gone

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:51.769
He's sick, and he needs a rest help a dragon, and I want my bottle someone give me my bottle

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.210
shot

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.359
Which is funny because merry and pippin are at the opposite ends of the spectrum as well in the [Jackson] film

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.210
They're a little overplay making them a tad too. Goofy, but still all around my thing that works good

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.030
Let's get another one at where the bashed evil

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.329
They're actually under played seeming a little bit more like real-life people

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.430
But to be honest not leaving much of an impression you cannot trust us to let you face trouble alone

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:26.479
And go up without a word. We're your friends frodo. Well. Thank you pippin. I'm [mary]. Whatever you're all short

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.049
[gandalf] is good both versions [breeding] this strong mythical element while also mixing in the side effects of his age

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.640
this last journey must be for others to make ah

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:44.239
And who are they to be that is what they're trying to decide here my problem is in the bash B film

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:49.700
He's a little too over-the-top. I compare these two scenes where he yells in heaven fool of a

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.350
[threw] yourself in [next] time and rid us of your stupidity fool of a duck so yourself in next time fool

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.880
What?

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.740
What oh?

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.740
oh, oh

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:13.160
[but] one of the biggest differences is aragorn. Which is totally blown away by the bash B film now granted

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.380
I'm not quite sure why it looks like a native American that certainly wasn't the sign of the book

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:19.749
But the character is still a million times better

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.840
Why?

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:28.269
Well being voiced by John heard one of the greatest actors of all time certainly helps my name is aragorn Son of arathorn

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.519
[but] on top of that the idea behind ever going to safety was both a ranger and a king

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:40.540
With the Jackson version you certainly buy the ranger part, but I never really saw anything kingly in it decide the ranger

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.899
become who you were born to be by

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.950
killing things and slaughtering evildoers

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.900
Just do a very kingly the best people [ones] seem to pull off both

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.260
He could be a badass, but he could also be very smooth and diplomatic

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.400
[Lothlorien] has a place of healing

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.150
There is no evil in it and unless a man brings evil bear with him on top of that he could also be very intimidating

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:08.320
Because if I wanted the ring for myself, I could have it

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.050
now

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.520
Please don't kill me

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.070
The Jackson will never seem to have that confidence or inner strength that the other one had

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:23.559
And the only [king] we think ever did was make a motivational speech. [I] see in your [eyes] the

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.589
Same fear that would take the heart of me

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:34.149
[okay], may come when the courage of men fails, but it is not this day this day we fight

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.450
I mean who the hell could possibly get a role of leadership?

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.919
By having no political background and just making a bunch of pretty speech, okay fine

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:45.459
But you gotta give them credit they both have totally different

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.979
ways of dealing with their problems for example when a horrible threat comes across king aragorn

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.750
He fails them out with billions of dollars and hopes they know how to spend it wisely but gene

00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:04.089
For Aragorn's weaknesses though Jackson Phil makes up for it with the addition of gollum which has done much better at Jackson's version again

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:09.940
The [baby] one isn't bad. They certainly have the addiction down in the hinting towards madness. Oh, yeah

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:16.600
Yes, it lays nice, [obit], but the Jackson one really took the character to a whole new level

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:23.530
He was devious, but sympathetic when bad things happened to him [you've] [got] genuinely sorry like [to] [us] always

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.159
Plus they really play [around] the split personality bit

00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:29.579
I

00:08:29.579 --> 00:08:31.669
Love come back

00:08:36.719 --> 00:08:38.719
Come back

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:45.019
[I'll] be right back coca-cola. [yeah], we want original classic

00:08:46.379 --> 00:08:50.599
Calories, we're trying to [miss] right no relax [right], [sweetie]

00:08:51.629 --> 00:08:53.629
[just] [suck] you suck

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:57.259
There's of course a ton of other characters, but they're all kind of on the same level

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.349
They're good, but not great each having their strengths and weaknesses

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.610
tough cold

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:06.800
I'm gonna go with the Jackson one mostly because they have more time in two movies to Flesh their characters out

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.859
And that's a huge advantage. Sorry gandalf. We still love you

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:13.370
What?

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.720
Euros don't mean crap unless you have some good villains to go up against and these movies had plenty

00:09:34.959 --> 00:09:40.169
Again from a casting point of view you could have got a better pick than Christopher lee for sorrows

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:42.240
He look the part acted [the] part

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:49.349
But most of all he sounded the part [Sarang's] forces are already moving the nine have left Mina's morgul

00:09:49.899 --> 00:09:55.649
God there. Is that voice cool. It did not seriously take there's an object of contend with a will of soda

00:09:55.649 --> 00:10:01.199
[I] think it's another one of those voices you don't want reading bedtime stories to your kids

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.929
Though once upon a time there were three bears

00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.899
three innocent sweet [oh]

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.630
suspecting Bears

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.680
[I]

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:16.200
Wonder the bass you film is okay, but you don't see much [about] where is the ring gandalf?

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:19.409
Why'd you rather see the [dark] Lord have it? [oh]?

00:10:20.649 --> 00:10:22.180
No

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.180
[please] don't flash me

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:31.469
Something I never understood in the banshee film though is for some reason [they] stopped pronouncing the s and simply calm our maps

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:38.519
Why is the s suddenly a bad word only because our bond is kind it should have been his friend our man how long since?

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:40.620
[Harriman] a double-Barrel an auto man

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.550
it is

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:46.260
Pronounced Saruman Dance isn't Silent also

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:50.369
How come gandalf can never figure out [the] [Sorrow] Mom's Gonna be a bad guy?

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:54.120
I mean do these look like the homes of any decent people

00:10:54.120 --> 00:11:00.989
You know your love of the halflings leaf has clearly slowed your mind. [oh] stop hushing my buzz

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:08.429
Flick [writers] are all hard to decide between two. I mean the Jacksonville odds were cool. Especially how you never see their faces

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.240
But the baggy ones were also pretty

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:21.680
Intimidating ranging from fragile creepy folk to tough soldiers of Darkness almost as if their power feared in and out at times

00:11:21.749 --> 00:11:25.399
[so] again, they do go a bit over the top end moments

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.040
Give the Tyler though

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.620
also, the Jackson version

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.389
I thought the way they looked we put the ring on was a little goofy if I didn't ever like the way things [look] we

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:48.289
Put the ring on it's like a third grader went nuts with the smudge to our photoshop

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:57.619
In the basket fell they don't really change, but you can tell you've entered a different world everything's slower the color changes

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.620
it's almost like a different state of being but

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.990
[for] me the big deciding [point] is the lord of darkness itself Sauron and believe it or not

00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:11.689
I actually like the [basti] one better

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:18.259
Simply because you never see him the most we get is a guy in a viking hat which isn't very intimidating

00:12:18.259 --> 00:12:21.318
But everything else is kept a mystery. You never see him

00:12:21.319 --> 00:12:28.969
but you can always feel his presence simply by the way people talk about him under the power of Sauron [the] dark lord of

00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:33.620
Mordor look at the scene with the eye in the fountain you came to tell that it is an eye

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:37.730
But the fear that fills everybody is still present do not touch the water

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:41.750
He's looking for you. The door is closed

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.199
If your quest fails, then nothing can stand against him and we are defenseless

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.910
Now let's look at the Jacksonville

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:57.049
It's just too overblown the item looks more like a lizard side which indicates on is more of a monster than he is a man

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:04.580
Even his costume seems over-the-top. There's just nothing subtle about it when I think of the lord of darkness

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.679
I think of something sneaky conniving and quiet not loud bombastic and in-your-face

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:16.760
Let me saw Sauron as a plotter someone who's waiting to strike in the shadows where this guy seems like the Hulk's metal pincushion

00:13:21.090 --> 00:13:23.660
oh sword mean

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:28.940
Sauron have explosive diarrhea

00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.060
sarang go boom

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.639
So like I said before [tough] call

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:41.230
But seeing how less is usually more I have to go into Baskerville because let's face it

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.999
No one can bring the dread and feelings of doom than the guy who directed cool world, [huh]?

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.730
Point goes to Becky oh

00:13:54.819 --> 00:13:59.729
Well, that's all fine and good, but how can they beat the shit out of each other? Here's the best actions

00:14:07.990 --> 00:14:09.690
Now [both] [these] stones are unique

00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.320
and how they do their actions

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.499
Jackson's movies are a little bit more acrobatic and inventive where bosch needs is a little bit more gritty and bloody

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:22.470
it's interesting to how the Jackson films do the battle of helm's deep in all blue and the Bosch key film does the battle and

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.919
[on] red. I don't even know why it turns all red just looks really cool

00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:35.429
In another flip-flop where the [Baski] felt have little build up

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.449
But a lot of [payoff] the Jackson film has a lot of build up, but little payoff

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:45.420
What do I mean by this well in the batch conversion? There's a real feeling of suspense in tension?

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.349
I mean when someone gets dead you really felt like you're getting stabbed in

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.859
The Jackson one they tempt death just a few too many times

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:02.520
I mean they literally jump into the middle of an army of Orcs not once not twice, but [three] times

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.849
And not [once] do they ever get a scratch on them

00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:17.610
Because I shouldn't defend the bench you film too much though. I mean look when they fire the arrows the numb nuts. Don't even move

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:27.900
I'm far too proud to be searching for color. I like this place to be good drunk here

00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.650
Good, right

00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:30.990
and we won't be taking the listed advantage of

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:37.440
[magic] for [an] event now of course the return to king [is] some of the best action scenes ever but since - he never made

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:42.630
It that far. I really don't count it. But still the action in the Jackson films really are better

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:45.209
They're more flashy more creative and more energized

00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.659
I would like to seen a little bit more grisly and realistic

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:54.600
But then again it is a fancy, so I guess anything goes point goes to [Jason] then you know nothing

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:04.869
So once again it comes down to story which one had a better plot the better painting and the better delivery

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.960
Let's take story front [away]

00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:19.970
It is interesting how both vashti and Jackson [enter] films at the exact same point

00:16:19.970 --> 00:16:25.550
They when the battle of helm's deep [and] [gollum] lead Sam and frodo does she lobe even though when the ball comes deep is in

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:27.550
The middle and they already met up wish you look

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:32.490
great

00:16:32.490 --> 00:16:34.490
[she] my pilk

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:41.450
Mm-Hmm and again the Jacksonville has the advantage that has two films to explain the story and where - he only has one

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:48.290
Because of this the bash [key] film suffers characters can't be fleshed out like they should and some characters just disappear altogether

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:54.110
Our wind ever makes an appearance in a one, I don't even think ever gets a line. She just stands there my

00:16:55.230 --> 00:17:02.389
Sister [daughter] [ailing] my only loyal kin since her brother has disobeyed my commands

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:04.530
Unfortunately, she's a mute

00:17:04.530 --> 00:17:10.399
But the Jackson [felmy] time seems a bit rushed - like I never did enjoy the editing of the first film

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.440
It seemed way too fragmented not the shires been invited Roberta. He's up to something

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:22.489
Alright, then keep your secrets. [I] like talking in sentences without any pauses don't you yes I do. I like it a lot indeed, huh?

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:26.390
Antibodies credit for all the scenes he had to cut the scenes

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:30.320
It does keep in are often very quiet and usually allow for a lot [of] atmosphere

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.350
Which I think in a lot of ways is closer to the books

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:39.440
Take for example when Gimli finds out two wars in the mines of [Moria] have all been destroyed. Here's the Jackson version

00:17:40.659 --> 00:17:42.349
oh

00:17:42.349 --> 00:17:44.349
[Eli's] body oh

00:17:44.659 --> 00:17:46.659
Suze I feared [oh]

00:17:46.879 --> 00:17:48.470
oh

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:50.470
Now here's the Master version

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:51.919
yesterday

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:54.908
Balin Lord of Moria fell an

00:17:55.429 --> 00:18:02.709
Orc shot him from behind a stone. He doesn't scream. He doesn't yell he just slowly walks away to [be] by himself

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.429
It's a lot more powerful

00:18:04.429 --> 00:18:05.690
but to be fair

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:11.289
Jackson's film has a lot of powerful scenes too many of which were not [even] focused on that much in the book like our ones

00:18:11.289 --> 00:18:16.898
Debate about choosing immortal life. It's really looked into and analyzed you will linger on and

00:18:17.779 --> 00:18:19.609
darkness and in doubt

00:18:19.609 --> 00:18:25.809
There's even a few subtle scenes as well like in the [bashed] you film frodo makes a big speech about how they probably never get

00:18:25.809 --> 00:18:29.559
Back I reckon we got enough left to [seize] to this mount doom

00:18:30.349 --> 00:18:35.679
After that you I dunno oh sad friend of friends

00:18:36.109 --> 00:18:41.409
After that if the ring goes into the fire and we're at hand after that dear Sam

00:18:42.229 --> 00:18:44.229
just to get there just

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:52.329
To get there yet in the Jackson film is literally just sewed off in a walk you go ahead and eat them. I've rationed it

00:18:53.059 --> 00:18:55.059
there should [be] enough for

00:18:55.249 --> 00:18:57.249
What?

00:18:57.739 --> 00:18:59.739
the Journey home

00:19:00.859 --> 00:19:03.249
That look alone used to say everything

00:19:03.349 --> 00:19:09.639
and as the films went on they did get progressively better it better taking their time with the story and not feeling as rushed as

00:19:09.639 --> 00:19:13.809
Before so while I have to admit, it's not really a close call

00:19:13.809 --> 00:19:18.608
There are a lot of elements in the banshee film that are not only subtle, but really work well

00:19:18.619 --> 00:19:21.309
It's a lot of over-the-top moments sure and some scenes

00:19:21.309 --> 00:19:26.079
Don't really make sense, but what they do get right they get really right, so even though

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:31.779
This is probably a surprise to no one the film that really is better is the Peter Jackson version the superior?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.140
So there you go Peter Jackson Vs.. Ralph Becky I

00:19:40.659 --> 00:19:48.269
Do feel bad, I'm not able to compare return the king to anything. oh wait a minute [the] rack and bass version. That's right

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:51.959
They did return the king well. I'll just compare those two that

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:01.769
I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to
